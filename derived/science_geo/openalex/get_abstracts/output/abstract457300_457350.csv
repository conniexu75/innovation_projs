Gardner et al. (p. 852 ) synthesize data from glacialogical inventories to find that glaciers in the Arctic, Canada, Alaska, coastal Greenland, the southern Andes, and high-mountain Asia contribute approximately as much melt water as the ice sheets themselves: 260 billion tons per year between 2003 and 2009, accounting for about 30% of the observed sea-level rise during that period."
https://openalex.org/W2031191822,"Cheap Pix Three-dimensional (3D) images can be captured by, for example, holographic imaging or stereoimaging techniques. To avoid using expensive optical components that are limited to specialized bands of wavelengths, Sun et al. (p. 844 ; see the Perspective by Faccio and Leach ) projected pulses of randomly textured light onto an object. They were able to reconstruct an image of the 3D object by detecting the reflected light with several photodetectors without any need for lenses. The patterned light beams can thus in principle be substituted for light sources of any wavelength."

Noorduin et al. (p. 832 ; see the Perspective by Vlieg ) designed micrometer-scale structures by varying the reaction conditions for silica and carbonate precipitation in which precipitation changes the local concentration and acidity to alter the next stage of precipitation, thus controlling whether the solid phase grows toward or away from the bulk solution. The result is the ability to design and generate a variety of complex structures by simple reaction-diffusion processes."
https://openalex.org/W2068974951,"High-throughput genotyping methods have increased the analytical power to study complex traits but high cost has remained a barrier for large scale use in animal improvement. We have adapted genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) used in plants for genotyping 47 animals representing 7 taurine and indicine breeds of cattle from the US and Africa. Genomic DNA was digested with different enzymes, ligated to adapters containing one of 48 unique bar codes and sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq 2000. PstI was the best enzyme producing 1.4 million unique reads per animal and initially identifying a total of 63,697 SNPs. After removal of SNPs with call rates of less than 70%, 51,414 SNPs were detected throughout all autosomes with an average distance of 48.1 kb, and 1,143 SNPs on the X chromosome at an average distance of 130.3 kb, as well as 191 on unmapped contigs. If we consider only the SNPs with call rates of 90% and over, we identified 39,751 on autosomes, 850 on the X chromosome and 124 on unmapped contigs. Of these SNPs, 28,843 were not tightly linked to other SNPs. Average marker density per autosome was highly correlated with chromosome size (coefficient of correlation = −0.798, r2 = 0.637) with higher density in smaller chromosomes. Average SNP call rate was 86.5% for all loci, with 53.0% of the loci having call rates >90% and the average minor allele frequency being 0.212. Average observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.046–0.294 among individuals, and from 0.064–0.197 among breeds, with Brangus showing the highest diversity as expected. GBS technique is novel, flexible, sufficiently high-throughput, and capable of providing acceptable marker density for genomic selection or genome-wide association studies at roughly one third of the cost of currently available genotyping technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2079444524,"Stress Inside Out In Gram-negative bacteria, the integrity of the outer membrane is crucial for survival and is an important aspect of resistance to antibiotics. The biogenesis of the major components lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer-membrane protein (OMP) of the outer membrane begins in the cytoplasmic compartment, involves export across the inner membrane and transport through the periplasm, and finally requires active insertion into the outer membrane by specialized assembly machines. Lima et al. (p. 837 ) supply results for a model in which serious defects in LPS biogenesis also create problems for OMP biogenesis, thereby producing the two signals needed to activate the σ E stress response pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2165311378,"Thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin sensitizers have the potential to effectively treat a number of human diseases, however the currently available agents have dose-limiting side effects that are mediated via activation of the transcription factor PPARγ. We have recently shown PPARγ-independent actions of TZD insulin sensitizers, but the molecular target of these molecules remained to be identified. Here we use a photo-catalyzable drug analog probe and mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify a previously uncharacterized mitochondrial complex that specifically recognizes TZDs. These studies identify two well-conserved proteins previously known as brain protein 44 (BRP44) and BRP44 Like (BRP44L), which recently have been renamed Mpc2 and Mpc1 to signify their function as a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier complex. Knockdown of Mpc1 or Mpc2 in Drosophila melanogaster or pre-incubation with UK5099, an inhibitor of pyruvate transport, blocks the crosslinking of mitochondrial membranes by the TZD probe. Knockdown of these proteins in Drosophila also led to increased hemolymph glucose and blocked drug action. In isolated brown adipose tissue (BAT) cells, MSDC-0602, a PPARγ-sparing TZD, altered the incorporation of 13C-labeled carbon from glucose into acetyl CoA. These results identify Mpc1 and Mpc2 as components of the mitochondrial target of TZDs (mTOT) and suggest that understanding the modulation of this complex, which appears to regulate pyruvate entry into the mitochondria, may provide a viable target for insulin sensitizing pharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W2059889406,"Invasive species that proliferate after colonizing new habitats have a negative environmental and economic impact. The reason why some species become successful invaders, whereas others, even closely related species, remain noninvasive is often unclear. The harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis, introduced for biological pest control, has become an invader that is outcompeting indigenous ladybird species in many countries. Here, we show that Harmonia carries abundant spores of obligate parasitic microsporidia closely related to Nosema thompsoni. These microsporidia, while not harming the carrier Harmonia, are lethal pathogens for the native ladybird Coccinella septempunctata. We propose that intraguild predation, representing a major selective force among competing ladybird species, causes the infection and ultimate death of native ladybirds when they feed on microsporidia-contaminated Harmonia eggs or larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2072267291,"ATAXIN Clock Although core components of circadian clocks in flies and mammals are transcriptional circuits, recent evidence indicates posttranscriptional regulation of the clock occurs. Studies from Lim and Allada (p. 875 ) and Zhang et al. (p. 879 ) converge to show that the protein ATAXIN-2, associated with neurodegenerative diseases in humans, is a regulator of translation required for normal clock function in pacemaker neurons and for daily rhythms of behavior. ATAXIN is an RNA-binding protein and cooperates in the accumulation of the Per (Period) protein, a core transcriptional regulatory component of the clock."
https://openalex.org/W1972399183,"A negative transcriptional feedback loop generates circadian rhythms in Drosophila. PERIOD (PER) is a critical state-variable in this mechanism, and its abundance is tightly regulated. We found that the Drosophila homolog of ATAXIN-2 (ATX2)--an RNA-binding protein implicated in human neurodegenerative diseases--was required for circadian locomotor behavior. ATX2 was necessary for PER accumulation in circadian pacemaker neurons and thus determined period length of circadian behavior. ATX2 was required for the function of TWENTY-FOUR (TYF), a crucial activator of PER translation. ATX2 formed a complex with TYF and promoted its interaction with polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP). Our work uncovers a role for ATX2 in circadian timing and reveals that this protein functions as an activator of PER translation in circadian neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2029880255,"TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa) is a major deposited protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia with ubiquitin. A great number of genetic mutations identified in the flexible C-terminal region are associated with disease pathologies. We investigated the molecular determinants of TDP-43 aggregation and its underlying mechanisms. We identified a hydrophobic patch (residues 318-343) as the amyloidogenic core essential for TDP-43 aggregation. Biophysical studies demonstrated that the homologous peptide formed a helix-turn-helix structure in solution, whereas it underwent structural transformation from an α-helix to a β-sheet during aggregation. Mutation or deletion of this core region significantly reduced the aggregation and cytoplasmic inclusions of full-length TDP-43 (or TDP-35 fragment) in cells. Thus, structural transformation of the amyloidogenic core initiates the aggregation and cytoplasmic inclusion formation of TDP-43. This particular core region provides a potential therapeutic target to design small-molecule compounds for mitigating TDP-43 proteinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2012153056,"The PI3K/Akt pathway is a key component in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. The aim of this work was to investigate the participation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and its outcome on different molecular targets such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Forkhead box-O (FoxO) transcription factors during mild oxidative stress triggered by iron overload. The exposure of mouse hippocampal neurons (HT22) to different concentrations of Fe(2+) (25-200 μm) for 24 h led us to define a mild oxidative injury status (50 μm Fe(2+)) in which cell morphology showed changes typical of neuronal damage with increased lipid peroxidation and cellular oxidant levels but no alteration of cellular viability. There was a simultaneous increase in both Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation. Levels of phospho-FoxO3a (inactive form) increased in the cytosolic fraction of cells treated with iron in a PI3K-dependent manner. Moreover, PI3K and Akt translocated to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress. Iron-overloaded cells harboring a constitutively active form of Akt showed decreased oxidants levels. Indeed, GSH synthesis under oxidative stress conditions was regulated by activated Akt. Our results show that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway during iron-induced neurotoxicity regulates multiple targets such as GSK3β, FoxO transcriptional activity, and glutathione metabolism, thus modulating the neuronal response to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1969938369,"Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered to be correlated with malignancy of cancer cells and responsible for cancer invasion and metastasis. We previously reported that distant metastasis was associated with hypoxia in gastric cancer. We therefore investigated the effect of hypoxic condition on EMT of gastric cancer cells. Gastric cancer cells were cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for 24 h. EMT was evaluated as the percentage of spindle-shaped cells in total cells. Effect of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) or tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the EMT was evaluated. The expression level of TGFβ1 and TGFβR was evaluated by real time RT-PCR. The TGFβ1 production from cancer cells was measured by ELISA. Hypoxia stimulated EMT of OCUM-2MD3 and OCUM-12 cells, but not that of OCUM-2M cells. The expression level of TGFβ1 mRNA under hypoxia was significantly higher than that under normoxia in all of three cell lines. The expression level of TGFβR mRNA was significantly increased by hypoxia in OCUM-2MD3 cells, but not in OCUM-2M cells. TGFβR inhibitor, SB431542 or Ki26894, significantly suppressed EMT of OCUM-2MD3 and OCUM-12. TGFβ1 production from OCUM-2MD3 and OCUM-12 cells was significantly increased under hypoxia in comparison with that under normoxia. These findings might suggest that hypoxia stimulates the EMT of gastric cancer cells via autocrine TGFβ/TGFβR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2054074378,"Sugar beet α-glucosidase (SBG), a member of glycoside hydrolase family 31, shows exceptional long-chain specificity, exhibiting higher kcat/Km values for longer malto-oligosaccharides. However, its amino acid sequence is similar to those of other short chain-specific α-glucosidases. To gain structural insights into the long-chain substrate recognition of SBG, a crystal structure complex with the pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose was determined at 1.7 Å resolution. The active site pocket of SBG is formed by a (β/α)8 barrel domain and a long loop (N-loop) bulging from the N-terminal domain similar to other related enzymes. Two residues (Phe-236 and Asn-237) in the N-loop are important for the long-chain specificity. Kinetic analysis of an Asn-237 mutant enzyme and a previous study of a Phe-236 mutant enzyme demonstrated that these residues create subsites +2 and +3. The structure also indicates that Phe-236 and Asn-237 guide the reducing end of long substrates to subdomain b2, which is an additional element inserted into the (β/α)8 barrel domain. Subdomain b2 of SBG includes Ser-497, which was identified as the residue at subsite +4 by site-directed mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970547240,"The superfluid phases of helium-3 ((3)He) are predicted to be strongly influenced by mesoscopic confinement. However, mapping out the phase diagram in a confined geometry has been experimentally challenging. We confined a sample of (3)He within a nanofluidic cavity of precisely defined geometry, cooled it, and fingerprinted the order parameter using a sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. The measured suppression of the p-wave order parameter arising from surface scattering was consistent with the predictions of quasi-classical theory. Controlled confinement of nanofluidic samples provides a new laboratory for the study of topological superfluids and their surface- and edge-bound excitations."
https://openalex.org/W1968533229,"The ascarosides, small-molecule signals derived from combinatorial assembly of primary metabolism-derived building blocks, play a central role in Caenorhabditis elegans biology and regulate many aspects of development and behavior in this model organism as well as in other nematodes. Using HPLC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics, we identified novel ascarosides incorporating a side chain derived from succinylation of the neurotransmitter octopamine. These compounds, named osas#2, osas#9, and osas#10, are produced predominantly by L1 larvae, where they serve as part of a dispersal signal, whereas these ascarosides are largely absent from the metabolomes of other life stages. Investigating the biogenesis of these octopamine-derived ascarosides, we found that succinylation represents a previously unrecognized pathway of biogenic amine metabolism. At physiological concentrations, the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine are converted to a large extent into the corresponding succinates, in addition to the previously described acetates. Chemically, bimodal deactivation of biogenic amines via acetylation and succinylation parallels posttranslational modification of proteins via acetylation and succinylation of L-lysine. Our results reveal a small-molecule connection between neurotransmitter signaling and interorganismal regulation of behavior and suggest that ascaroside biosynthesis is based in part on co-option of degradative biochemical pathways."

GIP primarily circulates as a 42-amino acid peptide (GIP(1–42)) but is also present in a form lacking the C-terminal 12 amino acids (GIP(1–30)), which exerts very similar effects at β-cells (4Hinke S.A.

To understand the complex effects of GIP on plasma glucose and fat deposition, it would be desirable to have a specific potent antagonist with an extended half-life.

The GIPr belongs to the glucagon receptor subfamily of class 2 (class B) GPCRs, a class that also includes the receptors for GLP1, glucagon, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, and other therapeutically important peptide hormones (11Foord S.M.

In this paper, we report an antagonist antibody derived from phage display libraries, Gipg013, that shows potent competitive neutralization of GIP activity at its receptor. Gipg013 should prove to be a useful tool for understanding the biological effects of GIP at the GIPr. The crystal structure of GIP(1–42) in complex with the extracellular domain (ECD) of the GIPr demonstrated that the hormone binds in an α-helical conformation in a surface groove of the ECD largely through hydrophobic interactions (22Parthier C.

It has been proposed that the C-terminal part of GIP first interacts with the ECD, and this event then helps the binding of the N-terminal part of the peptide with the juxtamembrane region of the receptor and activation of the receptor. The binding of peptides to class B receptors shows some common structural features. Superimposition of the crystal structures of these class B GPCRs shows that the sandwich fold, consisting of an α-helix and two anti-parallel β-sheets linked by three disulfide bonds, is well conserved in the family, although sequence alignment shows less conservation (23Kumar S.

The GIPr ECD preparation used in selections and screening was validated by competition with the cell surface GIPr on HEK293 cells for binding to GIP in the cAMP assay. An IC50 of 7.0 μm was obtained. Stable cell lines expressing human, mouse, rat, and dog GIP receptor (HEK293 human GIPr, mouse GIPr, rat GIPr, and dog GIPr) were generated in HEK293 cells. In brief, HEK293 cells were transfected with the expression vector pIRESneo3 containing the full-length GIP receptor gene of each species. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.8 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. Cells were seeded every 2–4 days at a density to achieve 3–4 × 107 cells on the day of the assay. Cells were harvested using Accutase (PAA Laboratories GmbH), counted, and resuspended in a suitable volume of appropriate assay buffer to achieve correct cell density for either selection or assay procedures, as outlined below. The combined spleen library (8.5 × 1010) has been described by Lloyd et al. (24Lloyd C. Lowe D. Edwards B. Welsh F. Dilks T. Hardman C. Vaughan T. Modelling the human immune response. Performance of a 1011 human antibody repertoire against a broad panel of therapeutically relevant antigens.Protein Eng. Des.

A sublibrary of the combined spleen library, S5 (1.8 × 1010) was investigated separately and was applied as the source of V genes for the generation of a separate ribosome display library. 40-μg aliquots of the ribosome display PBL libraries were digested with NcoI and NotI to excise the scFv constructs and clone them into pCantab6 (25McCafferty J.

Biotechnol. 1994; 47 (discussion 171–153): 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ligations were transformed into Escherichia coli TG1 by electroporation, yielding libraries of 6.0 × 108 and 8.0 × 108 cfu for the phage display PBLκ and phage display PBLλ libraries, respectively. 88 clones from each library were picked and sequenced to validate the quality of the libraries, revealing at least 75% functional clones. Generation of PBL library has been described in detail previously (26Ravn P. Selection of lead antibodies from naive ribosome display antibody libraries.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 805: 213-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Here we have applied the two subsets (κ and λ) as individual libraries in the selections. Similar to the PBL library, the S5 library was generated by subcloning the variable genes from the phage display S5 and recombining into a new ribosome display library. The phage display and ribosome display selections on soluble biotinylated GIPr ECD were carried out as described previously (26Ravn P.

In brief, the phage display selections were performed with biotinylated GIPr ECD at 200, 50, 25, and 10 nm in rounds 1–4, respectively, to increase selection pressure throughout the selection rounds. The ribosome display selections were performed with biotinylated GIPr ECD at 200, 200, 50, and 10 nm in rounds 1–4, respectively. To enable cell surface selections, the outputs from the fourth round of ribosome display selection were subcloned to phage display format, yielding libraries of 1.5 × 107, 7.9 × 106, and 1.1 × 107 for PBLλ, PBLκ, and S5, respectively. The cell surface selections were performed on HEK293 cells transformed with either an empty control construct or a construct for overexpressing the human GIP receptor and were performed with all of the subcloned fourth round ribosome display libraries and the second round phage display library selection outputs. The selections were monitored by screening outputs for scFv binding to GIPr ECD in phage ELISA as described previously (30Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R. Earnshaw J.C. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Human antibodies with sub-nanomolar affinities isolated from a large non-immunized phage display library.Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The cAMP HTRF assay was based upon the ability of an antibody to inhibit the GIP/GIPr interaction (acting as an antagonist) and thus decrease cellular production of cAMP. The resultant assay signal is inversely related to the levels of cAMP generated. The cAMP dynamic 2 kit (Cisbio) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For the high throughput screen of scFv peripreps (∼10,500 clones, evenly picked across selections), HEK293 GIPr cells were resuspended in cell medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1.6% G418), containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylanthine (Sigma), and 5 μl of cells were incubated with 2.5 μl of periplasmic preparations in a 384-well plate for 30 min at room temperature. Following this, 2.5 μl of GIP(1–42) peptide at 4 pm (an EC80 concentration) (Bachem) was added to samples, which were incubated for a further 30 min in order to produce an agonist response. For profiling experiments, cells were incubated with a 2.5-μl dilution series of purified IgG or scFv (11-point, half-logarithmic dilutions) (32Edwards B.M. Barash S.C. Main S.H. Choi G.H. Minter R.

Isolation of over one thousand different antibodies to a single protein, BLyS.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression curve fitting using GraphPad Prism®, version 5.01. The assay was carried out as the cAMP HTRF assay outlined above, with the following adjustments to measure dose-response curves at different antibody concentrations. Briefly, HEK293 human GIPr cells were incubated with a dilution series of a Gipg013 IgG antagonist starting from 3.75 μm (final concentration) or with assay buffer only (2.5 μl). Following incubation for 5 min, a dilution series of agonist (GIP peptide) (2.5 μl) was added to each concentration of Gipg013 IgG, and incubated for a further 30 min. EC50 values calculated for each antibody concentration and dose ratios determined using GraphPad Prism®. Subsequently, Schild plots were analyzed to yield pA2. The Octet RED system (ForteBio) was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). The assays were performed in PBS supplemented with 10× kinetics buffer, using a volume of 200 μl for all incubations. The Super Streptavidin biosensors were loaded with biotinylated GIPr ECD at 1.2 μg/ml. All of the immobilized metal affinity chromatography-purified scFvs were assayed at ∼0.5 μm (12.5 μg/ml). The kinetic data sets were fitted using 1:1 Langmuir binding using Octet RED software to yield dissociation constants. scFv was expressed in E. coli and purified from periplasmic extracts by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described previously (33Ravn P. Danielczyk A. Jensen K.B. Kristensen P. Christensen P.A. Larsen M. Karsten U. Goletz S. Multivalent scFv display of phagemid repertoires for the selection of carbohydrate-specific antibodies and its application to the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For IgG conversion, the variable genes were cloned into the pEU vectors and expressed and purified as described previously (25McCafferty J. Fitzgerald K.J. Earnshaw J. Chiswell D.J. Link J. Smith R. Kenten J. Selection and rapid purification of murine antibody fragments that bind a transition-state analog by phage display.Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1994; 47 (discussion 171–153): 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fluorescent microvolume assay technology (FMAT) was used for the receptor ligand binding assay. Gipg013 or isotype control antibody NIP228 (0.25 μg/ml final concentration) was prepared in 384-well plates (10 μl). To these, 0.4 μg/ml (final concentration) AlexaFluor 647-labeled goat anti-human IgG H+L (Invitrogen) (10 μl) was added. Stably transfected cell lines overexpressing either human, dog, mouse, or rat receptors for glucagon, GLP-1, or GIP were harvested and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma) and added to the 384-well assay plate (5000 cells in 20 μl). Plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 3 h. Subsequently, plates were read on the FMATTM 8100 HTS System (Applied Biosystems), and FL1 readings were plotted using GraphPad Prism®, version 5.01. FMAT was used for the receptor ligand competition assay. Dilution series of the antibodies were prepared in 384-well plates (10 μl). To this, 0.5 nm AlexaFluor 647-labeled GIP (Cambridge Research Biochemicals) (20 μl) was added. HEK293 human GIPr cells were harvested and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma), and added to the plate (10 μl). Plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1–2 h. Subsequently, plates were read on the FMATTM 8100 HTS system (Applied Biosystems). For FMAT analysis, IC50 values were determined by non-linear regression curve fitting using GraphPad Prism®, version 5.01. Real-time binding kinetics were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 2000 Instrument. All reagents were purchased from BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden). Experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a constant flow rate (30 μl/min) in running buffer (HBS-N; 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride). Gipg013 IgG was immobilized on the sensor chip (CM5) at a low concentration using the amine coupling method as described by the manufacturer. Binding of GIPr ECD was observed at a range of concentrations (500, 250, 125, and 62.5 nm (concentrations used for the IgG experiment were 125, 62.5, 31.25, and 15.6 nm)). The sensor chip was regenerated with Biacore Regeneration Buffer (10 nm glycine-HCl, pH 1.5). Sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAevaluation software, version 3.0, using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Gipg013 Fab (3.9 mg/ml) and GIPr ECD (0.77 mg/ml) protein samples were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio in 0.1 m Tris buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl). Using sparse matrix screens from Hampton Research and Molecular Dimensions (Suffolk, UK) in 96-well Corning plates (Corning Inc.) at 4 and 20 °C, preliminary crystallization conditions were identified. Sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments were performed using a Phoenix crystallization robot (Art Robbins Instruments). Gip013 Fab-GIPr ECD complex solution was mixed with reservoir solutions at a 1:1, 1:2, or 2:1 ratio (200-nl final volume), and the mixtures were equilibrated against 50 μl of reservoir solution. Crystallization conditions, data collection, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen by adding 20% glycerol to the reservoir solution. Diffracting quality crystals were obtained from 0.02 m TAPS, pH 9.0, 30% (w/v) PEG 10,000.TABLE 2Data processing and refinement statisticsUnit cell parametersa, b, and c (Å)a = 48.3, b = 109.9, c = 105.9α, β, and γ (degrees)α = 90.0, β = 97.8, γ = 90.0Space group:P21Resolution range47.71–3.0 ÅNo. of molecules/asymmetric unit2No. of reflectionsObserved90,279 (13,110)Unique21,867 (3167)I/σ (I)7.8 (2.6)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)Rmerge (%)aRmerge = ΣhklΣi‖Ii(hkl) − (I(hkl))‖/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl), where Ii(hkl) is the ith observation of reflection hkl and (I(hkl)) is the weighted average intensity for all observations i of reflection hkl.

Alzheimer's disease.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a004457Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Aβ is the proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein by the sequential cleavages of β- and γ-secretases (2De Strooper B. Proteases and proteolysis in Alzheimer disease: a multifactorial view on the disease process.Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 465-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). There are two major Aβ isoforms: Aβ42 (42 residues long) and Aβ40 (40 residues long). Aβ42 differs from Aβ40 by having two additional C-terminal residues. Although Aβ40 is severalfold more abundant than Aβ42 in the brain, Aβ42 is the major component in AD plaques (3Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Visualization of Aβ42(43) and Aβ40 in senile plaques with end-specific Aβ monoclonals: Evidence that an initially deposited species is Aβ42(43).Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar), suggesting that the aggregation of Aβ42 precedes Aβ40. Aggregation of Aβ results in the formation of insoluble amyloid fibrils, soluble oligomers, and protofibrils. In recent years, AD research has shifted from a fibril-centric to an oligomer-centric view, reflecting the good correlation between soluble Aβ oligomers and AD progression (4Hardy J. Selkoe D.J.

Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). A number of oligomeric Aβ assemblies have been identified in vivo and in vitro. Oligomer formation has also been found in other amyloid-related disorders, suggesting that oligomer-induced toxicity may be a common mechanism for a range of protein misfolding diseases (6Bemporad F.

Positive staining has been found in AD brain slices using these antibodies, suggesting that these Aβ oligomers are related to endogenous Aβ assemblies. Without the atomic-level structural information of these Aβ oligomers, it is impossible to know how many unique structures are present in these oligomers. The general lack of cross-reactivity among different oligomer-specific antibodies suggests that the surface-exposed groups are distinct in different oligomer preparations. On the other hand, similar structural features have also been found, which include β-strand structures at the central hydrophobic cluster (residues 17–20) and the C-terminal hydrophobic region (residues 30–40) and a turn/loop structure at residues 20–30. Antiparallel arrangement between β-strands has also been suggested based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies of Aβ oligomers prepared using a range of protocols (16Cerf E. Sarroukh R.

Detailed structural studies of these Aβ oligomers are urgently needed for several reasons. First, Aβ oligomers are toxic species and thus represent drug targets in AD. Second, structural knowledge is critical for understanding the structural basis of Aβ toxicity and the mechanism of aggregation. Third, detailed structural studies will help to determine whether each in vitro oligomer preparation can be assigned a unique structural identity. High-resolution structural studies on peptide fragments and macrocyclic β-sheet mimics have provided insights into the potential organization of amyloid oligomers (25Liu C. Sawaya M.R. Cheng P.N.

Solution NMR studies on preglobulomers show that they contain both antiparallel and parallel structures (35Yu L. Edalji R. Harlan J.E. Holzman T.F. Lopez A.P. Labkovsky B. Hillen H. Barghorn S.

In this work, we demonstrate that Aβ42 forms globular oligomers revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which are toxic to mammalian cell lines. Circular dichroism (CD) and x-ray powder diffraction show that these oligomers consist of cross-β-structures. We then performed site-directed spin labeling EPR studies on the Aβ42 globulomers with spin labels introduced, one at a time, at 14 different residue positions throughout the Aβ42 sequence. Spin label mobility analysis shows increasing structural order from N- to C-terminal regions. Distance measurements reveal that intermolecular distances for most labeling sites are in the range of 11.5–13.5 Å in the oligomers. These measured distances indicate a tightly packed C-terminal region and a loosely packed N-terminal region. These distances also suggest that Aβ42 globulomers adopt antiparallel β-structures. The DNA construct of GroES-ubiquitin-Aβ42 (36Shahnawaz M. Thapa A. Park I.S.

Baker at Australian National University (Australia) and Dr. Il-Seon Park at Chosun University (South Korea). Single cysteine mutations at various sites were introduced into Aβ42 sequence using a QuikChange kit (Agilent). Mutations were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Expression of GroES-ubiquitin-Aβ42 and Usp2cc proteins in Escherichia coli and their purification were performed as described previously (28Agopian A. Guo Z. Structural origin of polymorphism for Alzheimer's amyloid-β fibrils.Biochem. J. 2012; 447: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Ngo S. Guo Z. Key residues for the oligomerization of Aβ42 protein in Alzheimer's disease.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 414: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Full-length Aβ42 was cleaved from the fusion protein with Usp2cc. The enzymatic digestion was performed in a buffer containing 19 mm phosphate, 3 m urea, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 10.0. Usp2cc was added to the fusion protein at a molar ratio of 1:100. The digestion reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was then immediately filtered with a 0.2-μm filter (Whatman) and loaded on a 5-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PSU buffer (50 mm phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 8 m urea, pH 10.0). Aβ42 protein was eluted using a gradient of 25 mm imidazole. Purified Aβ42 was checked with SDS-PAGE, and no uncleaved proteins were detected. For spin labeling, dithiothreitol was added to purified protein fraction to a final concentration of 10 mm and was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 20 min to break any disulfide bonds. Then the Aβ42 sample was buffer-exchanged to labeling buffer (20 mm MOPS, 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8) using a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare). The spin labeling reagent 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate (Enzo Life Sciences) was added at 10 times molar excess and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The spin-labeled Aβ42 was further buffer-exchanged to 30 mm ammonium acetate, pH 10.0, lyophilized, and stored at −80 °C. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed to ensure that the mass of Aβ42 is correct and that the extent of labeling is >95%. Aβ42 oligomers were prepared using the globulomer protocol (35Yu L. Edalji R. Harlan J.E. Holzman T.F. Lopez A.P. Labkovsky B. Hillen H. Barghorn S. Ebert U. Richardson P.L. Miesbauer L. Solomon L. Bartley D. Walter K. Johnson R.W. Hajduk P.J. Olejniczak E.T. Structural characterization of a soluble amyloid β-peptide oligomer.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1870-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) with modifications. Aβ42 peptide was suspended in 100% 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) at 1 mm and then bath-sonicated for 5 min. Then the sample was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. HFIP was removed by evaporation overnight in the fume hood and then under vacuum for 1 h. HFIP-treated Aβ42 was resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide at 5 mm and sonicated for 5 min. Then Aβ42 was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (20 mm phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to 400 μm, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, Aβ42 samples were further diluted with 3 volumes of H2O to a final concentration of 100 μm and incubated for another 18 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration using 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off filters. The Aβ42 oligomer sample (5 μl) was placed on glow-discharged copper grids covered with 400-mesh Formvar/carbon film (Ted Pella). The sample was negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Samples were examined using a JEOL JEM-1200EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV, and images were recorded using a top-mounted charge-coupled device camera (Gatan). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based CellTiter 96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) was performed for a cell viability test. HeLa and PC-12 cell lines were used in the assay. Prior to the MTT test, PC-12 cells were cultured in ATCC-formulated RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC catalog number 30-2001) with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa and PC-12 cells were plated out at 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates (Costar catalog number 3596) and cultured for 20 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To initiate the test, 10 μl of sample was added into each well containing 90 μl of medium. After 24 h of incubation, 15 μl of dye solution (Promega catalog number G4000) was added into each well, and the mixture was further incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Then 100 μl of solubilization solution/stop mix (Promega catalog number G4000) was added to each well with 12 h of incubation at room temperature for complete solubilization of the dye crystals. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm. The background absorbance was recorded at 700 nm. The readout from buffer blank treated cell is regarded as 100% viability, and that from 0.2% treated cell is treated as 0% viability. Four replicates per sample were measured for calculating standard deviation. Secondary structures of Aβ42 samples were analyzed by CD spectroscopy. Samples (∼40 μl) were placed into a 0.01-cm path length quartz cell (Starna). A JASCO J-715 CD spectrometer was employed. The measurements were carried out in a wavelength range of 190–260 nm at a rate of 20 nm/min with a step resolution of 0.5 nm, a time constant of 4 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. The CD spectra were obtained by averaging 16 scans. The temperature was set at 25 °C. All the spectra were corrected by subtracting the buffer background. Aβ42 oligomer was washed with H2O using the 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off filter and lyophilized. The powder was mounted on the tip of a broken glass rod. Then, the specimen was placed on the goniometer of an in-house x-ray machine and shot using a Rigaku FR-D x-ray generator equipped with a Rigaku HTC imaging plate detector. The size of Aβ42 globulomer was analyzed by analytical SEC using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) attached to an ÄKTA explorer system (GE Healthcare). Prior to Aβ42 oligomer sample injection (50 μl), the column was washed with 2 column volumes of filtered, degassed globulomer buffer (5 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 35 mm NaCl, 2% DMSO, and 0.05% SDS). The molecular mass of Aβ42 globulomer was estimated based on the SEC profiles of protein standards (Bio-Rad). EPR measurements were performed at X-band frequency on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with the ER 4102ST cavity. A modulation frequency of 100 kHz was used. For measurements performed at room temperature, 20 milliwatts of microwave power was employed. EPR spectra of both the retentate and the filtrate after ultrafiltration with 30-kDa filter were collected. The filtrate component, accounting for <1% of total EPR signal, was subtracted from the retentate spectra to obtain the spectra of “pure” globulomers. For measurements performed at 170 K, 631 milliwatts of microwave power was used. Modulation amplitude was optimized to each individual spectrum. For each sample, 20 μl of solution was loaded into glass capillaries (VitroCom) sealed at one end. For measurements performed in frozen solution at 170 K, 20% (v/v) glycerol was added to the sample solution followed by flash-freezing the sample in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra in each figure panel were normalized to the same number of spins. Spectral simulations were performed using the program MultiComponent (developed by Dr. Christian Altenbach, UCLA), which provides a LabVIEW interface for the program NLSL developed by Freed and co-workers (39Schneider D.J.

We report the epitaxial growth of nanostructured polycrystalline quartz films on silicon [Si(100)] substrates via the solution deposition and gelation of amorphous silica thin films, followed by thermal treatment. Key to the process is the combined use of either a strontium (Sr(2+)) or barium (Ba(2+)) catalyst with an amphiphilic molecular template. The silica nanostructure constructed by cooperative self-assembly permits homogeneous distribution of the cations, which are responsible for the crystallization of quartz. The low mismatch between the silicon and α-quartz cell parameters selects this particular polymorph, inducing epitaxial growth."
https://openalex.org/W2031376810,"Mucin type O-glycosylation is initiated by a large family of polypeptide GalNAc transferases (ppGalNAc Ts) that add α-GalNAc to the Ser and Thr residues of peptides. Of the 20 human isoforms, all but one are composed of two globular domains linked by a short flexible linker: a catalytic domain and a ricin-like lectin carbohydrate binding domain. Presently, the roles of the catalytic and lectin domains in peptide and glycopeptide recognition and specificity remain unclear. To systematically study the role of the lectin domain in ppGalNAc T glycopeptide substrate utilization, we have developed a series of novel random glycopeptide substrates containing a single GalNAc-O-Thr residue placed near either the N or C terminus of the glycopeptide substrate. Our results reveal that the presence and N- or C-terminal placement of the GalNAc-O-Thr can be important determinants of overall catalytic activity and specificity that differ between transferase isoforms.

Several transferase isoforms, ppGalNAc T5, T13, and T16, display equally enhanced N- or C-terminal activities relative to the nonglycosylated control peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2053575600,"Widespread invasion by non-native plants has resulted in substantial change in fire-fuel characteristics and fire-behaviour in many of the world's ecosystems, with a subsequent increase in the risk of fire damage to human life, property and the environment. Models used by fire management agencies to assess fire risk are dependent on accurate assessments of fuel characteristics but there is little evidence that they have been modified to reflect landscape-scale invasions. There is also a paucity of information documenting other changes in fire management activities that have occurred to mitigate changed fire regimes. This represents an important limitation in information for both fire and weed risk management.We undertook an aerial survey to estimate changes to landscape fuel loads in northern Australia resulting from invasion by Andropogon gayanus (gamba grass). Fuel load within the most densely invaded area had increased from 6 to 10 t ha(-1) in the past two decades. Assessment of the effect of calculating the Grassland Fire Danger Index (GFDI) for the 2008 and 2009 fire seasons demonstrated that an increase from 6 to 10 t ha(-1) resulted in an increase from five to 38 days with fire risk in the 'severe' category in 2008 and from 11 to 67 days in 2009. The season of severe fire weather increased by six weeks. Our assessment of the effect of increased fuel load on fire management practices showed that fire management costs in the region have increased markedly (∼9 times) in the past decade due primarily to A. gayanus invasion.This study demonstrated the high economic cost of mitigating fire impacts of an invasive grass. This study demonstrates the need to quantify direct and indirect invasion costs to assess the risk of further invasion and to appropriately fund fire and weed management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1969491707,"In spite of evidence suggesting two possible mechanisms related to drug-seeking behavior, namely reward-seeking and harm avoidance, much of the addiction literature has focused largely on positive incentivization mechanisms associated with addiction. In this study, we examined the contributing neural mechanisms of avoidance of an aversive state to drug-seeking behavior during marijuana withdrawal. To that end, marijuana users were scanned while performing the monetary incentive delay task in order to assess positive and negative incentive processes. The results showed a group x incentive interaction, such that marijuana users had greater response in areas that underlie reward processes during positive incentives while controls showed greater response in the same areas, but to negative incentives. Furthermore, a negative correlation between withdrawal symptoms and response in the amygdala during negative incentives was found in the marijuana users. These findings suggest that although marijuana users have greater reward sensitivity and less harm avoidance than controls, that attenuated amygdala response, an area that underlies fear and avoidance, was present in marijuana users with greater marijuana withdrawal symptoms. This is concordant with models of drug addiction that involve multiple sources of reinforcement in substance use disorders, and suggests the importance of strategies that focus on respective mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2110433093,"Lipid microdomains (rafts) are cholesterol-enriched dynamic ordered lipid domains belonging to cell membranes involved in diverse cellular functions, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and infection. Many studies have reported relationships between insulin signaling and lipid rafts. Likewise, links between insulin signaling and O-GlcNAcylation have also been described. However, the potential connection between O-GlcNAc and raft dynamics remains unexplored. Here we show that O-GlcNAc and the enzyme that creates this modification, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), are localized in rafts. On insulin stimulation, we observe time-dependent increases in OGT expression and localization within rafts. We show that these processes depend on activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Inhibition of OGT does not significantly affect cholesterol synthesis and raft building but decreases insulin receptor expression and PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that O-GlcNAcylation, lipid rafts, and signaling pathways are spatiotemporally coordinated to enable fundamental cellular functions.—Perez-Cervera, Y., Dehennaut, V., Aquino Gil, M., Guedri, K., Solórzano Mata, C.

https://openalex.org/W2022228035,"Interspecies transmission of influenza A is an important factor in the evolution and ecology of influenza viruses. Marine mammals are in contact with a number of influenza reservoirs, including aquatic birds and humans, and this may facilitate transmission among avian and mammalian hosts. Virus isolation, whole genome sequencing, and hemagluttination inhibition assay confirmed that exposure to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus occurred among free-ranging Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris) in 2010. Nasal swabs were collected from 42 adult female seals in April 2010, just after the animals had returned to the central California coast from their short post-breeding migration in the northeast Pacific. Swabs from two seals tested positive by RT-PCR for the matrix gene, and virus was isolated from each by inoculation into embryonic chicken eggs. Whole genome sequencing revealed greater than 99% homology with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) that emerged in humans from swine in 2009. Analysis of more than 300 serum samples showed that samples collected early in 2010 (n = 100) were negative and by April animals began to test positive for antibodies against the pH1N1 virus (HI titer of ≥1∶40), supporting the molecular findings. In vitro characterizations studies revealed that viral replication was indistinguishable from that of reference strains of pH1N1 in canine kidney cells, but replication was inefficient in human epithelial respiratory cells, indicating these isolates may be elephant seal adapted viruses. Thus findings confirmed that exposure to pandemic H1N1 that was circulating in people in 2009 occurred among free-ranging Northern Elephant Seals in 2010 off the central California coast. This is the first report of pH1N1 (A/Elephant seal/California/1/2010) in any marine mammal and provides evidence for cross species transmission of influenza viruses in free-ranging wildlife and movement of influenza viruses between humans and wildlife."

Here, we show that strong TCR activation, in terms of both duration and ligand affinity, causes the accumulation of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3b and their specific enrichment at the foxp3 locus, which leads to increased CpG methylation and inhibits foxp3 transcription. During this process the augmentation of DNMT1 is regulated through at least two post-transcriptional mechanisms; that is, strong TCR signal inactivates GSK3β to rescue DNMT1 protein from proteasomal degradation, and strong TCR signal suppresses miR-148a to derepress DNMT1 mRNA translation. Meanwhile, TGF-β signaling antagonizes DNMT1 accumulation via activation of p38 MAP kinase. Thus, independent of transcription factor activation, TCR and TGF-β signals converge on DNMT1 to modulate the expression of foxp3 epigenetically, which marks mother cell iTreg lineage choice within the genome of differentiating daughter cells.Background: TCR and TGF-β signaling regulate the differentiation of Foxp3+-inducible regulatory T cells.Results: Through posttranscriptional regulation of DNMTs, TCR and TGF-β signaling control foxp3 promoter methylation.Conclusion: During antigen-induced proliferation, TCR and TGF-β signaling program T cells epigenetically to achieve heritage maintenance.Significance: Our results illustrate a single mechanism that can comprehensively underpin the interplay between antigen and environment in guiding iTreg differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2025814099,"Introduction and Rationale Number of demographically laggard countries will forego MDGs 4 and 5, and Nepal is not an exception to it. International reports reveal that, lack of adequate birth preparedness is one of the greatest hurdles in achievement of MDG 4 and 5. However, lack of comprehensive evidence at country level in developing countries like Nepal is a hindrance for policy making. In this context, this study estimated birth preparedness among Nepali women and its association with institutional delivery and postnatal care in Nepal. Methodology/Principal Fining Secondary data such as latest round of Nepal Demographic and Health Survey Data (NDHS, 2011) has been used in the study. Bivariate and multivariate models are applied as the methods of data analyses. Results reveals that only 32 per cent of women in Nepal have birth preparedness. The women who are well prepared belong to higher age group (45%), higher education (36%) and with higher women autonomy (86%). Women, who are well prepared for child birth (OR = 3.137, p<0.01) have a greater likelihood of going for institutional deliveries that women with no preparation (OR = 1). However, irrespective of level of birth preparedness, women in Nepal preferred to deliver the baby in public health facility that private health Facility. Conclusion and Implications Findings reveal that birth preparedness is one of the critical factors in determining the likelihood of having institutional delivery and checkups after delivery. At policy perspective, this study fosters that developing countries like Nepal have to ensure adequate and universal birth preparedness in order to achieve goal 4 and 5 of MDGs."
https://openalex.org/W2072322720,"Aprataxin polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase-like factor (APLF) facilitates nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and associates with the core NHEJ components XRCC4-DNA ligase IV and Ku. The APLF forkhead-associated (FHA) domain directs interactions with XRCC4, but the APLF-Ku interaction has not been well characterized. Here we describe an evolutionarily conserved amino acid motif within APLF that is required for mediating the physical interaction between APLF and Ku. This APLF Ku-binding motif possesses a similarity to regions identified in other NHEJ factors, WRN and XLF, which also direct interactions with Ku. Indeed, peptides derived from the Ku-binding region of APLF, WRN, or XLF were sufficient to reconstitute the interaction with Ku in vitro. Although APLF is localized predominantly to the nucleus, it does not possess a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Interestingly, the disruption of the APLF-Ku interaction by substituting key residues in the APLF Ku-binding motif was associated with increased relocalization of APLF to the cytoplasm and reduced association with XRCC4, which was rescued by the introduction of an NLS onto APLF. When human cells stably depleted of APLF were reconstituted with APLF Ku-binding mutants, or with an APLF FHA mutant that is known to disrupt interactions with XRCC4, APLF-dependent NHEJ and the retention of APLF at sites of laser-generated DNA damage were impaired. These data suggest functional requirements for Ku and XRCC4 in APLF-dependent NHEJ and a unique role for Ku as a factor required to facilitate the nuclear retention of APLF."

https://openalex.org/W2004886083,"Proper RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription termination is essential to generate stable transcripts, to prevent interference at downstream loci, and to recycle Pol II back to the promoter (1-3). As such, termination is an intricately controlled process that is tightly regulated by a variety of different cis- and trans-acting factors (4, 5). Although many eukaryotic termination factors have been identified to date, the details of the precise molecular mechanisms governing termination remain to be elucidated. We devised an in vitro transcription system to study specific Pol II termination. We show for the first time that the exonucleolytic Rat1·Rai1 complex can elicit the release of stalled Pol II in vitro and can do so in the absence of other factors. We also find that Rtt103, which interacts with the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) and with Rat1, can rescue termination activity of an exonucleolytically deficient Rat1 mutant. In light of our findings, we posit a model whereby functional nucleolytic activity is not the feature of Rat1 that ultimately promotes termination. Degradation of the nascent transcript allows Rat1 to pursue Pol II in a guided fashion and arrive at the site of RNA exit from Pol II. Upon this arrival, however, it is perhaps the specific and direct contact between Rat1 and Pol II that transmits the signal to terminate transcription."

Data were collected between June/2007-February/2008.The prevalence was estimated with a confidence interval of 95%. The associations between psychotropics use and mental disorders were analyzed through a logistic regression model (Odds Ration - OR).The one-month prevalence of psychotropic drug use was 6.55%, 3.19% for men and 9.13% for women. Antidepressants were the most frequently used drug (2.78%), followed by anorectics (1.65%), tranquilizers (1.61%) and mood stabilizers (1.23%). General practitioners issued the highest number of prescriptions (46.3%), followed by psychiatrists (29.3%); 86.6% of the psychotropic drugs used were paid for by the patient himself. Individuals with increased likelihood of using psychotropic drugs were those that had received a psychiatric diagnosis during a one-month period before the study (OR:3.93), females (OR:1.82), separated/divorced (OR:2.23), of increased age (OR:1.03), with higher income (OR:2.96), and family history of mental disorder (OR:2.59); only 16% of the individuals with a current DSM IV diagnosis were using a psychotropic drug; 17% among individuals with a depression-related diagnosis and 8% with Phobic Anxiety Disorders-related diagnosis used psychotropics.Approximately 84% of individuals displaying some mental disorder did not use psychotropic drugs, which indicates an important gap between demand and access to treatment. A significant failure is evident in the health system for patients with mental disorders; this could be due to health workers' inability to recognize mental disorders among individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2067981857,"Here, we have developed a highly sensitive immunoassay for Dcx to characterize expression in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rodents. We demonstrate that Dcx is widely expressed during development in various brain regions and as well can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid of rats (up to 30 days postnatal). While Dcx protein level decline in adulthood and were detectable in neurogenic regions of the adult rodent brain, similar levels were also detectable in brain regions expected to bear no neurogenesis including the cerebral cortex and CA1/CA3 enriched hippocampus. We monitored DCX protein levels after paradigms to increase or severely decrease adult hippocampal neurogenesis, namely physical activity and cranial radiation, respectively. In both paradigms, Dcx protein- and mRNA-levels clearly reflected changes in neurogenesis in the hippocampus. However, basal Dcx-levels are unaffected in non-neurogenic regions (e.g. CA1/CA3 enriched hippocampus, cortex). These data suggest that there is a substantial ""non-neurogenic"" pool of Dcx- protein, whose regulation can be uncoupled from adult neurogenesis suggesting caution for the interpretation of such studies."

According to a common hypothesis the genetic predisposition to thyroid cancer is highly heterogeneous; being in part due to many different rare alleles. Here we used linkage analysis and targeted deep sequencing to detect a novel single-nucleotide mutation in chromosome 4q32 (4q32A>C) in a large pedigree displaying non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (NMTC). This mutation is generally ultra-rare; it was not found in 38 NMTC families, in 2676 sporadic NMTC cases or 2470 controls. The mutation is located in a long-range enhancer element whose ability to bind the transcription factors POU2F and YY1 is significantly impaired, with decreased activity in the presence of the C- allele compared with the wild type A-allele. An enhancer RNA (eRNA) is transcribed in thyroid tissue from this region and is greatly downregulated in NMTC tumors. We suggest that this is an example of an ultra-rare mutation predisposing to thyroid cancer with high penetrance."
https://openalex.org/W1969636820,"Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib, is a critical problem in the treatment of EGFR mutant lung cancer. Several mechanisms, including bypass signaling by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-triggered Met activation, are implicated as mediators of resistance. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is a downstream conduit of EGFR and MET signaling, and is thus considered a therapeutically attractive target in the treatment of various types of cancers. The purpose of this study was to examine whether 2 clinically approved mTOR inhibitors, temsirolimus and everolimus, overcome HGF-dependent resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. Both temsirolimus and everolimus inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, which are downstream targets of the mTOR pathway, and reduced the viability of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells, PC-9, and HCC827, even in the presence of HGF in vitro. In a xenograft model, temsirolimus suppressed the growth of PC-9 cells overexpressing the HGF-gene; this was associated with suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway and tumor angiogenesis. In contrast, erlotinib did not suppress this signaling pathway or tumor growth. Multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor production by tumor cells and suppression of endothelial cell viability, contribute to the anti-angiogenic effect of temsirolimus. These findings indicate that mTOR inhibitors may be useful for controlling HGF-triggered EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer, and they provide the rationale for clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors in patients stratified by EGFR mutation and HGF expression status."
https://openalex.org/W2022178832,"Background Influenza is vaccine-preventable; however, the burden of severe influenza in India remains unknown. We conducted a population-based study to estimate the incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in a rural community in western India. Methods We conducted active surveillance for hospitalized patients with acute medical illnesses or acute chronic disease exacerbations in Pune during pandemic and post pandemic periods (May 2009–April 2011). Nasal and throat swabs were tested for influenza viruses. A community health utilization survey estimated the proportion of residents hospitalized with respiratory illness at non-study facilities and was used to adjust incidence estimates from facility-based surveillance. Results Among 9,426 hospitalizations, 3,391 (36%) patients were enrolled; 665 of 3,179 (20.9%) tested positive for influenza. Of 665 influenza positives, 340 (51%) were pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 and 327 (49%) were seasonal, including A/H3 (16%), A/H1 (3%) and influenza B (30%). The proportion of patients with influenza peaked during August 2009 (39%) and 2010 (42%). The adjusted annual incidence of influenza hospitalizations was 46.8/10,000 during pandemic and 40.5/10,000 during post-pandemic period with comparable incidence of A(H1N1)pdm09 during both periods (18.8 and 20.3, respectively). The incidence of both pH1N1 and seasonal hospitalized influenza disease was highest in the 5–29 year olds. Conclusions We document the previously unrecognized burden of influenza hospitalization in a rural community following the emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in India. During peak periods of influenza activity circulation i.e during the monsoon period, 20% of all hospital admissions in the community had influenza positivity. These findings can inform development of influenza prevention and control strategies in India."
https://openalex.org/W2061485615,"Background Mitochondrial short and long-range movements are necessary to generate the energy needed for synaptic signaling and plasticity. Therefore, an effective mechanism to transport and anchor mitochondria to pre- and post-synaptic terminals is as important as functional mitochondria in neuronal firing. Mitochondrial movement range is regulated by phosphorylation of cytoskeletal and motor proteins in addition to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Movement direction is regulated by serotonin and dopamine levels. However, data on mitochondrial movement defects and their involvement in defective signaling and neuroplasticity in relationship with mood disorders is scarce. We have previously reported the effects of lithium, valproate and a new antipsychotic, paliperidone on protein expression levels at the synaptic level. Hypothesis Mitochondrial function defects have recently been implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We postulate that mood stabilizer treatment has a profound effect on mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, mitochondrial migration and direction of movement. Methods Synaptoneurosomal preparations from rat pre-frontal cortex were obtained after 28 daily intraperitoneal injections of lithium, valproate and paliperidone. Phosphorylated proteins were identified using 2D-DIGE and nano LC-ESI tandem mass spectrometry. Results Lithium, valproate and paliperidone had a substantial and common effect on the phosphorylation state of specific actin, tubulin and myosin isoforms as well as other proteins associated with neurofilaments. Furthermore, different subunits from complex III and V of the electron transfer chain were heavily phosphorylated by treatment with these drugs indicating selective phosphorylation. Conclusions Mood stabilizers have an effect on mitochondrial function, mitochondrial movement and the direction of this movement. The implications of these findings will contribute to novel insights regarding clinical treatment and the mode of action of these drugs."

This enables a flexible system for in vitro protein evolution in mammalian cells where the displayed protein phenotype remains linked to genotype, but with the advantage of soluble protein also being produced without the requirement for any further recloning to allow a wide range of assays, including biophysical and cell-based functional assays, to be used during the selection process. This system has been used for the simultaneous surface presentation and secretion of IgG during antibody discovery and maturation. Presentation and secretion of monomeric Fab can also be achieved to minimize avidity effects. Manipulation of the splice donor site sequence enables control of the relative amounts of cell surface and secreted antibody. Multi-domain proteins may be presented and secreted in different formats to enable flexibility in experimental design, and secreted proteins may be produced with epitope tags to facilitate high-throughput testing. This system is particularly useful in the context of in situ mutagenesis, as in the case of in vitro somatic hypermutation."

Using a coupled physical-biogeochemical model, this study examines the sensitivity of the ecosystem functioning in the CCS to a lead or lag in the spring transition. An early spring transition results in an increased vertical nutrient flux at the coast, with the largest ecosystem consequences, both in relative amplitude and persistence, hundreds of kilometers offshore and at the highest trophic level of the modeled food web. A budget analysis reveals that the propagation of the perturbation offshore and up the food web is driven by remineralization and grazing/predation involving both large and small plankton species."

The number, identity and mode of action of cancer driver genes, and how they contribute to tumor evolution is largely unknown. This study deployed the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) as an insertional mutagen to find both the driver genes and the networks in which they function. Using deep insertion site sequencing we identified around 31000 retroviral integration sites in 604 MMTV-induced mammary tumors from mice with mammary gland-specific deletion of Trp53, Pten heterozygous knockout mice, or wildtype strains. We identified 18 known common integration sites (CISs) and 12 previously unknown CISs marking new candidate cancer genes. Members of the Wnt, Fgf, Fgfr, Rspo and Pdgfr gene families were commonly mutated in a mutually exclusive fashion. The sequence data we generated yielded also information on the clonality of insertions in individual tumors, allowing us to develop a data-driven model of MMTV-induced tumor development. Insertional mutations near Wnt and Fgf genes mark the earliest ""initiating"" events in MMTV induced tumorigenesis, whereas Fgfr genes are targeted later during tumor progression. Our data shows that insertional mutagenesis can be used to discover the mutational networks, the timing of mutations, and the genes that initiate and drive tumor evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2036402696,"The Streptococcus pyogenes NAD(+) glycohydrolase (SPN) is secreted from the bacterial cell and translocated into the host cell cytosol where it contributes to cell death. Recent studies suggest that SPN is evolving and has diverged into NAD(+) glycohydrolase-inactive variants that correlate with tissue tropism. However, the role of SPN in both cytotoxicity and niche selection are unknown. To gain insight into the forces driving the adaptation of SPN, a detailed comparison of representative glycohydrolase activity-proficient and -deficient variants was conducted. Of a total 454 amino acids, the activity-deficient variants differed at only nine highly conserved positions. Exchanging residues between variants revealed that no one single residue could account for the inability of the deficient variants to cleave the glycosidic bond of β-NAD(+) into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose; rather, reciprocal changes at 3 specific residues were required to both abolish activity of the proficient version and restore full activity to the deficient variant. Changing any combination of 1 or 2 residues resulted in intermediate activity. However, a change to any 1 residue resulted in a significant decrease in enzyme efficiency. A similar pattern involving multiple residues was observed for comparison with a second highly conserved activity-deficient variant class. Remarkably, despite differences in glycohydrolase activity, all versions of SPN were equally cytotoxic to cultured epithelial cells. These data indicate that the glycohydrolase activity of SPN may not be the only contribution the toxin has to the pathogenesis of S. pyogenes and that both versions of SPN play an important role during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2050027856,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a conserved protein complex known to be involved in developmental processes of eukaryotic organisms. Genetic disruption of a CSN gene causes arrest during early embryonic development in mice. The Csn8 subunit is the smallest and the least conserved subunit, being absent from the CSN complex of several fungal species. Nevertheless, Csn8 is an integral component of the CSN complex in higher eukaryotes, where it is essential for life. By characterizing the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that express Csn8 at a low level, we found that Csn8 plays an important role in maintaining the proper duration of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A decreased level of Csn8, either in Csn8 hypomorphic MEFs or following siRNA-mediated knockdown in HeLa cells, accelerated cell growth rate. Csn8 hypomorphic MEFs exhibited a shortened G1 duration and affected expression of G1 regulators. In contrast to Csn8, down-regulation of Csn5 impaired cell proliferation. Csn5 proteins were found both as a component of the CSN complex and outside of CSN (Csn5-f), and the amount of Csn5-f relative to CSN was increased in the Csn8 hypomorphic cells. We conclude that CSN harbors both positive and negative regulators of the cell cycle and therefore is poised to influence the fate of a cell at the crossroad of cell division, differentiation, and senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2031351800,"Unlike the core histones, which are incorporated into nucleosomes concomitant with DNA replication, histone H3.3 is synthesized throughout the cell cycle and utilized for replication-independent (RI) chromatin assembly. The RI incorporation of H3.3 into nucleosomes is highly conserved and occurs at both euchromatin and heterochromatin. However, neither the mechanism of H3.3 recruitment nor its essential function is well understood. Several different chaperones regulate H3.3 assembly at distinct sites. The H3.3 chaperone, Daxx, and the chromatin-remodeling factor, ATRX, are required for H3.3 incorporation and heterochromatic silencing at telomeres, pericentromeres, and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. By evaluating H3.3 dynamics at a CMV promoter-regulated transcription site in a genetic background in which RI chromatin assembly is blocked, we have been able to decipher the regulatory events upstream of RI nucleosomal deposition. We find that at the activated transcription site, H3.3 accumulates with sense and antisense RNA, suggesting that it is recruited through an RNA-mediated mechanism.

Additionally, we find that H3.3 is still recruited after Daxx knockdown, supporting a chaperone-independent recruitment mechanism.

Unlike the core histones, which are incorporated into nucleosomes concomitant with DNA replication, histone H3.3 is synthesized throughout the cell cycle and utilized for replication-independent (RI) chromatin assembly. The RI incorporation of H3.3 into nucleosomes is highly conserved and occurs at both euchromatin and heterochromatin. However, neither the mechanism of H3.3 recruitment nor its essential function is well understood. Several different chaperones regulate H3.3 assembly at distinct sites. The H3.3 chaperone, Daxx, and the chromatin-remodeling factor, ATRX, are required for H3.3 incorporation and heterochromatic silencing at telomeres, pericentromeres, and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. By evaluating H3.3 dynamics at a CMV promoter-regulated transcription site in a genetic background in which RI chromatin assembly is blocked, we have been able to decipher the regulatory events upstream of RI nucleosomal deposition. We find that at the activated transcription site, H3.3 accumulates with sense and antisense RNA, suggesting that it is recruited through an RNA-mediated mechanism. Sense and antisense transcription also increases after H3.3 knockdown, suggesting that the RNA signal is amplified when chromatin assembly is blocked and attenuated by nucleosomal deposition.

Mice with loss-of-function mutation in the extrahepatic mitochondrial enzyme CoA transferase (succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase, SCOT, encoded by nuclear Oxct1) cannot terminally oxidize ketone bodies and develop lethal hyperketonemic hypoglycemia within 48 h of birth. Here we use this model to demonstrate that loss of ketone body oxidation, an exclusively extrahepatic process, disrupts hepatic intermediary metabolic homeostasis after high fat mother's milk is ingested. Livers of SCOT-knock-out (SCOT-KO) neonates induce the expression of the genes encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1a (PGC-1α), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate carboxylase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, and the neonate's pools of gluconeogenic alanine and lactate are each diminished by 50%. NMR-based quantitative fate mapping of 13C-labeled substrates revealed that livers of SCOT-KO newborn mice synthesize glucose from exogenously administered pyruvate. However, the contribution of exogenous pyruvate to the tricarboxylic acid cycle as acetyl-CoA is increased in SCOT-KO livers and is associated with diminished terminal oxidation of fatty acids. After mother's milk provokes hyperketonemia, livers of SCOT-KO mice diminish de novo hepatic β-hydroxybutyrate synthesis by 90%. Disruption of β-hydroxybutyrate production increases hepatic NAD+/NADH ratios 3-fold, oxidizing redox potential in liver but not skeletal muscle. Together, these results indicate that peripheral ketone body oxidation prevents hypoglycemia and supports hepatic metabolic homeostasis, which is critical for the maintenance of glycemia during the adaptation to birth.Background: SCOT-KO mice cannot oxidize ketone bodies and die within 48 h of birth, due to hyperketonemic hypoglycemia.Results: After suckling milk, livers of SCOT-KO mice develop diminished pyruvate pools and alterations of hepatic pyruvate, fatty acid, and ketone body metabolism.Conclusion: Extrahepatic ketone oxidation supports hepatic adaptation to the extrauterine environment.Significance: Neonatal ketone metabolism reveals the importance of dynamic interorgan metabolic interactions.

Conclusion: Extrahepatic ketone oxidation supports hepatic adaptation to the extrauterine environment. Significance: Neonatal ketone metabolism reveals the importance of dynamic interorgan metabolic interactions. At birth, a transplacental nutrient stream replete with carbohydrates is terminated and replaced with a high fat, low carbohydrate milk diet that is cyclically interrupted by periods of nutrient deprivation. Hepatic glucose production plays a critical role in providing fuel, particularly to the developing brain (1Girard J. Ferré P. Pégorier J.P. Duée P.H. Adaptations of glucose and fatty acid metabolism during perinatal period and suckling-weaning transition.Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, glucose utilization is thought to support only ∼70% of the neonatal brain's energetic needs, and additional substrates, including ketone bodies, are required to supply the balance (2Ward Platt M. Deshpande S. Metabolic adaptation at birth.Semin. Fetal Neonatal Med. 2005; 10: 341-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To meet this demand, a coordinated hepatic metabolic program integrates β-oxidation and terminal oxidation of fatty acids, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis (1Girard J. Ferré P. Pégorier J.P. Duée P.H. Adaptations of glucose and fatty acid metabolism during perinatal period and suckling-weaning transition.Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Ketone body metabolism mediates energy transfer by partially oxidizing hepatic fatty acids to water-soluble four-carbon ketone body intermediates that are transported to extrahepatic organs for terminal oxidation during physiological states characterized by limited carbohydrate supply (3Robinson A.M.

Crawford P.A. Ketone body metabolism and cardiovascular disease.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2013; 304: H1060-H1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). As such, contributions of ketone body metabolism to neonatal bioenergetic homeostasis are 2-fold: (i) because the neonatal diet has high lipid content, ketogenesis provides a spillover pathway for excess fatty acid oxidation-derived acetyl-CoA that would otherwise require terminal oxidation, storage, or secretion (4McGarry J.D.

Williamson D.H. Physiological roles of ketone bodies as substrates and signals in mammalian tissues.Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 143-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Most ketogenesis occurs within hepatic mitochondria, at rates proportional to β-oxidation of fatty acids (4McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Regulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar).

Within extrahepatic organs, mitochondrial BDH1 reoxidizes d-βOHB to AcAc. Covalent activation of AcAc by CoA is catalyzed by the mitochondrial matrix enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT (encoded by the nuclear gene Oxct1), the only mammalian CoA transferase) to generate AcAc-CoA, which upon thiolytic cleavage, liberates acetyl-CoA that enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for terminal oxidation (11Williamson D.H.

Ketone bodies are efficient energetic substrates that are oxidized in proportion to their delivery (1Girard J. Ferré P. Pégorier J.P. Duée P.H.

The neonatal brain extracts ketones at rates up to 40-fold greater than the adult brain, and ketone body oxidation can support as much as 25% of the neonate's total basal energy requirements (2Ward Platt M. Deshpande S. Metabolic adaptation at birth.Semin. Fetal Neonatal Med. 2005; 10: 341-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Bougneres P.F. Lemmel C. Ferré P. Bier D.M. Ketone body transport in the human neonate and infant.J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because neurons oxidize fatty acids poorly (2Ward Platt M.

Physiol. 2003; 136: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Prior analysis of germline CoA transferase knock-out (SCOT-KO) mice revealed that CoA transferase is required for terminal ketone body oxidation. SCOT-KO mice are born normal, but exhibit increased cerebral glucose oxidation. These mice ultimately develop hyperketonemic hypoglycemia and die within 48 h of birth unless their lifespan is prolonged by frequent glucose administration (16Cotter D.G. d'Avignon D.A. Wentz A.E.

Chem. 2011; 286: 6902-6910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unlike mice with a global CoA transferase defect, recent studies using cell type-specific SCOT-KO mice reveal that the selective absence of ketone body oxidation individually within neurons, cardiomyocytes, or skeletal myocytes (the three greatest consumers of ketone bodies (3Robinson A.M. Williamson D.H. Physiological roles of ketone bodies as substrates and signals in mammalian tissues.Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 143-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 17Fukao T. Song X.Q. Mitchell G.A. Yamaguchi S. Sukegawa K. Orii T. Kondo N. Enzymes of ketone body utilization in human tissues: protein and messenger RNA levels of succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA):3-ketoacid CoA transferase and mitochondrial and cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases.Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)) does not cause hyperketonemia or hypoglycemia and does not impair survival during the neonatal period or starvation in adulthood. As observed in brains of germline SCOT-KO neonates, selective absence of neuronal CoA transferase activity was associated with increased glycolysis and glucose oxidation in the neonatal brain (18Cotter D.G. Schugar R.C. Wentz A.E. d'Avignon D.A. Crawford P.A. Successful adaptation to ketosis by mice with tissue-specific deficiency of ketone body oxidation.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 304: E363-E374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, the phenotypes of germline and tissue-specific SCOT-KO mice reveal that ketolytic cells do not require the energy stored in ketone bodies, but ketone body oxidation is necessary for maintenance of glycemia and therefore survival in the neonatal period. During states in which dietary carbohydrates are in short supply, the balance of hepatic glucose output with extrahepatic glucose consumption coordinates glucose homeostasis. Increased extrahepatic glucose consumption in neonatal germline SCOT-KO mice may therefore contribute to the development of hypoglycemia. To determine whether the absence of extrahepatic ketone body oxidation influences hepatic glucose production and intermediary metabolic homeostasis, we used biochemical approaches to quantify dynamic metabolism in livers of germline neonatal SCOT-KO mice. Oxct1−/− (germline SCOT-KO) mice were generated on the C57BL/6 genetic background (16Cotter D.G. d'Avignon D.A. Wentz A.E. Weber M.L. Crawford P.A. Obligate role for ketone body oxidation in neonatal metabolic homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 6902-6910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To obtain unfed neonatal mice, pups were collected within 1 h of birth. Pups without gastric milk spots were confirmed by open examination of the stomach and intestine at the time of sacrifice. Fed postnatal day zero (P0, the first day of postnatal life) mice were collected within 4 h of birth. All postnatal day 1 (P1) mice were maintained with the dam through the first 30 h after birth and were milk-fed. All mice were maintained at 22 °C on standard polysaccharide-rich chow diet (Lab Diet 5053) and autoclaved water ad libitum. Lights were off between 1800 and 0600. All experiments consisted of mouse pups that were harvested from at least three litters from three different breeder pairings. All experiments were conducted using protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University. Measurements of plasma AcAc and d-βOHB were performed using standard biochemical assays coupled to colorimetric substrates (Wako), as described previously (19Wentz A.E. d'Avignon D.A. Weber M.L.

Chem. 2010; 285: 24447-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). AcAc concentrations were determined by measuring total ketone body concentrations and subtracting the corresponding measured d-βOHB concentration. Plasma lactate and pyruvate were measured using colorimetric and fluorescent biochemical assays, respectively (Biovision). Blood glucose was measured in duplicate using glucometers (Aviva). Quantification of gene expression was performed using real-time RT-quantitative PCR using the ΔΔCt approach as described, normalizing to Rpl32, using primer sequences listed within supplemental Table S1 (19Wentz A.E. d'Avignon D.A.

Immunoblotting, using protein lysates from neonatal brain, heart, liver, and quadriceps/hamstring muscles to detect SCOT (rabbit anti-SCOT; Proteintech Group), actin (rabbit anti-actin; Sigma), HMGCS2 (rabbit anti-mHMGCS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PDH-E1α (rabbit anti-pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-α subunit antibody; Abcam ab155096), phosphoserine 293 PDH-E1α (PhosphoDetectTM anti-PDH-E1α (Ser(P)-293 rabbit antibody; Millipore AP1062), and BDH1 (rabbit anti-BDH1; Proteintech Group) was performed as described previously (34Orii K.E. Fukao T. Song X.Q. Mitchell G.A. Kondo N. Liver-specific silencing of the human gene encoding succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase.Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2008; 215: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Band intensities were quantified densitometrically using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Neonatal mice were sacrificed by decapitation. Livers were collected and weighed, and each liver was placed in a single well of a 6-well tissue culture plate containing 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice. Livers were minced and transferred to a 2-ml Eppendorf tube. Tissues were allowed to settle on ice and were centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min. Minced-liver pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.78 mm glucose (which reflects glycemia in neonatal mice), 0.63 mm sodium pyruvate, and 150 μm oleic acid (conjugated to bovine serum albumin in a 2:1 molar ratio)). Each liver preparation was plated in a single well of a 12-well plate containing 1 ml of medium, and incubated at 37 °C. At time points indicated in the figure legends, 50 μl of medium was removed to quantify ketone body concentrations. Hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations were determined using a Folch extract of liver and biochemical quantification using a biochemical assay (Wako), as described previously (20Crawford P.A. Crowley J.R. Sambandam N. Muegge B.D. Costello E.K. Hamady M. Knight R. Gordon J.I. Regulation of myocardial ketone body metabolism by the gut microbiota during nutrient deprivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11276-11281Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Hepatic glycogen and NAD+(H) concentrations were measured in liver lysates using fluorescent biochemical assays (Biovision). P0 or P1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 μmol of sodium [1,2,3,4-13C4]octanoate, 10 μmol of sodium [3-13C]pyruvate, or co-injected with 10 μmol of sodium [1,2,3,4-13C4]octanoate, plus 20 μmol of naturally occurring sodium pyruvate, sodium d-βOHB, sodium l-βOHB, or AcAc per g of body weight (vendor for stable isotopes: Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Base hydrolysis of ethyl-AcAc (Sigma W241512) was performed by addition of 50% NaOH to pH 12 and incubation at 60 °C for 30 min. The pH of base-hydrolyzed AcAc was adjusted to pH 8.5, and [AcAc] was confirmed using standard biochemical assays coupled to colorimetric substrates (Wako), as described previously (19Wentz A.E. d'Avignon D.A.

After intraperitoneal injections, neonatal mice were maintained on a heating pad for the indicated durations (see text and figure legends), killed by decapitation, and tissues were rapidly freeze-clamped in liquid N2. Neutralized perchloric acid tissue extracts were profiled using 13C-edited proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measured at 11.75 Tesla (Varian/Agilent Direct Drive-1) via first increment gradient heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (gHSQC). The majority of studies were carried out using a traditional probe, but extracts generated from mice injected with sodium [3-13C]pyruvate were analyzed using a high sensitivity cold probe at 11.75 Tesla (Varian/Agilent Direct Drive-1). Signals were collected from extracts dissolved in 275 μl of D2O + 1 mm trimethylsilyl propionate, loaded into high precision, thin walled 5-mm tubes (Shigemi). Quantification of signals by integration from the 1H{13C} and 13C-edited (gHSQC) collections of carbon 2 for taurine, carbon 4 for βOHB, carbon 1 for glucose, carbon 4 for glutamate, and 1H{13C} of carbon 3 for lactate were all performed as described previously (16Cotter D.G. d'Avignon D.A.

Tissue concentrations (pool size) of glucose, taurine, glutamate, and βOHB were calculated by normalizing the integrals for each metabolite obtained from the 1H{13C} collections to trimethylsilyl propionate and tissue weight. Because tissue taurine concentrations were constant across conditions (supplemental Tables S2 and S3) and taurine is not enriched by administration of these experimental substrates (19Wentz A.E. d'Avignon D.A.

The moles of 13C-labeled metabolites produced from the labeled substrate in each sample were calculated by subtracting the moles of 13C-labeled metabolites attributable to the metabolite pool size (i.e. in the absence of any enrichment from exogenous 13C-labeled substrates, 1.1% of the metabolites within the entire pool are expected to be 13C-labeled, based upon the natural abundance of 13C) from the total amount of 13C-labeled metabolites detected in the gHSQC collections. Fractional enrichments of 13C-labeled glutamate and βOHB were then calculated as described (19Wentz A.E. d'Avignon D.A. Weber M.L. Cotter D.G. Doherty J.M. Kerns R. Nagarajan R. Reddy N. Sambandam N.

Amino acids were quantified as butyl ester derivatives using multiple precursor/product combinations in a reversed-phase liquid chromatography protocol coupled to MS/MS (22Dietzen D.J. Weindel A.L.

Quantification was achieved in all cases using stable isotope 2H-labeled internal standards using an electrospray ionization source coupled to an API 3200-Qtrap tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems).

Therefore, we hypothesized that neonatal germline SCOT-KO mice, which cannot terminally oxidize ketone bodies, engage compensatory mechanisms in the liver to meet increased peripheral glucose demand. Increased abundances of the mRNAs encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1a (PGC-1α, encoded by Ppargc1a), pyruvate carboxylase (encoded by Pcx), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, encoded by Pck1), and glucose-6-phosphatase (encoded by G6pc) were observed in livers of postnatal day 1 (P1, the day immediately following delivery) SCOT-KO mice (Fig. 1A), and as expected, hepatic glycogen content was depleted in livers of P1 SCOT-KO mice (Fig. 1B). Consistent with increased gluconeogenic demand, MS/MS analysis of circulating amino acids demonstrated that alanine, which becomes the gluconeogenic substrate pyruvate following transamination (24Owen O.E. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. The key role of anaplerosis and cataplerosis for citric acid cycle function.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30409-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), was diminished 51% in blood of P1 SCOT-KO mice (Fig. 1C). Serine, which is deaminated to pyruvate by serine dehydratase, also trended lower in these mice. In addition, blood concentrations of the anaplerotic amino acid glutamate, which can replenish TCA cycle intermediates following conversion to α-ketoglutarate, were diminished 40% in SCOT-KO neonates. This contrasted with many glucogenic/ketogenic, glucogenic, ketogenic, and urea cycle amino acids, whose circulating concentrations were increased in P1 SCOT-KO mice (Fig. 1D; see supplemental Tables S4 and S5 for complete P0 and P1 blood amino acid profiles, respectively, of wild-type and SCOT-KO mice), suggesting enhanced skeletal muscle proteolysis in P1 SCOT-KO mice. In addition, the total circulating pyruvate pool (the sum of pyruvate plus lactate, which form a redox couple with NAD+/NADH), a critical source of gluconeogenic precursors via the Cori cycle, was diminished 53% in P1 SCOT-KO mice (Fig. 1E). In SCOT-KO neonates, increased extrahepatic glucose and lactate consumption (16Cotter D.G. d'Avignon D.A. Wentz A.E. Weber M.L. Crawford P.A.

The aim of this study was to validate a Chinese version of the FESFS in a sample of young Chinese adults.The FESFS was translated to Chinese prior to being administered to 1576 college students. The factor structure, reliability, and validity of the scale were examined.Two items were deleted after item analysis and the internal consistency of the whole scale was .89. A six-factor structure was derived by exploratory factor analysis. The factors were interpersonal, family and friends, school, living skills, intimacy, and balance. Estimates of the structural equation model supported this structure, with Goodness of Fit Chi-Square χ(2) = 1097.53 (p<0.0001), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.058, and the comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.93. Scale validity was supported by significant correlations between social functioning factors scores and schizophrenia personality questionnaire (SPQ) scores. Individuals with schizotypal personality features presented poorer social functioning than those without schizotypal personality features.The Chinese revised version of the FESFS was found to have good psychometric properties and could be used in the future to examine social functioning in Chinese college students."
https://openalex.org/W2023459168,"Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) is a major regulator of DNA damage response and can induce alternative cellular responses: cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or programmed cell death. Here, we report the identification of a new role of Chk2 in transcriptional regulation that also contributes to modulating the balance between survival and apoptosis following DNA damage. We found that Chk2 interacts with members of the NCoR/SMRT transcriptional co-regulator complexes and serves as a functional component of the repressor complex, being required for recruitment of SMRT on the promoter of pro-apoptotic genes upon DNA damage. Thus, the co-repressor SMRT exerts a critical protective action against genotoxic stress-induced caspase activation, repressing a functionally important cohort of pro-apoptotic genes. Amongst them, SMRT is responsible for basal repression of Wip1, a phosphatase that de-phosphorylates and inactivates Chk2, thus affecting a feedback loop responsible for licensing the correct timing of Chk2 activation and the proper execution of the DNA repair process."
https://openalex.org/W1979424123,"Objective Chronic periaortitis (CP) is a rare disease that is characterised by fibro-inflammatory tissue surrounding the abdominal aorta and has both non-aneurysmal (idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis [IRF]) and aneurysmal forms (inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm [IAAA]). We investigated whether toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to, and the clinical features of CP. Methods One hundred and two CP patients and 200 healthy controls were molecularly genotyped for TLR-4 gene polymorphism (+896 A/G) (rs4986790), VEGF mutations +936 C/T (rs3025039) and −634 C/G (rs2010963), and an 18 base pair (bp) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism at −2549 of the VEGF promoter region. The patients were grouped on the basis of the type of CP (IRF or IAAA), and the presence or absence of established atherosclerotic disease (ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease). Results There were no significant differences in the distribution of the studied polymorphisms between the patients and controls. However, carriage of the +936 T allele was significantly more frequent in the patients with IRF than in those with IAAA (26.5% vs 5.3%; p = 0.046; OR 6.49 [95% CI 0.82–51.54]). There were significantly more carriers of the I allele among the patients with ureteral obstruction (83.8% vs 58.8%; p = 0.006; OR 3.63 [95% CI 1.42–9.28]) and those who received conservative treatment (48.5% vs 23.5%; p = 0.015; OR 3.06 [95% CI 1.22–7.721]) than among those without, and II homozygosity was significantly more frequent in the patients with deep vein thrombosis than in those without (30.4% vs 11.7%, p = 0.031; OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.07–10.21]). Conclusion The VEGF +936 C/T polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of developing the non-aneurysmal IRF form of CP. Carriers of the I allele and II homozygosity are respectively at increased risk of developing ureteral obstruction and deep vein thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2024959012,"Rationale Methylarginines are endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitors that have been implicated in animal models of lung disease but have not previously been examined for their association with spirometric measures of lung function in humans. Objectives This study measured serum concentrations of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine in a representative sample of older community-dwelling adults and determined their association with spirometric lung function measures. Methods Data on clinical, lifestyle, and demographic characteristics, methylated arginines, and L-arginine (measured using LC-MS/MS) were collected from a population-based sample of older Australian adults from the Hunter Community Study. The five key lung function measures included as outcomes were Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second, Forced Vital Capacity, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second to Forced Vital Capacity ratio, Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second, and Percent Predicted Forced Vital Capacity. Measurements and Main Results In adjusted analyses there were statistically significant independent associations between a) higher asymmetric dimethylarginine, lower Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second and lower Forced Vital Capacity; and b) lower L-arginine/asymmetric dimethylarginine ratio, lower Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second, lower Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second and lower Percent Predicted Forced Vital Capacity. By contrast, no significant associations were observed between symmetric dimethylarginine and lung function. Conclusions After adjusting for clinical, demographic, biochemical, and pharmacological confounders, higher serum asymmetric dimethylarginine was independently associated with a reduction in key measures of lung function. Further research is needed to determine if methylarginines predict the decline in lung function."
https://openalex.org/W2051591535,"Proper preservation of transgenes and transgenic materials is important for wider use of transgenic technology in plants. Here, we report stable preservation and faithful expression of a transgene via artificial seed technology in alfalfa. DNA constructs containing the uid reporter gene coding for β-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by a 35S promoter or a tCUP promoter were introduced into alfalfa via Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Somatic embryos were subsequently induced from transgenic alfalfa plants via in vitro technology. These embryos were treated with abscisic acid to induce desiccation tolerance and were subjected to a water loss process. After the desiccation procedure, the water content in dried embryos, or called artificial seeds, was about 12-15% which was equivalent to that in true seeds. Upon water rehydration, the dried somatic embryos showed high degrees of viability and exhibited normal germination. Full plants were subsequently developed and recovered in a greenhouse. The progeny plants developed from artificial seeds showed GUS enzyme activity and the GUS expression level was comparable to that of plants developed from somatic embryos without the desiccation process. Polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the transgene was well retained in the plants and Southern blot analysis showed that the transgene was stably integrated in plant genome. The research showed that the transgene and the new trait can be well preserved in artificial seeds and the progeny developed. The research provides a new method for transgenic germplasm preservation in different plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2068609902,"In this study, we focus on the impact of senior executives' industry backgrounds on the amount of capital raised in the stock market. The primary contribution of the study entails applying the upper echelon theory to the initial public offering (IPO) phenomenon. Specifically, we hypothesize that the industry backgrounds of corporate executives affect the amount of capital that the firm raised in the primary stock market. We argue that the firm's future investment strategies are unobserved by the investors ex-ante and investors expect firms' investment strategies to be based on the executives' industry backgrounds. As a result, the executives' industry backgrounds influence the investors' expectations about what investment strategies the firm is likely to deploy. Furthermore, the above logic also suggests that executives of different industry backgrounds should prefer different investment strategies corresponding with demand for different amount of capital. As a result, we expect the industry backgrounds to covary with the capital raised from both the supply and demand perspectives. To test the hypotheses, we ran a reduced econometric model wherein the executives' background predicts the amount of capital raised. Regression analyses suggest that the capital raised is negatively associated with the number of senior executives with prior career experience in the healthcare and genomic sectors but positively associated with the number of senior executives with prior career experience in regulatory affairs. The results provide tentative support for the notion that investors infer corporate strategies from senior executives' industry backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2033578228,"In this study, we examine how initial public offerings (IPO) entry rates are affected when stock markets are boundedly rational and IPO firms infer information from their counterparts in the market. We hypothesize a curvilinear relationship between the number of comparable stocks and initial public offerings (IPO) entry rates into the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. Furthermore, we argue that trading volume and changes in stock returns partially mediates the relationship between the number of comparable stocks and IPO entry rates. The statistical evidence provides strong support for the hypotheses."
