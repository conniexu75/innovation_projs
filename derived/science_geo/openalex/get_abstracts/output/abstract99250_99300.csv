https://openalex.org/W1988317772,"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a cell-mediated autoimmune disease that serves as an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Oral administration of myelin basic protein (MBP) suppresses EAE by inducing peripheral tolerance. T cell clones were isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of SJL mice that had been orally tolerized to MBP. These clones were CD4+ and were structurally identical to T helper cell type 1 (TH1) encephalitogenic CD4+ clones in T cell receptor usage, major histocompatibility complex restriction, and epitope recognition. However, they produced transforming growth factor-beta with various amounts of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 and suppressed EAE induced with either MBP or proteolipid protein. Thus, mucosally derived TH2-like clones induced by oral antigen can actively regulate immune responses in vivo and may represent a different subset of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056924500,"Two molecular mechanisms of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, one perforin-based, the other Fas-based, have been demonstrated. To determine the extent of their contribution to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, a range of effector cells from normal control or perforin-deficient mice were tested against a panel of target cells with various levels of Fas expression. All cytotoxicity observed was due to either of these mechanisms, and no third mechanism was detected. Thus, the perforin- and Fas-based mechanisms may account for all T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in short-term in vitro assays."

https://openalex.org/W1574380753,"Scavenger receptors are integral membrane proteins that mediate the endocytosis of modified lipoproteins. The first of these to be purified and cloned were the type I and II macrophage scavenger receptors (SR-AI and SR-AII; class A scavenger receptors). Subsequently, the cell surface protein CD36 was shown to bind oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxidized LDL). From a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell variant we have cloned by expression the cDNA for a new member of the CD36 family of membrane proteins, SR-BI, whose predicted protein sequence of 509 amino acids is approximately 30% identical to those of the four previously identified family members. Both SR-BI and CD36 displayed high affinity binding for acetylated LDL with an apparent dissociation constant on the order of approximately 5 micrograms of protein/ml. The ligand binding specificities of CD36 and SR-BI, determined by direct binding or competition assays, were similar, but not identical; both bind modified proteins (acetylated LDL, oxidized LDL, maleylated bovine serum albumin), but not the broad array of other polyanions (e.g. fucoidin, polyguanosinic acid, carrageenan) which are ligands of the class A receptors. Thus, SR-BI and CD36 define a second class of scavenger receptors, designated class B. Native LDL, which does not bind to either class A receptors or CD36, unexpectedly bound with high affinity to SR-BI. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues showed that SR-BI was most abundantly expressed in fat and was present at moderate levels in lung and liver. Furthermore, SR-BI mRNA expression was induced upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. Thus, the tissue distribution of expression and ligand binding properties of SR-BI raise the possibility that this cell surface receptor may play an important role in lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2008304542,"The interaction of B7-related molecules on antigen-presenting cells with CD28 or CTLA-4 antigens on T cells provides a second signal for T cell activation. Selection inhibition of the B7-CD28 or B7-CTLA-4 interactions produces antigen-specific T cell unresponsiveness in vitro and suppresses immune function in vivo. To determine whether selective inhibition of the B7-CD28 or B7-CTLA-4 interactions could suppress spontaneous autoimmune disease, a B7-binding protein was generated by genetic fusion of the extracellular domain of murine CTLA-4 to the Fc portion of a mouse immunoglobulin G2a monoclonal antibody (muCTLA4Ig). In lupus-prone NZB/NZW filial generation (F1) mice, treatment with muCTLA4Ig blocked autoantibody production and prolonged life, even when treatment was delayed until the most advanced stage of clinical illness. These findings suggest a possible role for human CTLA4Ig in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1986271944,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent increase in synaptic strength implicated in certain forms of learning and memory. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, LTP is thought to involve the release of one or more retrograde messengers from the postsynaptic cell that act on the presynaptic terminal to enhance transmitter release. One candidate retrograde messenger is the membrane-permeant gas nitric oxide (NO), which in the brain is released after activation of the neuronal-specific NO synthase isoform (nNOS). To assess the importance of NO in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, LTP was examined in mice where the gene encoding nNOS was disrupted by gene targeting. In nNOS- mice, LTP induced by weak intensity tetanic stimulation was normal except for a slight reduction in comparison to that in wild-type mice and was blocked by NOS inhibitors, just as it was in wild-type mice. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that in the nNOS- mice as in wild-type mice, the endothelial form of NOS (eNOS) is expressed in CA1 neurons. These findings suggest that eNOS, rather than nNOS, generates NO within the postsynaptic cell during LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1992767896,"The role of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75LNTR, in NGF-mediated signal transduction has been examined. Our results show that treatment of PC12 cells with MC192, a monoclonal antibody directed against p75LNTR, results in reduced NGF binding to TrkA and attenuated TrkA activation. Use of mutant NGF that binds TrkA but not p75LNTR shows that the MC192 effect requires that NGF bind the p75LNTR receptor. To explore the possibility that MC192 disrupts some normal functional role of p75LNTR, BDNF was used to block binding of NGF to p75LNTR on PC12 cells. By preventing NGF binding to p75LNTR, NGF binding to TrkA and NGF-mediated signal transduction were reduced. We propose that p75LNTR normally acts to increase binding of NGF to TrkA, possibly by increasing the local NGF concentration in the microenvironment surrounding the cell surface TrkA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2110690646,"Using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, we have generated mice with a null mutation in the gene encoding the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a recognition molecule implicated in myelin formation. MAG-deficient mice appeared normal in motor coordination and spatial learning tasks. Normal myelin structure and nerve conduction in the PNS, with N-CAM overexpression at sites normally expressing MAG, suggested compensatory mechanisms. In the CNS, the onset of myelination was delayed, and subtle morphological abnormalities were detected in that the content of oligodendrocyte cytoplasm at the inner aspect of most myelin sheaths was reduced and that some axons were surrounded by two or more myelin sheaths. These observations suggest that MAG participates in the formation of the periaxonal cytoplasmic collar of oligodendrocytes and in the recognition between oligodendrocyte processes and axons."
https://openalex.org/W2036564332,"Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS), visualized immunohistochemically or with NADPH diaphorase histochemistry, is transiently expressed in discrete areas of the developing rat nervous system. In the brain transient NOS expression occurs in the cerebral cortical plate. At E15-E19, the majority of cells in the plate stain, with their processes extending through the corpus striatum to the thalamus. This staining decreases after birth and vanishes by the 15th postnatal day. Neurons in olfactory epithelium also express NOS from E15 till early postnatal life. In embryonic sensory ganglia virtually all neuronal cells are NOS positive, whereas by early adulthood only 1% express NOS. By contrast to these areas of transient NOS expression, in other neuronal sites NOS staining appears after cell bodies cease dividing and cells extend processes, and the staining persists in adult life. The transient expression of neuronal NOS may reflect a role in developmental processes such as programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1533844265,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) belongs to a superfamily of proteins implicated in the transport of ions, proteins, and hydrophobic substances. Recent studies have demonstrated that CFTR is a protein kinase A-sensitive anion channel regulated by ATP. In the present study, patch-clamp techniques were used to assess the role of CFTR in the transport of Cl- and ATP. The stable transfection of mouse mammary carcinoma cells, C127i, with the cDNA for human CFTR resulted in the appearance of a diphenylamine-2-carboxylate-inhibitable Cl- channel, which was activated by cAMP under whole-cell and cell-attached conditions and by protein kinase A plus ATP under excised, inside-out conditions. CFTR expression was also associated with the electrodiffusional movement of ATP as indicated by the cAMP activation of ATP currents measured under whole-cell conditions. In excised, inside-out patches, it was demonstrated that ATP currents were mediated by ATP-conductive channels, which were also activated by protein kinase A and blocked by the Cl- channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylate under excised, inside-out conditions. Single-channel currents observed in the presence of asymmetrical Cl-/ATP concentrations indicated that the same conductive pathway was responsible for both ATP and Cl- movement. Thus, CFTR is a multifunctional protein with more than one anion transport capability and may modify signal transduction pathways for Cl- or other secretory processes by the selective delivery of nucleotides to the extracellular domain."
https://openalex.org/W1984789406,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members bind to receptors that consist of heteromeric serine-threonine kinase subunits (type I and type II). In a yeast genetic screen, the immunophilin FKBP-12, a target of the macrolides FK506 and rapamycin, interacted with the type I receptor for TGF-beta and with other type I receptors. Deletion, point mutation, and co-immunoprecipitation studies further demonstrated the specificity of the interaction. Excess FK506 competed with type I receptors for binding to FKBP-12, which suggests that these receptors share or overlap the macrolide binding site on FKBP-12, and therefore they may represent its natural ligand. The specific interaction between the type I receptors and FKBP-12 suggests that FKBP-12 may play a role in type I receptor-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1969373337,"Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the constitutive NO synthase (cNOS) in neurons has been implicated in mediating excitotoxic neuronal death. In our murine cortical cell culture system, NMDA neurotoxicity was not blocked by addition of the NOS inhibitors, NG-nitro-L-arginine or aminoguanidine. However, following activation of inducible NOS in astrocytes by interleukin-1 beta plus interferon-gamma, NMDA but not kainate neurotoxicity was markedly potentiated. This selective potentiation of NMDA neurotoxicity was blocked by NOS inhibition or antioxidants (superoxide dismutase/catalase or Tempol) and could be mimicked by NO generators (SIN-1 or SNAP) or the oxygen radical generator, pyragallol. These results raise the possibility that NO production by astrocytes may contribute to NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal death, perhaps through interaction with oxygen radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1972262740,"Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), the major myelin protein in the CNS, has been thought to function in myelin assembly. Thus, mutations within the gene coding for PLP (Plp) cause hypomyelination, such as the jimpy phenotype in mice and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease in humans. However, these mutants often exhibit premature death of oligodendrocytes, which form CNS myelin. To elucidate the functional roles of Pip gene products in the maturation and/or survival of oligodendrocytes, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing the Plp gene by introducing extra wild-type mouse Pip genes. Surprisingly, transgenic mice bearing 4 more Plp genes exhibited dysmyelination in the CNS, whereas those with 2 more Plp genes showed normal myelination at an early age (3 weeks after birth), but later developed demyelination. Overexpression of the Plp gene resulted in arrested maturation of oligodendrocytes, and the severity of arrest was dependent on the extent of overexpression. Overexpression also led to oligodendrocyte cell death, apparently caused by abnormal swelling of the Golgi apparatus. Thus, tight regulation of Plpgene expression is necessary for normal oligodendrocyte differentiation and survival, and its overexpression can be the cause of both dys- and demyelination."
https://openalex.org/W2078833131,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a diffusible free radical that functions as a second messenger and neurotransmitter. NO synthase (NOS) is highly and transiently expressed in neurons of the developing olfactory epithelium during migration and establishment of primary synapses in the olfactory bulb. NOS is first expressed at E11 in cells of the presumptive nervous layer of the olfactory placode. NOS immunoreactivity persists in the descendants of these cells that differentiate into embryonic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Olfactory NOS expression in the ORN and in its afferents rapidly declines after birth and is undetectable by P7. Following bulbectomy, NOS expression is rapidly induced in the regenerating ORN and is particularly enriched in their outgrowing axons. Immunoblot and Northern blot analyses similarly demonstrate an induction of NOS protein and mRNA expression, respectively, the highest levels of which coincide with peaks of ORN regeneration. These data argue against a role for NO in odorant-sensitive signal transduction, but suggest a prominent function for NO in activity-dependent establishment of connections in both developing and regenerating olfactory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2057850916,"Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) incorporating nucleic acid bases into an achiral polyamide backbone bind to DNA in a sequence-dependent manner. The structure of a PNA-ribonucleic acid (RNA) complex was determined with nuclear magnetic resonance methods. A hexameric PNA formed a 1:1 complex with a complementary RNA that is an antiparallel, right-handed double helix with Watson-Crick base pairing similar to the ""A"" form structure of RNA duplexes. The achiral PNA backbone assumed a distinct conformation upon binding that differed from previously proposed models and provides a basis for further structure-based design of antisense agents."
https://openalex.org/W2008537587,"Subcellular compartments in the outer retina of the larval tiger salamander were identified as likely sites of production of nitric oxide (NO), a recently recognized intercellular messenger. NADPH diaphorase histochemistry and NO synthase immunocytochemistry labeled photoreceptor ellipsoids and the distal regions of bipolar and glial cells apposing photoreceptor inner segments, suggesting a role for NO in visual processing in the outer retina. We investigated the actions of NO on several rod photoreceptor ion channels. Application of the NO-generating compound S-nitrosocysteine increased Ca2+ channel current and a voltage-independent conductance, but had no affect on voltage-gated K+ or nonspecific cation currents. Given the steep relation between voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx and photoreceptor synaptic output, these results indicate that NO could modulate transmission of the photoresponse to second order cells."
https://openalex.org/W1646582854,"Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NF-AT) is a crucial transcription factor required for T-cell expression of interleukin 2. Purified NF-AT contains 45-kDa and 90-kDa subunits (Corthesy, B., and Kao, P. N. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 20682-20690). Partial internal amino acid sequences derived from each subunit indicate that these proteins are novel. The amino acid sequences were used to clone the cDNAs encoding each subunit. The cDNAs predict proteins of novel structures: NF45 has limited similarity to prokaryotic transcription factor sigma-54 and to human DNA topoisomerase II; NF90 has limited similarity to Drosophila Staufen in a domain predicted to bind double-stranded RNA. RNA encoding NF45 and NF90 exists in nonstimulated Jurkat T-cells and in all other cell types examined (HeLa, HepG2, K562). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to demonstrate that both proteins are located in the nucleus of Jurkat T-cells. Clones NF45 and NF90 with a polyhistidine fusion tag were transiently expressed and processed in the native environment of Jurkat T-cells. Histidine-tagged NF45 and NF90 proteins, affinity-purified on nickel chelate columns, encode a NF-AT DNA-binding activity that is enhanced following T-cell stimulation, and this enhancement is blocked when T-cells are stimulated in the presence of cyclosporin A or FK506."
https://openalex.org/W1575180462,"Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by macrophages inhibits tumor cell replication. NO also inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis, probably by quenching the catalytically active tyrosyl free radical of its R2 subunit. The role of this inhibition in NO-mediated cytostasis was thus evaluated. After a 4-h coculture with macrophages, quenching of the radical was demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in transfected L1210-R2 cells over-expressing the R2 protein. Pronounced cytostasis was simultaneously observed. A NO synthase inhibitor greatly reduced both phenomena. Target cells withdrawn from macrophages partially recovered from cytostasis and radical loss within 90 min. Deoxyribonucleosides added to by-pass ribonucleotide reductase inhibition efficiently reversed cytostasis of K-562 cells. After a 24-h coculture, the quenched tyrosyl radical still reappeared in L1210-R2 cells withdrawn from macrophages, but DNA synthesis did not resume. Moreover, deoxyribonucleosides marginally reversed overnight cytostasis of K-562 cells mediated by macrophages but were efficient against cytostasis induced by hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor. Autocrine cytostasis observed early in TA3-H2 cells committed to produce NO was closely correlated with quenching of the tyrosyl radical but not with formation of dinitrosyl-iron complexes. We thus propose that NO-dependent cytostasis begins with a rapid and reversible inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, progressively reinforced by other, long-lasting antiproliferative effects."
https://openalex.org/W2160378954,"The glycoproteins recognized by monoclonal antibody (mAb) NKI-beteb are among the best diagnostic markers for human melanoma because their expression is restricted to melanocytic cells. Recently, we isolated a cDNA clone, termed gp100-c1, which confers immunoreactivity not only to mAb NKI-beteb, but also to two other mAbs used to diagnose malignant melanoma, HMB-50 and HMB-45. In this report, we demonstrate that gp100-c1 cDNA encodes glycoproteins of 100 kDa (gp100) and 10 kDa (gp10) which are recognized by these mAbs in human melanoma cells. The translation product deduced from the open reading frame present in gp100-c1 cDNA is highly homologous to another melanocyte-specific protein, Pmel17. Nucleotide sequence analysis of genomic DNA indicates that the transcripts corresponding to gp100 and Pmel17 cDNAs originate from a single gene via alternative splicing. In all normal and malignant melanocytic cells analyzed, gp100 and Pmel17 RNAs are simultaneously expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1548272930,"The initiation of maximal DNA synthesis by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 requires the presence of the growth factor during the entire G0 to G1 transition period of the cell cycle (Zhan, X., Hu, X., Friesel, R., and Maciag, T. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 9611-9620). During this time, the phosphorylation of several novel proteins on tyrosine residues occurs, and one of these phosphotyrosyl-containing proteins has been characterized as the murine homolog of the chicken cortactin gene (Zhan, X., Hu, X., Hampton, B., Burgess, W.H., Friesel, R., and Maciag, T. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 24427-24431), a putative substrate for v-Src. We have examined the possibility that FGF-1 employs c-Src or Src-like kinases as signaling intermediates during the mid and late G1 phase of the NIH 3T3 cell cycle using immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. We have demonstrated that c-Src can associate with cortactin in a FGF-1-dependent manner. We have also demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody prepared against FGF receptor (R)-1 is able to co-precipitate Src-related proteins in lysates from FGF-1-treated NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, a kinase-active form of FGFR-1 expressed in a bacterial system was also able to associate with Src kinases in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation status of the FGFR-1 protein. Lastly, the Src homology (SH)-2 domain of v-Src was able to recognize a recombinant form of FGFR-1. Because (i) the association between FGFR-1 and Src-like kinases exhibits kinetics similar to those observed between the Src kinases and cortactin and (ii) the Src-SH2 domain is likely to be involved in the association with FGFR-1, we propose that the association of c-Src with activated FGF receptors may be responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin during the mid to late G1 phase of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2020266231,"RNA editing and subunit assembly of ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) were examined in an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line, CG4, which expresses GluR2-GluR4, GluR6, GluR7, KA1, and KA2. AMPA-evoked currents rapidly desensitize, whereas kainate-evoked currents contain a steady-state component with a nearly linear current-voltage relation and a fast desensitizing component that is inwardly rectifying. The Q/R site is edited > 95% to the arginine codon in GluR2(Q607) mRNA, and < 5% in GluR6(Q621) mRNA. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that GluR6 and/or GluR7 subunits assemble with KA2, but not with GluR2-GluR4. These results indicate that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells selectively edit and assemble glutamate receptors into at least two functionally and structurally distinct heteromeric channels."
https://openalex.org/W2075711087,"Opioids are coupled through G proteins to both ion channels and adenylyl cyclase. This study describes opioid modulation of the voltage-dependent cation channel, Ih, in cultured guinea pig nodose ganglion neurons. Forskolin, PGE2, and cAMP analogs shifted the voltage dependence of activation of Ih to more depolarized potentials and increased the inward current at -60 mV. Opioids had no effect on Ih alone, but reversed the effect of forskolin on Ih. This action of opioids was blocked by naloxone. Opioids had no effect on Ih in the presence of cAMP analogs, suggesting that modulation occurs at the level of adenylyl cyclase. The shift in the voltage dependence of Ih by agents that induce inflammation (i.e., PGE2) is one potential mechanism to mediate an increased excitability. Opioid inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent inhibition of Ih may be a mechanism by which opioids inhibit primary afferent excitability and relieve pain."
https://openalex.org/W1582656672,"The mechanisms by which insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is released from insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) and then binds to its receptor have not been defined. This study was designed to determine the role of glycosaminoglycans in altering the formation of the IGF-I.IGFBP complexes. Heparin inhibited formation of the IGF-I.IGFBP-5 complex and also separated preformed IGF-I.IGFBP-5 complexes. Heparin also inhibited formation of the IGF-I.IGFBP-3 complex; however, it did not inhibit formation of complexes between IGF-I and IGFBP-1, -2, or -4. Heparin exposure was associated with a 17-fold decrease in the affinity of IGFBP-5 for IGF-I. A synthetic peptide that contains residues from Arg221 to Arg238 of IGFBP-5, and a heparin binding domain prevented the inhibitory effects of heparin on formation of the IGF-I.IGFBP-5 complex. It did not directly compete with IGF-I for binding to IGFBP-5, suggesting that heparin binding to this region of IGFBP-5 resulted in a conformational change in IGFBP-5 which lowered its affinity for IGF-I. Other glycosaminoglycans that contained O-linked sulfates in the 2 or 3 carbon positions of iduronic acid, e.g. heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, also inhibited the IGF-I.IGFBP-5 complex formation, whereas those that did not, such as keratan sulfate or hyaluronic acid, had minimal effects. Anionic polysaccharides that contained O-sulfate groups in the 2 or 3 positions, such as dextran sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, and fucoidan, also had inhibitory activity. The findings suggest a role for these compounds in inhibiting IGF-I.IGFBP interactions, thus making IGF-I available to bind to its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2155089662,"Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells with delicate interdigitating foot processes which cover the exterior basement membrane surface of the glomerular capillary. They are in part responsible for the extraordinary charge and size filtration characteristics of the glomerulus. To better understand disease processes affecting the glomerular filter, we searched for proteins with relative specificity to the podocyte using a monoclonal antibody strategy. The first such protein characterized (designated glomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP1)) is a membrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) with a large extracellular domain containing eight fibronectin type III-like repeats, a hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a single PTPase domain. The GLEPP1 PTPase domain shows homology with two other single domain transmembrane PTPases (PTP beta and Drosophila central nervous system PTP10D). This homology includes 2 cysteines in the PTPase domain not present in intracellular or tandem domain membrane PTPases. GLEPP1 PTPase protein is distributed to the podocyte foot processes themselves. RNase protection assay shows that GLEPP1 mRNA is also present in brain. By analogy with the CD45 PTPase of T cells, we expect that this receptor might play a role in maintaining foot process structure and/or function by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of podocyte proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1590595696,"A single amino acid substitution in beta 3 (Asp119 --> Tyr) abrogates the ligand binding function of beta 3 integrins and alters the divalent cation conformation of the platelet integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (GPIIb-IIIa). This aspartic acid residue resides within a conserved cluster of oxygenated residues that may provide ligands for the coordination of divalent cations. To assign function to the other oxygenated residues in this group (Ser121, Ser123, Asp126, Asp127, and Ser130), each of these amino acids in beta 3 was individually substituted by alanine. None of these amino acid substitutions altered heterodimer formation or surface expression. However, the substitutions had differential effects on receptor function. Substitution at positions Asp119 or Ser121 produced a complete loss of receptor function. Cells expressing these mutants failed to adhere to fibrinogen, failed to bind activation-independent ligand-mimetic peptides, and did not bind the ligand-mimetic mAb PAC1 following activation of the receptor. Similarly, cells expressing beta 3 with a substitution at Ser123 also failed to adhere to fibrinogen and did not bind RGD peptide or mAb PAC1. These cells did retain the capacity to bind an alpha IIb beta 3-specific, high affinity peptidomimetic, but occupancy did not induce the conformational change from resting to activated state observed following occupancy of the wild type receptor. Substitution at positions Asp126, Asp127, or Ser130 had no effect on ligand binding function. These data indicate that Asp119, along with Ser121 and Ser123, plays an integral role in the ligand binding function of alpha IIb beta 3."
https://openalex.org/W1505781390,"Recent studies indicate multiple mechanisms are involved in Ca2+ stimulation of gene expression. We have used cell-permeable, specific inhibitors of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases) and phosphatase (calcineurin) to investigate the involvement of these enzymes in transcriptional regulation of three immediate early genes in PC12 cells stimulated with A23187 or KCl. Preincubation of PC12 cells with the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-62 blocked autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II in response to stimulation by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. KN-62 treatment also resulted in a 60-70% inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent transcription of c-fos, NGFI-A (zif 268), and NGFI-B (nur 77) as assessed by either Northern or nuclear run-on analyses. Preincubation with the calcineurin inhibitors FK-506 or cyclosporin A strongly enhanced expression of NGFI-A and blocked transcription of NGFI-B, but it had no significant effect on Ca(2+)-stimulated transcription of c-fos. Both FK-506 and KN-62 were specific for Ca(2+)-stimulated transcription as neither effected transcription in response to forskolin or phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) treatment. This is the first report of CaM kinase and calcineurin involvement in transcriptional regulation of NGFI-A and NGFI-B. Activation of CaM kinases and calcineurin, in response to elevated intracellular Ca2+, would exert antagonistic effects on transcription of NGFI-A. Since inhibition of either the kinase or phosphatase decreased transcription of NGFI-B by 60-90%, this suggests that each enzyme is necessary but not sufficient for Ca2+ stimulation. These results indicate that CaM kinases and calcineurin can mediate broad and complex regulation of Ca(2+)-stimulated gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2012036669,"The Xlsirts are a family of transcribed repeat sequence genes that do not code for protein. Xlsirt RNAs become localized to the vegetal cortex of Xenopus oocytes early in oogenesis, before the localization of the messenger RNA Vg1, which encodes a transforming growth factor-beta-like molecule involved in mesoderm formation, and coincident with the localization of Xcat2 transcripts, which encode a nanos-like molecule. Destruction of the localized Xlsirts by injection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides into stage 4 oocytes resulted in the release of Vg1 transcripts but not Xcat2 transcripts from the vegetal cortex. Xlsirt RNAs, which may be a structural component of the vegetal cortex, are a crucial part of a genetic pathway necessary for the proper localization of Vg1 that leads to subsequent normal pattern formation."
https://openalex.org/W1608454061,"Surfactant protein C (SP-C), a 3.7-kDa hydrophobic lung-specific protein, is synthesized and secreted by pulmonary type II cells through proteolytic processing of a 21-kDa propeptide (SP-C21) by currently undefined pathways. Previously, we reported the production of a polyclonal antibody against rat SP-C21 (anti-CPROSP-C) using a synthetic peptide as the immunizing antigen (Beers, M. F., Wali, A., Eckenhoff, M. E. F., Feinstein, S., Fisher, J. H., and Fisher, A. B. (1992) Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 7, 368-378). In this study, two additional epitope-specific proSP-C antibodies produced using synthetic peptide sequences were utilized to examine synthetic processing of SP-C. Anti-NPROSP-C (Met10-Gln23) and anti-CTERMSP-C (Ser149-Ser166) recognized native proSP-C21 produced from in vitro translation of SP-C cDNA. Immunocytochemistry using anti-NPROSP-C confirmed the localization of proSP-C peptides exclusively in type II cells. Western analysis of subcellular fractions identified a single 21-kDa band in microsomes and a 16-kDa form in lamellar bodies each recognized by all three antisera, while anti-NPROSP-C also uniquely identified a prominent 5-6-kDa form in lamellar bodies. In a perfused rat lung model labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine, immunoprecipitation of lung homogenate and lamellar body fractions identified early appearances of 35S-labeled 21-, 18-, and 16-kDa SP-C forms in homogenate and a 16-kDa intermediate form in lamellar bodies. Anti-NPROSP-C also exclusively detected time-dependent appearances of 5-10-kDa proSP-C forms in lamellar bodies and homogenates. Processing of proSP-C21 was completely blocked by inclusion of brefeldin A (15 micrograms/ml) in the perfusate. These results demonstrate that synthetic peptides can be used to produce epitope-specific antisera which recognize more hydrophilic domains of proSP-C and show that proSP-C processing occurs intracellularly in subcellular compartments of type II cells which are distal to the trans-Golgi network."

Transmembrane receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) are highly expressed in liver cells, which quickly respond to this polypeptide mitogen by activating an intrinsically low rate of cell division. Although EGF appears to regulate liver growth, its significance has remained unclear, and only a small change in serum levels can be detected during hepatocellular proliferation. Using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay, we report here the novel finding that EGF RNA transcripts are synthesized in a hepatic cell-specific pattern, appearing in hepatocyte and lipocyte cell types. Our data reveal that within 15 min following a 70% liver removal, EGF RNA levels increase > 10-fold and then diminish below basal levels prior to the first wave of regenerative cell division. Immunoanalysis of metabolically labeled hepatocytes shows that EGF accumulates as a large 60-kDa peptide. These results demonstrate that EGF transcription is a previously unrecognized component of hepatic gene expression, and rapid increases in EGF RNA levels in the immediate-early phase of liver regeneration point to EGF as an autocrine factor in the prereplicative hepatic growth program."
https://openalex.org/W1818076359,"The Kit/stem cell factor receptor (Kit/SCF-R) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor of importance for the normal development of hemopoietic cells, melanoblasts, and germ cells. We recently reported that protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in a negative feedback loop regulating the Kit/SCF-R by direct phosphorylation on serine residues in the receptor. Inhibition of PKC led to increased SCF-induced tyrosine kinase activity and mitogenicity, but PKC was necessary for SCF-induced motility. In this report we have further examined the modulatory role of PKC on SCF-induced signaling. The ligand-activated Kit/SCF-R associated weakly with GRB2 and induced only little tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma in porcine aortic endothelial cells transfected with Kit/SCF-R. In contrast, the SCF-stimulated Kit/SCF-R associated efficiently with, and induced tyrosine phosphorylation of, the p85 alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidyl inositide-3'-kinase (PI-3'-kinase). Both receptor association and tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 alpha were increased after inhibition of PKC, while its serine phosphorylation was decreased. Concomitantly, the specific activity of receptor-associated PI-3'-kinase activity was increased. Inhibition of PI-3'-kinase with wortmannin inhibited SCF-induced mitogenicity. SCF-induced phosphorylation of Raf-1 and activation of ERK2 still occurred after PKC inhibition but was not increased. In conclusion, SCF-induced PI-3'-kinase activation paralleled the increased SCF-induced mitogenicity after inhibition of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1516652978,"The selectins, a family of adhesion receptors involved in leukocyte extravasation, recognize sialyl Lewis X (sLe(x); NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc) and related oligosaccharides. We used conformational energy computations, high field NMR, and structure-function studies to define distance parameters of critical functional groups of sLe(x). This sLe(x) pharmacophore was used to search a three-dimensional data base of chemical structures. Compounds that had a similar spatial relationship of functional groups were tested as inhibitors of selectin binding. Glycyrrhizin, a triterpene glycoside, was identified and found to block selectin binding to sLe(x) in vitro. We substituted different sugars for the glucuronic acids of glycyrrhizin and found the L-fucose derivative to be the most active in vitro and in vivo. A C-fucoside derivative, synthesized on a linker designed for stability and to more closely approximate the original sLe(x) pharmacophore, resulted in an easily synthesized, effective selectin blocker with anti-inflammatory activity."
https://openalex.org/W1540677045,"Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is a calmodulin-dependent, flavin-containing hemoprotein that forms NO from L-arginine, NADPH, and molecular oxygen. Calmodulin binding to NOS triggers reduction of its heme groups (Abu-Soud, H., and Stuehr, D.J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 10769-10762), leading to NADPH oxidation and NO synthesis. We have examined how L-arginine and calmodulin control the ligand binding and electron acceptor properties of the NOS heme iron. In the absence of bound calmodulin, ferric NOS exhibited a Kd of 0.6 microM for L-arginine, as determined by the substrate-dependent shift in heme spin equilibrium toward a high spin state. L-Arginine binding reduced the affinity of the ferric NOS heme for cyanide by 8-fold. Carbon monoxide binding to substrate-free ferrous NOS occurred at a rate of 2 x 10(5) M-1 S-1; this rate was decreased 12-fold when L-arginine was bound. In contrast, bound calmodulin did not significantly affect cyanide or carbon monoxide binding to the NOS heme, nor did it alter NOS binding affinity for L-arginine. Anaerobic titration of a calmodulin-bound, L-arginine-free NOS with NADPH led to incomplete reduction of the heme iron; full reduction was achieved only in the presence of added L-arginine. Thus, our data suggest that L-arginine controls NOS heme iron reactivity in at least two ways: 1) it slows ligand interactions by binding in the distal pocket very near the heme and 2) it also appears to increase the reduction potential of the iron. In contrast, bound calmodulin does not alter the NOS affinity for L-arginine or heme ligands and may function solely as a switch that enables electrons to pass from the flavin domain onto the heme iron."
https://openalex.org/W1531891705,"The specificity of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) acceptor sites of ryudocan was examined by stably expressing epitope-tagged ryudocan cDNA constructs in mouse L cells, which normally produce this proteoglycan. Immunopurified ryudocan was glycanated with both heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS). The attachment of GAGs to ryudocan was prevented by creating Ser-->Thr mutations in all possible combinations at positions 44, 65, and 67. The resulting ryudocan of exogenous origin was immunopurified and evaluated with regard to attached GAG chains. The data reveal that ryudocan possesses three functional GAG attachment sites, that the sites are always occupied with GAG chains, and that each site is capable of bearing either HS or CS. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of GAG lyase digests of intact ryudocan reveal the production of the following multiple isoforms: pure HS-ryudocan, various HS/CS-hybrids, and pure CS-ryudocan. The data suggest that the occupancy bias of each site for HS or CS is slight and that each site functions in a relatively independent fashion. The GAG lyase analysis of partially purified L cell proteoglycans shows two pure CS-homoglycans with core proteins of M(r) = 130,000 and 52,000, respectively. A similar analysis of immunopurified L cell glypican demonstrates that this species only exists as a pure HS-homoglycan. The production of pure homoglycans by this clonal cell line strongly suggests that the functional promiscuity of GAG attachment sites of ryudocan must be encoded in the core protein structure. This property of ryudocan is not peculiar to L cells, as ryudocan synthesized by early passage human endothelial cells also bears both HS and CS. The production of multiple isoforms of ryudocan may serve to expand the functional versatility of this cell surface component and allow it to participate in many different biologic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1756176550,"FK-506, a potent immunosuppressive drug, acts during the commitment phase of T-lymphocyte activation to block a subset of calcium-associated events necessary for transcription of certain early lymphokine genes. The drug binds to an abundant, cytosolic 11.8-kDa protein termed the FK-506-binding protein (FKBP12). The FKBP12.FK-506 complex inhibits calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase that is a component of the signal transduction pathway leading to early lymphokine gene transcription. FKBP12 is one member of a growing gene family. Prior to this report, all other FKBP family members had been irrelevant to the mechanism of action of FK-506 because no other FKBP.FK-506 complexes were able to bind and inhibit calcineurin. Here, we report the purification and characterization of a novel FK-506-binding protein, FKBP12.6. Having 85% amino acid sequence identity to FKBP12, FKBP12.6 is, among the FKBPs, most closely related to FKBP12. When complexed with FK-506, FKBP12.6 binds to and inhibits calcineurin, making it only the second FKBP discovered thus far to do so. The ability to inhibit calcineurin establishes the potential relevance of FKBP12.6 to the immunosuppressive or toxic side effects of FK-506."
https://openalex.org/W1564666625,"There is accumulating evidence that endothelial cells express a non-isopeptide-selective endothelin (ET) receptor, ETB, which may be responsible for ET-1-induced transient vasorelaxation. The purpose of the present study was to seek direct evidence for ETB receptor expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and to characterize its functional role in HUVEC and in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with ETB receptor cDNA (CHO-ETB). Reverse polymerase chain reaction using HUVEC total RNA and ETB receptor-specific oligonucleotide primers firmly demonstrated the presence of an endogenous transcript of the appropriate molecular size. Next, a biotinylated ligand specifically recognizing the ETB receptor, IRL-1620, was synthesized, and immunocytochemical mapping of binding sites was performed in CHO-ETB cells. Specific binding of biotinylated IRL-1620 was evident in CHO-ETB cells, confirming appropriate cell surface receptor expression. Continuous nitric oxide (NO) monitoring with NO-selective electrode revealed a dose-dependent ET-1 stimulation of NO production by HUVEC. Stable transfection of CHO-ETB cells with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS), but not mock-transfection, imparted responsiveness to ET-1 similar to that for HUVEC and was characterized by the immediate release of NO. Protein tyrosine kinase-dependent and calcium-calmodulin-dependent pathways were involved in ET-1-induced activation of the constitutive NOS in CHO-ETB/NOS cells, but coupling of the receptor to the enzyme in HUVEC appeared to be predominantly protein tyrosine kinase-dependent. Although sufficient, calcium/calmodulin system was not an obligatory prerequisite for the ET-1-induced activation of NOS in HUVEC. In conclusion, using two cell systems, we demonstrated that the ETB receptor is functionally coupled to NOS and coordinates the generation of NO via a tyrosine kinase-dependent and a calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1503894421,"The keratin 5 gene presents a complex regulation, since it is expressed at different rates in the basal cells of most, if not all, stratified epithelia. We have analyzed the 5'-upstream region of the bovine keratin 5 (BK5) gene and found that the 5.2 kilobases preceding the gene mimic in vitro the cell type-specific expression of BK5. Most of the transcriptional activity maps to an enhancer located between positions -762 and -1009. The only regulatory element found in this enhancer by electrophoretic mobility shift, competition, and footprinting experiments is a consensus AP-1 site. Mutation of this site abolishes the activity of the enhancer and reduces to 25% the activity of the 5.2-kilobase upstream promoter region. Surprisingly, although the AP-1 presents indistinguishable footprints in all cell types tested, the enhancer is active only in some of them. Even an oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 region protected from DNase I is active in epithelial cells lines but not in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, suggesting that this region could constitute an epithelium-specific AP-1 element. We also show that BK5 does not respond to phorbol ester induction, which suggests that the regulation of this gene by AP-1 must be complex and probably different from several other suprabasal, AP-1-regulated cellular and viral genes."
https://openalex.org/W1491998159,"Yeast RNA lariat debranching enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity using a bacterial overproducer of the enzyme. The enzyme is capable of digesting a variety of branched nucleic acid substrates, including group II intron lariats, multicopy single-stranded DNAs (msDNAs), and a variety of synthetic branched RNAs. A trinucleotide release assay using radiolabeled msDNA substrates was developed and used to determine the basic biochemical parameters for the enzyme. The debranching enzyme shows a strong preference for purines at the 2'-position in both msDNA and synthetic branched RNA substrates, in accord with the structure of its native substrate, which always has a 2'-G residue. The use of small synthetic branched RNA substrates will allow systematic mechanistic and structural studies of this unique enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1538890723,"A competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed to quantitate vitronectin (Vn) mRNA in murine tissues using a synthetic RNA as an external standard. Although the liver contained the highest concentration of Vn mRNA, significant levels were also detected in the brain (25-fold less) and in adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle (100-fold less than liver). Lower concentrations also were detected in the lung, uterus, testis, and thymus, and little or no Vn mRNA could be detected in kidney, spleen, and blood. These results indicate that significant amounts of Vn mRNA are produced in extrahepatic organs. The regulation of Vn gene expression in vivo was studied in a murine model system in which acute systemic inflammation was induced by endotoxin administration. Plasma Vn levels increased 2- to 3-fold within 16 h after endotoxin administration and remained elevated for up to 72 h. This increase appeared to result from increased synthesis in the liver since the steady-state level of hepatic Vn mRNA increased 4-fold after endotoxin administration. Moreover, Vn mRNA levels in heart, lung, and brain were not significantly increased by endotoxin. These results suggest that Vn gene expression in vivo is regulated in a tissue-specific manner and identify Vn as a novel acute phase reactant."
https://openalex.org/W1517791678,"To understand the alteration of extracellular matrix composition evoked by chemotactic factors, we have studied the expression of adhesive (fibronectin) and anti-adhesive (tenascin) proteins in response to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a potent chemoattractant for rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC). PDGF-BB markedly induced two major tenascin mRNA transcripts, whereas fibronectin mRNA levels did not change. The results of immunoprecipitation studies paralleled Northern blot data. Since alternative splicing is responsible for the generation of multiple tenascin mRNAs in other cell types, we studied the effect of chemotactic factors on the relative abundance of tenascin isoforms. The alternatively spliced region of ASMC-derived rat tenascin was amplified and the identity of the products confirmed by sequencing. Three major polymerase chain reaction products were detected: a 1727-base pair unspliced form which was maximal at 2 h and 635- and 362-base pair products which were more abundant at 8 h after treatment with PDGF-BB or angiotensin II. Functional studies showed that the unspliced isoform of human tenascin inhibited attachment of both human and rat ASMC to fibronectin. These results suggest that PDGF-BB markedly up-regulates the expression of tenascin variants, which may lead to destabilization of cell-matrix interactions and promotion of cell migration."

https://openalex.org/W1542724925,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins is regulated by the integrin alpha IIb beta 3. In order to further examine integrin-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation, we have used small Arg-Gly-Asp-containing snake venom proteins (termed disintegrins) that inhibit platelet aggregation to competitively block the agonist-induced binding of fibrinogen to alpha IIb beta 3. One structurally unique disintegrin, contortrostatin (which appears to be a disulfide-linked dimer of 13.5 kDa with two Arg-Gly-Asp sites), was found to trigger signaling events typically mediated by fibrinogen cross-linking of alpha IIb beta 3, as demonstrated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase pp72syk and a 140-kDa protein. Contortrostatin and another disintegrin, multisquamatin (a monomer of 5.7 kDa with a single Arg-Gly-Asp site), did not affect thrombin-induced platelet shape change, secretion, or integrin-independent tyrosine phosphorylation; however, they inhibited aggregation and aggregation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins, including the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK. Our results suggest that structurally distinct disintegrins have varying effects on tyrosine phosphorylation; while monomeric multisquamatin and dimeric contortrostatin both inhibit aggregation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, contortrostatin also possesses a unique functional activity that allows it to activate an intracellular signaling pathway leading to tyrosine phosphorylation. This activity may be involved in the function of this snake venom protein on hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1566209759,"Amylase release from parotid acinar cells is a typical model of cAMP-mediated exocytosis. To obtain unequivocal data concerning the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in amylase exocytosis, we undertook the direct introduction of the PKA catalytic subunit into the parotid acini by permeabilization with streptolysin O (SLO). In the presence of 100 hemolytic units/ml SLO, cAMP increased amylase release in a time- and dose-dependent manner. PKI-(5-24)-peptide, a specific PKA inhibitor, markedly inhibited amylase release, but the extent of inhibition was approximately 50%. On the other hand, the PKA catalytic subunit highly purified from bovine hearts significantly induced amylase release. The release was strictly dependent on the presence of SLO and the catalytic activity of PKA added. The catalytic subunit dose dependently induced amylase release, but the heat-inactivated subunit had no stimulatory effect. PKI-(5-24)-peptide completely blocked amylase release evoked by the subunit. These results clearly demonstrate that the catalytic subunit of PKA regulates cAMP-mediated amylase release through phosphorylation of unidentified protein(s) directly or indirectly involved in the process of exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1540873444,"The carboxyl-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (CPP-I) plays a key role in the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis. In addition, it has been reported that, after cleavage from procollagen, CPP-I exerts feedback control of collagen biosynthesis. To further elucidate the mechanisms involved in each of these processes, we have investigated the nature of cell surface receptors for CPP-I. CPP-I affinity chromatography, using detergent extracts of iodinated HT1080 cells and EDTA elution, resulted in the isolation of two polypeptides of molecular mass 160 and 110 kDa. Since the migratory behavior of these polypeptides under nonreducing and reducing conditions was characteristic of a subset of integrin receptors, their reactivity with anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies was tested. Antibodies directed against the alpha 2 and beta 1 subunits specifically immunoprecipitated both CPP-I-binding polypeptides, indicating that the CPP-I receptor is the integrin alpha 2 beta 1. CPP-I was found to support the attachment and spreading of HT1080 cells, demonstrating that it can function as an adhesion protein. Two other approaches supported the identification of alpha 2 beta 1 as the CPP-I receptor. First, anti-functional anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies directed against the alpha 2 and beta 1 subunits completely abrogated the adhesive activity of CPP-I and, second, highly purified CPP-I bound specifically to alpha 2 beta 1-containing integrin preparations in a solid-phase receptor-ligand binding assay. These findings have important implications for the function of fibrillar collagen carboxyl-terminal propeptides and for the role played by integrins in the regulation of cellular phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1561330353,"PreOmpA-bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) (Goldenberg, D. P. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2481-2489) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the folding pathway of the mature protein in the periplasmic space was analyzed by pulse-chase experiments. Folding intermediates were trapped with iodoacetamide, immunoprecipitated with antisera specific for either the reduced or the native protein, and resolved by electrophoresis. In vivo, native BPTI formed with a half-life of 7 min which is 3-fold faster than the optimal in vitro folding rate in growth media supplemented with low molecular weight disulfides. The measured in vivo half-life includes the time required for translocation and processing by leader peptidase and therefore represents the lower limit for the actual folding rate in the cell. In addition to the native species, two-disulfide intermediates accumulated in the cell at appreciable levels and did not chase to the native species for at least 20 min. We found that the folding of BPTI in E. coli was absolutely dependent on DsbA, a protein which accelerates the formation of disulfide bonds in the periplasm. In a dsbA mutant strain, trace amounts of oxidized BPTI could be detected only in cultures grown under strongly oxidizing conditions. In wild-type cells, the addition of different concentrations of GSH/GSSG or oxidized dithiothreitol did not affect the kinetics of BPTI oxidation by DsbA. Finally, even though the folding of BPTI in vitro decreases by almost 10-fold/unit pH decrease, folding in cells grown at pH 6.0 was only marginally slower than folding in cells grown at neutral pH, despite the fact that the pH of the periplasmic space varies in response to the extracellular fluid."

https://openalex.org/W1557007841,"The serpin of action may resemble the standard mechanism described for small protein inhibitors of serine proteinases. Since these inhibitors are able to bind active site-modified target proteinases, we have investigated the interactions between two serpins and their 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI)-inactivated target proteinases. alpha 2-Antiplasmin and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor bound stoichiometrically to DCI-inactivated chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) and DCI-inactivated human neutrophil elastase, respectively. Similar to active proteinases, the DCI-inactivated proteinases failed to bind complexes between serpins and synthetic reactive site loop peptides. Thus, the abilities of active and inactive proteinases to bind the serpins probably depend on the same structural characteristics. The thermodynamic stability of the alpha 2-antiplasmin-DCI/chymotrypsin and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor-DCI/human neutrophil elastase complexes was similar to that of virgin serpins. However, in mouse plasma elimination studies the two complexes were removed rapidly from the circulation, suggesting that they have adopted the receptor recognized conformation. Consequently, cleavage of the reactive center peptide bond and formation of an inhibitor-acyl enzyme complex is neither obligatory to serpin-proteinase complex formation nor essential for the conformational change responsible for receptor mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1638258690,"Protein SRP19 is an important structural and functional constituent of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and belongs to a group of RNA binding proteins that specifically recognize certain tetranucleotide loops. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the amino acid residues in human SRP19 essential for interaction with SRP RNA. In our studies, three different groups of mutants were constructed, and each group covered essentially the entire sequence of the SRP19 protein in a consecutive nonoverlapping fashion. Results from 10 deletion mutants followed by the analysis of 24 mutants in which adjacent five residues were changed to pentaglycine suggested that a large portion of the protein may be required for RNA binding. Further examination of 53 mutant polypeptides in which adjacent dipeptide segments were altered showed, however, that 84 of the 144 SRP19 amino acids (58%) were not important for binding to the SRP RNA. The essential amino acids cluster in five regions which encompass most of the SRP19 sequence, with the exception of residues located at the N and C termini and a predicted internal loop. The results from the systematic site-directed mutagenesis study, when combined with protein secondary structure calculations, demonstrate that SRP19 is a precisely tooled protein which associates intimately with the SRP RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1854129105,"The substance P receptor and the anti-substance P antibody NC1 share the ability to bind to the COOH terminus of substance P. Sequence analysis identified a direct noninterrupted homology of 5 residues in the two molecules. Replacement of Gly166 and Tyr167 in this epitope of the substance P receptor by the corresponding substance K receptor amino acids (Cys and Phe) increases the affinity toward substance P 2-fold and toward substance K and neurokinin B 11- and 21-fold, respectively. A significantly larger effect of the mutation is observed for the hexapeptides of substance P and substance K which show a mutation-induced increase in binding energy of more than 2 kcal/mol. Hence, the NH2 terminus of substance P and, to a lesser extent, of substance K masks the effect of the mutation. I conclude that the epitope is important for recognition of the common COOH terminus of the tachykinins and for preservation of selectivity. The data furthermore suggest that formation of the peptide-receptor complex occurs through a composite set of interactions which are not adequately described by the two-site/no cooperativity address-message model."
https://openalex.org/W1593027775,"IL-6 signal transduction occurs when the liganded interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) interacts with glycoprotein (gp) 130. We hypothesized that synthetic peptides modeled from the extramembranous domain of the IL-6R may interfere with the IL-6-induced reaction between IL-6R and gp130 and may serve to elucidate the initial steps in IL-6 signal transduction. The capacity of such peptides to modulate two different IL-6 functions was evaluated: 1) IL-6-dependent B9 cell mitogenesis, and 2) IL-6-induced acute phase protein synthesis in HepG2 cells. A synthetic peptide, 249Y16T264, corresponding to residues 249-264, inhibited IL-6-dependent B9 proliferation and IL-6-induced acute phase protein up-regulation in HepG2 cells. Other peptides modeled from different regions of the IL-6R were not inhibitory. 249Y16T264 did not inhibit IL-6-independent HepG2 cell proliferation or total cellular protein synthesis. The inhibitory effect was reversible, indicating that the peptide was not cytotoxic. 249Y16T264 did not inhibit 125I-IL-6 binding in U266 cells. Delineation of this domain identified 249Y10R258 as the minimum effective sequence capable of inhibiting fibrinogen synthesis. Amino acid substitutions in 249Y10R258 obliterated the inhibitory effect on fibrinogen synthesis. In conclusion, a region of the extramembranous domain of the IL-6R has been identified that is involved in the regulation of IL-6 signal transmission. A synthetic peptide representing this region inhibits IL-6-dependent B9 cell mitogenesis and IL-6-stimulated acute phase response in HepG2 cells without affecting ligand binding."
