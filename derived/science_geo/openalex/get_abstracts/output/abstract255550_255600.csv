https://openalex.org/W2019969899,"Persistent viral infections are a major health concern. One obstacle inhibiting the clearance of persistent infections is functional inactivation of antiviral T cells. Although such immunosuppression occurs rapidly after infection, the mechanisms that induce the loss of T-cell activity and promote viral persistence are unknown. Herein we document that persistent viral infection in mice results in a significant upregulation of interleukin (IL)-10 by antigen-presenting cells, leading to impaired T-cell responses. Genetic removal of Il10 resulted in the maintenance of robust effector T-cell responses, the rapid elimination of virus and the development of antiviral memory T-cell responses. Therapeutic administration of an antibody that blocks the IL-10 receptor restored T-cell function and eliminated viral infection. Thus, we identify a single molecule that directly induces immunosuppression leading to viral persistence and demonstrate that a therapy to neutralize IL-10 results in T-cell recovery and the prevention of viral persistence."

Here we report that the MAPKKK MEKK1 regulates redox homeostasis in Arabidopsis. We show that MEKK1-deficient plants are misregulated in the expression of a number of genes involved in cellular redox control and accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Most strikingly, homozygous mekk1 mutant plants exhibit a lethal phenotype when developing true leaves. MEKK1 kinase activity and protein stability was regulated by H2O2 in a proteasome-dependent manner and mekk1 plants were compromised in ROS-induced MAPK MPK4 activation. Whereas mpk3 and mpk6 knock out plants showed no defects in development or changes in redox control genes, mpk4 null mutant shared several phenotypic and transcript profile features with mekk1 plants. In agreement with the concept that ROS negatively regulates auxin responses in plants, mekk1 and mpk4 mutants show reduced expression of several auxin-inducible marker genes. Overall, our data defines MPK4 as downstream target of MEKK1 and show that MEKK1 functions in integrating ROS homeostasis with plant development and hormone signaling.

A MAPK cascade minimally consists of a MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK module that is linked in various ways to upstream receptors and downstream targets. Receptor-mediated activation of a MAPKKK can occur through physical interaction and/or phosphorylation by either the receptor itself, intermediate bridging factors or interlinking MAPKKKKs. MAPKKKs are serine/threonine kinases that activate MAPKKs through phosphorylation on two serine/threonine residues in a conserved (S/T)X3-5(S/T) motif (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). In contrast, MAPKKs are dual-specificity kinases that phosphorylate MAPKs on threonine and tyrosine residues in the TXY motif. MAPKs are promiscuous serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate a variety of substrates including transcription factors, protein kinases, and cytoskeleton-associated proteins (2Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Specificity of MAPK cascades functioning within the same cell is generated through the presence of docking domains found in various components of MAPK modules and through a growing number of scaffold proteins (5Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar).Recently, we have isolated OMTK1 (oxidative stress-activated MAP triple-kinase 1), a novel MAPKKK from alfalfa (Medicago sativa), which among a panel of hormones and stresses tested, was only activated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (6Nakagami H. Kiegerl S. Hirt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26959-26966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Out of four MAPKs, OMTK1 specifically activated MMK3 resulting in an increased cell death rate. Pull-down analysis between recombinant proteins showed that OMTK1 directly interacts with MMK3 and that OMTK1 and MMK3 are part of a protein complex in vivo. These results indicated that OMTK1 plays a MAPK scaffolding role and functions in activation of H2O2-induced cell death in plants. Because of its autotetraploid nature, a genetic analysis of OMTK1 in alfalfa is not possible. Therefore, we investigated the function of MEKK1, which is the most closely related MAPKKK of alfalfa OMTK1, in Arabidopsis. MEKK1 has been implicated in biotic and abiotic stress signaling cascades. MEKK1 transcripts accumulate upon cold, salt and touch stress (7Mizoguchi T. Irie K. Hirayama T. Hayashida N. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and a truncated version of MEKK1 activates MAPK pathways induced by the bacterial elicitor flagellin (8Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) or by cold and salt stress (9Teige M. Scheikl E.

So far, no genetic analysis of the function of MEKK1 was performed. In the present study, knock-out mekk1 mutants were isolated and phenotypically characterized. mekk1 plants showed multiple defects including misregulation of several redox control genes and a lethal phenotype during early leaf development. Biochemical analysis indicated that MEKK1 is regulated by H2O2 in a proteasome-dependent manner and regulates ROS-induced MAPK MPK4 activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnalysis of MEKK1 T-DNA Insertion Lines—The mekk1-1 T-DNA insertion line was isolated from the SALK T-DNA collection (SALK_052557). The T-DNA insertion site was mapped with gene-specific primers LP: 5′-GATTATTCCACGAAACACCGCG-3′ and RP: 5′-AGAAATAGCCAAATCATCAGGACC-3′ and with a T-DNA specific primer LBa1: 5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′. Pairs of primers were used to determine if the plants were homozygous or heterozygous for the T-DNA insertion, and the PCR products were sequenced. The mekk1-3 T-DNA insertion line was isolated from the University of Wisconsin pDs-Lox collection (WiscDsLox339H07). The T-DNA insertion site was mapped with gene-specific primers LP: 5′-GATCATCGGGGATCGTCTTGGG-3′ and RP: 5′-GAAACTTCCATTTCCATACCCCC-3′ and with a T-DNA specific primer p745-Ws: 5′-AACGTCCGCAATGTGTTATTAAGTTGTC-3′. Pairs of primers were used to determine if the plants were homozygous or heterozygous for the T-DNA insertion, and the PCR products were sequenced.Imaging of Root Hairs—Sterilized seeds were imbibed at 4 °C for 2-7 days in sterile water to synchronize germination onset and then sown on 1.2% agar 1/2 MS (1% sucrose) in one row in the top third of square plates (120 × 120 × 17 mm, sealed by Leukopor tape allowing aeration). Plates were incubated in vertical positions, 35% humidity and long day conditions (16 h of light/8 h of darkness) at 24 °C. Root growth was monitored starting from the second day after sowing. Roots grown synchronously on the surface of agar plates were selected for microscopic analysis. Images of the root hair zone of 7-day-old seedlings were taken with an Olympus BX51 stereo binocular microscope (objective Olympus UplanApo 4× NA 0,16), an Olympus DP50 camera and Viewfinder Lite software (Pixera Corporation). Size bars were embedded by software analysis (Soft Imaging System GmbH).H2O2 Staining with DAB—H2O2 accumulation in planta was visualized by DAB staining. Arabidopsis seedlings were vacuum infiltrated for 2 min with DAB solution (1 mg/ml, pH 3.8) and incubated on a shaker for 1 h. The stain was poured off and chlorophyll removed by incubating overnight in 96% (v/v) ethanol. DAB is polymerized locally in the presence of H2O2 giving a visible brown stain.Transient Expression Assays—Transient expression assays were performed with isolated protoplasts from a cultured Arabidopsis cell suspension. The isolation, transformation and cultivation of protoplasts was performed as described (6Nakagami H. Kiegerl S. Hirt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26959-26966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of MEKK1 was fused at its C terminus to a double Myc epitope and cloned into the plant expression vector pRT100. The open reading frame of MPK4 was fused at its C terminus to a triple HA epitope and cloned into the plant expression vector pRT100. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed via polyethylene glycol with 4 μg of plasmid. 12-16 h after transformation, the protoplasts were pretreated with or without 100 μm proteasome inhibitor MG115, and then treated with or without 2 mm H2O2 for 5 min, before extracts were prepared from the protoplasts as described earlier (6Nakagami H. Kiegerl S. Hirt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26959-26966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and used for immunokinase assays.Protein Extraction—Cell extracts were prepared in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm NaVO3, 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.1% Tween 20, 15 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 40 min the supernatant was immediately used for further experiments.Immunokinase Assays—Immunokinase assays were performed with cell extracts from roots containing 50 μg of total protein as described in Cardinale et al. (10Cardinale F. Jonak C. Ligterink W. Niehaus K. Boller T. Hirt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36734-36740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides encoding the N-terminal 15, C-terminal 16, or C-terminal 7 amino acids of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6, respectively. Specificities of the antibodies were confirmed by using mpk3, mpk4, and mpk6 mutant plants. Immunoprecipitations from protoplast protein extracts were performed as described previously with anti-Myc or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (6Nakagami H. Kiegerl S. Hirt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26959-26966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Immunoblots—Immunoblots were done according to Nakagami et al. (6Nakagami H. Kiegerl S. Hirt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26959-26966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), probed either with MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 antibodies, or with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies at a dilution of 1:5,000.H2O2 and IAA Treatment of Seedlings—For RT-PCR analysis, sterilized seeds were imbibed at 4 °C for 2-7 days in sterile water to synchronize germination onset and then sown on 1/2 MS, 1% sucrose, 0.7% agar, and incubated in long day conditions (16 h of light/8 h of darkness) at 24 °C. 10 days after sowing, seedlings were transferred to sterile water and left to recover for 24 h. The seedlings were treated with or without 10 mm H2O2 for 1 h or 100 mm IAA for 2 h, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunokinase assays, the seeds were sown on 1/2 MS, 1% sucrose, 0.5% phytagel in one row of square plates. Plates were incubated in vertical positions and long day conditions (16 h of light/8 h of darkness) at 24 °C. 16 days after sowing, seedlings were transferred to sterile water and left to recover for 24 h. The seedlings were treated with or without 20 mm H2O2 for 15 min, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from seedlings according to manufacturer's instruction using TRI reagent (Sigma). Concentration of RNA was determined by measuring OD at 260 nm. First strand cDNA was synthesized with a Revert Aid ™ M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). PCRs were performed using following primers.

Shirasu (RIKEN Plant Science Center). Genomic analysis of mekk1-1 plants indicated that these plants carry an insertion of an inverted tandem T-DNA 9 base pairs downstream of the start codon within exon 1 of the MEKK1 gene (Fig. 1C). The genomic analysis of mekk1-3 plants revealed that an insertion of an inverted tandem T-DNA had occurred in the first intron of the MEKK1 gene (Fig. 1C). RT-PCR of RNA prepared from mekk1-1 and mekk1-3 plants with MEKK1 gene-specific primers indicated the absence of MEKK1 transcripts in these lines (Fig. 1D). Southern analysis of genomic DNA isolated from mekk1-1 and mekk1-3 plants with a T-DNA probe confirmed that both lines carried single site insertions (data not shown). Homozygous mekk1-1 and mekk1-3 mutants germinated and developed normal cotyledons (Fig. 1, A and B). However, shortly after, cotyledons of homozygous mekk1 mutants stopped expanding, started to wilt and became chlorotic (Fig. 1, A and B). mekk1 mutant plants also developed true leaves, but their true leaves were curled and extremely dwarfed compared with those of wild type plants. In comparison to wild type plants, mekk1-1 and mekk1-3 mutant plants stayed dwarfed and never reached maturity to produce seeds.When mekk1 seedlings were compared with wild type Arabidopsis plants, it was obvious that mekk1 mutant plants had shorter and less root hairs (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, when grown on vertical medium agar plates, mekk1 mutants had a strongly decreased number of lateral roots than wild type plants (Fig. 2C). Overall, these results indicate that MEKK1 plays an important role in regulating multiple processes during vegetative development of Arabidopsis.FIGURE 2mekk1(-/-) plants have less lateral roots and shorter root hairs.

For this purpose, we determined the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in mekk1 mutants and wild type seedlings using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. As seen by the accumulation of brown precipitate, in comparison to wild type plants, mekk1-1 and mekk1-3 mutants accumulated H2O2 in cotyledons and true leaves (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3A, young developing leaves accumulate H2O2 especially at the tip regions. However, H2O2 accumulation occurs at entire region of leaves at later stage (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3mekk1 and mpk4 mutants accumulate H2O2.

Upon plasmid transfection, protoplasts were treated with or without H2O2 before MEKK1-Myc was immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc antibody. Subsequently, the kinase activity of MEKK1 was determined using [γ-32P]ATP and myelin basic protein (MBP) as an artificial substrate. As shown in the autoradiogram in Fig. 4, MEKK1 kinase activity was detected at low levels in untreated protoplasts, but became strongly stimulated in response to H2O2 treatment. Interestingly, when MEKK1-Myc protein amounts were quantified by immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc antibody, MEKK1-Myc levels also showed a strong increase in H2O2-treated samples. These results revealed that MEKK1 protein amounts are directly affected by oxidative stress.FIGURE 4MEKK1 is activated by H2O2. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MEKK1-Myc expression vector or empty vector. The protoplasts were treated with or without 100 μm MG115 for 10 min, before further treatment with or without 2 mm H2O2 for 5 min. MEKK1-Myc kinase activity was determined from protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody followed by in vitro kinase assays with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with an anti-Myc antibody. Samples were analyzed on same SDS-PAGE gel. For clarity, lanes were assembled in separate panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the possibility that H2O2-induced MEKK1 kinase activation was due to proteasome-dependent regulation of MEKK1 protein stability, protoplasts were transiently transformed with the MEKK1-Myc expression vector and treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG115. Thereafter, MEKK1-Myc amounts were analyzed in total protein extracts by immunoblot with anti-Myc antibody. As seen in Fig. 4, the MG115 treatment of 10 min resulted in a clear accumulation of MEKK1-Myc protein to similar levels as seen after H2O2-treatment. These results indicated that MEKK1 is regulated through proteasome-mediated stability. Kinase assays of immunoprecipitated MEKK1-Myc from these extracts also showed increased activity but not to similar levels as seen after H2O2-treatment. In a further experiment, the proteasome inhibitor treatment was combined with the H2O2 treatment. Immunoblotting showed that the combined treatment did not result in higher accumulation of MEKK1-Myc protein amounts than after either treatment alone. Interestingly, the kinase activity of MEKK1-Myc was clearly higher in H2O2+MG115-treated protoplasts than in protoplasts treated with MG115 alone. These data indicate that proteasome-mediated MEKK1 protein stabilization might be a part of H2O2-induced activation of MEKK1, and full activation of MEKK1 by H2O2 might require other, as yet unknown, post-translational modifications.mekk1 Mutant Plants Are Impaired in ROS-induced MAPK Activation—MEKK1 has been shown to be involved in the activation of three MAPKs that play key roles in abiotic stress adaptation and pathogen defense (8Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar, 9Teige M. Scheikl E. Eulgem T. Doczi R. Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Dangl J.L. Hirt H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). During both pathogen attack and in response to all abiotic stresses, ROS are amply produced and could serve as a common mechanism for activating this pathway. To investigate this possibility in the context of MEKK1, the activation of the endogenous MAPKs MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 was analyzed in wild type Col-0 and mekk1 mutant plants before and in response to H2O2 treatment. MPK3, MPK4, or MPK6 were immunoprecipitated from root or seedling protein extracts with MAPK-specific antibodies and analyzed by in vitro kinase assays using MBP as a substrate. In root extracts, all three MAP kinases showed low basal kinase activity but were all strongly activated by H2O2 treatment in wild type Col-0 plants (Fig. 5A). Immunoblots of the protein extracts with the respective MAPK antibodies did not reveal significant changes in MAPK protein amounts after H2O2 treatment that would explain the increases in kinase activities of MPK3, MPK4 or MPK6 (Fig. 5A). In mekk1 mutant lines, the basal amounts and activities of all three MAPKs showed similar levels as in wild type plants (Fig. 5A). Whereas MPK6 activation was slightly reduced and MPK3 activation not affected, H2O2-induced activation of MPK4 was completely abrogated (Fig. 5A). Although the protein amounts of all three MAPKs were not affected in roots of mekk1 plants, protein amounts in seedlings differed greatly making the interpretation of the kinase activities complicated (supplementary Fig. S1). From the root data, we conclude that MPK4 is a major downstream target of the H2O2-induced MEKK1-dependent MAPK pathway.FIGURE 5MEKK1 is required for H2O2-induced MPK4 activation. A, H2O2-induced activation of MPK4 is abrogated in roots of mekk1 mutants. Wild type Col-0 and mekk1 mutant plants at 16 days after sowing were treated with or without 20 mm H2O2 for 15 min. MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 kinase activity was determined from root protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 specific antibodies followed by in vitro kinase assays with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 specific antibodies. B, MEKK1 is required for H2O2-induced MPK4 activation in protoplasts. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MPK4-HA alone or MPK4-HA in combination with MEKK1-Myc. The protoplasts were treated with or without 2 mm H2O2 for 5 min. MPK4-HA kinase activity was determined from these extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by in vitro kinase assays with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MEKK1 Activates MPK4—As the kinase activity in mekk1 mutants indicated that MEKK1 is an upstream activator of MPK4, we tested whether MEKK1 can activates MPK4 in response to ROS. For this purpose, HA-tagged MPK4 was co-expressed with Myc-tagged MEKK1 in protoplasts. Upon treating the protoplasts with or without H2O2, MPK4-HA was immunoprecipitated before determination of MPK4 kinase activity using MBP as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 5B, MPK4-HA alone was poorly active, and was not notably activated by H2O2 treatment. However, co-expression of MEKK1-Myc enhanced the basal activity of MPK4-HA to a certain extent, and caused significant enhancement of MPK4-HA activity upon H2O2 treatment. These data strongly support the idea that H2O2-induced MPK4 activation is mediated by MEKK1.Phenotypic Similarity between mekk1 and mpk4 Mutant Plants—Because we found that MPK4 is a downstream component of the H2O2-induced MEKK1 signaling cascade, we tested whether mpk4 would show phenotypic similarities to mekk1 mutant plants. So far, a genetic analysis of MPK4 function has only been performed in mpk4 mutants in the genetic background of A. thaliana accession Landsberg erecta (11Petersen M. Brodersen P. Naested H. Andreasson E. Lindhart U. Johansen B. Nielsen H.B. Lacy M. Austin M.J. Parker J.E. Sharma S.B. Klessig D.F. Martienssen R. Mattsson O. Jensen A.B. Mundy J.

To allow a direct comparison between MEKK1 and MPK4 functions, we selected MAPK mutants in the Col-0 background. The MPK4 T-DNA insertion line was isolated from the SALK T-DNA collection (SALK_056245). RT-PCR of RNA prepared from mpk4 plants with MPK4 gene-specific primers indicated that low amounts of MPK4 transcripts are still present (Fig. 6), but no MPK4 protein could be detected in this line by immunoblot analysis with MPK4-specific antibody (data not shown). The MPK3 and MPK6 T-DNA insertion lines were also isolated from the SALK T-DNA collection (SALK_151594 and SALK_073907, respectively). RT-PCR analysis of mpk3 and mpk6 plants indicated the absence of MPK3 or MPK6 transcripts in the corresponding lines (Fig. 6), and the absence of MPK3 and MPK6 protein in the mutants was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using MPK3 and MPK6 specific antibodies (data not shown). Like mekk1, mpk4 but not mpk3 and mpk6 mutants showed a strongly dwarfed phenotype with wilted cotyledons and curled dwarfed true leaves (supplementary Fig. S2A). When compared with wild type plants or mpk3 and mpk6 mutants, DAB staining indicated that mpk4 mutants accumulate H2O2 in their leaves (Fig. 3B and supplementary Fig. S2B). Overall, mekk1 and mpk4 mutant plants showed similarities with respect to both, phenotype and H2O2 accumulation.FIGURE 6Misregulation of redox-related genes in mekk1 and mpk4 mutant plants. RNA was extracted from wild type Col-0, mekk1-1, mekk1-3, mpk4, mpk3, and mpk6 seedlings at 10 days after sowing and treatment with or without 10 mm H2O2 for 1 h before RT-PCR analysis. Two different Col-0 samples were prepared from independently treated seedlings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Altered Expression of Genes Related to ROS Signaling and Homeostasis in mekk1 and mpk4 Mutant Plants— To further establish a role of MEKK1 and the MAPKs MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 in H2O2 signaling, we analyzed whether expression of genes involved in redox control are affected in mutant plants. For this purpose, we performed RT-PCR analysis of H2O2 treated or untreated wild type Col-0, mekk1, mpk3, mpk4, and mpk6 plants. As shown in Fig. 6, the expression of MPK4 was up-regulated in mekk1 mutants, conversely mpk4 mutants showed enhanced expression of MEKK1. These data suggest that expression of the MEKK1 and MPK4 genes is under negative control of their own pathway.The expression of several H2O2-inducible genes showed significantly higher induction in mekk1 and mpk4 mutants than in wild type plants or in mpk3 and mpk6 mutants. To this group of genes belong Zat12, a putative transcription factor (12Rizhsky L. Davletova S. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol.

In other cases, family members have distinct roles in a range of embryologic, differentiation or response pathways (as in the Tbx and Pax families). For the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, mice deficient in Irf1, Irf2, Irf3, Irf4, Irf5, Irf7, Irf8 or Irf9 have defects in the immune response but show no embryologic abnormalities. Mice deficient for Irf6 have not been reported, but in humans, mutations in IRF6 cause two mendelian orofacial clefting syndromes, and genetic variation in IRF6 confers risk for isolated cleft lip and palate. Here we report that mice deficient for Irf6 have abnormal skin, limb and craniofacial development. Histological and gene expression analyses indicate that the primary defect is in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. This study describes a new role for an IRF family member in epidermal development."

https://openalex.org/W2016538215,"TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions have recently been reported to be present in a high proportion of human prostate cancers. In the current study, we show that great diversity exists in the precise structure of TMPRSS2-ERG hybrid transcripts found in human prostates. Fourteen distinct hybrid transcripts are characterized, each containing different combinations of sequences from the TMPRSS2 and ERG genes. The transcripts include two that are predicted to encode a normal full-length ERG protein, six that encode N-terminal truncated ERG proteins and one that encodes a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein. Interestingly, distinct patterns of hybrid transcripts were found in samples taken from separate regions of individual cancer-containing prostates, suggesting that TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions may be arising independently in different regions of a single prostate."

Recent studies show that Insig-1 (but not Insig-2) is ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded when cells are depleted of sterols. Conversely, ubiquitination of Insig-1 is blocked, and the protein is stabilized when intracellular sterols accumulate. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase gp78, which binds with much higher affinity to Insig-1 than Insig-2, is required for ubiquitination and degradation of Insig-1 in sterol-depleted cells. Sterols prevent Insig-1 ubiquitination and degradation by displacing gp78 from Insig-1, an event that results from sterol-induced binding of Scap to Insig-1. In addition to providing a mechanism for sterol-regulated degradation of Insig-1, these results help to explain why Scap is subject to endoplasmic reticulum retention upon Insig-1 binding, whereas 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase is ubiquitinated and degraded.

DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Scap controls the activation of SREBPs, membrane-bound transcription factors that enhance transcription of genes required for cholesterol synthesis and uptake (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl.

Binding of Scap to Insig proteins leads to ER retention of Scap, thereby preventing delivery of Scap-bound SREBPs to the Golgi for proteolytic release from membranes (4Yang T. Espenshade P.J.

In the absence of this proteolytic activation, transcriptional rates of SREBP target genes decline, leading to a reduction in cholesterol synthesis and uptake. Sterol-induced binding of HMG CoA reductase to Insig proteins leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the reductase by 26 S proteasomes (6Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

This degradation slows the reductase-catalyzed conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonate, a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis (8Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). In combination, these sterol-mediated actions of Insig proteins (ER retention of Scap and degradation of HMG CoA reductase) prevent overaccumulation of cholesterol or its sterol precursors. Human Insig-1 and Insig-2 are 59% identical and share a similar topology with both proteins containing six transmembrane helices (5Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 9Feramisco J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Despite these similarities and overlapping functions in sterol regulation, Insig-1 and Insig-2 differ in their mode of regulation. The Insig-1 gene is a target of nuclear SREBPs. Thus, Insig-1 mRNA levels are high in sterol-deprived cells and decline under sterol-replete conditions (3Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 4Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The Insig-2 transcript is expressed constitutively in cultured cells and is not regulated by nuclear SREBPs (5Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, the level of Insig-1 protein varies opposite to that of its mRNA. In sterol-depleted cells in which Insig-1 mRNA levels are high, the Insig-1 protein becomes ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by proteasomes with a half-life <30 min (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When cells are presented with sterols, Scap binds to Insig-1, and this event blocks Insig-1 ubiquitination, thereby extending its half-life to >2 h (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, the steady state levels of Insig-1 protein remain the same despite a reduction in its mRNA (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with Insig-1, Insig-2 has a much longer half-life that is not subject to sterol regulation (11Lee J.N. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45257-45265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12Lee J.N. Gong Y. Zhang X. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4958-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These two levels of Insig-1 regulation (gene transcription and protein stability) are central to a process recently termed “convergent feedback inhibition” (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When cells are depleted of sterols, the Scap-SREBP complex dissociates from Insig-1, which in turn becomes ubiquitinated and degraded. This allows translocation of Scap-SREBP complex to the Golgi, where SREBPs are processed to the nuclear form that accelerates transcription of genes required for cholesterol synthesis and uptake. Transcription of the Insig-1 gene is also enhanced, which leads to an increase in the synthesis of Insig-1 protein. However, this protein will be rapidly degraded until sufficient sterols accumulate to stimulate Scap binding to Insig-1. Thus, inhibition of SREBP processing requires the convergence of newly synthesized Insig-1 and newly acquired cholesterol, thereby preventing premature termination of SREBP activation. Insight into the mechanism for convergent feedback inhibition may be provided by the recent discovery of gp78 as an Insig-1-associated protein (13Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound gp78 is a RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) that mediates ubiquitination of reductase in the presence of sterols (13Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In the current study, we expand upon this observation by examining a possible role for gp78 in sterol-regulated ubiquitination and degradation of Insig-1. Our results show that gp78 is required for the ubiquitination and degradation of Insig-1 in sterol-depleted cells. Sterol-dependent stabilization of Insig-1 occurs when the protein binds to Scap, which in turn displaces gp78, thereby preventing ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Insig-1. These results explain the sterol-regulated stability of Insig-1 protein and provide a new model for the underlying mechanism of convergent feedback inhibition.

SRD-13A cells are a clone of mutant CHO cells deficient in Scap.

Transient Transfection of Cells and Immunoblot Analysis— SRD-13A and SV589 cells were transiently transfected with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Conditions of incubation after transfection are described in the figure legends. After incubation, duplicate dishes of cells were pooled, harvested, and lysed in 0.1 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, a protease inhibitor mixture including 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal). Aliquots of the lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Antibodies used in the current studies were IgG-R139 (5 μg/ml), IgG-9E10 (1 μg/ml), a polyclonal anti-Myc (0.2 μg/ml), a polyclonal anti-T7 (0.2 μg/ml), a monoclonal anti-HA IgG (1:1,000 dilution), a polyclonal anti-gp78 (1:10,000 dilution), a monoclonal anti-CFTR (1:1000 dilution), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs (0.2 μg/ml). Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal substrate system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 films at room temperature for the indicated time. RNA Interference (RNAi)—Duplexes of small interfering RNA (siRNA) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The three siRNA sequences targeting human gp78 (GenBank™ accession number NM_001144) are at nucleotide positions (relative to the codon for the initiating methionine) 300-318, 1130-1318 and 1318-1336 for gp78-1, gp78-2, and gp78-3, respectively. The siRNA sequences targeting human Hrd1 and Trc8 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF317634 and AF064801, respectively) correspond to the following nucleotide positions relative to the codon for the initiating methionine Hrd1 (nucleotides 177-195) and Trc8 (nucleotides 1663-1681). SV589 cells cultured in a 60-mm dish were transfected with 400 pmol of siRNA duplexes using OligofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer, after which the cells were used for experiments as described in the figure legends. Real-time PCR—The protocol was identical to that described by Liang et al. (20Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Briefly, triplicate samples of first strand cDNA were subjected to real-time PCR quantification using forward and reverse primers for the indicated mRNA with human 36B4 as an invariant control. Relative amounts of mRNAs were calculated using the comparative CT method. Immunoprecipitation—The pooled cell pellets from duplicate 60-mm dishes of cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described previously (14Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of Insig-1—Cells were directly lysed in the dish by the addition of buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Fos-choline 13, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, a protease inhibitor mixture including 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal) supplemented with 8 m urea. The cell lysates were sonicated for 5 s at 4°C with a Branson Digital Sonifier. The resulting cell lysates were diluted with buffer B to decrease the urea concentration to 2 m and subjected sequentially to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis to determine the ubiquitination of Insig-1 as previously described (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows an experiment that addresses the requirement of gp78 for degradation of Insig-1 in sterol-depleted SV-589 cells, a line of immortalized human fibroblasts (21Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as we do not have an antibody capable of detecting endogenous Insig-1 in human cells, SV-589 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid that encodes human Insig-1 tagged with six copies of the c-Myc epitope. Expression of the transfected Insig-1 is driven by the weak thymidine kinase promoter to prevent saturation of the regulated degradation machinery. The cells were subsequently transfected with duplexes of siRNA targeting either gp78 or green fluorescent protein (GFP), a control mRNA not present in the cells. Following incubation in medium containing sterols, which prevents ubiquitination and degradation of Insig-1 (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the cells were switched to sterol-depleting medium and treated with cycloheximide to block the generation of newly synthesized Insig-1. At various times after cycloheximide treatment, cells were harvested for lysate preparation and immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc. In previous studies, we found that the time course of Insig-1 disappearance following cycloheximide treatment reflects its rate of degradation (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In cells receiving the GFP siRNA, Insig-1 declined by >50% after 1 h and became barely detectable after 2 h of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-4). This disappearance was significantly blunted by transfection of three siRNAs that target different regions of the gp78 mRNA, with >50% of Insig-1 remaining in the cells after 2 h of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 5-13). Endogenous Myc protein was also detected in the same immunoblot, because anti-Myc was used to detect transfected Insig-1. The disappearance of Myc protein after cycloheximide treatment was not affected by transfection of siRNAs targeting gp78 (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-13). Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that each gp78 siRNA duplex decreased the level of gp78 mRNA by >80% (Fig. 1B). Notably, the degradation of Insig-1 was not completely abolished in cells transfected with siRNA targeting gp78. This is most likely due to the activity of residual gp78 remaining in the cell after RNAi treatment. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, gp78 acts catalytically rather than stoichiometrically. Thus, a small amount of gp78 could still catalyze the ubiquitination of fractions of Insig-1 resulting in their degradation. A similar RNAi experiment was conducted to demonstrate the requirement of gp78 for Insig-1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2). SV-589 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Insig-1 fused to three copies of the T7 epitope and a plasmid encoding ubiquitin tagged with an epitope derived from the influenza HA protein. The cells were subsequently transfected with siRNAs targeting a control mRNA (GFP) or gp78. The cells were depleted of sterols and incubated in the absence or presence of MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor that blocks degradation of ubiquitinated Insig-1 (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The cells were then harvested, detergent lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-T7-coupled agarose beads to precipitate Insig-1. Immunoprecipitated material was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-T7 and anti-HA to detect Insig-1 and ubiquitin, respectively (Fig. 2). Transfecting cells with the gp78 siRNA efficiently decreased expression of the protein as revealed by immunoblot analysis with anti-gp78 (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 3 and 5). In the absence of MG132, the level of Insig-1 was elevated in immunoprecipitates from cells that received the gp78 siRNA (Fig. 2, middle panel, lanes 2 and 3). This is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, which demonstrate a role for gp78 in the degradation of Insig-1. Ubiquitinated Insig-1 was not detected under this condition (Fig. 2, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3), presumably because the ubiquitinated protein was rapidly degraded by proteasomes. Treatment of control-transfected cells with MG-132 led to the appearance of ubiquitinated Insig-1, which is indicated by high molecular weight smears in the anti-HA immunoblot of the precipitates (Fig. 2, top panel, lane 4). This ubiquitination was blocked when cells received the siRNA duplex targeting gp78 (Fig. 2, top panel, lane 5). Constant amounts of Insig-1 were found in immunoprecipitates from MG-132-treated cells, regardless of the siRNA duplex transfected (Fig. 2, middle panel, lanes 4 and 5). Notably, we did not observe the appearance of a smear of ubiquitinated Insig-1 in the anti-T7 immunoblot. This likely results from rapid deubiquitination of Insig-1 because of the strong activity of deubiquitinating enzymes in the lysates (7Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22Edward G.M. Len N. Electrophoresis. 1998; 20: 418-428Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that gp78 is required for ubiquitination of Insig-1 in sterol-depleted cells. Fig. 3 shows experiments that address the specificity of gp78 in mediating degradation of Insig-1. We first examined whether RNAi-induced knockdown of gp78 retards degradation of another polytopic protein from the ER membrane. For this purpose, we transfected SV589 cells with an expression plasmid encoding Insig-1 or a mutant version of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein CFTR(ΔF508), a well known substrate for ER-associated degradation (23Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The cells were then transfected with the control or gp78 siRNA duplex, incubated in sterol-depleting medium, and subjected to cycloheximide chase analysis. As expected, Insig-1 degradation was slowed in cells transfected with the gp78 but not the control siRNA duplex (Fig. 3A, upper panel). However, CFTR(ΔF508) continued to be rapidly degraded, even in cells that received the gp78 siRNA duplex (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). We next designed an experiment to determine whether degradation of Insig-1 in sterol-depleted cells requires the presence of other membrane-bound RING finger E3s such as Trc8, which contains a weakly conserved putative sterol-sensing domain (24Gemmill R.M. West J.D. Boldog F. Tanaka N. Robinson L.J. Smith D.I. Li F. Drabkin H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and Hrd1, a homolog of gp78. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hrd1p is required for regulated degradation of the yeast reductase isozyme HMG2p (25Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), its mammalian ortholog neither mediates regulated degradation of mammalian reductase nor binds Insig-1 (13Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To determine whether Hrd1 or Trc8 are required for degradation of Insig-1, their expression was reduced in SV-589 cells by RNAi (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the result of gp78 knockdown (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5), RNAi-mediated knockdown of Hrd1 and Trc8 did not block degradation of Insig-1 in sterol-depleted cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 6-9). Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that mRNAs for gp78, Hrd1, and Trc8 were reduced by >70% in the experiment (Fig. 3C). Inasmuch as ubiquitination and degradation of Insig-1 is blocked by sterols (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we next examined whether binding between gp78 and Insig-1 is similarly blocked by sterols. To avoid potential artifacts generated by overexpression, we analyzed SRD-14/pTK-Insig-1-Myc cells, mutant CHO cells that lack endogenous Insig-1 but stably express Myc-tagged Insig-1 at levels that are similar to those found in wild-type cells (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in the absence or presence of sterols, after which they were harvested, and Insig-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates by anti-Myc. Immunoblot analysis of the resulting immunoprecipitates revealed that a small fraction of endogenous gp78 co-immunoprecipitated with Insig-1 when the cells were cultured in the absence of sterols (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Incubation of cells with sterols increased the amount of Insig-1, but decreased the amount of gp78 co-immunoprecipitated with Insig-1 (Fig. 4A, lane 2). It should be noted that the presence of a large fraction of gp78 not bound to Insig-1 likely reflects a role for the E3 in processes unrelated to Insig-1 degradation (19Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 26Watanabe H. Carmi P. Hogan V. Raz T. Silletti S. Nabi I.R.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we found that sterol-induced binding of Scap to Insig-1 is required for sterols to block Insig-1 ubiquitination (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, an experiment was designed to determine whether Scap is required for sterol-mediated inhibition of gp78-Insig-1 complex formation. SRD-13A cells, a line of mutant CHO cells lacking Scap (28Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Scap, gp78, and T7-tagged Insig-1. The cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of sterols, after which they were harvested, lysed, and Insig-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 beads. Immunoblotting the precipitates revealed that, in the absence of Scap, gp78 was co-immunoprecipitated with Insig-1 in the absence or presence of sterols (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). Co-expression of Scap stabilized Insig-1 even in the absence of sterols (Fig. 4B, lane 5, bottom panel), and this correlated with a trace amount of Scap in the precipitate (Fig. 4B, lane 5, middle panel). In precipitates from the same cell lysates, binding between gp78 and Insig-1 was slightly inhibited (Fig. 4B, lane 5, top panel). Treatment with sterols further stabilized Insig-1 (Fig. 4B, lane 6, bottom panel); more Scap and less gp78 were co-precipitated with Insig-1 (Fig. 4B, lane 6, middle and top panels). These results indicate that sterol-mediated dissociation between gp78 and Insig-1 requires Scap, and this event correlates with stabilization of Insig-1. To further confirm that Scap binding to Insig-1 is required for the sterol-mediated inhibition of gp78-Insig-1 complex formation, we co-transfected SRD-13A cells with an expression plasmid encoding Scap(Y298C), which is defective in binding to Insig-1 (29Adams C.M. Reitz J. De Brabander J.K. Feramisco J.D. Li L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52772-52780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were cultured in the presence of sterols, and the amount of gp78 and Scap that co-immunoprecipitated with Insig-1 was determined as described in the experiments of Fig. 4B. As shown in Fig. 4C, wild-type Scap co-immunoprecipitated with Insig-1, and this interaction led to reduced binding between gp78 and Insig-1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 3-5). In contrast, Scap(Y298C) did not co-immunoprecipitate with Insig-1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 6-7) and had no effect on the amount of gp78 co-immunoprecipitated with Insig-1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 3, 6, and 7). Fig. 5 shows an experiment in which we examined the binding between gp78 and Insig-2, which is not subject to rapid degradation in the absence of sterols (12Lee J.N. Gong Y. Zhang X. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4958-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SRD-13A cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding gp78 and T7-tagged Insig-1 or Insig-2. The cells were cultured in medium containing 5% fetal calf serum prior to preparation of detergent lysates, which were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 beads to precipitate the Insig proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, Insig-1 and -2 were expressed to similar levels, and their immunoprecipitation was nearly complete (bottom two panels). Significant amounts of gp78 were co-immunoprecipitated with Insig-1 but not Insig-2 (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). Insig-2 is not ubiquitinated in SRD-13A cells because of a unique glutamate residue at position 214 (12Lee J.N. Gong Y. Zhang X. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4958-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined whether gp78 binds to the E214A mutant of Insig-2, which was shown to be ubiquitinated in SRD-13A cells (12Lee J.N. Gong Y. Zhang X. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4958-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Remarkably, gp78 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Insig-2(E214A), and the amount of gp78 co-precipitated with mutant Insig-2 was similar to that precipitated with Insig-1 (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 5). Considered together with results from a previous study (10Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the current data establish a model for sterol-regulated degradation of Insig-1 protein. The essential features of this model are diagrammed in Fig. 6. In sterol-depleted cells, Insig-1 binds to a fraction of gp78, which transfers ubiquitin to Insig-1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. This conclusion is supported by the RNAi experiments of Figs. 1, 2, 3, which show a specific requirement for gp78 in the ubiquitination and rapid degradation of Insig-1 that occurs in sterol-depleted cells. In the presence of sterols, Scap binds to Insig-1 in a reaction that displaces gp78 (Fig. 4). We propose that this displacement prevents ubiquitination of Insig-1, which results in the stabilization of the protein. Inasmuch as gp78 is not found associated with the Scap-Insig-1 complex, Scap is not ubiquitinated or degraded but rather is retained in the ER. Other fractions of Insig-1 bind to reductase in sterol-loaded cells. Insig-1 is unlikely to bind simultaneously to reductase and Scap, as indicated by observations that the two proteins compete for Insig-1 binding in sterol-treated cells (6Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Sterol-induced binding of reductase to Insig-1 does not displace gp78 (13Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As a result, the reductase becomes ubiquitinated, which leads to its rapid degradation by proteasomes (13Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Whether the fraction of Insig-1 that mediates this reaction is ubiquitinated and degraded along with HMG CoA reductase is presently unknown. Inasmuch as reductase is rapidly degraded upon sterol treatment, it is not expected to stabilize Insig-1. This is in agreement with observations that sterol-mediated stabilization of Insig-1 occurs normally in mutant CHO cells that lack reductase (data not shown). The model shown in Fig. 6 also suggests that Insig-1 could be the short-lived mediator protein that is required for the sterol-regulated degradation of HMG CoA reductase proposed 25 years ago (30Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. Chang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6174-6180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current studies, we report that the binding of gp78 to Insig-1 is prevented by sterols (Fig. 4). However, in the study that first identified gp78 as an Insig-1-associated protein, the association was found to be constitutive and not regulated by sterols (13Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We believe this discrepancy reflects differences in expression levels of Scap, Insig-1, and gp78 used in the two studies. In the current studies, Scap, Insig-1 and gp78 were expressed to levels similar to those of the endogenous proteins. Under these conditions, gp78/Insig-1 association is inhibited by sterols (Fig. 4A). A similar result can be reproduced in an overexpressed system; however, the amount of transfected plasmids encoding Scap, Insig-1, and gp78 must be carefully optimized (Fig. 4B). In the original study, Insig-1 and gp78 were overexpressed in cells, and their interaction was not inhibited by sterols (13Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We reason that endogenous Scap was not present in sufficient quantities to inhibit the binding of gp78 to Insig-1 when the cells were treated with sterols. Besides sterols, polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to inhibit proteolytic activation of SREBPs, particularly SREBP-1, with unknown mechanism (17Hannah V.C. Ou J. Luong A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4365-4372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to know whether Insig-1 can be stabilized by polyunsaturated fatty acids, and if so, whether the stabilization is mediated by dissociation of gp78 from Insig-1. In contrast to Insig-1, Insig-2 does not bind to gp78 with high affinity (Fig. 5). The lack of interaction with gp78 may account for the slower degradation of Insig-2. This is supported by results with the E214A mutant of Insig-2, which degrades at a much faster rate than wild-type Insig-2 (12Lee J.N. Gong Y. Zhang X. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4958-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and binds to gp78 (Fig. 5). If gp78 does not bind directly to Insig-2, then how does Insig-2 mediate the degradation of reductase? Insig-2 is capable of mediating complex formation between gp78 and reductase (13Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, dominant negative versions of gp78 block Insig-2-mediated degradation of reductase in transient transfection assays. We favor a scenario in which gp78 does not bind to Insig-2 alone but binds with high affinity to the reducatse-Insig-2 complex. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Insig-2 mediates degradation of reductase through the action of an unidentified E3. Future studies will be aimed toward completely resolving these issues. We thank Drs. Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein for their continued support and advice, Lisa Beatty and Marissa Hodgin for assistance in tissue culture, and Jeff Cormier for assistance in real-time PCR analysis."

These receptors cooperate in a pairwise combination to elicit or inhibit the inflammatory signals in response to certain PAMPs. The other TLRs that are evolutionarily closely related and highly homologous are TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. They are all confined to the membranes of endosomes and recognize similar molecular structures, the oligonucleotide-based PAMPs. However, the cooperative interactions among these receptors that may modulate the inflammatory signaling in response to their cognate agonists are not reported. We report here for the first time the functional effects of one TLR on the other among TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. The results indicate that TLR8 inhibits TLR7 and TLR9, and TLR9 inhibits TLR7 but not vice versa in HEK293 cells transfected with TLRs in a pairwise combination. This is concluded by selectively activating one TLR over the other by using small molecule TLR agonists. We also show that these inhibitory interactions are the result of direct or indirect physical interactions between the TLRs. The murine TLR8 that does not respond to any known human TLR8 agonists also inhibits both murine and human TLR7. The implications of the inhibitory interactions among these TLRs in host-pathogen recognition and subsequent inflammatory responses are not obvious. However, given the complexity in expression pattern in a particular cell type and the variation in distribution and response to different pathogens and stress signals in different cell types, the inhibitory physical interactions among these TLRs may play a role in balancing the inflammatory outcome from a given cell type to a specific challenge.

In vertebrates the innate immune system is a first line of defense against invading agents (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar). The innate immune system contains components conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates and includes receptors recognizing molecular structures that are highly conserved among pathogens called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). 2The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; TLR, Toll-like receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IP, immunoprecipitation; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; mDCs, myeloid dendritic cells; pDCs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells; PMA, phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate; m, murine; h, human; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. Activation of the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors by molecules derived from evolutionarily distant pathogens like bacteria, fungi, and viruses provides the necessary signals for the initiation and activation of the adaptive immune response. Thus, the innate immune system plays a critical role in triggering the activation of adaptive immune responses by promoting the presentation of antigens and up-regulation of various cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules (2Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors (TLRs), mammalian homologs of the Drosophila receptor Toll, are an integral part of the innate immune system (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar, 3Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). So far 10 different human TLRs (TLR1 to 10) have been identified (4Medzhitov R. Janeway C.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). All TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins composed of an N-terminal extracellular domain with leucinerich repeats involved in ligand (PAMP) recognition, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain largely made up of a TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor homology) domain required for downstream signaling (5Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar, 6Akira S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 78: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). While TLR1, -2, and -4–6 are involved in recognizing PAMPs associated with bacterial membranes (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar, 3Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar), TLR3 and -7–9 recognize oligonucleotide (RNA and DNA)-based molecular patterns from both bacteria and viruses (7Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Reis e Akira S. Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2757) Google Scholar, 9Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To date, the role of TLR10 has not been established, and its ligand (PAMP) has not been identified. The TLRs that recognize bacterial membrane components are confined to the plasma membrane (10O'Neill L.A.J. Science. 2004; 303: 1481-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The other TLRs that recognize oligonucleotide -based ligands are distributed to the membranes of the endosomal compartment (10O'Neill L.A.J. Science. 2004; 303: 1481-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Although most TLRs function as homodimers (or homopolymers) upon ligand binding, some ligands require cooperation of more than one TLR in activating the downstream signaling cascade. For example, in vitro studies using cotransfection of different TLRs into cells that normally do not express TLRs have confirmed that heterotypic interactions between TLR1 and TLR2, TLR2 and TLR6, and TLR4 and TLR6 are required for recognition and activation of signaling in response to triacyl lipopetides, diacyl lipopeptides, and other bacterial cell wall components (11Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 13Ozinsky A.

However, the TLR-TLR heterotypic interactions are not always activating. The heterotypic TLR1-TLR4 interactions were shown to be inhibitory to TLR4 signaling in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (18Spitzer J.H. Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Kennedy M.N. Segal D.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, certain heterotypic TLR-TLR interactions are essential not only for the recognition of a particular PAMP but may also play a regulatory role in controlling the extent of inflammatory response. The factors that may facilitate either homoor heterotypic interactions among TLR1, -2, -4, and -6 appear to be their spatial distribution (plasma membrane) (10O'Neill L.A.J.

However, there is no literature evidence suggesting either synergistic or inhibitory interactions among these TLRs. Several factors, alone or in combination, may have hindered these types of studies. The most notable are as follows: 1) the lack of agonists that selectively activate either TLR7 or TLR8, as their cognate agonist single-stranded RNAs activate both the receptors (7Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Reis e Akira S. Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2757) Google Scholar, 8Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Krischning C. Akira S. Lipford G.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) activation of either TLR7 or TLR8 by single-stranded RNA requires transfection of the agonist, and the innate immune system is known to have other intracellular molecular mechanisms that recognize RNAs and activate signaling (22Yoneyama M.

Schetter C. Krieg A.M. Wagner H. Lipford G. Bauer S. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 499Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar), thus limiting the studies to only human cells that offer very little opportunity for any genetic manipulations; and 4) in almost all instances, the cells that express TLR7 also express TLR9 (25Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B. Giese T. Endres S. Hartmann G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4531-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 28Applequist S.E. Wallin R.P. Ljunggren H.G. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the activation of either of these receptors leads to similar immunological response (29Heil F. Ahmad-Nejad P. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Gellert T. Dietrich H. Lipford G. Takeda K. Akira S. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2987-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), confounding the effects of any possible interaction of one on the other. Finally, any immune or nonimmune cells that express multiple TLRs are not suitable for comparison of the function of one TLR in the absence and presence of the other TLR. In this study, we report the effect of pairwise coexpression of TLR7 and TLR8, TLR7 and TLR9, and TLR8 and TLR9 by selectively activating one TLR over the other to understand the functional consequences of physical interactions among these TLRs. We took advantage of 3M proprietary immune response modifiers that selectively activate either TLR7 or TLR8 (9Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), and CpG-oligo (CpG-2059) (30Zhang Y. Shoda L.K. Brayton K.A. Estes D.M. Palmer G.H. Brown W.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used as a selective TLR9 agonist. HEK293 cells that do not normally express any of the TLRs and are amenable to systematic manipulation were used in this study. Cells, Reagents, and Plasmids—HEK293 cells stably transfected with NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct (HEK293-NF-κB) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. TLR7- and TLR8-selective agonists, 3M-001 and 3M-002, respectively, were made by 3M chemists (9Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). TLR4 agonist, LPS, was purchased from Sigma, and TLR2 agonist, tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-cystein (Pam-3-Cys), was purchased from Calbiochem. TLR9 agonist, CpG-2059 (5′-TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT-3′) was custom-synthesized by MWG Biotec (High Point, NC). Antibodies used in this study were obtained from different sources as follows: anti-TLR7 polyclonal antibody from U. S. Biological (Swampscott, MA), anti-TLR9 antibodies from InvivoGen (San Diego), anti-HA antibodies from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and anti-EGFP antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All the antibodies were validated for their selectivity by using total cell extracts made from HEK293 cells transfected with corresponding TLRs and tagged TLR. Luciferase reporter gene assay kits (LucLite®) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The human TLR2 and TLR4-MD2 (the DNA sequence corresponding to TLR4 and MD2 was separated by the internal ribosomal entry site), murine TLR7 (mTLR7), human TLR7, murine TLR8 (mTLR8), and human TLR8 (isoform 1), and human TLR9 expression vectors were made by ATG Laboratories (Coon Rapids, MN) for 3M Co., by cloning human or murine full-length cDNA corresponding to TLR into pCI-Neo vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The TLR8 expression vector with N-terminal HA tag was constructed by inserting the HA tag at the C-terminal end of the predicted signal peptide sequence (after 45 residues from the N-terminal end or TLR8 isoform 1) in pCI-Neo-hTLR8 clone. TLR2-CFP and TLR7-EGFP expression plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. Golenbock (University of Massachusetts, Worcester). Transient Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assay— HEK293-NF-κB cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/well in 10-cm dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 4 h, the cells were transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector encoding human or murine TLRs at 1 μg of total DNA/106 cells, and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used as transfection reagent at 1:3 DNA to FuGENE 6 (w/w ratio). In experiments where individual TLRs were transfected, 0.5 μgof the TLR DNA and 0.5 μg of control DNA (pCI-Neo vector or pCI-Neo-TLR2 plasmid DNA) were used, and in pairwise cotransfection experiments 0.5 μg of each TLR DNA was used. Twenty four hours post-transfection, 5 × 104 cells/well were transferred to 96-well flat-bottom plates. After 2 h, the cells were stimulated for 24 h with TLR agonists. TLR7- and TLR8-selective agonists, 3M-001 and 3M-002, respectively, were added from Me2SO stock solutions, and TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 agonists were added from the stocks solutions made in the culture media. The cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity using LucLite® by measuring luminescence intensity on an LMax luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The luminometer was calibrated to read relative luciferase units. Differentiation of THP1 Cells—THP1 cells were grown at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (all media reagents from BIOSOURCE), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with 10 mg/ml glucose. The day before phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment, cells were split into fresh media to ensure they were in log phase growth. The following day the cells were adjusted to 5 × 105 cells/ml in fresh medium containing 30 nm PMA (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 or 72 h. Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with fresh media. After resting for 48 or 72 h, the cells were challenged with TLR7 or TLR8 selective agonists in fresh media for 24 h. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and supernatants withdrawn for cytokine measurements (9Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Coimmunoprecipitations—Equal amounts of DNA (1 μg of total DNA/106 cells) for each TLR were cotransfected into HEK293-NF-κB cells and harvested after 24 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C) to remove the insoluble material. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblot analysis was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, using ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation experiments, cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads, and then protein concentration was determined. Cell extracts (1 mg of protein in 1 ml) were incubated with 1 μg of the antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 50 μl (packed volume) of protein A-Sepharose beads. After 1 h at room temperature, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The protein bound beads were boiled for 1 min in 2× sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis as described earlier. The immune cells that express multiple TLRs at varying levels are not amenable to the study of specific TLR-TLR functional interactions selectively. It adds more complexity to study functional interactions among TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 as they are all localized to the same intracellular compartment (10O'Neill L.A.J. Science. 2004; 303: 1481-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and expressed in different combinations in different immune cells (25Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B. Giese T. Endres S. Hartmann G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4531-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 26Ito T. Amakawa R. Fukuhara S. Hum.

Also, use of immune cells lacks the control for comparison of the function of one TLR in the absence and presence of the other TLR. As the specific protein-protein interaction studies require control over the stoichiometry of the proteins, we have used HEK293 cells, which provide an opportunity to manipulate the expression levels of one TLR over the other as they do not express any of the TLRs used in this study and are also widely used for studying the function of TLRs in general. Selective activation of either TLR7 or TLR8 is the most important aspect of this study to understand the effect of TLR-TLR physical interactions on signaling by either of the receptors while they are coexpressed. Previously, it has been shown that 3M proprietary imidazoquinolines, 3M-001 and 3M-002, selectively activate TLR7 and TLR8, respectively, as measured by NF-κB-reporter activation in TLR7 or TLR8 transiently transfected HEK293 cells and selective cytokine induction in human PBMCs (9Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Here we have used 3M-001 and 3M-002 to selectively activate TLR7 and TLR8, respectively, and CpG-2059 to activate TLR9, and we studied the effect of one TLR on the signaling (NF-κB activation) of the other TLR. TLR8 Selectively Inhibits TLR7 and TLR9, and TLR9 Selectively Inhibits TLR7—The human TLRs (TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) were cotransfected in a pairwise combination in HEK293-NF-κB cells (stably expressing NF-κB-luciferase reporter) and selectively activated one of the TLRs to see the effect of the other on the signaling by measuring the NF-κB activation. In cotransfection experiments, equal amounts (0.5 μg) of plasmid DNA corresponding to each TLR were used (total of 1 μg/106 cells). In single TLR transfection experiments, the amount of DNA corresponding to that particular TLR was the same as in cotransfection experiments. To keep the total DNA similar to that in cotransfection experiments, we have used the DNA corresponding to the control vector (pCI-Neo) alone or pCI-Neo containing the TLR2 coding sequence (pCI-Neo-TLR2). Because the use of either of the control DNA did not have any effect on the results, we continued to use the TLR2-containing vector as it provides a close stoichiometry that is comparable between single and cotransfection experiments (pCI-Neo-TLR2 expression vector length is closer to pCI-Neo-TLR7, -8 or -9 than pCI-Neo vector alone). The results of pairwise cotransfection of HEK293-NF-κB cells by TLR expression plasmids following selective activation of TLR7 by 3M-001, TLR8 by 3M-002, and TLR9 by CpG-2059 showed that TLR8 inhibits TLR7 (Fig. 1A) and TLR9 (Fig. 1F) and TLR9 inhibits TLR7 (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, TLR7 had no inhibitory effects on either TLR8 (Fig. 1B) or TLR9 (Fig. 1D), and TLR9 did not inhibit TLR8 (Fig. 1E). The stimulatory effects of TLR7 on the TLR9 response to CpG-2059 (Fig. 1D) were consistent across all the experiments. Day to day variations in the magnitude of fold increase in response to the activation of TLRs were common. Therefore, we always performed a given set of experiments (e.g. Fig. 1, A and B, as one set, C and D, as one set, and E and F as another set) together for a better comparison. The inhibition of TLR7 by TLR8 was consistently more complete compared with the inhibition of either TLR7 by TLR9 or TLR9 by TLR8 (Fig. 1, A versus C and F). The molecular basis for the inhibitory effects of TLR8 and TLR9 may be 2-fold as follows: 1) competition for downstream signaling proteins as all these TLRs share a common adaptor protein, MyD88 (31Janssens S. Beyaert R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 474-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 32Vogel S.N. Fitzgerald K.A. Fenton M.J. Mol. Interv. 2003; 3: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and the kinases, IRAK1 and IRAK4 (33Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar); and 2) direct physical interaction as all these TLRs confined to the same cellular compartment, the endosomes. If these inhibitory effects are because of the competition for the downstream signaling proteins, then the coexpression of either TLR8 or TLR9 with other TLRs of different compartment should also have similar inhibitory effects. To test this hypothesis, TLR8 or TLR9 were cotransfected with either TLR2 or TLR4-MD2 in HEK293-NF-κB cells, and the activation in response to either Pam-3-Cys (TLR2) or LPS (TLR4) was measured. The results show that TLR8 or TLR9 does not inhibit either TLR2 (Fig. 1G) or TLR4 (Fig. 1H). Previously, we showed that TLR2 (used as control plasmid in single TLR transfections to keep the amount of DNA levels similar to cotransfections) does not have any functional effects on TLR7, TLR8, or TLR9 (Fig. 1, A–F). Therefore, it is unlikely that the inhibitory effects of TLR8 (on TLR7 and TLR9) and TLR9 (on TLR7) are because of a direct competition for the downstream signaling components. Next, the adaptor proteins and the kinases are recruited to the receptor only after agonist binding, and in these experiments only one of the TLRs was selectively stimulated. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of TLR8 and TLR9 may have resulted from direct or indirect (mediated through an unknown protein) physical interactions. The Inhibitory Effects of TLR8 and TLR9 Result from Direct or Indirect Physical Interactions—If the inhibition of one TLR by the other is not a consequence of direct competition for downstream signaling proteins, then the other obvious reason is the direct or indirect physical interactions between the TLRs. If one TLR inhibits the other TLR through direct or indirect physical interactions, then the inhibition of either TLR7 or TLR9 by TLR8 and TLR7 by TLR9 should be dependent on the protein concentration of the inhibitory TLR. To this end, the cotransfection experiments were performed by systematically varying the amount of DNA corresponding to the inhibitory TLR against a fixed amount of DNA corresponding to the TLR that is inhibited while keeping the total amount of DNA constant by supplementing with a control vector (pCI-Neo-TLR2) DNA (Fig. 2). Both NF-κB activation in response to 10 μm selective TLR agonists and protein expression levels were measured. As the commercial anti-TLR8 antibodies were not of usable quality, as tested in HEK293 cells expressing TLR8, we have used N-terminal HA-tagged TLR8 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) in these experiments to measure the protein levels using anti-HA antibody. The use of HA-tagged TLR8 did not alter the results as its inhibitory effects on either TLR7 or TLR9 were comparable with untagged TLR8. The results show a good correlation between increased protein levels of either TLR8 or TLR9 resulting from increasing amounts of DNA transfected, while the protein levels of either TLR7 and TLR9, where fixed amount of DNA was transfected, remained qualitatively unchanged (Fig. 2). The increased protein levels of the inhibitory TLRs in turn showed correspondingly increased inhibitory effects (Fig. 2, A–C). The inhibitory effects of TLR8 and TLR9 are independent of the concentration (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, or 30 μm) of agonist used for the selective activation of either TLR7 or TLR9 (only data corresponding to 10 μm agonist is presented in Fig. 2). The inhibitory effects of TLR8 on TLR7 (Fig. 2A) as a function of increasing amounts of TLR8 DNA are much steeper compared with more gradual inhibitory effects of either TLR8 on TLR9 (Fig. 2B) or TLR9 on TLR7 (Fig. 2C). These results are also consistent with previous results (Fig. 1) that the inhibition of TLR7 by TLR8 is more complete than that of TLR9 by TLR8 or TLR7 by TLR9 in cotransfection experiments using equal amount of DNA corresponding to each TLR. It is interesting to note that the response of TLR8 to 3M-002 is qualitatively unchanged with increasing amounts of DNA transfected, even though there is an increase in protein expression levels. A plausible explanation for this effect is that the maximum achievable TLR8-dependent NF-κB activation in response to 3M-002 has been reached at very low protein levels of TLR8. On the other hand, in TLR7 and TLR9 coexpression studies, the inhibition of TLR7 or the activation of TLR9 is more typical, because the effects are gradual and reciprocal with increasing expression of protein as a function of increasing amounts of TLR9 DNA. Also, as noted previously (Fig. 1D), in the present DNA titration experiments the increased activation of TLR9 in the presence of TLR7 (Fig. 2C), compared with TLR9 alone, is consistent, indicating that TL"

Recently alpha1,6-fucosylation has been further reported to be very crucial by the study of alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8)-knock-out mice, which shows the phenotype of emphysema-like changes in the lung and severe growth retardation. In this study, we extensively investigated the effect of core fucosylation on alpha3beta1 integrin and found for the first time that Fut8 makes an important contribution to the functions of this integrin. The role of core fucosylation in alpha3beta1 integrin-mediated events has been studied by using Fut8(+/+) and Fut8(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts, respectively. We found that the core fucosylation of alpha3beta1 integrin, the major receptor for laminin 5, was abundant in Fut8(+/+) cells but was totally abolished in Fut8(-/-) cells, which was associated with the deficient migration mediated by alpha3beta1 integrin in Fut8(-/-) cells. Moreover integrin-mediated cell signaling was reduced in Fut8(-/-) cells. The reintroduction of Fut8 potentially restored laminin 5-induced migration and intracellular signaling. Collectively, these results suggested that core fucosylation is essential for the functions of alpha3beta1 integrin."
https://openalex.org/W2010898742,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States due, in large part, to the lack of early detection methods. Lung cancer arises from a complex series of genetic and epigenetic changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, are reversible with currently available pharmaceuticals and are early events in lung tumorigenesis detectable by non-invasive methods. In order to better understand how epigenetic changes contribute to lung cancer, and to identify new disease biomarkers, we combined pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, with genome-wide expression profiling. Of the more than 200 genes upregulated by these treatments, three of these, neuronatin, metallothionein 3 and cystatin E/M, were frequently hypermethylated and transcriptionally downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and tumors. Interestingly, four other genes, cylindromatosis, CD9, activating transcription factor 3 and oxytocin receptor, were dominantly regulated by histone deacetylation and were also frequently downregulated in lung tumors. The majority of these genes also suppressed NSCLC growth in culture when ectopically expressed. This study therefore reveals new putative NSCLC growth regulatory genes and epigenetic disease biomarkers that may enhance early detection strategies and serve as therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1992903652,"Arabidopsis PDK1 activity is regulated by binding to the lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) resulting in activation of the oxidative stress-response protein kinase OXI1/AGC2-1. Thus there is an inferred link between lipid signaling and oxidative stress signaling modules. Among a panel of hormones and stresses tested, we found that, in addition to PA, the fungal elicitor xylanase activated PDK1, suggesting that PDK1 has a role in plant pathogen defense mechanisms. The downstream OXI1 was activated by additional stress factors, including PA, H(2)O(2), and partially by xylanase. We have isolated an interacting partner of OXI1, a Ser/Thr kinase (PTI1-2), which is downstream of OXI1. Its sequence closely resembles the tomato Pti kinase, which has been implicated in the hypersensitive response, a localized programmed cell death that occurs at the site of pathogen infection. PTI1-2 is activated by the same stresses/elicitors as OXI1 and additionally flagellin. We have used RNA interference to knock out the expression of PDK1 and OXI1 and to study the effects on PTI1-2 activity. We show that specific lipid signaling pathways converge on PTI1-2 via the PDK1-OXI1 axis, whereas H(2)O(2) and flagellin signals to OXI1-PTI1-2 via a PDK1-independent pathway. PTI1-2 represents a new downstream component that integrates diverse lipid and reactive oxygen stress signals and functions closely with OXI1."

The disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domains of the ADAMs have been implicated in their function. In the case of the SVMPs, we hypothesized that these domains could function to target the metalloproteinases to key extracellular matrix proteins or cell surface proteins. Initially we detected interaction of collagen XIV, a fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices containing von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains, with the PIII SVMP catrocollastatin. Next we investigated whether other VWA domain-containing matrix proteins could support the binding of PIII SVMPs. Using surface plasmon resonance, the PIII SVMP jararhagin and a recombinant cysteine-rich domain from a PIII SVMP were demonstrated to bind to collagen XIV, collagen XII, and matrilins 1, 3, and 4. Jararhagin was shown to cleave these proteins predominantly at sites localized at or near the VWA domains suggesting that it is the VWA domains to which the PIII SVMPs are binding via their cysteine-rich domain.

The proteinase domain of all the SVMP hemorrhagic toxins is believed to function to degrade capillary basement membranes, endothelial cell surfaces, and stromal matrix ultimately causing extravasation of capillary contents into the surround stroma (5Baramova E.N. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Shannon J.D. Baramova E.N. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11575-11583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly the PIII class of SVMPs is typically much more potent in causing hemorrhage compared with the PI and PII classes that lack the cysteine-rich domain found in the PIII class (4Fox J.W. Serrano S.M.T. Toxicon. 2005; 45: 969-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) suggesting a role for this domain in the pathophysiology of the PIII hemorrhagic toxins. Indeed the disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domains of certain hemorrhagic toxins have been shown to be potent inhibitors of collagen-induced platelet aggregation as a result of interaction of the cysteine-rich domain with the α2β1 integrin on platelets (7Jia L.G. Wang X.M. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Zigrino P. Kamiguti A.S. Eble J. Drescher C. Nischt R. Fox J.W. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40528-40535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Proteolytic degradation of capillary basement membrane structures and inhibition of platelet aggregation have been considered to be the key features underlying the hemorrhagic potency of PIII SVMP hemorrhagic toxins (5Baramova E.N. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 9Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R. Theakston R.D. Zuzel M. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 627-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Similarly recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated the ability of natural disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domains processed from PIII SVMPs, as well as a recombinant cysteine-rich domain based on the structure from the PIII SVMP atrolysin A proteinase from Crotalus atrox venom, to support the interaction of the PIII SVMPs with von Willebrand factor (10Serrano S.M.T. Jia L.G. Wang D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies indicate that the non-proteinase domains, particularly the cysteine-rich domain, of the PIII SVMPs play an important role in the pathophysiology of the toxins targeting the proteinase domain to relevant substrates to promote hemorrhage. This leads to the question of whether there are conserved structural motifs in other relevant proteins that can support PIII SVMP binding and thus targeting proteolysis by the SVMPs. von Willebrand factor (VWF), a plasma and extracellular matrix protein, contains three von Willebrand factor A domains (referred to as VWA1, VWA2, and VWA3). VWA domains are involved in cell adhesion and are present in extracellular matrix proteins and in integrin receptors (11Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Among the VWA-containing proteins are the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs) that form a subclass of collagens characterized by the presence of more than one triple helical domain separated by non-triple helical segments. FACIT collagens XII (12Gordon M.K. Gerecke D.R. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and XIV (13Gordon M.K. Castagnola P. Dublet B. Linsenmayer T.F. Van der Rest M. Mayne R. Olsen B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Gerecke D.R. Foley J.W. Castagnola P. Gennari M. Dublet B. Cancedda R. Linsenmayer T.F. Van der Rest M. Olsen B.R. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12177-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have one domain that anchors the molecule to the surface of the fibril and three “finger-like” domains containing VWA-like regions (15Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Among the non-collagenous VWA-containing extracellular matrix proteins are the matrilins. Matrilins 1, 2, and 4 contain two VWA domains that flank a variable number of EGF domains, whereas in matrilin 3 the C-terminal VWA domain is missing. Matrilins are thought to play a role in the formation of fibrillar or filamentous structures associated with collagens (16Wagener R. Ehlen Harald W.A. Ko Y.-P. Kobbe B. Mann H.H. Sengle G. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3323-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the structural features of PIII SVMPs and their ability to target physiological substrates as well as to gain new insights into the mechanisms of hemorrhage production by these toxins we initially undertook in vitro studies to explore the interactome of Western diamondback rattlesnake (C. atrox) venom proteins with fibroblast cell surface- and cell surface-associated proteins. Based on our studies we now report that an extracellular matrix/cell surface-associated protein, collagen XIV, was identified as a binding partner of a PIII SVMP, catrocollastatin from C. atrox venom. The general ability of PIII SVMPs to interact with collagen XIV was confirmed using another PIII SVMP, jararhagin, isolated from Bothrops jararaca venom with surface plasmon resonance studies. This interaction phenomenon was extended to another FACIT collagen, XII, as well as the extracellular matrix proteins matrilin 1, 3, and 4, all proteins containing VWA domains. We also demonstrated that interaction of the PIII SVMPs with these proteins was mediated via the cysteine-rich domain that serves to target SVMP proteolysis to peptide bonds at or near their VWA domain-binding site in these proteins. In summary, we have identified novel binding partners/substrates for PIII SVMPs that use the cysteine-rich domain to mediate binding to substrate VWA domains and target them for proteolytic degradation. A role for collagen XII and XIV and matrilin 1, 3, and 4 degradation in SVMP-induced hemorrhage is unknown; however, given their presence in the collagenous stroma surrounding capillaries in many tissues and their role in matrix stabilization, one can speculate on their importance to capillary integrity, and thus their degradation by the hemorrhagic SVMPs may contribute to hemorrhage production via capillary destabilization. Recombinant A/C (cysteine-rich domain protein from atrolysin A) was prepared as described elsewhere (10Serrano S.M.T. Jia L.G. Wang D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); jararhagin, a PIII hemorrhagic SVMP from B. jararaca venom (17Paine M.J. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Dr. Ana M. Moura-da-Silva (Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil). Bovine collagen XII and collagen XIV were prepared as described before (18Nishiyama T. McDonough A.M. Bruns R.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28193-28199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen XII as isolated from bovine tissue represents the small splice variant. This variant lacks the first 1189 amino acid residues and starts with the third VWA domain. Native matrilin 1 was extracted from fetal bovine rib cartilage as described previously (19Mann H.H. Özbek S. Engel J. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25294-25298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); recombinant full-length matrilins 2, 3, and 4 (19Mann H.H. Özbek S. Engel J. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25294-25298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and VWA matrilin domains 4A1 and 4A2 were prepared as described previously (19Mann H.H. Özbek S. Engel J. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25294-25298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the matrilin 3 VWA domain was a kind gift from Dr. Patric Nitsche (Lund University, Lund, Sweden) and was amplified by PCR using primers that inserted an SpeI restriction site at the 5′-end and a NotI site at the 3′-end, respectively (matn3A1m forward, 5′-GCCCACTAGTTTGCAAGAGCAGGCCTTTG-3′; and matn3A1m reverse, 5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCTTAAGCACAAAAGGTTTCCTGGAATC-3′). After digestion with SpeI and NotI, the amplified cDNA fragment was inserted into the expression vector pCEP-Pu with a C-terminal His tag in-frame with the signal peptide of BM40 (20Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the matrilin 4 EGF domains was amplified by PCR using primers that inserted an SpeI restriction site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end, respectively (matn4EGFm forward, 5′-GCCCACTAGTAAAGGACCTGTGTGCTGAGTTGG-3′; and matn4EGFm reverse, 5′-CAATGGATCCCCGGTCACAGCTCTTGCC ATC-3′) and inserted into the expression vector pCEP-Pu with a C-terminal His tag in-frame with the signal peptide of BM40 (20Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). cDNA coding for the fibronectin type III domains 6–8 of mouse collagen XII was amplified by PCR using primers that introduced a NheI restriction site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end (M920, forward, AATGCTAGCCTTGAAGAACGTGGCTCACC; and M921, reverse, 2TTTGGATCCTTAAGAAGATAGAAATGGTGTCAC). The cDNA was cloned into a modified pET vector (EMD Biosciences) carrying a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site. Upon transformation with the recombinant plasmid, Escherichia coli cells (BL21) were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 16 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 7 m urea. The bacteria were sonicated followed by removal of insoluble cell debris by centrifugation. After a 2-fold dilution with H2O the supernatant was applied to a nickel-chelating Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a buffer containing 40–80 mm imidazole. Following removal of urea by dialysis, thrombin cleavage was performed overnight at room temperature (5 mm CaCl2, 1 unit/mg thrombin, Sigma), and the cleaved His6 tag was removed by loading the solution again to a nickel-chelating Sepharose column. Cell Membrane Preparations—Human HS68 fibroblasts grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum were detached from tissue culture plates by a rubber policeman, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2 and homogenized with a Polytron for 30 s at 0 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min at 0 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was resuspended and centrifuged again. The supernatant was combined with the other supernatant and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged at 82,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet representing cell membranes was resuspended with 1% (w/v) octyl β-glucoside in 85 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, and 1 mm EDTA. Following incubation at 0 °C for 30 min, the solution was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the solubilized membrane proteins were obtained in the supernatant. Cy-5 Labeling of Cell Membrane Proteins—50 μg of the fibroblast cell membrane protein preparation was incubated with 400 pmol of Cy-5 dye (GE Healthcare) in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.3, for 30 min on ice. The reaction was quenched by adding 10 mm lysine, and the labeled proteins were separated from the reaction mixture by a gel filtration spin column (GE Healthcare). Biotinylation of C. atrox Venom Proteins—3 mg of C. atrox venom (Miami Serpentarium, Punta Gorda, FL) was mixed with 150 μl of 10 mm biotin (Pierce) in PBS. Following incubation for 2 h on ice, the mixture was dialyzed for 4 h at 4°C against PBS and stored at 4 °C until use. Interaction of Biotinylated Venom Proteins and Cy-5-labeled Cell Membrane Proteins—100 μg of biotinylated venom proteins in PBS buffer was incubated with 100 μg of the Cy-5-labeled fibroblast cell membrane protein preparation for 16 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. To stabilize interacting proteins the incubation mixture was incubated with 1 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) for 2 h in ice. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against PBS for 8 h at 4°C followed by addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.5% and NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m. This was then incubated with streptavidin beads for 16 h at 4 °C with constant mixing followed by four washes with PBS binding buffer followed by elution with binding buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) followed by detection of Cy-5-labeled/biotinylated/cross-linked protein complexes using a Bio-Rad FX laser scanner using a 635 nm laser with a 690-nm band pass filter. For protein identification, protein bands visualized in the gel were excised, destained, and then in-gel digested with trypsin (22Hanna S.L. Sherman N.E. Kinter M.T. Goldberg J.B. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 95-2508Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a Finnigan LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer system (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) with a Protana nanospray ion source interfaced to a self-packed 8-cm (75-μm-inner diameter) Phenomenex Jupiter 10-μm C18 reverse phase capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA). Volumes of 0.5–5 μl of extract were injected, and the peptides were eluted from the column by an acetonitrile, 0.1 m acetic acid gradient at a flow rate of 0.25 μl/min. The nanospray ion source was operated at 2.8 kV. The digest was analyzed using the double play capability of the instrument acquiring full scan spectra to determine peptide Mr and product ion spectra to determine amino acid sequence in sequential scans. The data were analyzed by data base searching using the Sequest search algorithm. Surface Plasmon Resonance Assays—Protein-protein interactions were assessed by surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore™ 3000 system. Collagen XII or collagen XIV was covalently immobilized on the BIAcore CM-5 sensorchip (carboxylated dextran matrix) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly the CM-5 chip was activated with a 1:1 mixture of 75 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 11.5 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimide for 7 min. Collagen XII or collagen XIV (200 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5) was injected over an activated CM-5 chip for 10 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. Remaining active groups on the matrix were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine HCl at pH 8.5. Immobilization of collagen XII and collagen XIV on CM-5 sensorchip resulted in average surface concentrations of 13 and 15 ng/mm2, respectively. Protein solutions of jararhagin (31.5–2000 nm) and A/C (2.34–300 nm) were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20 (v/v) and injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Full-length matrilins 1, 2, 3, and 4 or matrilin VWA domains 3A1, 4A1, and 4A2 were immobilized by injecting the protein (200 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5) over activated CM-5 chips for 7 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C, resulting in surface concentrations of 3.18, 3.41, 5.3, 9.35, 6.5, 6.15, and 5.79 ng/mm2, respectively. Protein solutions of the recombinant protein A/C (2.81–180 nm) were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 and injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Collagen XII fibronectin type III domains 6–8 (50 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5) or matrilin 4 EGF domains (10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5) were immobilized by injecting the protein solution over activated CM-5 chips for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25 °C, resulting in surface concentrations of 0.9 and 0.67 ng/mm2, respectively. A solution of 5 μm jararhagin was prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 and injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The nonlinear fitting of association and dissociation curves according to a 1:1 model was used for the calculation of kinetic constants (Biaevaluation software version 3.1). Individual experiments were performed a minimum of six times. 4 μg of collagen XII or XIV was incubated with 0.4 μg of jararhagin for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2 as were controls of collagen and jararhagin alone. Reactions were stopped by addition of 20 mm EDTA and freezing prior to electrophoresis on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis the gels were stained overnight with SYPRO Ruby (Bio-Rad). Gels were scanned with a Bio-Rad FX imager, and molecular weights were estimated from the markers using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. To identify sites of digestion, 20 μg of collagen was incubated with 2 μg of jararhagin as described above, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue. For blotting, the gel was placed in a Transphor apparatus (GE Healthcare), and proteins were transferred at 0.4 A (3.17 mA/cm2) for 1.5 h at a maximum of 100 V to 0.2-μm pore polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems) using 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine at 10 °C. After staining the membrane with Coomassie Blue the membrane was scanned using a Bio-Rad GS-800 scanner, and bands of interest were excised for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. After washing the membrane slices with 20% methanol, the bands were sequenced in an Applied Biosystems 494 Procise sequencer using the manufacturer's pulsed liquid polyvinylidene difluoride cycles. The C termini of the digested collagens were localized by estimation based on their identified N termini, the estimated molecular mass of the fragment from gel electrophoresis, and the published sequences of these proteins using the ExPASy protein Compute pI/Mw tool. The figure presented is representative of a minimum of three such experiments. Fibroblasts were isolated from newborn mouse skin according to established procedures (23Zhang Z.G. Bothe I. Hirche F. Zweers M. Gullberg D. Pfitzer G. Krieg T. Eckes B. Aumailley M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1886-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 with Glutamax™ (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 250 μm l-ascorbic acid, and 450 μm l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. Subconfluent cells were transferred to serum-free medium for 12 h followed by addition of jararhagin to a final concentration of 117 or 233 nm and incubated for 1.5 or 4 h at 37 °C. The conditioned medium was supplemented with 20 mm EDTA and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science), centrifuged at low speed to remove cell debris, and used for Western blot analysis. For detection of collagen XII affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-collagen XII (24Veit G. Hansen U. Keene D.R. Bruckner P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Chiquet M. Koch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27461-27470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used. Due to the lack of sufficient amounts of matrilin 1 and the lack of observed binding of A/C to matrilin 2, proteolysis experiments were performed with only matrilins 3 and 4. In these experiments 3 μg of matrilin 3 or 2.5 μg of matrilin 4 was incubated with 0.3 μg and 0.25 μg of jararhagin, respectively, for 180 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2 as were controls of matrilins and jararhagin alone. Reactions were stopped by freezing at –80 °C before electrophoresis on 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels that were stained overnight with SYPRO Ruby (Bio-Rad). Gels were scanned with a Bio-Rad FX imager, and molecular weights were estimated using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. As in the case of the collagens, the C termini of the proteolysis products were estimated based on their identified N termini, their molecular masses from gel electrophoresis, and their published sequences. The figure presented is representative of a minimum of three such experiments. Identification of C. atrox Venom Protein-Fibroblast Membrane-associated Protein Complexes—The concept behind this experiment was to attempt to identify novel venom protein-cell surface-associated protein interactions. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, the approach was to label venom proteins with biotin and fibroblast cell surface-associated proteins with the fluorescent dye Cy-5. Following mixture of the two preparations protein-protein interactions were stabilized by chemical cross-linking. The labels on these proteins were then exploited such that when the mixture was passed through a streptavidin bead column only proteins and protein complexes with biotin tags (via labeled venom proteins) would be retained. Following elution of the column and electrophoresis via SDS-PAGE detection of Cy-5-tagged protein would be indicative of cross-linked protein complexes containing both cell membrane-associated and venom proteins (supplemental Fig. 1). All fluorescent bands were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, and the band indicated with the arrow in supplemental Fig. 1 contained peptides derived from both the C. atrox PIII SVMP, catrocollastatin ((I/L)PCAPEDVK), and the FACIT collagen XIV (TNQ(L/I)(I/L)(L/I)QNT). Interaction of the PIII SVMP Jararhagin and the Recombinant Cys-rich Domain from the PIII SVMP Atrolysin A with Collagens XII and XIV—Our aim with these studies was to investigate further the interaction of class PIII SVMPs with the FACIT collagens and to localize the interaction domain on the PIII SVMPs. For this purpose, jararhagin, a PIII SVMP from B. jararaca venom, and a recombinant cysteine-rich domain (A/C) of atrolysin A from C. atrox venom were assayed to assess their ability to bind to collagens XII and XIV, both containing VWA domains, using surface plasmon resonance. As observed in Fig. 1, both jararhagin (Fig. 1, A and B) and the recombinant cysteine-rich domain A/C (Fig. 1, C and D) were capable of interacting with immobilized collagens XII and XIV, respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. The kinetics of these interactions are shown in Table 1. Interestingly the recombinant PIII cysteine-rich domain A/C demonstrated significantly stronger interaction to collagens XII and XIV than did the full-length SVMP jararhagin. In another interaction assay using surface plasmon resonance jararhagin showed no binding to recombinant collagen XII fibronectin type III domains 6–8 indicating that the interactions with FACIT collagens are mediated by the VWA domains present in collagens XII and XIV (not shown).TABLE 1Kinetic evaluation of the interaction of jararhagin and A/C (recombinant cysteine-rich domain of PIII SVMP atrolysin A) with collagens XII and XIV immobilized on CM-5 sensorchip in the BIAcore 3000 systemAnalyteLigand on chipKDka (×106)kd (×10-3)nmm-1s-1s-1JararhaginCollagen XII2850.02186.2JararhaginCollagen XIV2540.007541.92A/CCollagen XII5.310.2111.12A/CCollagen XIV9.370.1141.07 Open table in a new tab Interaction of the Recombinant Cysteine-rich Domain of Atrolysin A (A/C) with Full-length Matrilins—To extend the possibility that other PIII SVMPs containing cysteine-rich domains could bind to VWA domain-containing matrix proteins we assayed the ability of the recombinant C. atrox A/C protein from atrolysin A to bind to matrilins 1–4. As seen in Fig. 2, A/C was capable of binding to matrilins 1, 3, and 4 in a concentration-dependent manner. No binding was observed between A/C and matrilin 2. The kinetics of these interactions are shown in Table 2. The binding of A/C to matrilins 1, 3, and 4 was all in the nanomolar range; however, the interaction with matrilins 1 and 3 was ∼8 times stronger than with matrilin 4. No binding was detected when we tested the interaction of jararhagin with a recombinant protein corresponding to the matrilin 4 EGF domains (not shown).TABLE 2Kinetic evaluation of the interaction of A/C with full-length matrilins and matrilin VWA domains immobilized on CM-5 sensorchip in the BIAcore 3000 systemLigand on chipKDka (×106)kd (×10-3)nmm-1 s-1s-1Matrilin 14.641.614.48Matrilin 2N.D.Matrilin 33.651.535.58Matrilin 3 A1 domain2.581.403.63Matrilin 435.90.196.77Matrilin 4 A1 domain22.90.143.08Matrilin 4 A2 domain14.80.162.29 Open table in a new tab Interaction of the Recombinant Cysteine-rich Domain of Atrolysin"
https://openalex.org/W2056351159,"Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 tumor suppressor proteins have been shown to negatively regulate cell growth through inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in integrin signaling. Here we identify a novel interaction between FAK and TSC2 and show that TSC2 is phosphorylated by FAK. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of FAK kinase dead mutant inhibits the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1, two key mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) downstream targets, and negatively regulates the cell size and that FAK regulation of S6K phosphorylation is through TSC2. Finally, we provide data that FAK plays a positive role in cell adhesion-induced S6K phosphorylation, whereas TSC2 is required for cell suspension-induced S6K inactivation. Together, these results suggest that FAK might regulate S6K activation and cell size through its interaction with and phosphorylation of TSC2 and also provide a previously unappreciated role of TSC2 in the regulation of mTOR signaling by cell adhesion.

TSC1 and TSC2 are both tumor suppressor genes responsible for tuberous sclerosis, which is characterized by the formation of hamartomas in a wide range of tissues (4Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2003; 67: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). TSC1 and TSC2 contain coiled-coil regions and can form a physical and functional complex in vivo (7Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M.

Recent studies have shown that TSC1·TSC2 complex functions as a potent negative regulator of cell growth mainly by their inhibition of mTOR and its targets ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein-1 (4EBP-1), which play essential roles in the regulation of protein synthesis and cell size (9Potter C.J.

Lamb R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation plays critical roles in the regulation of signal transduction. TSC2 initially was shown to undergo both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation in response to various stimuli (16Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies identified multiple serine/threonine kinases capable of phosphorylating TSC2 and regulating its function in mTOR signaling, including Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (13Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar, 17Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol.

Cell. 2005; 121: 179-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). However, the tyrosine kinase responsible for TSC2 tyrosine phosphorylation has not been reported so far. Cell adhesion signaling has been shown to play key roles in a number of important cellular processes, including cell migration, cell survival, cell proliferation, and cell growth (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 22Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). In contrast to our extensive understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cell migration, cell survival, and cell proliferation through cell adhesion signaling, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which cell adhesion regulates cell growth. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a 125-kDa protein-tyrosine kinase that plays a major role in cell adhesion-mediated signal transduction. Numerous studies have shown that FAK functions to regulate cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, cell proliferation, and cell survival through its interaction with and phosphorylation of other downstream signaling molecules (23Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 24Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). FAK has also been shown to play a role in cell adhesion-stimulated S6K activation, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown (25Malik R.K. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29785-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In an effort to further explore potential mechanisms of FAK regulation of S6K activation and cell size, we searched for other FAK-interacting proteins involved in the regulation of cell size. In this study we show a novel interaction between FAK and TSC2. We show that TSC2 could be phosphorylated by FAK in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of FAK kinase dead mutant inhibits the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP-1 and negatively regulates the cell size and that FAK regulation of S6K phosphorylation is through TSC2. Finally, we provide evidence that FAK plays a role in cell adhesion-induced S6K phosphorylation, whereas TSC2 is required for cell suspension-induced S6K inactivation. Antibodies and Reagents—Affinity-purified antibody against GST was prepared from anti-GST serum using GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose as an affinity matrix. The mouse monoclonal FAK antibody, the mouse monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), and the rabbit polyclonal FAK site-specific antibody against phosphorylated Tyr-397 (PY397) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The rabbit polyclonal α-HA (Y11) antibody, the mouse monoclonal α-c-Myc tag (9E10) antibody, rabbit polyclonal TSC2 antibody, rabbit polyclonal α-FAK (C20) antibody, and rabbit polyclonal S6K antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal Thr-389 phospho-S6K, rabbit polyclonal S6, rabbit polyclonal Ser-240/244 phospho-S6, rabbit polyclonal 4EBP-1, and rabbit polyclonal Thr-37/46 phospho-4E-BP1 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-HA-conjugated agarose beads, glutathione-agarose beads, protein A-Sepharose, human plasma fibronectin (FN), and mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid DNA Construction—HA-tagged expression vectors pKH3, pKH3-FAK, pKH3-FAK-Y397F, pKH3-FAK-kd (kinase dead), pKH3-NT-FAK, pKH3-KD-FAK (kinase domain), pKH3-CT-FAK, pKH3-KC-FAK, Myc-tagged expression vector pHAN, pHAN-FAK, GST-tagged expression vector pDHGST, and pDHGST-FAK have been described previously (35Cooper L.A.

TSC2 609–1080-amino acid segment was amplified by primers 5′-CCCATCGATTTAGGCCCCACGGGACACCTGCTGCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCAGCATCCGGCTGCAGGCCTTTGAC-3′ (reverse), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated with pKH3 digested with the same enzymes to generate pKH3-TSC2 609–1080. pKH3-TSC2 609–1080 was then digested by ClaI and filled in by Klenow enzyme followed by BamHI digestion to release TSC2 609–1080 segment, which was ligated into pGEX2T digested by BamHI and SmaI to generate pGEX2T-TSC2 609–1080. The RNAi vector pBS-U6 is a gift from Y. Shi (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Construction of TSC2 RNAi vector was achieved in two separate steps as previously described (38Gan B. Melkoumian Z.K. Wu X. Guan K.L. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 22-nucleotide oligo (oligo 1) was first inserted into the pBS-U6 vector digested with ApaI (blunted) and HindIII. The inverted motif that contained the 6-nucleotide spacer and 5 T residues (oligo 2) was then subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the intermediate plasmid to generate pBS-U6-TSC2. The sequence of oligo1 is 5′-GGCAGATTTGTGAAGTCGCAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTTTTGCGACTTCACAAATCTGCC-3′ (reverse); the sequence of oligo2 is 5′-AGCTTTTGCGACTTCACAAATCTGCCCTTTTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTCAAAAAGGGCAGATTTGTGAAGTCGCAAA-3′ (reverse). The RNAi targeting sequences were all analyzed by BLAST search to ensure that they did not have significant sequence homology with other genes. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Adenovirus Infection—The TSC2–/– LEF cells that stably express either TSC2 (TSC2–/– + TSC2 cells) or an empty vector (TSC2–/– + VEC cells) were generous gifts from Dr. Kun-Liang Guan of University of Michigan and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS containing 0.5 mg/ml G418, as previously described (18Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar). SYF cells were generous gifts from Drs. L. Cary, R. Klinghoffer, and P. Soriano of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. The FAK KO MEFs were a generous gift of Dr. D. Ilic (University of California, San Franscisco) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. 293T cells and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids as indicated using Lipofectamine™ following the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were conducted 24–48 h after transfection. The recombinant adenoviruses encoding FAK kinase dead mutant (Ad-FAK kd), RNAi adenoviruses Ad-FAK RNAi, and Ad-Control RNAi were used as previously described (39Wu X. Gan B. Yoo Y. Guan J.L. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 40Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cells were infected by Ad-FAK kd or Ad-GFP for 36 h before the experiments and infected by Ad-FAK RNAi or Ad-Control RNAi for 72 h before the experiments. For FN replating experiment, the growing cells were briefly trypsinized, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and held in suspension for 60 min. Indicated cells were lysed. Cells replated on FN were added to plates coated with 10 μg/ml FN for different periods of time as indicated. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For most experiments subconfluent cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). For experiments to detect in vivo phosphorylation of TSC2, 0.5 mm pervanadate was used in lysis buffer instead of sodium vanadate as phosphatase inhibitor. Briefly, 500 mm sodium vanadate was mixed with 500 mm H2O2 (1:1) and incubated at room temperature for 10–15 min before adding to lysis buffer (1:250 dilution). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, and total protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating cell lysates with HA-conjugated agarose beads or glutathione-agarose beads for more than 3 h at 4 °C. To detect endogenous protein-protein interaction, immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating cell lysates with appropriate antibodies as indicated for more than 3 h at 4 °C followed by incubation for another 3 h with protein A-Sepharose. After washing 3–5 times with lysis buffer, immune complexes were resolved using SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as a secondary antibody and the Amersham Biosciences ECL system for detection. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Binding Assays—GST-TSC2 609–1080 fusion proteins were purified and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated with recombinant His-tagged FAK in 300 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for more than 3 h at 4°C. The samples were then washed five times with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST and anti-FAK antibody. Cell Size Assay—To determine cell size and DNA content, FACS analysis with Cell Quest software was performed as previously described (18Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar, 38Gan B. Melkoumian Z.K. Wu X. Guan K.L. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells grown in 60-mm plates were transfected with various expression vectors. The next day the confluent cells were split in 10-cm dishes (1:4 split). The cultured medium was changed every 24 h until confluent. The cells usually became confluent for harvest after 2–3 days. To harvest cells, plates were washed once with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min in 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA. Cells were gently pipetted off the plate with PBS, 10% FBS, transferred to 15-ml conical tubes, centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 rpm, and washed once with PBS, 1% FBS, and the final cells pellets were resuspended with 1 ml of PBS, 1% FBS. Resuspended cells were fixed on ice by adding 3 ml of cold 100% ethanol (75% final) while vortexing. Fixed cells were stored at 4 °C until the time of analysis. Immediately before analysis on FACS, the fixed cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min, washed once with PBS, 1% FBS, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 100 μg/ml RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 20–30 min. The cells were stained by propidium iodide for FACS analysis to determine the cells size in G1-phase and G2/M-phase populations. For MEF cells size analysis, completely trypsinized cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish at 20% confluency and then cultured with DMEM, 10% FBS to 90% confluency. The cells were analyzed by FACS as described above. Association of FAK with TSC2—To investigate a potential interaction between FAK and TSC2, we first co-transfected the vector encoding Myc-tagged FAK with HA-tagged TSC2 or HA empty vector into 293T cells. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. Fig. 1A shows that Myc-FAK was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-TSC2 but not detected in the immunoprecipitates of control lysates from cells co-transfected with HA empty vector. We could also detect TSC2 in FAK immunoprecipitates by reciprocal IP. As shown in Fig. 1B, the vector encoding GST-tagged TSC2 and HA-tagged FAK or HA empty vector were co-transfected into 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation by anti-HA antibody. GST-TSC2 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with HA-FAK but not detected in the immunoprecipitates of control lysates from cells co-transfected with HA empty vector. Consistent with these transfection studies, we could also detect the interaction of endogenous FAK and TSC2 in NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, FAK was detected in anti-TSC2 immunoprecipitates from attached cells but not suspended cells. Together, these results suggest that TSC2 could interact with FAK in vivo. It has been shown that TSC1 and TSC2 form a stable complex in vivo (7Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. van den Snell R. Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 8Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether FAK could also interact with TSC1. We co-transfected vector encoding GST-tagged FAK or GST empty vector into 293T cells with vectors encoding Myc-TSC1 and HA-TSC2, either individually or in combination. Fig. 1D shows that FAK could coimmunoprecipitate with TSC2 regardless of TSC1 co-expression (lanes 1 and 3). TSC1 could also be detected in FAK immunoprecipitates when TSC2 was co-expressed (lane 1). However, FAK did not apparently interact with TSC1 without TSC2 co-expression (lane 2). These data suggest that FAK could form a ternary complex with both TSC1 and TSC2 and that FAK indirectly interacts with TSC1 through its association with TSC2. Characterization of the Binding Regions in FAK and TSC2—To determine the TSC2 binding site on FAK, we co-expressed a GST-tagged TSC2 vector with the vector encoding HA-tagged wild-type FAK or various FAK mutants (Fig. 2A) in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed with an anti-HA antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-GST antibody. Fig. 2C shows that, as expected, TSC2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-FAK. TSC2 was also co-immunoprecipitated with FAK Y397F and kd (kinase dead) mutants, suggesting that neither tyrosine 397 phosphorylation nor kinase activity of FAK is required for FAK association with TSC2. Further mapping experiments by using several FAK truncation mutants demonstrated that FAK KD (kinase domain) and KC domain associated with TSC2, whereas FAK NT domain and CT domain showed no binding to TSC2 (Fig. 2, A and C). These results suggest that the kinase domain of FAK mediates its interaction with TSC2. A similar strategy was used to define the FAK binding region within TSC2 by co-expression of Myc-tagged FAK vector with the vector encoding various HA-tagged TSC2 truncation mutants (Fig. 2B) in 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitations with anti-HA antibodies. As showed in Fig. 2D, TSC2 1081–1765 fragment, which contains Rheb-GAP domain, did not apparently interact with FAK, whereas TSC2 1–1080 fragment could interact with FAK as well as full-length and the 1–1320 fragment of TSC2, suggesting that Rheb-GAP domain in TSC2 is neither sufficient nor required for TSC2 interaction with FAK. Furthermore, TSC2 1–608 fragment showed no obvious interaction with FAK (Fig. 2, B and D). Thus, these results suggest that 609–1080 amino acids of TSC2 are required for TSC2 interaction with FAK. Last, we found that His-tagged recombinant FAK protein was sufficient to bind to recombinant GST fusion protein containing TSC2 609–1080 amino acids, but not GST alone, in vitro (Fig. 2E), suggesting that 609–1080 amino acids of TSC2 mediates a direct interaction between FAK and TSC2. FAK Phosphorylation of TSC2—The identification of the interaction between FAK and TSC2 raises the possibility of tyrosine phosphorylation of TSC2 by FAK. To determine whether TSC2 serves as a phosphorylation substrate for FAK, we co-transfected HA-tagged TSC2 vector with Myc-tagged FAK, Myc-tagged FAK kinase dead mutant (FAK kd), or Myc empty vector into 293T cells. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. We observed that TSC2 could be phosphorylated by WT FAK, but not by FAK kd mutant, suggesting that TSC2 serves as a phosphorylation substrate for FAK in vivo (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, overexpression of FAK kd mutant even decreased the basal phosphorylation level of TSC2 (Fig. 3A). Because FAK kd interacted with TSC2 as efficiently as FAK WT (see Fig. 2B), FAK kd mutant might function as a dominant negative mutant to compete with endogenous FAK for interaction with TSC2 and, thus, decreased the basal phosphorylation level of TSC2. Finally, phosphorylation of TSC2 by FAK was also observed in SYF cells that are deficient in the expression of Src family kinases Src, Yes, and Fyn (26Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B), suggesting that phosphorylation of TSC2 by FAK is independent of the Src family kinases. FAK Regulation of S6K Phosphorylation and Cell Size through TSC2—Recent studies have shown that TSC1·TSC2 complex negatively regulates cell size through inhibition of mTOR-S6K pathway (9Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T. Cell. 2001; 105: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 15Jaeschke A. Hartkamp J. Saitoh M. Roworth W. Nobukuni T. Hodges A. Sampson J. Thomas G. Lamb R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that overexpression of FAK-related non-kinase inhibited cell adhesion-mediated activation of S6K, suggesting that FAK might play a role in cell adhesion-mediated activation of S6K (25Malik R.K. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29785-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that FAK might regulate S6K phosphorylation through TSC2. To examine this possibility, 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged wild-type FAK, FAK kd mutant, or empty vector along with the vector encoding HA-tagged S6K. Cell lysates were then prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Thr-389-phosphorylated S6K to determine its activation state. We found that, although overexpression of wild-type FAK did not significantly affect S6K phosphorylation in these cells (data not shown), overexpression of FAK kd decreased S6K phosphorylation, consistent with its dominant negative effect on TSC2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the result on S6K phosphorylation, we also found that overexpression of FAK kd decreased phosphorylation of 4EBP-1, another target of mTOR, in 293T cells (Fig. 4B). To investigate whether FAK plays any role in cell size control, 293T cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding FAK kd or an empty vector control, and the effects on cell size were then measured by determining the mean forward scatter (mean FSC-H) with a flow cytometer. Fig. 4C shows that overexpression of FAK kd in these cells led to a left-shift of the mean FSC-H distribution compared with the empty vector-transfected cells, which corresponds to a decrease in the size of the FAK kd-transfected populations of cells. Quantification of the data indicated a ∼5% decrease in the average cell size in the FAK kd-transfected 293T cells (Fig. 4D). Consistent with this, we also found decreased cell size in FAK KO MEFs compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 4, E and F). To determine whether FAK regulation of S6K phosphorylation is through TSC2 or not, we generated TSC2 RNAi vector pBS-U6 TSC2, which could significantly down-regulate the endogenous TSC2 protein level in 293T cells (Fig. 5A). 293T cells were then transfected with the expression vector encoding FAK kd and TSC2 RNAi vector pBS-U6 TSC2, either individually or in combination, and S6K phosphorylation was then tested. Fig. 5A shows that, although overexpression of FAK kd decreased S6K phosphorylation (compare lanes 1 and 2), the negative effect on S6K phosphorylation by FAK kd was abolished under TSC2 knock-down condition (compare lanes 3 and 4). To further test the functional relationship between FAK and TSC2, we overexpressed FAK kd via adenoviral infection in TSC2–/– LEF cells that stably express either TSC2 (TSC2–/– + TSC2 cells) or an empty vector (TSC2–/– + VEC cells). Fig. 5B shows that overexpression of FAK kd caused a reduction in endogenous S6K phosphorylation in TSC2 reexpressing cells but not in TSC2–/– cells. Finally, Fig. 5C shows that overexpression of FAK KD (which is capable of interacting with TSC2), but not NT domain (which does not interact with TSC2), functioned as a dominant negative mutant to suppress S6K phosphorylation. Collectively, these results suggest that FAK functions upstream of TSC2 to regulate S6K phosphorylation and that FAK up-regulates mTOR signaling and cell size potentially through its interaction with and phosphorylation of TSC2. The Roles of FAK and TSC2 in the Regulation of S6K Phosphorylation by Cell Adhesion—We further examined whether FAK plays any physiological role in the regulation of S6K phosphorylation by cell adhesion signaling, as a number of studies have showed that FAK can be potently activated by cell adhesion, which can also promote S6K phosphorylation (23Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 25Malik R.K. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29785-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We, thus, examined the effect of S6K phosphorylation by cell adhesion upon endogenous FAK knock-down by FAK RNAi. HeLa cells were infected with adenoviruses Ad-FAK RNAi or Ad-Control RNAi. Cell lysates were prepared from suspended cells or cells replated on fibronectins for different periods of time and followed by Western blotting with phospho-S6K. Fig. 6A shows that cell adhesion-induced S6K phosphorylation was attenuated in FAK RNAi-treated cells compared with control RNAi-treated cells. We further examined whether overexpression of FAK WT or kinase dead mutant would have any effect on S6K phosphorylation under cell suspension and adhesion conditions. Fig. 6B shows that overexpression of FAK kinase dead mutant suppressed the cell adhesion-induced S6K phosphorylation. Interestingly, overexpression of FAK wild type increased S6K phosphorylation under suspension conditions, although it did not affect S6K phosphorylation during cell adhesion. Taken together, our results suggest that FAK plays a positive role in cell adhesion-induced S6K phosphorylation. TSC2 has been shown to function as the integration point to receive signaling from several stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, intracellular energy levels, and hypoxia, to regulate S6K phosphorylation (11Gao X.

Our observation that FAK plays a positive role in cell adhesion-induced S6K phosphorylation suggests that TSC2 might play a role in S6K inactivation by cell suspension. We, thus, compared S6K phosphorylation in TSC2–/– + TSC2 cells or TSC2–/– + VEC cells upon cell suspension. Fig. 6C shows that cell suspension treatment caused a dramatic decrease in S6K phosphorylation in TSC2 reexpressing (TSC2–/– + TSC2) cells; however, this effect was largely abolished in TSC2–/– cells. Similarly, we found that cell suspension down-regulated S6 and 4EBP-1 phosphorylation in TSC2 reexpressing cells but failed to decrease S6 and 4EBP-1 phosphorylation in TSC2–/– cells (Fig. 6C). Together, these results strongly suggest that TSC2 plays an important role in cell suspension-induced S6K inactivation. FAK is an important mediator of signal transduction pathways initiated by integrins in cell migration, survival, and cell cycle regulation (23Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 24Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). Here we provide several lines of evidence to suggest that FAK also plays an important role in cell size control. First, overexpression of FAK kd mutant inhibits the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP-1 and decreases cell size in 293T cells. Second, FAK regulation of S6K activation is abolished in TSC2 knock-down or knock-out background. Our study, thus, strongly suggests that FAK functions upstream of TSC2 and mTOR to regulate S6K activation and cell size. In addition, we show that FAK plays a positive role in cell adhesion-induced S6K phosphorylation, whereas TSC2 is required for cell suspension-induced S6K inactivation. Finally, we identify a novel cell adhesion-dependent interaction between FAK and TSC2 and show that TSC2 could be phosphorylated by FAK. Importantly, we show that the association of FAK KD and NT domains with TSC2 correlated with their ability to regulate S6K phosphorylation, suggesting that FAK regulates cell size possibly through its interaction with and phosphorylation of TSC2. Taken together, our data together suggest the following model. In suspended cells, because FAK is inactivated, FAK-mediated inhibition of TSC2 is relieved, and TSC2 functions to suppress S6K phosphorylation and cell growth. Cell adhesion activates FAK and promotes FAK-TSC2 interaction; activated FAK then inactivates TSC2 through its interaction with TSC2, which lead to increased S6K phosphorylation and cell growth. This model also explains our findings that TSC2 is required for kd FAK inhibition of S6K phosphorylation in adhered cells and that TSC2 is required for the decrease in S6K phosphorylation upon cell suspension. It has been shown that integrin-mediated cell adhesion stimulated S6K phosphorylation and that overexpression of FAK-related non-kinase caused a significant reduction in the integrin-mediated activation of S6K, suggesting that FAK might play a role in cell adhesion-mediated S6K activation (25Malik R.K. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29785-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which FAK regulates S6K activation was not addressed in the study. Furthermore, because S6K activation has also been shown to play an important role in other cellular processes, such as cell proliferation (1Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether FAK-mediated S6K activation plays any role in cell size control. Our study presented here is consistent with the previous observation and also provides several novel mechanistic insights about FAK function in the regulation of cell size. A number of recent studies have shown that TSC1·TSC2 complex functions to negatively regulate cell size by their inhibition of mTOR and its targets S6K and 4E-BP1 (9Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T.

Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 18Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L.

Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2893-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Our study here showed for the first time that TSC2 also plays a critical role in the regulation of S6K phosphorylation by cell adhesion signaling. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion signaling has been shown to play a critical role in a number of biological processes, including angiogenesis (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 22Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Although most studies have focused on the roles of integrin-regulated cell survival, proliferation, and migration pathways in angiogenesis, recent studies have begun to reveal the potential role of protein synthesis and cell growth in the regulation of angiogenesis by integrin signaling. For example, it has been shown that tumstatin, a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, specifically inhibits mTOR signaling and cap-dependent protein synthesis in vascular endothelial cells through tumstatin interaction with integrin αVβ3, which might mediate the anti-angiogenic function of tumstatin (29Maeshima Y. Sudhakar A. Lively J.C. Ueki K. Kharbanda S. Kahn C.R. Sonenberg N. Hynes R.O. Kalluri R. Science. 2002; 295: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It is possible that the dysregulation of cell adhesion-mediated angiogenesis might play a role in pathobiology of tuberous sclerosis. Intriguingly, TSC patients develop cutaneous angiofibromas and renal angiomyolipomas, and TSC1, TSC2 heterozygous mice develop liver hemangiomas, all of which are highly vascular (4Kwiatkowski D.J.

The molecular mechanisms by which the function of TSC is modified by various stimuli to regulate cell size have been extensively studied recently. Most studies indicate that phosphorylation of TSC2 by other kinases plays a major role in the regulation of TSC function. For example, it has been shown that TSC1·TSC2 complex could be regulated by growth factor signaling through TSC2 phosphorylation by Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1, whereas AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation plays a major role in TSC regulation by energy level deprivation (13Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar, 17Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol.

Cell. 2005; 121: 179-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Furthermore, anisomycin-induced TSC2 phosphorylation is mediated by TSC2 phosphorylation by MK2, although the functional significance of this phosphorylation is not clear (34Li Y. Inoki K. Vacratsis P. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13663-13671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although the initial study indicated that TSC2 could undergo both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation (16Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), all the TSC2 kinases identified so far are serine/threonine kinases, and the tyrosine kinase(s) responsible for TSC2 tyrosine phosphorylation remains unknown. Here we show that TSC2 can be phosphorylated by FAK through its interaction with FAK. This is the first study to identify the tyrosine kinase, which can phosphorylate TSC2. The molecular mechanisms by which FAK regulates TSC2 function are not clear at present. Previous studies suggested that TSC1·TSC2 complex formation is critical for its function (7Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. van den Snell R. Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 8Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar). However, we find that neither FAK overexpression nor FAK knock-down affects TSC1·TSC2 interaction, suggesting that FAK might not play a role in the regulation of TSC1·TSC2 complex formation. Currently it is tempting to speculate that FAK phosphorylation of TSC2 might negatively regulate TSC2 GAP activity toward Rheb, thus promoting S6K activation. It would be interesting to identify the phosphorylation sites in TSC2 by FAK and study the functional significance of FAK-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation in our future study.

Here we report that, in addition to its inverse agonistic activities, Agrp exhibits agonistic properties on the endocytosis pathway of melanocortin receptors. Sustained exposure of human embryonic kidney 293 cells to Agrp induced endocytosis of the MC3R or the MC4R. The extent and kinetics of Agrp-promoted MCR endocytosis were similar to the endocytosis induced by melanocortins. Using the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technique, we further showed that after binding of Agrp both MCRs interacted with β-arrestins. In line with this observation, in COS-7 cells co-expression of β-arrestins enhanced Agrp-induced MCR endocytosis, whereas in human embryonic kidney 293 cells co-transfection of β-arrestin-specific small interference RNAs diminished Agrp-promoted endocytosis. This new regulatory mechanism was likewise detectable in a cell line derived from murine hypothalamic neurons endogenously expressing MC4R, pointing to the physiological relevance of Agrp-promoted receptor endocytosis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Agrp does not solely act by directly blocking MCR signaling but also by reducing the amount of MCR molecules accessible to melanocortins at the cell surface. This β-arrestin-dependent mechanism reveals a new aspect of MCR signaling in particular and refines the concept of G protein-coupled receptor antagonism in general.

Ligand-promoted translocation of a given receptor protein from the plasma membrane into the cell interior (receptor endocytosis) represents an important step in the desensitization process of most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Agrp, agouti-related protein; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CRE, cAMP-response element; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ex, Xpress epitope; Fluc, firefly luciferase; GABABR2, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MCR, melanocortin receptor; α-MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Rluc, Renilla luciferase; siRNA, small interference RNA; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Agrp, agouti-related protein; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CRE, cAMP-response element; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ex, Xpress epitope; Fluc, firefly luciferase; GABABR2, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MCR, melanocortin receptor; α-MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Rluc, Renilla luciferase; siRNA, small interference RNA; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein.

Because it was proposed that agonist-promoted signaling is required to initiate the molecular processes leading to GPCR endocytosis, an overwhelming number of reports have attributed ligand-induced receptor endocytosis exclusively to ligands with positive intrinsic activities (agonists). However, for a few members of the GPCR superfamily, including the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the endothelin A receptor (6Bhowmick N. Narayan P. Puett D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the cholecystokinin receptor (7Roettger B.F. Ghanekar D. Rao R. Toledo C. Yingling J. Pinon D. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 357-362PubMed Google Scholar), and the parathyroid hormone receptor (8Sneddon W.B. Syme C.A. Bisello A. Magyar C.E. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. Weinman E.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Friedman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43787-43796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), receptor endocytosis promoted by ligands with no intrinsic activity (antagonists) has also been observed. Due to the synthetic nature of the ligands used in these studies, no physiological significance could be attributed to this phenomenon.Agouti and agouti-related protein (Agrp) are the only known naturally occurring peptides that block GPCR signaling and thus act as natural antagonists (9Miller M.W. Duhl D.M. Vrieling H. Cordes S.P. Ollmann M.M. Winkes B.M. Barsh G.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 454-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 12Ollmann M.M. Wilson B.D. Yang Y.K. Kerns J.A. Chen Y. Gantz I. Barsh G.S. Science. 1997; 278: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Both peptides diminish signaling of melanocortin receptors (MCRs), a family of GPCRs responsive to peptides such as the α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Agouti has been shown to regulate skin pigmentation by inhibiting MC1R signaling in melanocytes (13Lu D. Willard D. Patel I.R. Kadwell S. Overton L. Kost T. Luther M. Chen W. Woychik R.P. Wilkison W.O. Nature. 1994; 371: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 14Robbins L.S. Nadeau J.H. Johnson K.R. Kelly M.A. Roselli-Rehfuss L. Baack E. Mountjoy K.G. Cone R.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), whereas Agrp controls body weight by blocking MC3R and/or MC4R activity in hypothalamic neurons (11Graham M. Shutter J.R. Sarmiento U. Sarosi I. Stark K.L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 273-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of Agrp-mediated inhibition of MCR signaling has recently been emphasized by the description of an age-related lean phenotype of Agrp-deficient mice (15Wortley K.E. Anderson K.D. Yasenchak J. Murphy A. Valenzuela D. Diano S. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Sleeman M.W. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 421-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Initial data indicated that agouti and Agrp mediate their physiological effects by acting as competitive antagonists. Further studies revealed that both ligands also act as inverse agonists because binding of these peptides to both MCRs decreased basal, agonist-independent receptor signaling (16Chai B.X. Neubig R.R. Millhauser G.L. Thompson D.A. Jackson P.J. Barsh G.S. Dickinson C.J. Li J.Y. Lai Y.M. Gantz I. Peptides. 2003; 24: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Nijenhuis W.A. Oosterom J. Adan R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, previous reports have suggested that the antagonistic activities of agouti described to date cannot account for all inhibitory effects of this peptide on MC1R signaling (18Ollmann M.M. Barsh G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15837-15846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Ollmann M.M. Lamoreux M.L. Wilson B.D. Barsh G.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been proposed that still unknown agouti-promoted signaling pathways lead to MC1R desensitization probably due to receptor endocytosis. However, the molecular mechanism initiating putative agouti-induced MC1R endocytosis remained unclear, and the physiological importance of this process is still unsettled. In the case of the MC4R, melanocortin-promoted receptor endocytosis has been reported in overexpressing cell systems such as HEK-293 cells (20Gao Z. Lei D. Welch J. Le K. Lin J. Leng S. Duhl D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Blondet A. Doghman M. Rached M. Durand P. Begeot M. Naville D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Effects of Agrp on MC4R endocytosis have not yet been described. To date, no data considering ligand-promoted endocytosis of the MC3R are available.The present study was initiated to study the agonist-promoted endocytosis of the MC3R. MC3R endocytosis in HEK-293 cells induced by agonists could be detected by cell fractionation and surface ELISA experiments. Further analyzing the effects of inverse agonists on MC3R endocytosis, we surprisingly observed that Agrp has the ability to induce receptor endocytosis. This new regulatory mechanism of MCR signaling was not restricted to the MC3R because Agrp-promoted receptor endocytosis was also detectable in cells expressing the MC4R. In COS-7 cells, co-expression of β-arrestins substantially increased Agrp-induced endocytosis, whereas in HEK-293 cells co-transfection of β-arrestin-specific siRNAs inhibited Agrp-promoted endocytosis of both MCRs, indicating that β-arrestins are involved in the MCR endocytosis induced by the inverse agonist. In line with these findings, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technique experiments revealed that binding of Agrp promoted the interaction of β-arrestins with both MCRs. Finally Agrp-induced MC4R endocytosis could also be observed in GT1-1 cells endogenously expressing MC4R, pointing to the physiological relevance of this new regulatory mechanism. In conclusion, the naturally occurring inverse agonist Agrp promoted the endocytosis of the MC3R and the MC4R in an arrestin-dependent manner, revealing a new mechanism by which Agrp fine tunes the responsiveness of MCR-expressing cells to melanocortins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine were purchased from PAA, Inc. (Pasching, Austria). Metafectene was obtained from Biontex (München, Germany). Coelenterazine H was from Biaffin (Kassel, Germany), and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from sheep were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [3H]Adenine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The human Agrp fragment (amino acids 86–132) was obtained from the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). α-MSH was purchased from Sigma.Eucaryotic Expression Vectors—For bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments, expression vectors encoding the MC3R or MC4R fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were generated as follows. PCR fragments containing the entire coding sequences excluding the stop codon of the human MC3R or MC4R were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector harboring the sequence of YFP in a way that fused the 3′-end of the receptor cDNA to the 5′-end of the YFP cDNA. This procedure resulted in an in-frame fusion of the receptors with YFP separated by a 7-amino acid linker. To obtain fusion proteins with the Renilla luciferase (Rluc), PCR fragments containing the entire coding sequences excluding the stop codons of MCR were subcloned into the pRluc-N3 plasmid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a way that fused the receptor sequence to the 5′-end of Rluc, resulting in an in-frame fusion of the receptor with Rluc separated by a 16-amino acid linker. For ELISA experiments, we fused the anti-Xpress peptide (Asp-Leu-Tyr-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) from Invitrogen to the N terminus of MCR. To this end, PCR fragments containing the entire coding sequences of the human MC3R or MC4R were subcloned into the pcDNA4 vector (Invitrogen) in a way that fused the anti-Xpress peptide to the 5′-end of the MCR. pcDNA3.1-GABABR2-Rluc, pcDNA3.1-β-arrestin-2-YFP, pcDNA3.1-GABA-BR2-YFP, or pcDNA3.1-β-arrestin-2-Rluc constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Bouvier (Montréal, Canada) and are described elsewhere (23Perroy J.

For transient expression of recombinant proteins, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells in 10-cm dishes, cultured for 24 h, and then transfected with the appropriate amount of plasmid DNA using the Metafectene reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were detached and seeded in new dishes as required for the following experiment.cAMP Accumulation—To determine agonist-promoted cAMP accumulation, ∼200,000 HEK-293 cells transfected with various MCR fusion protein constructs were seeded in 12-well dishes coated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine 24 h prior to the experiment and labeled for 2–4 h in serum-free DMEM containing 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine. Cells were stimulated for 45 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 2.5 μm isobutylmethylxanthine along with various concentrations of α-MSH or Agrp. The reaction was terminated by removing the medium and adding ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid to the cells. [3H]cAMP was then purified by sequential chromatography over Dowex resin and aluminum oxide columns.Firefly Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—A pAD-CRE-Fluc plasmid containing the coding sequence of the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase (Fluc) under the control of the CRE promoter was co-transfected with various MCR fusion proteins in HEK-293 cells using the Metafectene reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were seeded in 12-well dishes coated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine. After 12 h, cells were serum-starved for 12 h and stimulated in serum-free DMEM with increasing concentrations of various ligands. After 12 h of ligand stimulation, cells were lysed, and Fluc activity was determined using a luciferase reporter system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a PolarSTAR plate reader from BMG (Offenburg, Germany).β-Arrestin Recruitment in Living Cells Monitored by BRET—For the detection of β-arrestin recruitment by MCR in living cells, BRET assays were performed as described previously (25Angers S.

Briefly 24 h after transfection of plasmids encoding the cDNA of MCR-YFP and/or β-arrestin-2-Rluc or of β-arrestin-1-YFP and MCR-Rluc fusion proteins, cells were detached using PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and washed with BRET puffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2). The cell number was determined by measuring the extinction of the cell suspension at 600 nm. Approximately 100,000 cells were placed in 96-well dishes and stimulated for 45 min at room temperature with 1 μm α-MSH or 100 nm Agrp. BRET measurements were started 2 min after addition of 5 μm (final concentration) Rluc substrate coelenterazine H. After degradation of the substrate by the energy donor Rluc, light is emitted with an emission peak at 480 nm. The energy acceptor YFP is excited by non-radiative energy transfer if YFP is located within a distance of less than 100 Å from the energy donor (which is achieved by the ligand-promoted translocation of β-arrestin from the cytosol to the plasma membrane). Thus, as a result of the receptor-arrestin interaction, fluorescence is re-emitted by YFP with a peak at 525 nm. Light intensity emitted at 440–500 and 510–590 nm was detected using the PolarSTAR plate reader. The ratio of the light intensities at 510–590 over 440–500 nm is defined as the BRET signal. BRET signals were then corrected by subtracting the background of the BRET measurement detected in cells expressing only Rluc.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay to Detect Cell Surface Receptors—In the case of HEK-293 cells, 24 h after transfection Ex-MC3R- or Ex-MC4R-expressing cells were detached and seeded in 12-well dishes (∼200,000 cells/well) coated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine. After 24 h, cells were stimulated at 37 °C for various time periods with 1 μm α-MSH or 100 nm Agrp in DMEM to induce receptor endocytosis. Dishes were then placed on ice, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1% BSA. After blocking unspecific binding sites for 5 min on ice with the same buffer, Xpress epitope-MCR fusion proteins on the cell surface were detected by incubating the cells with 400 ng/ml anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at 4°C. After washing the cells twice with PBS containing 1% BSA, cells were fixed for 15 min with 3–10% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Then cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 45–60 min with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from sheep (1:2,000) in PBS with 1% BSA at room temperature. Thereafter cells were washed twice for 20 min with PBS containing 1% BSA and once with pure PBS. The substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5–10 min, the reaction was stopped with 3 n HCL, and extinction was measured at 492 nm. Data are presented as absolute values, or receptor endocytosis is given as the percentage of the signal after ligand treatment relative to the time-matched control (vehicle). To be able to detect ligand-promoted MC4R endocytosis in GT1-1 cells, cell surface ELISA experiments were performed with the following modifications. GT1-1 cells were seeded in 12-well dishes (∼400,000 cells/well) coated with 0.1% poly-d-lysine. To detect endogenously expressed murine MC4R an anti-MC4R peptide antibody (ab24233, 400 ng/ml) from Abcam plc (Cambridge, UK) was used, and the concentration of the secondary antibody (1:1,000) and of the horseradish peroxidase substrate were increased (5-fold). The exposure time of the substrate to horseradish peroxidase was also increased (5-fold). Background values due to unspecific binding of the secondary antibody to GT1-1 cells were determined in the absence of the anti-MC4R peptide antibody and subtracted from the signal obtained in the presence of the anti-MC4R peptide antibody.Cell Fractionation by Ultracentrifugation through Sucrose Cushions—MCR endocytosis was also assessed after cell fractionation as described previously (26Breit A.

Briefly 24 h after transfection of cells with receptor-Rluc fusion proteins cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes and, after an additional 24-h incubation time, stimulated for 45 min at 37 °C with 1 μm α-MSH or 100 nm Agrp in DMEM. Cells were detached on ice with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, and the total membrane fraction was prepared as follows. Cells were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml benzamidine, and 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) using a Polytron (Ultraturrax T24, IKA) for 10–15 s at maximum speed. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant containing the total membrane fraction was then placed on the top of a sucrose cushion (35%) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min. The light endosomal fraction containing internalized receptor (Rluclight) was found at the 0–35% interface, whereas the heavy membrane fraction (Rlucheavy) sedimented at the bottom of the tube. The heavy membrane fraction was resuspended in 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and the light endosomal fraction was collected and again centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet was also resuspended in 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and the total amount of protein in each fraction was determined using the method of Bradford. The amount of receptor-Rluc fusion proteins in each fraction was determined by measuring Rluc activity using the PolarSTAR plate reader and normalized to the total amount of protein. Endocytosis was calculated as a percentage using the following equation: [Rlucheavy/(Rlucheavy + Rluclight) × 100)]basal – [Rlucheavy/(Rlucheavy + Rluclight) × 100]ligand.Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA from GT1-1 or as a control from HEK-293 cells (data not shown) was isolated using the TriFast reagent (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). First strand synthesis was carried out with random hexamers as primers (pdN6, Amersham Biosciences) using REVERTAID reverse transcriptase (MBI-Fermentas, Sankt Leon-Roth, Germany). Products were amplified using mouse MC3R- (forward, 5′-TGGGCACCCTATATATCCACA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCTTCATGCAGGAGTGC-3′), mouse MC4R- (forward, 5′-TTCCCTCCACCTCTGGAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGGGGAAACAAAAAGTTG-3′), mouse β-arrestin-1- (forward, 5′-CTCAAGCATGAGGACACGAA-3′; inverse, 5′-ATTTCACGGTTGGCACCTT-3′), mouseβ-arrestin-2- (forward, 5′-GACCAGTTCTGCTAGGACGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTACCTTGGAACACTGGCATAG-3′), or, as a control, mouse β-actin (forward, 5′-CCAACCGTGAAAAGATGACC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTGGTACGACCAGAGGCATAC-3′)-specific primer pairs. PCRs were carried out using the following conditions: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, 45 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.Specific Gene Knock-out by siRNAs—The small RNA interference technique was used as described before (28Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8081) Google Scholar, 29Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 31Shenoy S.K. Drake M.T.

Statistical significance of differences in all assays was assessed by the two-tail Student's t test.RESULTSAgrp Inhibits Basal cAMP Production in HEK-293 Cells Expressing Various MCR Fusion Proteins—Originally Agrp was described to be an antagonist of various MCR subtypes, including the MC3R and the MC4R. Further studies revealed that Agrp not only antagonizes melanocortin-promoted MCR signaling but also inhibits basal, agonist-independent receptor activity, defining Agrp as an inverse agonist (17Nijenhuis W.A. Oosterom J. Adan R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To validate receptor fusion proteins used in the present study, we monitored cAMP accumulation by anion exchange chromatography and cAMP production after co-transfection of a reporter gene construct encoding the Fluc protein under the control of the CRE promoter. Both the cAMP accumulation and the CRE-Fluc reporter gene assay revealed that neither fusion of Rluc or YFP to the C terminus nor fusion of the Xpress epitope to the N terminus of MCR inhibited receptor signaling and that no dramatic alterations in the potency or efficacy of the agonist (α-MSH) or the inverse agonist (Agrp) was observed (Table 1). It is noteworthy that in this and all following experiments a fragment of human Agrp (amino acids 86–132) was used. This Agrp fragment has been reported to occur naturally after cleavage of the full-length peptide by protein convertase 1 or 3 and to exhibit the most potent inverse agonistic activities of all known Agrp fragments (32Creemers J.W.

Life Sci. 2003; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4von Zastrow M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For the MC4R recombinantly expressed in HEK-293 cells, it has been shown that this receptor subtype is endocytosed in an agonist-dependent manner (20Gao Z. Lei D. Welch J. Le K. Lin J. Leng S. Duhl D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Shinyama H. Masuzaki H. Fang H. Flier J.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, no such data are available for the MC3R. To investigate agonist-promoted receptor endocytosis, we fused the Xpress epitope to the N terminus of the MC3R (Ex-MC3R) and performed cell surface ELISA experiments with HEK-293 cells recombinantly overexpressing this fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, stimulation of these cells with the agonist α-MSH (1 μm) for 45 min significantly reduced the amount of Ex-MC3R molecules accessible to the specific antibody against the Xpress epitope, revealing that the MC3R undergoes agonist-promoted endocytosis. Although ligand-promoted GPCR endocytosis has almost completely been attributed to agonists, we next wondered whether the inverse agonist Agrp is also able to regulate MC3R endocytosis. To our surprise, incubation of Ex-MC3R-expressing cells with Agrp (100 nm) for 45 min reduced the number of receptor molecules expressed at the cell surface, indicative of MC3R endocytosis induced by this inverse agonist (Fig. 1, A and B). To test whether Agrp-promoted endocytosis is restricted to the MC3R, we also analyzed ligand-promoted endocytosis of an Ex-MC4R fusion protein. As expected, stimulation of Ex-MC4R-expressing cells with the agonist α-MSH reduced the MC4R density at the plasma membrane as a result of agonist-promoted MC4R endocytosis (Fig. 1, A and B) as mentioned before. Moreover as for the MC3R, stimulation of HEK-293 cells with Agrp also promoted MC4R endocytosis (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that the inverse agonist induced endocytosis of both MCRs. Inverse agonist-promoted receptor endocytosis was not promoted by the overexpression of MCR in HEK-293 cells because, a"

Rad9/Crb2 are bona fide checkpoint proteins whose activation requires their corresponding C-terminal tandem BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) motifs, which mediate their oligomerization and phosphorylation at multiple sites following DNA damage. Here we show that the function of human 53BP1 similarly depends on its oligomerization and phosphorylation at multiple sites but in a BRCT domain-independent manner. Moreover, unlike its proposed yeast counterparts, human 53BP1 only has limited checkpoint functions but rather acts as an adaptor in the repair of DNA double strand breaks. This difference in function may reflect the higher complexity of the DNA damage response network in metazoa including the evolution of other BRCT domain-containing proteins that may have functions redundant or overlapping with those of 53BP1. 53BP1 plays an important role in cellular response to DNA damage.

To protect the integrity of their DNA against the potentially deleterious assaults from various endogenous and environmental sources, cells have evolved a genome surveillance network that carefully coordinates DNA repair with cell cycle progression. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) 4The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand breaks; BRCT, BRCA1 C-terminal; PIKK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; Gy, grays; HA, hemagglutinin; IR, ionizing radiation; IRIF, IR-induced foci; FL, full length protein. are considered the most toxic type of DNA damage. If left unrepaired or repaired improperly, they cause chromosomal aberrations, which may be lethal or result in oncogenic transformation (1Difilippantonio M.J. Petersen S. Chen H.T. Johnson R.

Cell. 2002; 109: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). One of the network components activated early in response to DNA DSBs is 53BP1, a large nuclear protein that was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a p53-binding partner (3Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Domain analysis revealed the presence of a tandem BRCT motif at the C terminus of 53BP1, a domain frequently found in proteins implicated in DNA damage response pathways (4Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 5Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N terminus of 53BP1 contains several (S/T)Q motifs, the preferred phosphorylation sites for members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family, which play central roles in DNA damage signal transduction. Subsequent studies showed that 53BP1 is phosphorylated by the PIKK family member ATM and undergoes a rapid relocalization to sites of DNA DSBs upon exposure of cells to DNA-damaging agents (6Anderson L.

Moreover, class switch recombination of immunoglobulin heavy chains is severely impaired in the absence of 53BP1, suggesting a defect in the non-homologous end-joining of DNA DSBs (12Ward I.M.

The repair defect in 53BP1-deficient cells can be quantified by assessing PIKK-dependent phosphorylation of the histone H2A variant, H2AX, a component of the nucleosome core structure (14Kuhne M.

Frisk C.S. Ried T. Nussenzweig A. Chen J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10079-10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, H2AX is reversibly phosphorylated at megabase regions flanking the sites of DNA DSBs (16Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar).

However, it is unknown to what extent the 53BP1 BRCT motifs or the multiple N-terminal (S/T)Q sites are needed for the repair function of 53BP1. To address these questions, we stably expressed various 53BP1-deletion mutants in 53BP1-defcient MEFs and analyzed the repair capacity of these cells by determining the numbers of residual P-H2AX foci following treatment with ionizing radiation. Moreover, we fine-mapped the region required for 53BP1 oligomerization and, using the same approach, assessed the role of 53BP1 oligomerization in DNA DSB repair. Constructs and Transfection—The original plasmid containing HA-tagged human 53BP1 cDNA was obtained from Dr. K. Iwabuchi (pCMH6K53BP1) (23Iwabuchi K. Li B. Massa H.F. Trask B.J. Date T. Fields S. J.

The 15AQ plasmid, a pCMH6K53BP1 derivative, was provided by Dr. P. B. Carpenter (10Morales J.C. Xia Z. Lu T. Aldrich M.B. Wang B. Rosales C. Kellems R.E. Hittelman W.N. Elledge S.J. Carpenter P.B. J.

FuGENE 6 (Invitrogen) was used as the transfection reagent. Repair and Checkpoint Assays—For the DNA DSB repair assay, cells were plated onto coverslips and grown to confluency. Once the cells had stopped dividing, they were irradiated with 1 or 2 Gy using a 137Cs source and allowed to recover for up to 27 h prior to immunostaining with anti-phopsho H2AX antibodies (24Riballo E.

The cells were viewed on a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope, and the number of P-H2AX foci was assessed in 100-200 cells/sample. To analyze the integrity of the intra-S-phase checkpoint, logarithmically growing cells were plated into 96-well plates and grown at 37 °C for 2 days in medium containing 10 nCi of [14C]thymidine (ICN Radiochemicals) per ml. Radioactive medium was replaced overnight with fresh medium to chase 14C-labeled precursors into DNA prior exposure of cells to 0, 5, 10, and 20 Gy of IR. 30 min later, [3H]thymidine was added to the medium (20 μCi/ml), and the cells were incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. After removal of the radioactive medium and two washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were trypsinized, harvested on filter paper, and analyzed on a scintillation counter. For the low dose G2/M checkpoint assay, cells were either untreated or irradiated with 0.5 Gy and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C prior to fixation and staining with anti-phospho-histone H3 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) and propidium iodide. The number of mitotic cells was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 2 mm Na3VO4, and extracts were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) or S-agarose beads (EMD Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were then gently washed three times with lysis buffer, and the precipitated complexes were resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. After boiling, the samples were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with various antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG (M2) and HA epitope (HA.11) were purchased from Sigma and Covance, respectively. Anti-p53 antibodies DO1 and 421 were purchased from Oncogene, whereas the polyclonal anti-53BP1 antibody was raised against the N terminus of 53BP1 (7Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Localization of 53BP1 to sites of DNA DSBs (the formation of so-called ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF)) requires a region upstream of the two BRCT domains (10Morales J.C. Xia Z. Lu T.

The current hypothesis is that a tandem Tudor fold within this region (here referred to as the IRIF region) is required for the initial targeting of 53BP1 to sites of DSBs by recognizing and binding methylated histones exposed at the areas surrounding the DNA lesions (21Huyen Y. Zgheib O. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Petty T.J. Sheston E.A. Mellert H.S. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D.

Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Subsequent interactions of the IRIF region with other proteins or protein modifications are then needed to retain and/or stabilize 53BP1 at the break sites (20Ward I.M. Minn K. Jorda K.G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19579-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 25Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Kruhlak M.J. Pilch D.R. Staudt D.W. Lee A. Bonner R.F.

It is speculated that the proper localization of 53BP1 would be required for its function in DNA damage response, although direct evidence is lacking. To investigate the requirement of various 53BP1 regions in the non-homologous repair of DNA DSBs, we generated 53BP1-null MEF lines expressing HA-tagged full-length or mutated h53BP1. Using residual P-H2AX foci as a readout, we assessed the efficiency of DNA DSB repair 27 h after exposure of superconfluent G1-phase cells to 2 Gy IR. As expected, 53BP1 IRIF mutants (Δ1052-1302 and ΔTudor 1477-1632), which are unable to relocate in response to DNA damage, showed the same repair defect as 53BP1-deficient cells (Fig. 1). Moreover, reconstitution with h53BP1 full-length protein (FL) restored the DSB repair to levels that were similar to the ones observed in the 53BP1 wild-type line (Fig. 1, wt), suggesting that human 53BP1 can fully replace its murine counterpart in DNA DSB repair. The N terminus of 53BP1 contains no functionally defined protein region but has several (S/T)Q sites, which represent potential target sites for ATM or other PIKKs. In fact, we and others had previously shown that 53BP1 becomes hyperphoshorylated in an ATM-dependent manner in response to DNA damage, and we mapped Ser-6, Ser-25, Ser-29, and Ser-784 as inducible in vivo ATM phosphorylation sites (7Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 9Xia Z. Morales J.C. Dunphy W.G. Carpenter P.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19579-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To test whether phosphorylation of these four sites is required for the repair function of 53BP1, we transiently transfected 53BP1-deficient MEFs with a quadruple serine to alanine mutant (S6A,S25A,S29A,S784A). Interestingly, the expression of this particular 53BP1 phospho-mutant almost restored the repair efficiency to wild-type levels, whereas cells expressing the Δ1-1052 mutant showed the repair defect similar to 53BP1-null cells (53BP1-/-, 5.20 ± 0.26; FL, 1.83 ± 0.13; S6A,S25A,S29A,S784A, 2.10 ± 0.18; Δ1-1052, 5.24 ± 0.31, mean ± S.E.). There are at least two possible explanations for this result. One is that there are additional redundant phosphorylation sites at the N terminus of 53BP1. Phosphorylation of those sites is sufficient for mediating DNA DSB repair. Alternatively, 53BP1 phosphorylation could be independent from the repair function of 53BP1 and might contribute to checkpoint or other function of 53BP1. To distinguish these two possibilities, we analyzed a series of MEF lines stably expressing increasing N-terminal deletions (Δ1-165, Δ1-334, Δ1-500, Δ1-659, Δ1-1052) or a phospho-mutant (10Morales J.C. Xia Z. Lu T. Aldrich M.B. Wang B. Rosales C. Kellems R.E. Hittelman W.N. Elledge S.J. Carpenter P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 10: 10Google Scholar) with all 15 conserved (S/T)Q sites being changed to AQ sites (15AQ) (Fig. 2A). Using the same residual P-H2AX foci assay, we observed a gradual increase in repair deficiency with increasing length of the deletion (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this finding, transient expression of two internal deletion mutants, Δ170-499 and Δ334-659, resulted only in a partial rescue of the repair deficiency (data not shown). Moreover, expression of the 15AQ mutant could not salvage the repair defect in 53BP1-null MEFs, although the average number of residual P-H2AX foci was slightly lower than that observed in the parental line or in cells expressing the Δ1-1052 deletion mutant (Fig. 2B). Based on these observations, we believe that phosphorylation of 53BP1 at multiple sites within the 53BP1 N terminus is required for efficient DNA DSB repair. To test whether 53BP1 phosphorylation would be involved in checkpoint control, we analyzed the ability of cells to repress DNA synthesis in the presence of DNA damage (radio-resistant DNA synthesis (RDS) assay). However, unlike ATM-deficient control cells, neither 53BP1-null nor 53BP1-reconstituted MEFs showed a significant RDS phenotype in response to 5, 10, or 20 Gy IR (Fig. S1 in supplemental materials and data not shown). These findings corroborated our former conclusion that 53BP1 does not play a major role in cell cycle checkpoint control (11Ward I.M. Minn K. Van Deursen J. Chen J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated to what extent the C-terminal BRCT repeats contribute to the function of 53BP1 in DNA DSB repair. 53BP1 had been identified and named based on the in vitro interaction of its C terminus with the central DNA-binding domain of p53 (3Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Although this original observation was made in yeast cells overexpressing these two proteins, subsequent structural analyses confirmed that the first BRCT motif together with the inter-repeat linker bind to the DNA-binding surface of p53 (26Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We also observed an interaction of endogenous 53BP1 and p53 in human cells (Fig. 3B). However, the functional significance of this tandem BRCT domain has not been addressed. To examine the role of the 53BP1 BRCT region in DNA DSB repair, cells stably expressing a truncated form of 53BP1 (ΔBRCT 1700-1972, Fig. 3A) were analyzed for residual P-H2AX foci 27 h after exposure to 2 Gy. Interestingly, expression of the BRCT truncation mutant completely rescued the repair defect in 53BP1-null cells (Fig. 3C). The same observation was made in cells transiently transfected with the ΔBRCT 1700-1972 construct (data not shown). Moreover, the average number of P-H2AX foci in unirradiated ΔBRCT cells was similar to that found in cells expressing full-length 53BP1. In contrast, 53BP1-deficient cells or cells that expressed the N-terminal deletion mutant (Δ1-1052) showed higher baseline levels indicative of a higher number of unrepaired endogenous lesions (Fig. 3C). The rescue effect of the ΔBRCT mutant was not restricted to a late stage of repair but could be seen as early as 1 h following irradiation with 1 Gy (see Fig. S2A in supplemental materials). In addition, a low dose G2/M checkpoint assay showed that the 53BP1 BRCT domains are not involved cell cycle checkpoint control (Fig. S2B in supplemental materials). Together, these findings indicate that the 53BP1 BRCT domains are not required for efficient DSB repair or checkpoint control. 53BP1 has recently been shown to homo-oligomerize in a DNA damage-independent manner. The region required and sufficient for oligomerization has been mapped to residues 1052-1475, an area upstream of the 53BP1 tandem Tudor folds (27Adams M.M. Wang B. Xia Z. Morales J.C. Lu X. Donehower L.A. Bochar D.A. Elledge S.J. Carpenter P.B. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1854-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function of 53BP1 oligomerization, we attempted to narrow down the region using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The data gained from this analysis suggested that residues 1231-1270 mediate the oligomerization of 53BP1 (data not shown). To confirm these in vitro findings, we generated an HA-tagged 53BP1 ΔDimer (Δ1231-1270) construct and performed a double-transfection assay. 293T cells were co-transfected with S-FLAG-tagged full-length 53BP1 and the HA-ΔDimer mutant or an HA-tagged control plasmid. 48 h later, aliquots of the cells were collected. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA or anti-S antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. S-FLAG-53BP1 FL could be readily detected in the HA-FL and HA-Δ1-1052 precipitates but not in the HA-ΔDimer (Δ1231-1270) and HA-Δ1052-1302 precipitates. Correspondingly, HA-FL and HA-Δ1-1052, but not HA-ΔDimer or HA-Δ1052-1302, co-immunoprecipitated with S-FLAG-FL 53BP1 (Fig. 4B). These data confirm that the region comprising residues 1231-1270 is required for 53BP1 oligomerization. Next, we transfected 53BP1-null MEFs with the ΔDimer (Δ1231-1270) construct and asked whether deletion of the oligomerization region would affect 53BP1 accumulation at the sites of DNA DSBs. Notably, cells expressing the deletion mutant still formed IRIF, although the deleted region resides within the region required for 53BP1 foci formation (Fig. 4, A and C). However, expression of ΔDimer (Δ1231-1270) could not rescue the repair defect in stably transfected 53BP1-deficient MEFs (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these findings suggest that oligomerization of 53BP1 is critical for its function in DNA DSB repair. 53BP1 plays a significant role in the repair of DNA DSBs, and here we provide evidence that phosphorylation and homo-oligomerization of 53BP1 are crucial to exert this function. In contrast, the C-terminal tandem BRCT motifs of 53BP1 appear not to be required for DSB repair. 53BP1 has been shown to undergo a dynamic interaction with chromatin following DNA damage. Upon exposure of cells to ionizing radiation, 53BP1 becomes transiently immobilized at the chromosomal regions flanking the DNA DSBs (28Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Binding and retention of 53BP1 to chromatin requires an intact Tudor domain, a recently characterized methyl-binding motif (21Huyen Y. Zgheib O. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Petty T.J. Sheston E.A. Mellert H.S. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2004; 432: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), as well as a less distinguished upstream region (20Ward I.M. Minn K. Jorda K.G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19579-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Tudor domain or the preceding region prevent the repair function of 53BP1, indicating that accumulation of 53BP1 at break sites is an absolute requirement for efficient DNA DSB repair. Similarly, mutation of multiple phosphorylation sites at the 53BP1 N terminus impairs DSB repair in an incremental fashion. Although it remains to be determined how many phosphorylation sites have to conspire for full 53BP1 function, it appears that there is no sharp threshold for these phosphorylation events. DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of multiple PIKK sites has also been described in budding yeast Rad9 (29Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which is thought to be the homologue of mammalian 53BP1 based on sequence similarities in its tandem BRCT and Tudor motifs. In budding yeast, phosphorylation of Rad9 is required for the survival of genotoxic stress by regulating the activation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53, the functional orthologue of the mammalian signal transducer Chk2 (29Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Rad9 recruits Rad53 to DNA lesions, thus enabling its phosphorylation by the PIKK Mec1. Phosphorylation of Rad53 triggers its activation, autophosphorylation, and subsequent release from Rad9 (30Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 31Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Similarly, 53BP1 has been shown to interact with Chk2 and promote its phosphorylation (11Ward I.M. Minn K. Van Deursen J. Chen J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 32Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, unlike its yeast counterpart, Chk2 can still be activated in the absence of 53BP1 (11Ward I.M. Minn K. Van Deursen J. Chen J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 34Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), although the activation or phosphorylation of Chk2 is reduced in 53BP1-deficient cells. These data suggest that 53BP1 is not essential for Chk2 phosphorylation and/or activation following DNA damage, raising the possibility that a more complex and redundant signal adaptor system may be evolved in higher organisms. Indeed, although phosphorylation of Rad9 as well as Rad9-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53 require the C-terminal tandem BRCT domains in budding yeast (35Soulier J. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), deletion of the BRCT domains in mammalian 53BP1 did not affect 53BP1 phosphorylation (data not shown) or 53BP1 function in DNA DSB repair. Moreover, homo-oligomerization appears to be the critical function of the Rad9 (budding yeast) or Crb2 (fission yeast) BRCT domains (35Soulier J. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Du L.L. Moser B.A. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38409-38414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas oligomerization of 53BP1 depends on a small region outside of its BRCT domains. The fact that the BRCT domains of 53BP1 are not required for effective DNA DSB repair raises the question of the specific function of this tandem motif in 53BP1. An obvious possibility would be a role in p53 regulation. The evolution of this tumor suppressor module in higher eukaryotes could have conferred a new role to the C terminus of 53BP1, whereas a novel upstream region assured the homo-oligomerization of the protein. It seems clear that the 53BP1 BRCT domain is able to interact with the DNA-binding domain of p53 and initial studies implied that 53BP1 may stimulate p53-mediated transcriptional activation (23Iwabuchi K. Li B. Massa H.F. Trask B.J. Date T. Fields S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26061-26068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, p53 cannot bind simultaneously to 53BP1 and DNA (26Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 37Derbyshire D.J. Basu B.P. Serpell L.C. Joo W.S. Date T. Iwabuchi K. Doherty A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that 53BP1 could directly activate p53-mediated transcription. In addition, IR-induced p21 activation was found to be normal in 53BP1-deficient splenocytes (15Ward I.M. Difilippantonio S. Minn K. Mueller M.D. Molina J.R. Yu X. Frisk C.S. Ried T. Nussenzweig A. Chen J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10079-10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 53BP1 might regulate p53 indirectly by affecting the phosphorylation of p53 following DNA damage. In fact, small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of 53BP1 led to impaired p53 accumulation in a human cancer line (32Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). However, no defect in p53 stabilization was found in primary 53BP1-deficient mouse thymocytes, nor did these cells fail to undergo p53-mediated G1 arrest or apoptosis (11Ward I.M. Minn K. Van Deursen J. Chen J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 15Ward I.M. Difilippantonio S. Minn K. Mueller M.D. Molina J.R. Yu X. Frisk C.S. Ried T. Nussenzweig A. Chen J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10079-10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains a subject of debate as to whether the regulation of p53 is a biological function of 53BP1. Alternatively, the 53BP1 BRCT domains could interact with an as yet unidentified protein, perhaps a phosphoprotein, since tandem BRCT domains bind preferentially to phosphorylated peptides (38Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y.

Such a hypothetical complex could function in a subtype of DNA repair that is not measured by our DSB repair assay. Unlike budding yeast Rad9 or fission yeast Crb2, which are key players in DNA damage checkpoint control (40Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 41Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Lou Z. Chini C.C. Minter-Dykhouse K. Chen J. Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M.

Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), 53BP1 appears to have a limited role in DNA damage checkpoints. Although small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of 53BP1 in human cancer lines led to defects in the G2/M and intra-S-phase checkpoints (32Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 33DiTullio R.A. Mochan T.A. Venere M. Bartkova J. Sehested M. Bartek J. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), minor or no cell cycle checkpoint defects were detected in 53BP1-deficient mouse and chicken cells (11Ward I.M. Minn K.

These differences between 53BP1 and its proposed yeast homologues could have evolved with the increasing number of BRCT-containing proteins in metazoa. For example, checkpoint proteins MDC1/NFBD1 and MCPH1/BRIT1 are BRCT-containing proteins that do not have any apparent homologues in yeast. These proteins might be evolved to carry out checkpoint functions, whereas 53BP1 gains more importance in DNA DSB repair. Regardless of their differences, it is still tempting to speculate that the mechanism of action remained similar among 53BP1, budding yeast Rad9, and fission yeast Crb2. All three proteins appear to be oligomeric adaptors that enable/facilitate the activation of effector molecules in response to DNA damage. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the new role of the 53BP1 BRCT motifs in the complex mammalian damage response network.

They are homotrimers, in which each subunit contains a narrow pore through which substrate transport occurs. Two conserved histidine residues in the pore have been proposed to be necessary for ammonia conductance. By analyzing 14 engineered polar and non-polar variants of these histidines, in Escherichia coli AmtB, we show that both histidines are absolutely required for optimum substrate conductance. Crystal structures of variants confirm that substitution of the histidine residues does not affect AmtB structure. In a subgroup of Amt proteins, found only in fungi, one of the histidines is replaced by glutamate. The equivalent substitution in E. coli AmtB is partially active, and the structure of this variant suggests that the glutamate side chain can make similar interactions to those made by histidine.

Ammonium is the preferred nitrogen source for many organisms, and its transport across cellular membranes is a fundamental biological process. (In this report, we use the term ammonium to refer to both the protonated (NH4+) and the unprotonated (NH3) forms and ammonia to refer specifically to NH3.) Ammonium transport is mediated by a family of ubiquitous membrane proteins (designated Amt), found in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants, whose homologues in animals are the Rhesus (Rh) 3The abbreviations used are: Rh, Rhesus; GS, glutamine synthetase; r.m.s., root mean square. 3The abbreviations used are: Rh, Rhesus; GS, glutamine synthetase; r.m.s., root mean square. proteins (1von Wirén N.

Physiol. 2006; 451: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of action of both the Amt and Rh proteins is not yet understood. Escherichia coli encodes a single Amt protein, AmtB, which is a stable trimer in the cytoplasmic membrane and retains this structure when purified and reconstituted in the presence of lipids (5Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Conroy M.J. Jamieson S.J. Blakey D. Kaufmann T. Engel A. Fotiadis D. Merrick M. Bullough P.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic structures of E. coli AmtB and of the orthologous Archaeoglobus fulgidus Amt-1 have revealed a narrow channel within each monomer (7Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J.

At its periplasmic end, a binding site for NH4+ has been identified, but entry from this site into the channel appears sterically hindered by the side chains of two conserved phenylalanines (Phe-107 and Phe-215 in AmtB). The structure analysis of E. coli AmtB (7Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 8Zheng L. Kostrewa D. Bernèche S. Winkler F.K. Li X.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17090-17095Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) led to the conclusion that the protein is a channel that conducts uncharged NH3. Stopped-flow experiments with purified AmtB reconstituted into proteoliposomes (7Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and in vivo functional characterization of E. coli AmtB are consistent with this view (10Javelle A. Thomas G. Marini A.M. Kramer R. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A variety of studies on Rh proteins also support an ammonia channel model (11Ripoche P. Bertrand O.

Cartron J.P. Ludewig U. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Almost all Amt/Rh proteins contain two conserved histidines, which in AmtB are located within transmembrane helices M5 (His-168) and M10 (His-318) such that their side chains protrude into the channel (14Conroy M.J. Bullough P.A. Merrick M. Avent N.D. Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 131: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). They are related by the 2-fold quasi-symmetry of AmtB, and their adjacent imidazole rings are arranged such that an unusual lateral hydrogen bond is formed between their two δ1 nitrogens. It has been proposed that these histidines might have a role in the deprotonation of ammonium ions before they traverse the channel as uncharged NH3 (4Winkler F.K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 451: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M.

A. 2004; 101: 17090-17095Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that deprotonation of NH4+ occurs at the periplasmic binding site through some general base present in the periplasm (4Winkler F.K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 451: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or, based on molecular dynamics simulations, through a highly conserved Asp residue (Asp-160 in E. coli AmtB) (15Lin Y. Cao Z. Mo Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 10876-10884Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In a number of fungal Amt proteins, a Glu residue replaces the His-168 orthologue, and these proteins can also facilitate ammonium transport (16Smith D.G. Garcia-Pedrajas M.D. Gold S.E. Perlin M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Biswas K. Morschhauser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Marini A.-M.

Site-directed mutants offer the possibility of testing some of these predictions. In this study, we report the first such analysis and confirm that the unusual twin-His structure in the pore of AmtB is essential for optimum substrate conductance.

Protein Quantification—For each AmtB variant, serial dilutions of whole-cell extracts of strain GT1000 (ΔglnKΔamtB) expressing a mutant amtB allele were subject to Western blotting using anti-AmtB antibodies. On each gel, 20, 14, 10, and 6 ng of pure AmtB were loaded for quantification. X-ray films were scanned and analyzed using GeneTools software (Syngene). [14C]Methylammonium Transport Assays—Methylamine accumulation (AmtB activity) and methylglutamine accumulation (glutamine synthetase activity) were determined as described (10Javelle A. Thomas G. Marini A.M. Kramer R. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Production, Crystallization, and Structure Analysis of Wild-type and Mutant AmtB—Cloning, expression, purification, and crystallization methods were essentially as described (8Zheng L. Kostrewa D.

Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). M9 medium was used for wild-type AmtB and the H318F mutant, and the auto-induction medium (23Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4107) Google Scholar) was used in all other cases. The mutant AmtB proteins (except for H168E and H318F) were extracted from a low spin pellet (40,000 × g) obtained after removing unbroken cells at 10,000 × g. Affinity chromatography was performed using either Ni2+- or Co2+-loaded fast flow Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). A one-step affinity purification was used in most cases, and the eluted AmtB-containing fractions, after concentration, were directly used to set up crystallization trials. Crystals were obtained by mixing 1-2 μl of concentrated protein (10-20 mg/ml) with an equal volume of reservoir buffer in sitting drops at 20 °C (Table 2). Crystals grown after one-step purification had imidazole (about 150 mm) and higher salt (250 rather than 50 mm) in their mother liquor when compared with those grown after additional gel filtration (8Zheng L. Kostrewa D. Bernèche S. Winkler F.K. Li X.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17090-17095Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).

Data sets were processed with the XDS program (24Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). A standardized refinement protocol was used throughout. As a starting model, we used the refined native structure 1XQF structure (8Zheng L. Kostrewa D. Bernèche S. Winkler F.K. Li X.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17090-17095Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) in which His-168 and His-318 were converted to Gly and all water molecules at and in the pore, as well as those with high B-factors, were removed. Using Refmac (25Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), an initial rigid body refinement (10 cycles with data to 3 Å resolution) was followed by a round of translation/libration/screw and restrained refinement (10 cycles with data to the maximum resolution, Table 2). After inserting the proper residues at positions 168 and 318, another 30 cycles of restrained refinement were carried out using the previously determined translation/libration/screw parameters and data between 15 Å and the maximum resolution. In this final refinement, simple scaling was used (as opposed to Babinet scaling in the initial round), and the solvent contribution was included using a van der Waals radius of 1.0. At this stage, difference densities for the analysis of pore hydration were calculated (see Fig. 6). After adding some more water molecules, imidazole (where indicated at site S1), and at a few locations, other buffer components (glycerol, acetate, and sulfate where clearly defined in the density) to the model, 30 final refinement cycles led to the final models and refinement statistics (Table 2). Expression of the His-168 and His-318 Variants—To test the proposed critical roles of His-168 and His-318, we constructed 14 variants of E. coli AmtB, replacing the histidines by non-polar (aromatic or aliphatic) and polar residues including potentially charged ones. These amtB alleles were introduced into a plasmid-borne glnKa-mtB operon and expressed in the ΔglnKΔamtB strain GT1000. Eight of the variants behaved like wild-type AmtB in being correctly targeted to the inner membrane, in running as a major trimetric species with an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), and in their expression level (Fig. 1C). Six of the polar mutants (H168D, H168T, H318E, H168K, and the double mutants H168E/H318E and H168T/H318T) were still correctly targeted and well expressed but were also present, to a variable extent, as dimeric or monomeric species on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, and data not shown for H168T/H318T), rendering the quantitative evaluation of their expression level difficult and indicating that they might be less stable.FIGURE 2AmtB variant expression in vivo.

Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). GlnK is a member of the PII family: trimeric proteins that act as sensors of cellular nitrogen status (27Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Tyr-51 of GlnK is covalently modified by uridylylation in cells that are subject to nitrogen starvation, and this process is reversed in nitrogen sufficiency (28Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A rapid increase in extracellular ammonium causes deuridylylated GlnK to interact with AmtB, apparently to regulate the activity of the channel in response to the intracellular nitrogen status (21Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that a highly conserved AmtB residue, Asp-160, was essential for activity, insofar as an D160A mutation completely inactivated AmtB but did not affect the level of protein (21Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We also showed that D160A AmtB was impaired in sequestering GlnK following an ammonium shock, despite GlnK being deuridylylated normally (21Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The structure of AmtB shows that Asp-160, which is on the periplasmic side, has a critical structural role (7Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), and we deduce that any significant structural perturbation in AmtB may impair its interaction with GlnK either through perturbing oligomerization or by affecting the structure on the cytoplasmic face. Consequently, this interaction can be taken as indicative of a preserved native-like trimeric structure, and we therefore assessed the His variants of AmtB for their ability to sequester GlnK. All except H168T showed normal GlnK-AmtB complex formation (Fig. 3) and a normal deuridylylation pattern (data not shown) of GlnK after an ammonium shock of 30 mm for 15 min, suggesting that with one exception, they maintain a native-like structure. Interestingly, even the variants that appear less stable on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) were able to form a complex with GlnK. None of the variant AmtB proteins was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2A), indicating that they were all targeted to the membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that with the exception of H168T, the variants are all correctly folded and present as trimers in the membrane. The apparent destabilization of the trimeric state of some variants upon SDS treatment therefore does not imply that their structure is significantly perturbed under non-denaturing conditions. X-ray Structure of Variants—Five of the functionally characterized His variants (H168A, H168E, H168F, H318A, H318F) and the H168A/H318A variant could be crystallized in the previously reported hexagonal form, which permitted their structure determination to a resolution of at least 2.2 Å resolution (8Zheng L. Kostrewa D. Bernèche S. Winkler F.K. Li X.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17090-17095Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) (Table 2). When compared with wild-type AmtB, the structural changes were restricted to the mutated residue with minor changes in the conformation of the neighboring histidine in some cases (see Fig. 6, data not shown). Superposition of the 357 Cα positions of the well ordered residues (Table 2) further illustrates this point. In the case of the H168F mutant, the His-318 side chain is rotated around χ1 and χ2 to avoid repulsive interactions. Even for the double mutant H168A/H318A, neither a structural collapse nor conformational adaptations in neighboring side chains are seen, indicating that the pore structure is intrinsically very rigid. The glutamate at position 168, which could be present in its protonated or charged form, appears as a very good mimic of the substituted imidazole. It occupies almost the same space, and its carboxylate is coplanar with the imidazole of His-318 and makes a hydrogen bond to its δ1 nitrogen. In its protonated state, it also could act as hydrogen bond acceptor or donor for water/ammonium in the pore, depending on the tautomeric state of the two side chains. His-168 and His-318 Are Essential for Optimum Substrate Conductance—The remarkable conservation of the two pore histidines led to the hypothesis that they play a key role in allowing the substrate to cross the central part of the channel (4Winkler F.K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 451: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M.

Their precise function, whether to serve as proton acceptors for an entering ammonium ion, or more simply, to shape the pore and balance its polarity, has remained an open question, and no experimental data were available to confirm their proposed essential role. We assessed the transport activities of each of the variants and detected no AmtB activity with any of them, except H168E, when using 20 μm methylammonium as substrate (Fig. 4). As described in detail previously (10Javelle A. Thomas G. Marini A.M. Kramer R. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), in these assays, we measure both initial influx of methylammonium driven by the concentration gradient (AmtB activity) and its subsequent metabolic trapping by glutamine synthetase (GS activity). The H168E variant had a reduced but significant activity (25 ± 5%) when compared with wild type. No GS activity, in terms of conversion of methylammonium to methylglutamine, was detected in any case (Fig. 4) despite the level of GS protein and its distribution within the cell being equal to that of wild type in all strains (Figs. 1B and 2B). We have previously shown that GS activity is closely coupled to AmtB function (10Javelle A. Thomas G. Marini A.M. Kramer R. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of this coupling is unknown. We hypothesize that t"

J., Hinkhouse, M. M., Grady, M., Gaut, A. W., Liu, J., Zhang, Y., Weydert, C. J. D., Domann, F. E., and Oberley, L. W. (2003) Cancer Res. 63, 5513–5520). Although dicumarol has been used as an inhibitor of the two-electron reductase NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), dicumarol is also thought to affect quinone-mediated electron transfer reactions in the mitochondria, leading to the production of superoxide ( O2·¯ ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We hypothesized that mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species mediates the increased susceptibility of pancreatic cancer cells to dicumarol-induced metabolic oxidative stress. Dicumarol decreased clonogenic survival equally in both MDA-MB-468 NQO1– and MDA-MB-468 NQO1+ breast cancer cells. Dicumarol decreased clonogenic survival in the transformed fibroblast cell line IMRSV-90 compared with the IMR-90 cell line. Dicumarol, with the addition of mitochondrial electron transport chain blockers, decreased clonogenic cell survival in human pancreatic cancer cells and increased superoxide levels. Dicumarol with the mitochondrial electron transport chain blocker antimycin A decreased clonogenic survival and increased superoxide levels in cells with functional mitochondria but had little effect on cancer cells without functional mitochondria. Overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase and mitochondrial-targeted catalase with adenoviral vectors reversed the dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity and reversed fluorescence of the oxidation-sensitive probe. We conclude mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species mediates the increased susceptibility of cancer cells to dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity. Dicumarol is a naturally occurring anticoagulant derived from coumarin that induces cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in human pancreatic cancer cells (Cullen, J. J., Hinkhouse, M.

We conclude mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species mediates the increased susceptibility of cancer cells to dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity. Dicumarol (3,3′-methylenebis[4-hydroxycoumarin]) is a naturally occurring anticoagulant derived from coumarin that is obtained from the sweet clover (Melilotus alba) (1Madari H. Panda D. Wilson L. Jacobs R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1214-1220PubMed Google Scholar, 2Keating G.J. O'Kennedy R. O'Kennedy R. Thornes R.D. Coumarins: Biology, ApplicationsMode of Action. John Wiley & Sons, West Sussex, England1997: 23-64Google Scholar). Coumarin and its compounds have demonstrated numerous antitumor and antiproliferative effects. Studies have shown that coumarin compounds inhibit proliferation of human malignant cell lines in vitro (3Marshall M.E. Mohler J.L. Edmonds K. Williams B. Butler K. Ryles M. Weiss L. Urban D.

Dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity is not from interference with vitamin K epoxide oxidoreductase or a previously unrecognized aspect of vitamin K metabolism, since the addition of vitamin K does not impair the growth inhibiting effect of dicumarol. The growth inhibitory effect of dicumarol may also be relatively specific for tumor cells, since proliferation of normal human airway myocytes is not affected (9Brar D.D. Kennedy T.P. Whorton A.R. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20017-20026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although such coumarin compounds as dicumarol have been utilized in cancer therapy, little is known about the mechanism of action of these drugs. NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) is responsible for the two-electron reduction of quinones using NADPH or NADH as an electron donor (10Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Talalay P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Dicumarol inhibits NQO1 resulting in increased oxidative stress within the cell, leading to increased cell toxicity (11Hollander P.M. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Josoda S. Nakamura W. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that dicumarol causes cytotoxicity against human pancreatic cancer cells that have overexpression and increased activity of NQO1 (13Cullen J.J. Hinkhouse M.M. Grady M. Gaut A.W. Liu J. Zhang Y. Weydert C.J.D. Domann F.E. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5513-5520PubMed Google Scholar). Dicumarol increased intracellular levels of superoxide ( O2·¯ ), as measured by hydroethidine staining, and inhibited cell growth. Both of these effects (cell growth inhibition and hydroethidine staining) were blunted with infection of an adenoviral vector containing the cDNA for manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), 2The abbreviations used are: Mn-SOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; METC, mitochondrial electron transport chain; mitCAT, mitochondrially targeted catalase; AntA, antimycin A; Myx, myxothiazol; O2·¯ , superoxide anion radical; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; DCFDA, carboxymethyl dichlorofluorescein (DCF) diacetate; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; pHPA, para-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species. a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme that scavenges O2·¯ . This study compliments the recent study from Li et al. (14Li N. Ragheb K. Lawler G. Sturgis J. Rajwa B. Melendez J.A. Robinson J.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that similar compounds as dicumarol result in increased mitochondrial O2·¯ production leading to apoptosis, whereas others have demonstrated that dicumarol acts intracellularly to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation at the NADH-cytochrome b5 site (15Collier A.C. Pristos C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that mitochondrial metabolism might be involved in the process that caused cytotoxicity with dicumarol treatment even though the majority of NQO1 is found in the cytoplasm (16Lewis A. Ough M. Du J. Tsao M.S. Oberley L.W. Cullen J.J. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 43: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Winski S.L. Koutalos Y. Bentley D.L. Ross D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1420-1424PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic oxidative stress results from an imbalance between prooxidants (i.e. superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, etc.) produced as byproducts of oxidative metabolism and the cellular antioxidants that eliminate these species. Studies to determine whether oxidative stress from mitochondrial metabolism was the mechanism responsible for dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity were accomplished. Dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity of MIA PaCa-2 cells was accompanied by a dose-dependent and time-dependent increase in apoptosis as measured by flow cytometry and diaminobenzidine staining, which was associated with cytochrome c release from mitochondria and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (18Lewis A. Ough M. Li L. Hinkhouse M.M. Ritchie J.M. Spitz D.R. Cullen J.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4550-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that dicumarol treatment in these human tumor cells caused cytotoxicity as well as activation of mitochondrial signaling and pathways thought to be involved with cell death. We hypothesized that mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species mediates the increased susceptibility of pancreatic cancer cells to dicumarol-induced metabolic oxidative stress. The current studies demonstrate that the presence or absence of NQO1 did not alter dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity but decreased clonogenic survival in transformed cell lines to a greater degree than normal cells. We also demonstrated that mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species mediates the increased susceptibility of cancer cells to dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity in a series of three experiments. First, we demonstrated dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity, and increased superoxide levels were enhanced with the addition of mitochondrial electron transport chain (METC) blockers in cancer cell lines. Second, dicumarol with the addition of METC blockers induced cytotoxicity and increased superoxide levels in cells with functional mitochondria but had little effect on cancer cells without functional mitochondria. Finally, overexpression of Mn-SOD and mitochondrial-targeted catalase with adenoviral vectors reversed the dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity and decreased ROS levels. Cell Culture—MIA PaCa-2 (undifferentiated) and AsPC-1 (poorly to moderately differentiated) cells, human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MIA PaCa-2 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2.5% horse serum. AsPC-1 was maintained in RPMI 1640 with 20% heat-inactivated bovine serum and 1% sodium pyruvate. Control MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and the isogenic cell line MDA-MB-468 stably transfected with constitutive NQO1 expression vector under the control of a CMV promoter were generous gifts from Dr. David Boothman, University of Texas Southwestern and were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (19Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Dr. Michael King (Thomas Jefferson University) kindly provided the human osteosarcoma 143BTK-rho(+) and rho(0) cells (20King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IMR90 human lung fibroblasts and their SV40-transformed counterparts (IMR90-SV40) were gifts from Dr. Douglas Spitz, University of Iowa, and were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 1× MEM vitamins, 1× MEM essential amino acids, and 2× nonessential amino acids, with 20% fetal calf serum and buffered with 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (21Blackburn R.V. Spitz D.R. Liu X. Galoforo S.S. Sim J.S. Ridnour L.A. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). GM00637G SV-40-transformed human fibroblasts were also a gift from Dr. Douglas Spitz and were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media was obtained from Invitrogen, and all cell lines were maintained at 37 °C. All cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma and only utilized when found to be negative. Generation of rho(0) Cells—To determine the role of mitochondrial electron transport chain activity in dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity and ROS production, human osteosarcoma cells (143BTK-rho(+) and rho(0) cells) (20King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and MIA PaCa-2 rho(0) cells depleted of mitochondria DNA were generated by incubating wild type cells (rho+) for 6–8 weeks with 100 ng/ml ethidium bromide. The medium was supplemented with 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 50 μg/ml uridine, and 100 μg/ml pyruvate to compensate for the respiratory metabolism deficit as described (22Vaquero E.C. Edderkaoui M. Pandol S.J. Gukovksy I. Gukovskaya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34643-34654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). After selection, the MIA PaCa-2 rho(0) cells were cultured in the above-specified medium without ethidium bromide. To verify the mitochondria DNA depletion, PCR demonstrated an absence of mitochondria DNA in rho(0) cells as described (22Vaquero E.C. Edderkaoui M. Pandol S.J. Gukovksy I. Gukovskaya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34643-34654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Clonogenic Cell Survival Experiments—At the beginning of each experiment, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in media supplemented with 2% serum as previously described (19Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Control and treatment cultures were treated identically. Dicumarol (50–100 μm) was added to cell cultures after a 50 mm concentration of dicumarol was dissolved in water by the dropwise addition of 0.1 n NaOH. The addition of up to 2.5 μl of this solution/ml (250 μm highest final concentration) did not change the pH of complete medium. Cultures were then placed in an incubator, and at each time point cells were trypsinized, counted, diluted, and plated for clonogenic cell survival assay as previously described (13Cullen J.J. Hinkhouse M.M. Grady M. Gaut A.W. Liu J. Zhang Y. Weydert C.J.D. Domann F.E. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5513-5520PubMed Google Scholar). Surviving colonies were fixed and stained after 7–10 days and counted under a dissecting microscope. Cell Viability—As an indicator of cell metabolic viability, the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used. Cells were seeded at 1 × 104 in a 96-wellplate in full media. 5 mg/ml MTT was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Lysing buffer consisting of 20% SDS in a 1:1 solution of N,N-dimethyl formamide was added and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The plate was read at 590 nm on an Ultramark microplate imaging system (Bio-Rad). Drug Treatment—Drugs were added to cells at final concentrations of 10 μm antimycin A (AntA), 50 μm myxothiazol (Myx), 50 μm rotenone, and 2 μm dinitrophenol. Stock solutions of all drugs were obtained from Sigma, dissolved in Me2SO, and used without further purification. All cells were incubated in media containing 2% serum with different drugs for the specified times. Transduction of Adenoviral Vectors Containing Antioxidant Enzymes—To determine whether O2·¯ or H2O2 were responsible for the cytotoxic effects of dicumarol, we transduced MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells with adenovirus constructs containing antioxidant enzymes. The adenovirus constructs used were replication-defective, E1- and partial E3-deleted recombinant adenovirus (23Zwacka R.M. Dudus L. Epperly M.W. Greenburger J.S. Engelhardt J.F. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Inserted into the E1 region of the adenovirus genome are the human antioxidant genes (Mn-SOD, CuZn-SOD, mitCAT, CAT) or BglII, all of which are driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Except for AdmitCAT, the adenovirus constructs were originally prepared by John Engelhardt, University of Iowa (23Zwacka R.M. Dudus L. Epperly M.W. Greenburger J.S. Engelhardt J.F. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A plasmid with the full-length catalase cDNA with the Mn-SOD mitochondrial leader sequence added to the construct was originally prepared by Dr. Andres Melendez (24Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Approximately 106 MIA PaCa-2 cells were plated in 10 ml of complete media in a 100-mm2 plastic dish and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were then washed 3 times in serum- and antibiotic-free media. The adenovirus construct(s), suspended in 3% sucrose, was then applied to cells suspended in 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free media. Control cells are treated with the adenovirus-BglII construct. Cells were incubated with the adenovirus constructs for 24 h. Media was then replaced with 4 ml of complete media for an additional 24 h before cells were harvested. Measurement of Prooxidant Levels—Prooxidant levels (presumably H2O2) were measured at various time intervals by labeling cells for 15 min at 37 °C using the oxidation sensitive (C-400; 5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and insensitive (C-369; 5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate) fluorescent dyes dissolved in Me2SO with flow cytometric analysis as described (13Cullen J.J. Hinkhouse M.M. Grady M. Gaut A.W. Liu J. Zhang Y. Weydert C.J.D. Domann F.E. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5513-5520PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidation insensitive probe was utilized to control for changes in uptake, ester cleavage, and efflux so that differences in fluorescence could definitively be attributed to changes in oxidation of the probe. Intracellular generation of the O2·¯ was assessed using hydroethidine fluorescence. O2·¯ reacts with hydroethidine to form oxidized products, which bind to nuclear DNA and form red fluorescent complexes. The fluorescence of hydroethidine-labeled cells was quantitated using flow cytometry. Cells were grown to subconfluence in 60-mm dishes and initially treated with or without drugs for the specified time, washed, and incubated with hydroethidine (10 μm) for 40 min. The cells were removed by trypsinization, which was neutralized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum and then analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Bioscience FACScan). Intracellular hydroperoxide production was estimated by adding 10 μm DCFDA (C-400) to cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, cells were harvested using a cell scraper and transferred to a collection tube along with the floating cells in the incubation buffer. After centrifugation, supernatant was removed by aspiration; cells were lysed with 200 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation, the fluorescence levels in cell lysates were measured with a TECAN Spectrafluor Plus (excitation 485 nm, emission 535 nm). Extracellular H2O2 production was determined using a fluorometric assay (25Hyslop P.A. Sklar L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Incubation of H2O2 with horseradish peroxidase in the presence of para-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid (pHPA) (Sigma) results in the formation of a fluorescent pHPA dimer. Cells were treated with 50 μm dicumarol at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. After the treatment the cells were washed with phenol red-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. To the cells were added 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 6.5 mm glucose, 1 mm HEPES, 6 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1.6 mm pHPA, and 0.95 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. H2O2-induced pHPA dimer formation was measured with a spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B) (excitation 323 nm, emission 400 nm). H2O2 production was estimated by constructing a standard curve using known H2O2 concentrations. Cell Homogenization and Protein Determination—Cells were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0), scraped from the dishes using a rubber policeman, and then collected in phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). This was followed by sonic disruption on ice for 30 s in 10-s bursts using a VibraCell sonicator (Sonics and Materials Inc., Danbury, CT) at 100% power. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford dye-binding protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Analysis—Immunoreactive protein corresponding to antioxidant enzymes was identified and quantified from total cell protein by the specific reaction of the immobilized protein with its antibody. Total protein was electrophoresed in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide running gel and a 5% stacking gel. The proteins were then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose sheets. After blocking in 20% fetal bovine serum for 1 h, the sheets were washed and then treated with antisera to either Mn-SOD (1:1000), CuZn-SOD (1:500), or catalase (1:1000). Polyclonal rabbit-anti-human antibodies to Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD have been prepared and characterized in our laboratory (26Cullen J.J. Weydert C. Hinkhouse M.M. Ritchie J.M. Domann F.E. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1297-1303PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody for catalase was purchased from Athens, Inc. (Athens, GA). The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (Sigma) IgG (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The washed blot was then treated with ECL Western blot detection solution (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film. All Western blots were performed in duplicate. Enzyme Activity—Superoxide dismutase activity was measured using an indirect competition assay between SOD and an indicator molecule, nitro blue tetrazolium (26Cullen J.J. Weydert C. Hinkhouse M.M. Ritchie J.M. Domann F.E. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1297-1303PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium cyanide (5 mm) inhibits CuZn-SOD; therefore, activity measured in the crude homogenate in the presence of sodium cyanide indicates only Mn-SOD activity. Specific activity was reported as units/mg of protein. Catalase activity was measured by the method of Beers and Sizer (27Beers Jr R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the analysis of Aebi (28Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18934) Google Scholar). All measurements were normalized to protein content using the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.G. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the catalase assay is a spectrophotometric procedure that measures peroxide removal. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by means of Systat (Systat inc., Evanston Ill). A single factor ANOVA, followed by post-hoc Tukey test, was used to determine statistical differences between means. All means were calculated from three experiments, and error bars represent standard error of mean (S.E.). All Western blots were repeated at least twice. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. The Effects of Dicumarol Are Independent of NQO1 Status— NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), a homodimeric, ubiquitous, flavoprotein, catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. This reaction prevents the one-electron reduction of quinones by cytochrome P450 reductase and other flavoproteins that results in oxidative cycling with generation of ROS. Previous studies have suggested that selective inhibition of NQO1 with dicumarol alters the malignant phenotype of tumor cells with high NQO1 levels (13Cullen J.J. Hinkhouse M.M. Grady M. Gaut A.W. Liu J. Zhang Y. Weydert C.J.D. Domann F.E. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5513-5520PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role of NQO1 in dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity in our model system, clonogenic cell survival, cell viability, and hydroethidine fluorescence were determined in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, and the isogenic cell line MDA-MB-468 was stably transfected with constitutive NQO1 after treatment with dicumarol 50 μm for 4 and 24 h (Fig. 1). Dicumarol (50 μm) decreased cell viability and clonogenic survival in a similar time-dependent manner in both the NQO1– and NQO1+ cell lines. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward increased cell viability (Fig. 1A) and clonogenic survival (Fig. 1B) after treatment with dicumarol 50 μm for 24 h in the NQO1+ cell line, which may be attributed to the antioxidant properties of NQO1 (30Siegel D. Gustafson D.L. Dehn D.L. Han J.Y. Boonchoong P. Berliner L.J. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Treatment with higher doses of dicumarol (100 and 250 μm) and longer times (24 and 48 h) also did not demonstrate any difference in cell viability or clonogenic survival between the NQO1– and NQO1+ MDA-MB-468 cell lines (data not shown). Additionally, hydroethidine fluorescence as an indicator of supeoxide levels was not significantly different between cell lines after 4 h of dicumarol treatment (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the data in the clonogenic survival, hydroethidine fluorescence was somewhat higher in the NQO1–cell lines and lower in the NQO1+ cell line, which may be due to the antioxidant properties of NQO1. Dicumarol-induced Cytotoxicity Is More Profound in Human Transformed Cells than Untransformed Cells—Transformed cells have been found to be more susceptible to oxidative stress than untransformed cells (31Spitz D.R. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Galoforo S.S. Lee Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of dicumarol on transformed versus untransformed cells, IMR90 human lung fibroblasts and their SV40-transformed counterparts (IMR90-SV40) were treated with dicumarol (50 and 100 μm) for 24 h (Fig. 2). Although dicumarol had little effect on clonogenic survival in the IMR90 fibroblast cell line, dicumarol had a profound effect in decreasing clonogenic survival in the IMR90-SV40-transformed cell line, resulting in no colony formation when 100 μm was given for 24 h. Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Blockers Enhance Dicumarol-induced Cytotoxicity—Previous investigations have demonstrated that dicumarol acts intracellularly to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation at the NADH-cytochrome b5 site (15Collier A.C. Pristos C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The effect of mitochondrial electron transport chain blockers on dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity was determined in MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells and in GM00637G SV40-transformed human fibroblasts (Fig. 3). MIA PaCa-2 cell survival decreased after 4 h of dicumarol (50 μm) in the presence of antimycin A, myxothiazol, and rotenone, relative to control, but these drugs were not toxic by themselves during this time frame (Fig. 3A). No toxicity was seen in cells treated with dinitrophenol in the presence of dicumarol. In the GM00637G cells there was a more dramatic decrease in clonogenic survival after treatment of dicumarol (50 μm) in the presence of antimycin A, myxothiazol, and rotenone (Fig. 3B). Once again, dinitrophenol in the presence of dicumarol had little effect on clonogenic survival. Time Course of Dicumarol-induced Cytotoxicity in the Presence of AntA—Dicumarol toxicity in MIA PaCa-2 cells in the presence of 10 μm antimycin A demonstrated time-dependent (0–24 h) increases in cytotoxicity. Again, 10 μm antimycin A was not toxic to the cells until after 24 h of treatment. The data in Fig. 3C demonstrate the time course of cytotoxicity seen during dicumarol treatment in MIA PaCa-2 cells in the presence of AntA. These data support the hypothesis that blocking the mitochondrial electron transport chain will contribute to dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity. Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Blockers Enhance Dicumarol-induced Cytotoxicity and Prooxidant Production— To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial electron transport chain blockers enhance levels of intracellular prooxidants and associated cytotoxicity, cells were labeled with hydroethidine, and fluorescence was quantitated using flow cytometry. The human pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 were treated with dicumarol (50 μm) alone, antimycin A (10 μm), and the combination of both drugs, and clonogenic survival and hydroethidine were measured (Fig. 4). Cells treated with dicumarol for 4 h in the presence of AntA demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity as well as increases in mean fluorescence intensity when labeled with hydroethidine. Fig. 4A demonstrates clonogenic survival in the MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line after treatment with dicumarol, antimycin, or the combination of drugs for 4 h. As previously demonstrated, dicumarol (50 μm) alo"

We report that murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) proliferate in response to EGF only when these cells express the urokinase receptor (uPAR). EGFR expression was equivalent in uPAR−/− and uPAR+/+ MEFs. In response to EGF, these cells demonstrated equivalent overall EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK/MAP kinase activation; however, phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in the EGFR, which has been implicated in cell growth, was substantially decreased in uPAR−/− MEFs. STAT5b activation also was decreased. As Tyr-845 is a c-Src target, we overexpressed c-Src in uPAR−/− MEFs and rescued EGF mitogenic activity. Rescue also was achieved by expressing murine but not human uPAR, suggesting a role for autocrine uPAR cell-signaling. In MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells, EGF mitogenic activity was blocked by uPAR gene silencing, with antibodies that block uPA-binding to uPAR, and with a synthetic peptide that disrupts uPAR-dependent cell signaling. Again, c-Src overexpression rescued the mitogenic activity of EGF. We conclude that uPAR-dependent cell-signaling may prime cells to proliferate in response to EGF by promoting Tyr-845 phosphorylation and STAT5b activation. The importance of this pathway depends on the c-Src level in the cell."

Reduction of TMAO in trimethylamine (TMA) is mainly performed by the respiratory TMAO reductase. This system is encoded by the torCAD operon, which is induced in the presence of TMAO. This regulation involves a two-component system comprising TorS, an unorthodox histidine kinase, and TorR, a response regulator. A third protein, TorT, sharing homologies with periplasmic binding proteins, plays a key role in this regulation because disruption of the torT gene abolishes tor expression. In this study we showed that TMAO protects TorT against degradation by the GluC endoproteinase and modifies its temperature-induced CD spectrum. We also isolated a TorT negative mutant that is no longer protected by TMAO from degradation by GluC. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed that TorT binds TMAO with a binding constant of 150 μm. Therefore, we conclude that TorT binds TMAO and that this binding promotes a conformational change of TorT. We also showed that TorT interacts with the periplasmic domain of TorS in both the presence and absence of TMAO but the TorT-TMAO complex induces a higher GluC protection of TorS than TorT alone. These results support the idea that TMAO binding to TorT induces a cascade of conformational changes from TorT to TorS, leading to TorS activation. We identified several homologues of the TorT protein that define a new family of periplasmic binding proteins. We thus propose that the members of this family bind TMAO or related compounds and that they are involved in signal transduction or even substrate transport.

Stewart V. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 217-261Google Scholar). Reduction of TMAO in trimethylamine (TMA) mainly involves the TMAO reductase system. This respiratory system comprises three proteins: TorC, TorA, and TorD. The TorC protein is a pentahemic c-type cytochrome anchored to the membrane and oriented toward the periplasmic compartment. The TorA protein, located in the periplasm, is the terminal reductase and receives the electrons from TorC (2Gon S. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11545-11551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). TorD is a cytoplasmic protein that acts as both a specific chaperone and an escort protein for TorA, allowing TorA maturation and protection before its translocation into the periplasm by the Tat system (3Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Genest O. Seduk F. Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Tor respiratory system is encoded by the torCAD operon that is induced in the presence of TMAO (7Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The TMAO control is strict because there is almost no expression of the tor operon in the absence of TMAO. The three genes torS, torT, and torR, located upstream of the tor operon, are involved in this regulation. Disruption of either one of these genes abolishes tor operon induction. The torS and torR genes encode a two-component regulatory system in which TorS is an unorthodox sensor containing three phosphorylation sites and TorR a response regulator of the OmpR family (8Simon G. Méjean V. Jourlin C. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5601-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Jourlin C. Bengrine A. Chippaux M. Méjean V. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At its N-terminal extremity, TorS contains a large detector region of about 300 residues oriented toward the periplasm and flanked by two transmembrane segments. The cytoplasmic part of TorS comprises three domains, each of them containing a phosphorylation site: the N-terminal transmitter domain contains the primary site of phosphorylation (His443), the central receiver domain possesses a phosphorylable aspartate (Asp723), and the C-terminal alternative transmitter domain bears the phosphodonor site for TorR (His850) (10Jourlin C. Ansaldi M. Méjean V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon detection of the signal, TorS autophosphorylates on His443. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to Asp723 and subsequently to His850. Thereafter, the phosphoryl group on His850 is transferred onto Asp53 of the N-terminal receiver domain of TorR (10Jourlin C. Ansaldi M. Méjean V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, TorR binds to decameric direct repeats, called tor boxes and located in the intergenic torC-torR region, to activate tor operon expression (11Simon G. Jourlin C. Ansaldi M. Pascal M.C. Chippaux M. Méjean V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TorS can also dephosphorylate phospho-TorR when TMAO is exhausted. Dephosphorylation is a rapid process occurring by reverse phosphorelay (12Ansaldi M. Jourlin-Castelli C. Lepelletier M. Théraulaz L. Méjean V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2691-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The torT gene is the third gene required for tor operon induction (13Jourlin C. Simon G. Pommier J. Chippaux M. Méjean V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is located between the torS and torR genes and encodes a periplasmic protein of 36 kDa. Genetic evidence showed that TorT acts upstream of the TorS/TorR two-component system but its precise role is yet unknown. Interestingly, TorT shares weak homologies with periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs). These proteins are especially known to bind substrates and to allow their transport via ABC-type transporters (14Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Felder C.B. Graul R.C. Lee A.Y. Merkle H.P. Sadee W. AAPS PharmSci. 1999; 1: E2Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Substrates include mono- and oligosaccharides, amino acids, oligopeptides, ions, metals, and vitamins (14Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many PBPs have been crystallized and their structures solved. These studies have revealed a common structure consisting of two globular lobes connected by a hinge region with the ligand-binding site located at the interface between the two domains (16Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 19Pang A. Arinaminpathy Y. Sansom M.S. Biggin P.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PBPs can be found in two conformations: a ligand-free open conformation and a ligand-bound closed conformation. Therefore PBPs undergo a conformational change upon binding of the substrate. In addition to their role in transport, certain PBPs also proved to be involved in signal transduction by directly interacting with transmembrane sensors. The ChvE sugar-binding protein of Agrobacterium tumefaciens interacts with the VirA sensor to enhance induction of the vir genes in the presence of monosaccharides (20Cangelosi G.A. Ankenbauer R.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26552-26558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently three others PBPs, CBP in Vibrio furnissii, LuxP in Vibrio harveyi, and BctC in Bordetella pertussis, proved to be involved in signal transduction by interacting with the periplasmic domain of their sensor partners (22Li X. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The PBPs were classified in several families according to the nature of the bound substrate (14Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PBPs of a given family share similar molecular masses and present sequence similarities located, in particular, in their N-terminal regions. TorT does not belong to any previously described family but shares weak homologies with the RbsB ribose-binding protein of E. coli and with uncharacterized PBPs (13Jourlin C. Simon G. Pommier J. Chippaux M. Méjean V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide biochemical, biophysical, and genetic evidence that the TorT protein binds TMAO and interacts with the detector region of the TorS sensor. We also show that, upon binding of the TorT-TMAO complex, the TorS detector region undergoes a conformational change that probably activates it as a kinase. Finally we show that TorT belongs to a new family of PBPs. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. To maintain plasmid selection, ampicillin and kanamycin were added at 50 and 25 μg/ml, respectively. When necessary, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at 1 mm to induce gene expression.TABLE 1Strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidGenotype and/or characteristicRef. or sourceStrainMC4100araD139 Δ(lacIPOZYA-argF) U169 rpsL thiLaboratory collectionLCB620MC4100 torA8::MudII 1734 (torA′-′lacZ)7Méjean V.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Strains were grown overnight anaerobically in LB at 37 °C. Values represent the average of three independent experiments with a variation of no more than 15% from the mean. When necessary, ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and TMAO (10 mm) were added. Construction of the torT Deletion Mutant (LCB982)—We used the method described by Datsenko and Wanner (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11149) Google Scholar) to delete the chromosomal copy of torT gene of strain LCB620 (torA′-′lacZ). This method consists of the replacement of the gene to be inactivated by a DNA fragment generated by PCR and allowing resistance to an antibiotic. The primers used for PCR were 60 nucleotides long and included 40-nucleotide homology extensions corresponding to the 5′ extremity or the 3′ region of the torT gene and 20-nucleotide priming sequences that hybridized to the resistance gene of plasmid pKD3 (Cmr). Detailed information on the primer sequences are available on request. The PCR products were incubated with DpnI to eliminate remaining plasmid DNA and used to transform strain LCB620 harboring the λ Red helper plasmid pKD46, which permits recombination. The resulting strain was named LCB982 and has a deletion of the first 737 bases of the 1029 bases of torT gene. Construction of Plasmids—To construct plasmid pET-Tp, allowing overproduction of a C-terminal His6-tagged recombinant TorT protein, the torT coding sequence was amplified from MC4100 chromosomal DNA by PCR. We used a primer that contains a SmaI site followed by the 5′ coding sequence of torT and a primer that contains a SmaI site followed by a sequence encoding a His6 tag and a sequence complementary of the 3′ end of torT. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the PCR products were cloned into the corresponding SmaI site of vector pET21. To construct plasmid pET-TL80P, allowing overproduction of a N-terminal His6-tagged recombinant TorT protein, the torT gene truncated of the sequence encoding the signal peptide was amplified from pJF-TL80P plasmidic DNA by PCR. We used a primer that contains an NcoI site followed by a sequence encoding a His6 tag and by the 5′ coding sequence of torT and a primer that contains a HindIII site followed by a sequence complementary of the 3′ end of torT. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the PCR products were cloned into the corresponding sites of vector pET28. To construct plasmid pJF-Tp, the torT coding sequence was amplified from MC4100 chromosomal DNA by PCR. We used a primer that contains an EcoRI site followed by the 5′ coding sequence of torT and a primer that contains a SmaI site followed by a sequence encoding a His6 tag and a sequence complementary of the 3′ end of torT. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the PCR products were cloned into the corresponding sites of vector pJF119EH. Detailed information on all primer sequences are available on request. All plasmid inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transformations were performed by the method of Chung and Miller (27Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Isolation of torT Negative Mutant—For random mutagenesis, the torT coding sequence was amplified from MC4100 chromosomal DNA by PCR using the same primers as for the construction of pJF-Tp. To allow the introduction of mutations in the torT sequence, three successive rounds of PCR amplification (30 cycles each) were performed. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the PCR products were cloned into the corresponding EcoRI and SmaI sites of vector pJF119EH. Ligation products were then transformed in strain LCB982 (torA′-′lacZ) and the resulting colonies were screened on MacConkey plates. On MacConkey agar supplemented with lactose and TMAO, strains that produced wild type TorT proteins yielded red colonies (Lac+), whereas strains that produced TorT negative mutant proteins, that did not induce the torA′-′lacZ fusion, yielded white or pale colonies (Lac–). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—TorT was produced from strain BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid pET-Tp. The recombinant strain was grown aerobically until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8 unit. Overproduction of the protein was then induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 4 h at 37°C. The proteins were purified from the soluble fraction obtained after French press treatment of the cells in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) followed by two successive centrifugations (18,000 × g for 10 min and 120,000 × g for 90 min). The soluble fraction was equilibrated in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing NaCl (500 mm) and imidazole (5 mm) and loaded onto a HiTrap™-chelating Ni2+ column (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with a step gradient of imidazole ranging from 20 to 500 mm. TorT was recovered in the 300 mm imidazole fraction. The proteins were then dialyzed against phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol. TorTL80P was produced from strain BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid pET-TL80P. The proteins were purified with the same protocol used for TorT except that they were recovered from the pellet obtained after centrifugation (18,000 × g for 10 min) by using 8 m urea. TorSN was produced from strain BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid pET-Sp and purified as described by Gon et al. (28Gon S. Jourlin-Castelli C. Théraulaz L. Méjean V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11615-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TorSN polypeptide corresponds to the His-tagged periplasmic N-terminal domain of TorS (position 17–319). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectra—CD measurements were performed with a Jasco J-810 instrument equipped with a Peltier-type temperature control system (model PTC-348WI) with a 0.2-mm path length. Far UV spectra of purified TorT protein (80 μg/ml in phosphate buffer, 20 mm, pH 7.4) were monitored at 25 °C from 195 to 260 nm at 0.2 nm/min and were averaged from three independent acquisitions. The thermal stability of TorT secondary structure (80 μg/ml) was monitored at 222 nm over the range 25–80 °C at 1 °C/min. The mean residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded at 0.2 °C intervals. The α-helical content was derived from the ellipticity at 222 nm as described in Morris et al. (29Morris M.C. Mery J. Heitz A. Heitz F. Divita G. J. Pept. Sci. 1999; 5: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The experimental data, i.e. plots of the observed ellipticity (θ) against temperature (T), were fitted with the data analysis program SigmaPlot to the equation reported by Tan et al. (30Tan Y.J. Oliveberg M. Davis B. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 980-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Limited Proteolytic Digestion—TorT (wild type or mutant) and TorSN, together or separately, were subjected to proteolysis with endoproteinase GluC (V8, type XVII-B; Sigma). Digestions were carried out with purified proteins in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. TorT (7.4 μm) and/or TorSN (7.8 μm) were incubated 10 min in the presence or absence of TMAO (10 mm) and endoproteinase GluC was then added at a protein/enzyme mass ratio of 4/1 for TorT digestion, 20/1 for TorSN digestion, and 4/1 for TorT-TorSN co-digestion. The reactions were stopped after various incubation times (2, 10, 30, and 60 min) by adding SDS loading buffer (133 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 3.3 mm EDTA, 0.7 mm sucrose, 0.07% bromphenol blue, 6% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1.7% β-mercaptoethanol) and by subsequently incubating the samples for 10 min at 95 °C. The samples were then analyzed on SDS-PAGE. For TorT digestion, the gel was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining, whereas for TorSN digestion and TorT-TorSN co-digestion, digestion products were first transferred to a Hybond™-ECL™ nitrocellulose membrane and detected with anti-TorS antibodies. Each experiment was repeated at least three times and gave the same profile of degradation. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C using a MicroCal MCS instrument. After purification onto HiTrap™-chelating Ni2+ column, the TorT and TorTL80P proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7). The protein concentration was 25 μm in the calorimetric cell. Each experiment consisted of 10-μl injections of 10 mm TMAO or ribose prepared in the protein dialysis buffer. The heat of dilution was measured by injecting the ligand into the protein-free buffer solution or by additional injections of ligand after saturation; the value obtained was subtracted from the heat of reaction to obtain effective heat of binding. To obtain thermodynamic parameters, titration curves were fitted to a one-site model using MicroCal Origin software. Experiments were performed twice. Native Gel Experiments—TorT (11.1 μm) and TorSN (11.7 μm) were incubated together or separately in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of 10 mm TMAO for 20 min at room temperature. Native sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added to the samples before loading onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The migration pattern was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Chemical Cross-link Studies—Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, Pierce), which is a homobifunctional NHS-ester, was used as a cross-linker. TorT (8.3 μm) and TorSN (8.8 μm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate buffer with DSG (5 mm) in the presence or absence of 10 mm TMAO. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were excised from the polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis. They were digested overnight by trypsin and subsequently analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (Voyager DE-RP). Proteins were then identified by comparison with the protein databases using the Mascot program. Biosensor Experiments—The BIAcore apparatus (surface plasmon resonance) was used to analyze, in real time, the binding between TorSN and TorT. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. The TorSN polypeptide was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium formate buffer (pH 4.5) and subsequently immobilized on a sensor chip CM5 through amine coupling, using 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) as running buffer. For this purpose, the dextran matrix was first activated with 50 μl (5 μl/min) of a mixture of 200 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hypochloride and 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide. TorSN (4.7 μm) was injected during 6 min (5 μl/min) and the reaction was further stopped with 50 μl of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, resulting in ∼4500 resonance units of immobilized protein. TorT at various concentrations, in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol, was injected during 2.5 min (10 μl/min). The running buffer used was 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl. When indicated, TorT was first preincubated for 5 min with 0.1 or 1 mm TMAO prior to the injection. As a control, the same experiments were carried out without immobilizing protein on the sensor chip. Analysis of the sensorgram, after subtraction of the control, was carried out with the evaluation software (BIAevaluation 2.1, BIAcore) to calculate the kinetic constants of the complex formation. The kinetic data were interpreted on the basis of the simple binding model A + B ↔ AB (one analyte A reacts with a single site on the immobilized ligand B). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant KD was calculated from the ratio koff/kon. Bioinformatical Procedures—Amino acid sequence of TorT from E. coli was used to perform a Psi-Blast on the non-redundant protein databases via the Infobiogen server. Multiple alignment was performed using ClustalW on the Infobiogen server. Biochemical Evidence of the Formation of a TorT-TMAO Complex—TMAO is the inducer of the torCAD structural operon and this induction requires the TorS/TorR two-component system and the TorT periplasmic protein. We hypothesized that TMAO could be directly detected either by the TorS sensor via its N-terminal region or by the periplasmic TorT protein. In the latter case, we assumed that the phosphorelay could then be activated by the interaction of the TorT-TMAO complex with the TorS sensor. To determine which of the TorT or TorS proteins binds TMAO, the TorT protein and the periplasmic domain of TorS (hereafter called TorSN) were overproduced and purified. These two proteins were His-tagged at their C-terminal extremity to facilitate the purification procedure. The purified proteins were then subjected to limited proteolytic digestion by the endoproteinase GluC in the presence or absence of TMAO. The samples were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE. When the TorT protein was incubated with GluC in the absence of TMAO, it was progressively degraded (Fig. 1A). The amount of the entire protein diminished and several proteolytic products appeared. After 1 h of incubation, the band corresponding to intact TorT had almost disappeared. In contrast, when the TorT protein was incubated with 10 mm TMAO prior to the addition of GluC, it was subjected to less degradation as after 1 h of incubation a large amount of the entire protein was still present (Fig. 1A). Moreover, in the presence of TMAO, the digestion pattern of TorT remained unchanged from 2 to 30 min of incubation with GluC. This result shows that TorT becomes resistant to endoproteinase GluC digestion in the presence of TMAO. This strongly suggests that TorT binds TMAO and that this binding modifies the conformation of TorT, allowing TorT to resist proteolysis. In contrast, TorSN exhibits the same sensitivity to GluC with or without TMAO. Indeed, the TorSN polypeptide was already cleaved into several products and the full-length polypeptide was almost undetectable after 10 min of incubation with GluC, with or without TMAO (Fig. 1B). When TorSN was incubated for 1 h with GluC, it was entirely degraded whether TMAO was present or not prior to the addition of GluC. The fact that TMAO did not modify the patterns of TorSN proteolysis suggests that TorS does not detect TMAO directly (Fig. 1B). Genetic Evidence That TorT Is a TMAO-binding Protein—If TorT is a TMAO-binding protein, it should be possible to isolate TorT mutant proteins unable to bind TMAO and therefore to activate the tor operon expression. We performed random mutagenesis of the torT gene by successive rounds of PCR amplification. The mutated PCR products were cloned under the control of the ptac promoter and the resulting plasmids were introduced into strain LCB982, which is deleted of the torT gene and contains a torA′-′lacZ fusion. Transformants were screened on MacConkey/lactose medium containing TMAO (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several negative mutants were isolated. One of these mutants was further characterized. Sequencing indicated that a T was substituted for a C in position 239 in the torT mutant gene, leading to the replacement of a leucine by a proline in position 80 of the protein (thereafter called TorTL80P). To confirm that the TorTL80P mutant was unable to induce tor operon expression, we measured the β-galactosidase activities of strain LCB982 containing the pJF-TL80P plasmid in anaerobiosis in the presence or absence of TMAO. As shown in Fig. 2A, no significant β-galactosidase activity could be detected in strain LCB982 containing either the pJF119EH vector or the pJF-TL80P plasmid whether TMAO was present or not. In contrast, the lacZ fusion of strain LCB982 was normally induced in the presence of TMAO when a wild type copy of torT was provided in trans whether the encoded TorT protein contained a C-terminal His6 tag (pJF-Tp) or not (pCJ6) (Fig. 2A). This result confirms that TorTL80P is unable to induce tor operon expression in the presence of TMAO. To test the ability of TorTL80P to bind TMAO, the matured protein was overproduced and subsequently purified. The purified TorTL80P protein was then subjected to limited proteolytic digestion by the endoproteinase GluC in the presence or absence of TMAO. The samples were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2B, TorTL80P exhibited the same sensitivity to GluC with or without TMAO and was rapidly degraded in several products whether TMAO was present or not. This result indicates that, in contrast to the wild type TorT prote"

Elevated Cdk activity via RB pathway mutations is observed in virtually every human cancer. Thus, Cdk inhibitors have tremendous promise as anticancer agents although detailed mechanistic knowledge of their effects on RB function is needed to harness their full potential. Here, we illustrate a novel function for Cdks in regulating the subcellular localization of RB. We present evidence of significant cytoplasmic mislocalization of ordinarily nuclear RB in cells harboring Cdk4 mutations. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism to circumvent RB-mediated growth suppression by altered nucleocytoplasmic trafficking via the Exportin1 pathway. Cytoplasmically mislocalized RB could be efficiently confined to the nucleus by inhibiting the Exportin1 pathway, reducing Cdk activity, or mutating the Cdk-dependent phosphorylation sites in RB that result in loss of RB-Exportin1 association. Thus RB-mediated tumor suppression can be subverted by phosphorylation-dependent enhancement of nuclear export. These results support the notion that tumor cells can modulate the protein transport machinery thereby making the protein transport process a viable therapeutic target.

These results support the notion that tumor cells can modulate the protein transport machinery thereby making the protein transport process a viable therapeutic target. Mutations in cell cycle components that allow cells to bypass quiescence or cellular senescence pathways are important hallmarks of a cancer cell thereby making the cell cycle machinery an important target for anti-cancer therapeutic strategies (1Malumbres M.

Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). RB is active in its hypo or underphosphorylated state whereas sequential phosphorylation of the sixteen serine/threonine residues of RB by several Cdks leads to inactivation of RB function (3Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Cdk-mediated phosphorylation alters association of RB with its myriad interacting proteins that regulate cell cycle progression and transformation potential (4Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The association of RB with E2F transcription factors is the best characterized and it is believed that phosphorylation of RB on several Cdk phosphorylation sites results in the release of E2Fs and activation or repression of target E2F-dependent promoters (5Stevens C. La Thangue N.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The normally nuclear localization of RB is facilitated by a bi-partite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C terminus (6Zacksenhaus E. Bremner R. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4588-4599Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Underphosphorylated RB remains in the nucleus via association of its N terminus with nuclear matrix proteins (7Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, G1/S phosphorylation results in decreased affinity of hyperphosphorylated RB for the nuclear compartment (8Mittnacht S. Weinberg R.A.

Cell Res. 1993; 204: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mechanistic details that govern the fate of this hyper-phosphorylated RB species and its physiological relevance in relation to RB tumor suppressor function have been obscure and are the subject of this report. We and others have previously shown that inheritance of a p16Ink4a-insensitive Cdk4Arg24Cys(R24C) allele results in increased Cdk4 kinase activity because of loss of p16Ink4a inhibition thereby increasing the transformation potential of cells and predisposing mice harboring this mutation to cancer because of loss of RB tumor suppressor function (11Rane S.G.

Here, we investigated whether the deregulated Cdk activity, often associated with hyperphosphorylation of RB, might alter RB subcellular localization and thereby compromise its tumor suppressor function. We present evidence of cytoplasmic mislocalization of RB generated via enhanced Exportin1-mediated nuclear export. Our results reveal a simple mechanism by which RB-mediated tumor suppression can be subverted during cancer progression by Cdk phosphorylation-dependent enhancement of nuclear export. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments and Plasmids—Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (11Rane S.G. Dubus P. Mettus R.V. Galbreath E.J. Boden G. Reddy E.P. Barbacid M. Nat.

As described previously (11Rane S.G. Dubus P. Mettus R.V. Galbreath E.J. Boden G. Reddy E.P. Barbacid M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 12Rane S.G. Cosenza S.C. Mettus R.V. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell.

MEFs were treated with flavopiridol and cells were monitored for viability using the WST-1 assay (Roche Applied Science). Results presented are average of triplicate with standard deviations. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions of cells either untreated or treated with 10 nm or 30 nm LMB (L2913, Sigma) for 5 h were prepared using NE-PER™ reagent (Pierce), and 30-μg aliquots were used for immunoblot analysis. Cells were treated with 10 and 30 nm LMB and incubated for 2-5 h followed by immunofluorescence assay. GFP-Cdk4R24C was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the Cdk4 cDNA to convert arginine at position 24 to cysteine followed by cloning into GFP vector (Clontech) and sequence analysis to confirm mutagenesis. GFP and GFP-Cdk4 were used as controls. GFP-Rev, GFP-RB, GFP-RBWTLP, and GFP-RB7LP (14Angus S.P. Solomon D.A. Kuschel L. Hennigan R.F. Knudsen E.S. Mol.

Med. 2004; 10: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunofluorescence—For immunoprecipitation (IP), 300 μg of total protein was incubated with indicated antibodies and protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) followed by Western blot analysis (WB) using the indicated antibodies. For immunofluorescence (IF), cells were seeded onto collagen I-coated 8-well Biocoat culture slides and were fixed in 1 or 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with either acetone (2 min) or methanol (2 min). After antibody incubation and mounting in DAPI-containing medium cells were observed on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with a Photometric CCD camera. Localization was determined by scoring nuclear/cytoplasmic and nuclear profiles from at least 100 cells of each sample treatment. Antibody sources are: monoclonal anti-RB antibody (1:200 dilution for IF, 1 μg for WB and 2 μg for IP; clone G3-245; BD/Pharmingen; epitope amino acids (aa) 332-344 of human RB protein); monoclonal anti-RB antibody (1:200 for IF; clone 4H1; Cell Signaling Technology, which recognizes a.a 701-928 of human RB protein), monoclonal underphosphorylated-RB (1:100 for IF, 1:2000 for WB), phospho-RB780, (1:100 for IF, 1:2000 for WB), phospho-RB807/811 (1:100 for IF, 1:2000 for WB) polyclonal antibodies from Cell Signaling; monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (1:8000, Sigma); polyclonal and monoclonal anti-E2F-1 (1:200 for IF and WB, Santacruz), polyclonal antiexportin1 (1:200 for WB, Santacruz, sc5595; H300); Lamin A/C (1:400 for WB) polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; monoclonal and polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (1:200 for WB) from BD Biosciences and Alexa-fluor secondary antibodies (1:500 for IF) from Molecular Probes. Transient Transfection and Reporter Assays—Cells were seeded into 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. The synthetic E2F reporter (pE2F-LUC) (16Gaubatz S. Wood J.G. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9190-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the natural Cyclin E promoter, (pCE-LUC) (1 μg each) was transfected into cells. Transfection was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 24 h after transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Lysates were assayed for luciferase activity and normalized to total protein concentration. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated 2-3 times. The results shown are the mean ± S.E. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) Assay—Total RNA was extracted using the TRI® reagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). RT-PCR was performed using One Step RNA PCR Kit (AMV) (TAK RR024A, TaKaRa Biomedicals, TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primer sequences were based on cDNA sequences corresponding to each of the genes analyzed, and these primer pairs were selected with the help of PrimerExpress 1.0 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GAPDH (Acc M32599) 5′-ATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGAGAC-3′ and 5′-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3′; TopoII-alpha (Acc U01915) 5′-GATTCAGCCTTGAGTGCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGCAAGTCACAAGTTGGAAT-3′; Bcl-2 (Acc M16506) 5′-GAATGAACGGTGACGTACGTACAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGAGCGCAGGCATGGATCCGTA-3′; Importin-alpha2 (Acc BC003274) 5′-GCTTTCTAGAGAGAAACAGCCTCC-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCACAAGTTGGGGAACAACT-3′. All samples were performed at least in duplicate. FRAP—Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed on Zeiss 510 confocal microscope with a ×100/1.3 N.A. planapochromat oil objective. GFP was excited with the 488 nm line of Ar laser and GFP emission was monitored above 505 nm. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with a Nevtek ASI 400 Air Stream incubator (Nevtek). In transfected cells a square spot of ∼5 μm inside the nucleoplasm was bleached for ∼600 ms using the 488-nm laser line at 100% laser power. Cells were monitored at 0.5-s intervals for 123 s. For quantitation, the total fluorescent intensities of a region of interest in the bleached area and in the total nuclear area were monitored using Zeiss software. Background fluorescence (BG) was measured in a random field outside the cells. The relative fluorescence intensity double normalized to the pre-bleach value was calculated at each time point as: Irel = (To - BG) × (I(t)-BG)/(T(t) - BG) × (Io - BG) where To is the average intensity of the entire nucleus during pre-bleach, and Io is the average intensity of the region of interest during pre-bleach. For quantification 15 cells were used. Heterokaryon Fusion Assay—To detect nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, a heterokaryon fusion assay was performed essentially as we have described earlier (15Nicot C. Dundr M. Johnson J.M. Fullen J.R. Alonzo N. Fukumoto R. Princler G.L. Derse D. Misteli T. Franchini G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cdk4R/R cells, grown to about 85% confluence, were electroporated with a BTX electroporator ECM 830 using 5 μg of GFP-RB or GFP-Rev and 15 μg sheared salmon sperm carrier DNA in a 2-mm gap cuvette at 200 V, 1-ms pulse, 4 pulses and 0.5-s intervals and transferplated on microscopic slides in 6-well plates. 4-h later, RB mutant human SAOS-2 cells were seeded onto the same chambers. SAOS-2 is a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line, which lacks full-length nuclear RB and produces instead a mutant 90kd RB protein that is localized to the cytoplasm (17Shew J.Y. Lin B.T. Chen P.L. Tseng B.Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were washed thoroughly with pre-warmed PBS and treated with 25 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma) for 30 min to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. After aspirating the medium containing cycloheximide, cells were washed with PBS and immediately overlaid with a solution of 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG; Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 90 s to induce cell fusion. The cells were then extensively washed with PBS to completely remove all traces of PEG and transferred back to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS containing 25 μg/ml of cycloheximide for 70 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI. These cells were then viewed using Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope with ×100/1.4 N.A. planapochromat objective. Data were collected via Zeiss/LSM510 software. Live Time-lapse Confocal Microscopy—Cdk4R/R cells were transfected with either GFP-RB or red fluorescent protein (DsRed2) expression vectors followed by mixing the transfected cells as described previously (15Nicot C. Dundr M. Johnson J.M. Fullen J.R. Alonzo N. Fukumoto R. Princler G.L. Derse D. Misteli T. Franchini G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The following day, 30 min before fusion with polyethylene glycol cells were incubated with cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) to prevent de novo protein synthesis. After fusion, cells were maintained in cycloheximide and observed immediately by live time-lapse confocal microscopy. To evaluate the export process, cells were treated with 30 nm LMB for 3 h before fusion and maintained in the presence of LMB after fusion and analyzed as above. Nucleocytoplasmic Localization of RB—Western blot analyses demonstrate that compared with the low level of RB in Cdk4WT cells, Cdk4R24C/R24C (Cdk4R/R) cells exhibit increased levels of RB with a substantial fraction of RB in its hyperphosphorylated form (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses of nucleocytoplasmic fractions revealed that in contrast to the exclusively nuclear RB in Cdk4WT cells, RB is detected in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of Cdk4R/R cells (Fig. 1B). These results were verified using immunofluorescence assays which revealed normal nuclear localization of RB and E2F1 in Cdk4WT cells (Fig. 1D). In Cdk4R/R cells, although E2F1 was predominantly nuclear, we observed dispersed nucleocytoplasmic localization of RB and substantial free cytoplasmic RB (Fig. 1D). Quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence data revealed that in comparison to the nearly exclusive nuclear localization of RB and phospho-RB in Cdk4WT cells, greater that 95% Cdk4R/R cells harbored nucleocytoplasmically localized RB and phospho-RB (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Consistent with the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A), quantification of relative fluorescence intensities over the subcellular compartments revealed that Cdk4R/R cells harbored elevated level of RB and phospho-RB (Fig. 1C, lower panel). The observation of cytoplasmic RB is intriguing since RB is widely believed to be a nuclear protein and nuclear retention is presumed to be important for its tumor suppressor function. To rule out the contribution of fixation and permeabilization conditions in the observed nucleocytoplasmic localization of RB, we performed immunofluorescence assays on Cdk4R/R cells under a variety of fixation/permeabilization conditions. Nucleocytoplasmic RB localization was reproducibly observed in Cdk4R/R cells after fixation in 1% or 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with either acetone (2 min) or methanol (2 min) (supplemental Fig. S1). Further, the reproducibility of RB nucleocytoplasmic localization was verified under the different fixation/permeabilization conditions using two monoclonal RB antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes (supplemental Fig. S1). Finally, antibody specificity was verified using RB-deficient (RB-/-) cells where the immunofluorescence signal was comparable to background fluorescence observed in cells treated with only secondary antibodies (supplemental Fig. S1). Together, these studies demonstrate the existence of nucleocytoplasmically localized RB species in Cdk4R/R cells. Consistent with our prior published work demonstrating the increased transformation potential of the Cdk4R24C mutation (12Rane S.G. Cosenza S.C. Mettus R.V. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we observed deregulated E2F activity in Cdk4R/R cells. Enhanced activity of the synthetic E2F-reporter and that of the promoter for the E2F target gene Cyclin E was observed in Cdk4R/R cells (Fig. 1E). Further, elevated levels of E2F target genes (18Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4684-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 19Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), TopoII-α, Importin-α2, BCL2 were observed in Cdk4R/R cells (Fig. 1F). RB phosphorylation occurs at each G1/S transition in normal and cancer cells. Previously, it has been shown using WI-38 normal human lung fibroblasts that the conversion from low salt resistant to low salt extractable hyperphosphorylated RB occurs with transition through the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle (8Mittnacht S. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 10Stokke T. Erikstein B.K. Smedshammer L. Boye E. Steen H.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To monitor whether there was a correlation between RB subcellular localization and position in the cell cycle, we performed immunofluorescence experiments on synchronized cell populations. WI-38 normal human fibroblasts, normal Cdk4WT cells and Cdk4R/R cells were synchronized by serum starvation and stimulated to enter the cell cycle with 10% serum containing media as described previously (11Rane S.G. Dubus P. Mettus R.V. Galbreath E.J. Boden G. Reddy E.P. Barbacid M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 12Rane S.G. Cosenza S.C. Mettus R.V. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Propidium iodide-based fluorescence activated cell sorting assays showed evidence of equivalent numbers of Cdk4WT and Cdk4R/R cells in G1 and S phase of the cell cycle (supplemental Table S1). Immunofluorescence assays were performed using RB antibodies on cell preparations during serum starvation and after serum stimulation. These analyses revealed that RB is confined to the nucleus in normal human (WI-38) and mouse (Cdk4WT) fibroblast cells during all stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of RB (p-RB) in Cdk4WT cells was evident 24 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 2). In contrast, almost 60% of Cdk4R/R cells harbored nucleocytoplasmic localization of RB between 8-12 h after serum stimulation with majority of RB in a phosphorylated state (Fig. 2). A fraction (33%) of Cdk4R/R cells showed evidence of phosphorylated RB after the 72-h serum starvation (time 0) and throughout the course of the serum stimulation experiment (Fig. 2). It is unclear whether the observed phospho-RB in Cdk4R/R cells at time 0 reflects a pool of cells that are refractory to growth arrest or a property unique to Cdk4R/R cells. Taken together, these observations are indicative of an important role for the Cdk4R24C mutation in mediating changes in subcellular localization of RB. Cdk-mediated Phosphorylation Regulates RB Subcellular Localization and Function—Predominantly underphosphorylated RB and low levels of phosphorylated RB are observed in Cdk4WT cells (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, increased phosphorylation of RB at sites Ser780, Ser807, and Ser811 was observed in Cdk4R/R cells (Fig. 1, A and B; data not shown) with the phosphorylated RB proteins dispersed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). More interestingly, confinement of majority of underphosphorylated RB in Cdk4R/R nuclei (Fig. 3A) suggested that only phosphorylated species of RB could exit the nucleus. We next investigated the requirement for Cdk activity in determining the nucleocytoplasmic localization of RB. Treatment of Cdk4R/R MEFs with flavopiridol, an inhibitor of phosphokinases with strongest activity against Cdks (20Sedlacek H.H. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2001; 38: 139-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), was accompanied by nuclear retention of RB (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this, RB was exclusively nuclear in Cdk4KO cells that lack Cdk4 activity (Fig. 3C) further validating the importance of Cdk4 activity in regulating the subcellular localization of RB. Cdk4R/R cells that harbor nucleocytoplasmically distributed RB exhibit increased cell proliferation rate and enhanced tumorigenesis potential in xenograft-tumor assays (12Rane S.G. Cosenza S.C. Mettus R.V. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Treatment with the Cdk-inhibitor flavopiridol, which caused increased nuclear retention of RB in these cells (Fig. 3C), resulted in reduced viability of Cdk4R/R cells (Fig. 3B). Because there is evidence for both Cdk mediated RB-dependent and RB-independent mechanisms of action involving the anti-tumoral effect of flavopiridol (20Sedlacek H.H. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2001; 38: 139-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), it is plausible that some of the flavopiridol-mediated effects observed here are RB-independent. Together, these results indicate that RB cytoplasmic mislocalization can be effectively reversed by inhibition of Cdk activity. Phosphorylation of C-terminal Residues of RB Determines Its Subcellular Localization—RB is nuclear in Cdk4KO cells that lack Cdk4 kinase activity (Fig. 3C). Rescue of Cdk4 activity in Cdk4KO cells, by expressing the p16-insensitive activated Cdk4R24C kinase, resulted in efflux of RB from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). Similar nucleocytoplasmic RB localization was also seen in Cdk4WT cells transfected with Cdk4R24C expression vectors (Fig. 4A). In contrast, Cdk4KO or Cdk4WT cells transfected with control vectors or vectors expressing wild type Cdk4 showed a typical nuclear RB (Fig. 4A). These observations emphasize the requirement for increased Cdk activity in regulating the cytoplasmic localization of RB. We next postulated that specific Cdk-phosphorylation sites on RB determine its observed cytoplasmic mislocalization. Sixteen potential Cdk phosphorylatable serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) residues span the RB protein (3Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Six of these sites are in the N terminus that has been previously implicated in mediating interactions of RB with the nuclear lamina (7Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Ten remaining phosphorylation sites are located in the large pocket of RB (RB-LP). RB-LP comprises the A/B pocket domain separated by the linker insert domain (I) in addition to the C-terminal domain. The latter itself has seven clustered Cdk sites (3Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) including Ser780, Ser807, and Ser811, which are all phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic RB observed in Cdk4R/R cells (Figs. 1A and 3A; data not shown). Moreover, RB-LP contains the minimal functional domains required for regulated E2F1 association, transcriptional repression, cell cycle inhibition and tumor suppression (21Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Yang H. Williams B.O. Hinds P.W. Shih T.S. Jacks T. Bronson R.T. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3103-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To test the role of specific phosphoresidues in the subcellular localization of RB, we studied the localization of a phosphomutant of the RB large pocket (GFP-RB7LP with mutations of all seven C-terminal phosphorylation sites) fused to the GFP (14Angus S.P. Solomon D.A. Kuschel L. Hennigan R.F. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 8172-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in Cdk4R/R cells. As controls we monitored the localization of wild-type RB (GFP-RB) and wild-type RB-LP (GFP-RBWTLP). Equal amounts of GFP-RB, GFP-RBWTLP and GFP-RB7LP were transfected into Cdk4R/R cells (Fig. 4D). Nucleocytoplasmic localization of GFP-RB and GFP-RBWTLP was observed (Fig. 4, B and C). This was consistent with the similar nucleocytoplasmic localization of endogenous RB in Cdk4R/R cells (Figs. 1, 2 and 3). In contrast, a dramatic nuclear confinement of GFP-RB7LP was seen (Fig. 4, B and C) indicating that these phosphorylation residues in the C-domain of RB are critical in determining its nucleocytoplasmic localization. Phosphorylation-dependent Association of RB with Exportin1—Nuclear export of the tumor suppressor proteins p27Kip1, APC, Smad4(DPC4), and p53 is known to inactivate their tumor suppressor function (23Kastan M.B. Zambetti G.P. Cell. 2003; 112: 1-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We reasoned that RB might be subject to similar nucleocytoplasmic shuttling that might influence its tumor suppressor function. Therefore, we next delineated the mechanism of RB nucleocytoplasmic localization by hypothesizing that RB, phosphorylated on its C-domain residues by Cdks in the nucleus, is subsequently exported to the cytoplasm. We examined this hypothesis by studying the involvement of nuclear export in the subcellular localization of RB. The karyopherin family of nuclear export receptors (31Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), notably Exportin1 (CRM1) (32Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), are involved in trafficking of diverse substrates across the nuclear membrane. Whereas, we detected no major change in the levels of Exportin1 RNA (Fig. 5A), a 2-fold increase in Exportin1 protein level was observed (Fig. 5B), and Western blot analysis of nucleocytoplasmic fractions revealed an increased cytoplasmic Exportin1 expression in Cdk4R/R cells (Fig. 5C). Since RB elicits many of its functions via interaction with its associated proteins (33Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), we next asked if Exportin1 associated with RB. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed an association between the endogenous RB and Export"

The functions of glycine receptor (GlyR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor are modulated by G protein βγ subunits. The molecular determinants for this functional modulation, however, are still unknown. Studying mutant receptors, we identified two basic amino acid motifs within the large intracellular loop of the GlyR α1 subunit that are critical for binding and functional modulation by Gβγ. Mutations within these sequences demonstrated that all of the residues detected are important for Gβγ modulation, although both motifs are necessary for full binding. Molecular modeling predicts that these sites are α-helixes near transmembrane domains 3 and 4, near to the lipid bilayer and highly electropositive.

These homologous receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (1Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principles of Neural Science.

Inhibitory GlyRs are critical for the control of excitability in the mammalian spinal cord and brain stem. Binding of glycine to the extracellular region induces a rapid increase in Cl- ion conductance, generating a hyperpolarization of the cell membrane (3Legendre P. Cell Mol.

Berger A.J. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Like all members of the LGIC superfamily, GlyRs are pentamers composed of five subunits in which each subunit possesses four transmembrane domains arranged to form the ion pore. In this structure, the individual subunits provide extracellular and intracellular domains that play roles in ligand binding and intracellular modulation, respectively (1Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principles of Neural Science. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2000: 207-228Google Scholar, 2Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

The function of GlyRs can be effectively modulated by extracellularly acting compounds like strychnine, picrotoxin, zinc ions, and ethanol (3Legendre P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 760-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 4Aguayo L.G. van Zundert B. Tapia J.C. Carrasco M.A. Alvarez F.J. Brain Res. Brain Res.

Miller P.S. Neuroscientist. 2004; 10: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the receptor can also be modulated by intracellular signaling. One of the most studied and recognized pathways involved in regulation of ligand-gated ion channel function are phosphorylation processes through protein kinases. Indeed, GlyR and other members of the LGIC superfamily are modulated by activation of cAMP-dependent kinases and protein kinase C (10Smart T.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This involves specific serine residues in the loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (6Harvey R.J. Depner U.B. Wassle H.

On the other hand, recent reports have shown that the activity of GlyRs and nAChRs can be modulated by G protein βγ subunits in a phosphorylation-independent manner (15Fischer H. Liu D.M. Lee A. Harries J.C. Adams D.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3571-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Yevenes G.E. Peoples R.W. Tapia J.C. Parodi J. Soto X. Olate J. Aguayo L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In both cases, activation of G proteins, using nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs or by application of purified Gβγ dimers, generates a strong enhancement in the agonist-evoked current, related to a shift to the left in the agonist concentration-response curve and an increased open channel probability (15Fischer H. Liu D.M. Lee A. Harries J.C. Adams D.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3571-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Yevenes G.E. Peoples R.W. Tapia J.C. Parodi J. Soto X. Olate J. Aguayo L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the molecular determinants involved for this modulation are unresolved. On the other hand, some molecular characteristics for binding and modulation of Gβγ to other effector proteins are better understood (17Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 18Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 19Dolphin A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 607-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In fact, previous studies implicated the presence of basic amino acids, such as lysine and arginine, in the modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels, phospholipase Cβ, and β-adrenergic receptor kinases (20De Waard M.

Furthermore, similar results were obtained with mutations in the N-terminal region and in the cytoplasmic linker between the first and second transmembrane repeats of voltage-gated calcium channels (19Dolphin A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 607-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P.

In the present study, we have examined the molecular determinants for G protein modulation of the human GlyR α1 subunit. The present study shows that most of the large intracellular loop is not involved in the modulation. We identified two basic amino acid motifs within the loop of the GlyR as critical for binding and functional modulation by Gβγ dimers. Acidic residues, on the other hand, are not important for this regulation. These results provide novel information about the Gβγ modulatory sites in the GlyR, a member of the LGIC superfamily, and also demonstrate a new role for specific residues in the intracellular loop for the GlyR function. cDNA Constructs—The cDNA construct encoding the human glycine receptor α1 subunit with a C-terminal hexahistidyl tag has been described previously (25Sadtler S. Laube B. Lashub A. Nicke A. Betz H. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This construct was first subcloned in a pCI vector (Promega) for expression in HEK 293 cells. Mutations were inserted using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the constructions were confirmed by sequencing. The glycine receptor amino acids were numbered according to their position in the mature protein sequence. pEYFP-Gβ1 and pECFP-Gγ2 expression vectors were kindly provided by Stephen R. Ikeda (National Institutes of Health) (27Ruiz-Velasco V. Ikeda S.R. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). G protein β1-FLAG and G protein γ2 were purchased from UMR cDNA resource center. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were cultured using standard methodologies. HEK 293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of DNA for each plasmid studied per well. Expression of GFP was used as a marker of positively transfected cells, and recordings were made after 18-36 h. Electrophysiology—Whole cell recordings were performed as previously described (16Yevenes G.E. Peoples R.W. Tapia J.C. Parodi J. Soto X. Olate J. Aguayo L.G. Nat.

Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1036-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A holding potential of -60 mV was used. Patch electrodes were filled with 140 mm CsCl, 10 mm 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm GTP. The external solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10 mm glucose. For G protein activation experiments, GTPγS (0.5 mm) was added directly to the internal solution, replacing GTP. The amplitude of the glycine current was assayed using a short (1-2 s) pulse of 30-40 μm glycine every 60 s as previously described (16Yevenes G.E. Peoples R.W. Tapia J.C. Parodi J. Soto X. Olate J. Aguayo L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Strychnine (1 μm) blocked all of the current elicited by wild type and mutant glycine receptors (not shown). Construction of Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down Assays—DNA fragments encoding wild type and mutant GlyR intracellular loops were subcloned in the GST fusion vector pGEX-5X3 (GE Healthcare). GST fusion proteins were generated in Escherichia coli BL21 using 50 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 6 h, the cells were collected and sonicated in lysis buffer (1× phosphate buffer, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture set II (Calbiochem)). Subsequently, the proteins were purified using a glutathione resin (Novagen). Normalized amounts of GST fusion proteins were incubated with purified Gβγ protein (10 ng; Calbiochem). Incubations were done in 800 μl of binding buffer (200 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture set II) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed five times in binding buffer, and bound proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Bound Gβγ was detected using a Gβ antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a chemiluminiscence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, the relative amounts of Gβγ were quantified by densitometry. Similar conditions have been used to study the interaction between Gβγ and other effector proteins (15Fischer H. Liu D.M. Lee A.

Immunofluorescence, Visualization, and Analysis—HEK 293 cells were first fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and were then permeabilized (0.3% Triton X-100, 30 min) and blocked (10% normal horse serum, 60 min). Subsequently, all night incubation with a monoclonal FLAG (Stratagene) and polyclonal hexahistidine antibodies (His-Tag; U.S. Biological) was carried out. Epitope visualization was performed incubating the sample with two secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3 (1:600; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Finally, the cells were coverslipped using fluorescence mounting medium (Dako Cytomation; Dako). For quantitative analysis, the cells were chosen randomly for imaging using a Nikon confocal microscopy. Stacks of optical sections in the z axis were acquired, and dual color immunofluorescent images were captured in simultaneous two-channel mode. Colocalization was studied by superimposing both color channels. The cross-correlation coefficient (r) between both fluorescence channels was measured using computer software (Metamorph; Universal Imaging Corp.) starting from separate immunoreactivity to GlyR-His and Gβ1-FLAG in the same cell (39Agnati L.F.

The theoretical maximum for (r) is 1 for identical images, and a value close to 0 implies a complete different localization of the labels. Subsequently, the obtained data were compiled, analyzed, and plotted. Molecular Modeling—The GlyR model was constructed by homology using coordinates from the Torpedo nAchR at 4 A° resolution (28Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N.

The ligand-binding segment of the GlyR was modeled from the acetylcholine-binding protein structure (30Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K.

Data Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA and are expressed as the arithmetic means ± S.E.; values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For all of the statistical analysis and plots, the Origin 6.0 (MicroCal) software was used. The normalized values were obtained by dividing the current amplitude obtained with time of dialysis by the current at minute one.

Effects of G Protein Activation on Wild Type and Truncated Human α1 Glycine Receptor Subunits—The currently accepted topology of the LGIC superfamily predicts that the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 is the region for interaction and regulation by intracellular pathways, including receptor phosphorylation (10Smart T.G.

Noteworthy, Ser391 was the first residue in this sequence reported to be modulated by phosphorylation by protein kinase C (13Ruiz-Gomez A. Vaello M.L. Valdivieso F. Mayor F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 559-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic loop polypeptide contains ≈84 amino acids (Fig. 1A), which can present alternative splicing. Therefore, we examined the sensitivity of a recently identified α1 splicing variant, in which the sequence between residues Glu326 and Lys355 was deleted (24Inoue K. Ueno S. Yamada J. Fukuda A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), to Gβγ modulation (Fig. 1A). In addition, we constructed a truncated GlyR, in which the whole sequence between residues Glu326 and Gln382 was deleted (Fig. 1A). As previously reported (16Yevenes G.E. Peoples R.W. Tapia J.C. Parodi J. Soto X. Olate J. Aguayo L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the amplitude of the glycine-activated current in human wild type GlyRs was strongly enhanced above control (80 ± 10%, n = 18) after 15 min of intracellular dialysis with GTPγS (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, similar effects were found on Δ326-355 and Δ326-382 truncated GlyRs (Fig. 1, B and C), and no statistical differences were detected (Fig. 1C). Thus, these data indicate that the whole deleted sequence between residues 326 and 382 is not a critical determinant for Gβγ modulation and directs further analysis toward other regions in the intracellular loop. Two Basic Motifs Are Critical for G Protein βγ Functional Modulation of Glycine Receptors—Studies on the molecular determinants involved in the binding and modulation by G protein βγ to several proteins have shown the existence of key basic amino acids (19Dolphin A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 607-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6855-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the large intracellular loop of the GlyR has a high density of residues, such as lysine and arginine (23 of 84), with several in a cluster near the transmembrane domain 3 (TM3), 316RFRRKRR (Fig. 2A). This cluster was found to be important for correct membrane topology of GlyRs (25Sadtler S. Laube B. Lashub A. Nicke A. Betz H. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of this motif on the G protein modulation, we studied mutant GlyRs in which these basic residues, together with a phenylalanine, were replaced by alanines. The data shows that GTPγS-mediated current enhancement was significantly attenuated in the 316-320A (11 ± 9%, n = 10) and the 316-322,325A (8 ± 11%, n = 8) mutants (Fig. 2, B-D). On the other hand, the data in Fig. 2 (B-D) show that mutations in an acidic motif (326EDE) near this basic cluster did not affect the receptor sensitivity to modulation (70 ± 13%, n = 8). The finding that GTPγS affected the 316-320A and 316-322,325A mutants in a similar fashion (Fig. 2D) suggests that residues 316-320 are the main determinants for Gβγ modulation. Nevertheless, the GlyR intracellular loop has two other pairs of basic residues near the C-terminal (377RK385KK; Figs. 1A and 2A), and we studied the functional importance of those residues on receptor modulation. Interestingly, the alanine replacement of these four residues also significantly attenuated the effect of G protein activation (-5 ± 7%, n = 8), in a similar way to the 316-320A mutant (Fig. 2, B-D). It is known that Gβγ overexpression can induce tonic modulation of Ca+2, GIRK channels, and GlyRs (16Yevenes G.E. Peoples R.W. Tapia J.C. Parodi J. Soto X. Olate J. Aguayo L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 27Ruiz-Velasco V. Ikeda S.R. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of wild and mutant GlyRs to display this phenomenon. In these experiments, the concentration-response relationship for the wild type α1 GlyRs was shifted to the left after Gβγ dimers were coexpressed, as reflected by a significant reduction in its EC50 (-32 ± 4%) with respect to control cells (Fig. 3). Tonic modulation was absent in the 316-320A; 377-378, 385-386A (9 ± 12% and 12 ± 14%, respectively), which is in line with the loss of glycine-activated current potentiation after GTPγS dialysis. Other constructs where the basic residues were retained displayed normal tonic modulation after Gβγ coexpression (Fig. 3). Regarding the cell surface expression of these functional constructs, we found that with the exception of the 316-320A (25Sadtler S. Laube B. Lashub A. Nicke A. Betz H. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), all of the mutants studied displayed very similar maximal current values. For example, the amplitude of the maximal current (Imax) elicited by 1 mm glycine was 3339 ± 460 pA (n = 13) for the 377-378, 385-386A mutant, which was not significantly different from wild type GlyRs (3647 ± 394 pA, n = 23). On the other hand, although the truncated GlyRs showed lower Imax relative to wild type (Δ326-382, 1584 ± 210 pA, n = 11), the G protein modulation was unchanged. Thus, these data suggest that the elimination of G protein βγ modulation is independent of changes on cell surface expression. Thus, all of the above shows the importance of the basic residues in the functional G protein βγ modulation of GlyRs. To identify critical amino acids involved in the G protein modulation, we carried out a mutagenesis scanning in these two regions found to be important for modulation. For the 316RFRRK cluster, all single point mutations showed marked attenuations in the potentiating effect produced by the GTP analog, compared with the wild type GlyRs (Fig. 4A). For example, the potentiation for R316A was 40 ± 17% (n = 5), whereas the effect for K320A was only 29 ± 13% (n = 8). Interestingly, the mutation F317Q also altered the modulation (29 ± 14%, n = 5) implicating hydrophobic residues, in addition to basic ones, in the modulatory effects. Double mutants RK319-320A and RR316,318A were also less affected than the wild receptor (27 ± 8%, n = 6 and 33 ± 14%, n = 7, respectively) but were no different from the point mutants (Fig. 4, A and B). On the other hand, for the basic residues detected near the C-terminal region, no potentiation was detected in the double mutant 385-386A (2 ± 6%, n = 9), suggesting a critical role for the 385KK residues (Fig. 4, C and D). Subsequent studies with the point mutations K385A and K386A showed significant attenuations (3 ± 4%, n = 6 and 32 ± 16%, n = 5, respectively), confirming an important role for the 385KK motif for this intracellular regulation. Altogether, the data show the main importance of the basic motifs 316RFRRK and 385KK in the Gβγ modulation of GlyRs, suggesting that all of these residues are necessary for the functional effect. Basic Motifs Are Involved in the Protein Interaction between Gβγ and Glycine Receptor—To determine whether the intracellular motifs identified are necessary for the binding of Gβγ to the GlyR, we constructed GST fusion proteins encoding wild type and mutated forms of the GlyR intracellular loop in which the functional G protein modulation was abolished. GST fusion proteins were first expressed and purified (Fig. 5A), and then in vitro binding assays were performed using purified Gβγ, under conditions that warrant the native conformation of the heterodimer (15Fischer H.

Purified Chinese hamster Pex7p that had been expressed in an Sf9/baculovirus system was biologically active in several assays such as those for PTS2 binding and assessing the restoration of the impaired PTS2 protein import in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) pex7 mutant ZPG207. Pex7p was eluted as a monomer in gel filtration chromatography. Moreover, the mutation of the highly conserved cysteine residue suggested to be involved in the dimer formation did not affect the complementing activity in ZPG207 cells. Together, Pex7p more likely functions as a monomer. Together with PTS1 protein, the Pex7p-PTS2 protein complex was bound to Pex5pL, the longer form of Pex5p, which was prerequisite for the translocation of Pex7p-PTS2 protein complexes. Pex5pL-(Pex7p-PTS2 protein) complexes were detectable in wild-type CHO-K1 cells and were apparently more stable in pex14 CHO cells deficient in the entry site of the matrix proteins, whereas only the Pex7p-PTS2 protein complex was discernible in a Pex5pL-defective pex5 CHO mutant. Pex7p-PTS2 proteins bound to Pex14p via Pex5pL. In contrast, PTS2 protein-bound Pex7p as well as Pex7p directly and equally interacted with Pex13p, implying that the PTS2 cargo may be released at Pex13p. Furthermore, we detected the Pex13p complexes likewise formed with Pex5pL-bound Pex7p-PTS2 proteins. Thus, the Pex7p-mediated PTS2 protein import shares most of the steps with the Pex5p-dependent PTS1 import machinery but is likely distinct at the cargo-releasing stage.

Okumoto K. Kinoshita N. Ghaed K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). PEX5 and PEX7 are causal genes for peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation groups 2 and 11, encoding the PTS1 and PTS2 receptors, respectively (9Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C.S. Moser A.

Pex5p and Pex7p, a Trp-Asp motif (WD) protein, recognize their cargoes in the cytoplasm and transport them to peroxisomes. We reported earlier that mutations in Pex7p such as L292ter, G217R, A218V, and W221ter abrogate the binding to Pex5pL (see below) and PTS2 (14Mukai S. Ghaedi K. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

Two isoforms of Pex5p, termed Pex5pS and Pex5pL, with 37-amino acid insertions, are identified in mammals (10Otera H. Okumoto K. Tateishi K. Ikoma Y. Matsuda E. Nishimura M. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Ohashi K. Higuchi O. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 388-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pex5pL forms a complex with Pex7p-PTS2, being exclusively responsible for PTS2 protein import (15Matsumura T. Otera H. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21715-21721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, Pex5pL has distinct domains, including the N-terminal region for Pex7p-PTS2 binding and the C-terminal TPR motifs responsible for binding to PTS1 (16Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, whether Pex5pL simultaneously transports both PTS1 and PTS2 cargoes has not yet been elucidated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pex7p-PTS2 complexes are translocated to peroxisomes by Pex18p-Pex21p complexes (17Purdue P.E. Yang X. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), apparently the functional homologue of mammalian Pex5pL. Pex5pL docks with Pex14p to form complexes comprising Pex14p-Pex5pL-Pex7p-PTS2 (18Otera H. Harano T. Honsho M. Ghaedi K. Mukai S. Tanaka A. Kawai A. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21703-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Contrary to this, Pex18p-Pex21p complexes do not directly bind to Pex14p when the docking complexes consisting of the Pex7p-PTS2 protein and Pex14p are formed (19Stein K. Schell-Steven A. Erdmann R. Rottensteiner H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6056-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanism of PTS2 import is partly distinct between the yeast and mammalian cells. In this study, we attempted to address the molecular mechanisms underlying Pex7p-mediated PTS2 import. First, we made successful progress in expressing biologically active, recombinant mammalian Pex7p in an Sf9/baculovirus system. Using the purified Pex7p, we show here that Pex7p-PTS2 protein complex can be loaded onto Pex5pL together with PTS1 protein. Pex7p-PTS2 protein complexes bind to Pex14p via Pex5pL in vitro, consistent with a view depicting the docking step on peroxisome membranes in the import of PTS cargoes. Contrary to Pex5p (16Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), Pex7p directly binds to Pex13p in the presence or the absence of PTS2 proteins, suggesting PTS2 cargo release at Pex13p. Thus, the Pex5pL-dependent import of Pex7p-PTS2 protein complexes shares most of the steps with the Pex5p-mediated PTS1 import machinery but is likely distinct at the cargo releasing stage.

Preparation of Recombinant Proteins and Protein Import Complexes—For isolation of His6-PTS2-EGFP, pQE30/PTS2-EGFP in XL1-Blue strain cultured in 2× YT medium at 37 °C was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The cells were lysed by sonication in L buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. After a 1-h rotation of soluble fraction with Talon resin harboring Co2+ (BD Biosciences), unbound proteins were thoroughly washed out with L buffer. Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses each harboring His6-PEX7, FLAG-EGFP-PTS1, and FLAG-PTS2-EGFP. The cells were lysed at 48–72 h post-infection by sonication in L buffer without Triton X-100 but containing 25 μg/ml of antipain, pepstatin A, and leupeptin, and 50 units of aprotinin. From the soluble fraction, His6-Pex7p was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. FLAG-EGFP-PTS1 and FLAG-PTS2-EGFP were similarly purified using anti-FLAG immunoglobulin G (IgG) M2-agarose (Sigma) in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. Pex7p was isolated by digestion of His6-Pex7p with AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.15 m NaCl. Two FLAG-PTS model proteins, FLAG-EGFP-PTS1 and FLAG-PTS2-EGFP, were isolated by elution with FLAG peptide (Sigma). Cargo-loaded Pex5pL was prepared by pull-down with Pex5pL of FLAG-EGFP-PTS1 bound to anti-FLAG-IgG beads in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). His6-PTS2-EGFP-loaded Pex7p was isolated by incubation of Pex7p with His6-PTS2-EGFP on Talon beads and following elution with buffer B containing 0.25 m imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). His6-Pex7p was isolated from His6-Pex7p on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, as done for His6-PTS2-EGFP. His6-Pex7p-FLAG-PTS2-EGFP complexes were isolated by FLAG pull-down of FLAG-PTS2-EGFP on beads that had been incubated with His6-Pex7p in Sf9 cell lysates. His6-Pex7p-loaded GST-fused Pex13p (GST-Pex13p) and FLAG-PTS2-EGFP-His6-Pex7p-bound GST-Pex13p were prepared by GST pull-down of GST-Pex13p after incubation with His6-Pex7p and (FLAG-PTS2-EGFP)-His6-Pex7p complexes, respectively. Other recombinant proteins used in this study, including GST-Pex5pS, GST-Pex5pL, GST-Pex13p, GST-Pex14p, Pex5pL, Pex5pLMut234 with mutations at the WXXX(F/Y) motifs 2, 3, and 4, and Pex13p, were as described (16Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Five μg of recombinant Pex7p was applied onto 1.6 × 60-cm Superdex S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Elution was done at 1 ml/min and monitored at 280 nm by an AKTA system (Amersham Biosciences). Pex7p in the eluate fractions was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Pex7p antibody. Assessment of Disulfide Linkage by SDS-PAGE—HEK293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-Pex7p were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol in the presence or absence of 10 mm DTT. Pex7p was assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Pex7p antibody.

CHO pex14 mutant ZP161 stably expressing FLAG-EGFP-PTS1 was isolated in the presence of Zeocin after transfection to ZP161 of pcDNA3.1Zeo-FLAG-EGFP-PTS1. Purified soluble Pex7p was introduced into pex7 ZPG207 cells with Provectin protein delivery reagents (Imgenex). Briefly, 1 μg of Pex7p was mixed with Provectin and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. A protein-Provectin mixture was transferred onto cells (∼2 × 104) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were further cultured for 8 h, as described (20Tsukamoto T. Yokota S. Fujiki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Assays for Multiple Component Complexes—Various amounts of Pex7p-(His6-PTS2-EGFP) complexes were incubated with Pex5pL-(FLAG-EGFP-PTS1) complex bound to anti-FLAG-IgG beads, in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a protease-inhibitor mixture. FLAG-EGFP-PTS1 and His6-PTS2-EGFP were detected by immunoblotting using antibodies to FLAG and His6, respectively. Pex5pL and Pex5pLMut234 were likewise incubated with two different complexes each consisting of His6-Pex7p-bound GST-Pex13p and FLAG-PTS2-EGFP-His6-Pex7p-bound GST-Pex13p. His6-Pex7p, FLAG-PTS2-EGFP, and GST-Pex13p were assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies to Pex7p, FLAG, and Pex13p, respectively. Pex13p complexes in pex7 ZPG207 expressing Pex and PTS proteins including FLAG-Pex13p were investigated. At 12 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Pex13p was done with anti-FLAG-IgG-agarose. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. PTS2-GFP stably expressed in ZPG207 cells was detected with anti-GFP antibody. HEK293 cells transfected with HA2-EGFP-PTS1 and/or HA2-PTS2-EGFP were likewise verified at 12-h post-transfection. Protease Sensitivity Assay—Cargo-loaded Pex7p was prepared as follows. Purified Pex7p (0.1 μg) was incubated with FLAG-PTS2-EGFP (0.8 μg) bound to anti-FLAG-IgG agarose. After thorough washing, the complexes were eluted with FLAG peptide and treated with 1, 10, and 50 μg/ml of Pronase on ice for 30 min (14Mukai S. Ghaedi K. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9548-9561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Pex7p and FLAG-PTS2-EGFP were detected using antibodies to Pex7p and GFP, respectively. Pex7p was also treated with Pronase in the presence of FLAG-EGFP-PTS1 equivalent to the amount to FLAG-PTS2-EGFP. Morphological Analysis—Peroxisomes in CHO cells were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence light microscopy as described (27Okumoto K. Abe I. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25700-25710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Alexa) and Texas Red-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG antibody (Alexa). GFP and EGFP fluorescence were directly observed by fluorescence light microscopy after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (26Ghaedi K. Kawai A. Okumoto K. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression, Purification, and Antibody Preparation of Pex13p SH3 Domain—EcoRI-SalI fragment of the PCR product using a template human (Hs) PEX13 (21Toyama R. Mukai S. Itagaki A. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Wanders R.J.A. Fujiki Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with primers, HsPex13SH3-Fw and HsPex13-Rv, was ligated into the EcoRI-SalI site of pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). E. coli BL21 was transformed with pGEX6P-1-HsPex13pSH3 and grown according to the procedure recommended by the manufacture. A C-terminal part comprising amino acid residues 256–403 of HsPex13p, termed Pex13pSH3, was recovered from cell lysates by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After thoroughly washing, Pex13pSH3 was isolated by cleaving the bound GST fusion protein with Prescission protease in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Rabbit anti-Pex13p antibody was raised by conventional subcutaneous injection of Pex13pSH3 (28Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4324-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed in immunoprecipitation buffer with anti-FLAG IgG-conjugated agarose or antibodies to Pex14p and Pex13p bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Other Methods—Western blot analysis was performed as described (14Mukai S. Ghaedi K. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9548-9561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In detection by immunoblot of protein import complexes in HEK293 cells, monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and CDP-Star detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Expression and Purification of Pex7p Using Sf9 Cell/Baculovirus System—As a step to understanding at a molecular level the mechanisms of PTS2 import mediated by the PTS2 receptor, we attempted to express and purify recombinant Pex7p using an Sf9 cell/baculovirus expression system. Basically after two-step purification, soluble 40-kDa Pex7p was obtained (Fig. 1A). To assess the PTS2 receptor activity, the purified Pex7p was introduced into pex7 ZPG207 cells stably expressing PTS2-GFP (14Mukai S. Ghaedi K. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9548-9561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Ghaedi K. Kawai A. Okumoto K. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PTS2 import was restored in ZPG207 cells upon introduction of Pex7p, but not in mock-treated ZPG207 (Fig. 1B). Next, a binding assay was performed with peroxisomal matrix model proteins FLAG-EGFP-PTS1(SGLRSSKL) and FLAG-PTS2-EGFP containing a 36-amino acid presequence plus N-terminal 8-amino-acid residues (23Tsukamoto T.

Wen J.K. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on agarose beads. Pex7p was detected only in the fraction bound to FLAG-PTS2-EGFP, but not to FLAG-EGFP-PTS1 (Fig. 2A). Pex7p binding to GST-Pex5p was also verified by GST pull-down assay. Pex7p bound to Pex5pL, not to Pex5pS, only in the presence of PTS2 cargo protein, FLAG-PTS2-EGFP (Fig. 2B), consistent with our earlier observation (14Mukai S. Ghaedi K. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9548-9561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the purified recombinant Pex7p was biologically active. Furthermore, PTS2 cargo-dependent interaction between Pex7p and Pex5pL was assessed in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation assay upon their ectopic expression in CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2C). HA2-Pex5pL was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Pex7p and the endogenous thiolase precursor (Fig. 2C, lane 8) and more efficiently in the presence of excess amount of a PTS2 protein, HA2-PTS2-EGFP (lane 10), confirming the PTS2-dependent binding of Pex7p to Pex5pL.FIGURE 2Interaction of Pex7p with PTS2 proteins and Pex5p. A, in vitro binding assay of Pex7p with both types of PTS reporter proteins. Pex7p (5 μg) was incubated with FLAG-EGFP-PTS1 (1 μg) and FLAG-PTS2-EGFP (1 μg).

The parasitic kinetoplastids have a unique reliance on such processes, because their genome is organized into polycistronic transcription units in which adjacent genes are not coordinately regulated. Indeed, the number of RNA-binding proteins predicted to be encoded in the genome of kinetoplastids is unusually large, invoking the presence of unique RNA regulators dedicated to gene expression in these evolutionarily ancient organisms. Here, we report that a small CCCH zinc finger protein, TbZFP3, enhances development between life-cycle stages in Trypanosoma brucei. Moreover, we demonstrate that this protein interacts both with the translational machinery and with other small CCCH proteins previously implicated in trypanosome developmental control. Antibodies to this protein also co-immunoprecipitate EP procyclin mRNA and encode the major surface antigen of insect forms of T. brucei. Strikingly, although TbZFP3 is constitutively expressed, it exhibits developmentally regulated association with polyribosomes, and mutational analysis demonstrates that this association is essential for the expression of phenotype. TbZFP3 is therefore a novel regulator of developmental events in kinetoplastids that acts at the level of the post-transcriptional control of gene expression.

TbZFP3 is therefore a novel regulator of developmental events in kinetoplastids that acts at the level of the post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Regulatory events in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms are most commonly governed by transcriptional control. In this way transcription factors and their co-regulators can target the promoters for individual genes or coordinately regulated gene networks enabling either a specific response to an environmental change or a programmed and more widespread response through cell differentiation.Gene regulation can also operate post-transcriptionally, either at the level of RNA processing, mRNA stability, translational efficiency, protein localization, or turnover (1Moore M.J. Science. 2005; 309: 1514-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The extent of post-transcriptional control of gene expression differs between different genes, networks, cells, and organisms. One group of organisms that has an unusual emphasis on post-transcriptional control is the kinetoplastid protozoa, comprising the important human pathogens, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania sp. (2Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). These organisms, among the most evolutionarily ancient eukaryotes, are unusual in that their genome is organized into long polycistronic transcription units with tens of genes being coordinately transcribed from distant, as yet unidentified, promoters (3Berriman M.

Such co-transcribed gene clusters do not seem, in general, to be organized as co-regulated operons; instead adjacent genes can show differential gene expression, for example in different life-cycle stages. This places the emphasis of gene regulation in these organisms almost entirely at the post-transcriptional level. However, although the kinetoplastids conserve the conventional eukaryotic machinery for mRNA turnover (4Ivens A.C. Peacock C.S. Worthey E.A. Murphy L. Aggarwal G. Berriman M. Sisk E.

Science. 2005; 309: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), little is known about the specific trans-acting factors that govern developmental events at the level of gene expression. Moreover, transcriptional control has only been observed for two protein-coding transcription units in T. brucei: those encoding the variant surface glycoprotein gene (in bloodstream forms of the parasite) and procyclin genes, which encode a protein coat on the forms of the parasite found in its tsetse fly vector (reviewed in Ref. 2Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In contrast to the remainder of trypanosome transcription units these are unique in being transcribed by RNA polymerase I (5Rudenko G. Bishop D. Gottesdiener K. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4259-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Gunzl A. Bruderer T. Laufer G. Schimanski B. Tu L.C. Lee P.I. Lee M.G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).Differentiation between bloodstream and tsetse-midgut (procyclic) forms of T. brucei entails a large number of fundamental changes in these unicellular protozoa (7Matthews K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition to the aforementioned surface antigen exchange, these include changes in cell morphology (8Matthews K.R. Sherwin T. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2231-2239PubMed Google Scholar), organelle development and activity (9Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), metabolism (10Tielens A.G.M. VanHellemond J.J. Parasitol.

Usefully, if differentiation is initiated with a subtype of the bloodstream parasite population that accumulates to near homogeneity at the peak of each parasitemia (i.e. stumpy forms), then cell differentiation is almost completely synchronous in the population (15Ziegelbauer K. Quinten M. Schwarz H. Pearson T.W. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This has allowed a mapping of the events in this developmental pathway, thus revealing a high order of temporal and spatial regulation. It has also allowed the identification of molecules transiently enriched during this process. One such protein, TbZFP1, has been found to be important for repositioning of the kinetoplast (an elaborated mitochondrial genome) from the posterior end of the cell to a position midway between the nucleus and cell posterior (16Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Hendriks E.F. Matthews K.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This is one of the major morphological events that characterize differentiation between bloodstream and procyclic forms and is mediated by posterior outgrowth of the trypanosome microtubule corset (8Matthews K.R. Sherwin T. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2231-2239PubMed Google Scholar). A related protein, TbZFP2, also generates a procyclic stage-specific morphological phenotype when overexpressed and is required in bloodstream forms for efficient differentiation, as revealed by transcript-specific RNAi 3The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; TTP, tristetraprolin; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain. 3The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; TTP, tristetraprolin; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain. (16Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).TbZFP1 and TbZFP2 are members of a family of proteins characterized by their possession of the zinc finger motif C7–8C5C3H (CCCH) and small size (<150 amino acids). Although TbZFP1 and -2 are unique to kinetoplastids, the CCCH motif is an RNA binding zinc finger found in a range of eukaryotic proteins involved at all levels of post-transcriptional gene expression control (18Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 19Reese K.J. Dunn M.A. Waddle J.A. Seydoux G. Mol.

In particular, the mammalian tristetraprolin (TTP) family of proteins recognize AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of mRNAs causing regulated instability (18Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), whereas in Caenorhabditis elegans regulated control of translation and mRNA localization during embryonic development is conferred by POS1 (22Tabara H. Hill R.J. Mello C.C. Priess J.R. Kohara Y. Development. 1999; 126: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MEX3 (23Guedes S. Priess J. Development. 1997; 124: 731-739PubMed Google Scholar), and PIE-1 (19Reese K.J. Dunn M.A. Waddle J.A. Seydoux G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the homologue of TbZFP1 in T. cruzi has been shown to bind RNA and interact with identified regulatory RNA elements that control developmental gene expression (24Morking P.A. Dallagiovanna B.M. Foti L. Garat B. Picchi G.F. Umaki A.C. Probst C.M. Krieger M.A. Goldenberg S. Fragoso S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Notably, TbZFP1 and -2 also contain protein-interaction domains with TbZFP2 possessing a WW motif closely related to one of those found in E3 ubiquitin ligases.The recent completion of the genome sequence for three kinetoplastids reveals an unusual number of CCCH proteins encoded in each organism, with 65 predicted CCCH proteins encoded in T. brucei, compared with 12 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (4Ivens A.C.

Among this set, a third small CCCH protein has been identified, which enhances trypanosome life-cycle differentiation. Moreover, analysis of the interactions of TbZFP3 in vivo demonstrates its capacity to complex with both TbZFP1 and TbZFP2. This supports a modular model for functional interactions among this unusual protein family, each of which has been implicated in the regulation of differentiation events. Finally, we demonstrate that TbZFP3 exhibits a procyclic stage-specific association with polyribosomes despite its constitutive expression through the life cycle and that this association is necessary for the expression of phenotype. This supports a role for this unique protein family in the post-transcriptional control of developmental events in the trypanosome life cycle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTrypanosomes—For ectopic expression, T. brucei 427 bloodstream and procyclic forms were used, each being previously engineered to express the tetracycline repressor protein, enabling regulated gene expression. Slender and stumpy form RNA, protein extracts, and polysomal extracts were prepared from T. brucei rhodesiense EATRO 2340. Stumpy forms were isolated 5–6 days after inoculation of mice with 1 × 105 T. brucei rhodesiense EATRO 2340 GUP2962 when the population was >80% stumpy by morphology. Parasite transfection was carried out as previously described (16Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), with procyclic cells being cultured in SDM-79 and selected with 20 μg/ml hygromycin, whereas bloodstream forms were cultured in HMI-9 (at 37 °C, 5% CO2) and selected with 2 μg/ml hygromycin.Plasmid constructs were each generated in the trypanosome expression vector pHD451 (30Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Deletion and mutation of TbZFP3 were carried out either via the Stratagene mutate-a-base mutagenesis kit or by a PCR mutagenesis strategy. Complete details of plasmid constructions in this report, and associated primers, are available from the authors upon request.Northern and Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Polysome Fractionation—RNA was prepared from bloodstream or procyclic forms using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen), and RNAs were resolved on 1% formaldehyde gels. Hybridization was carried out using digoxigenin-labeled Ribo-probes with post hybridization washes being carried out at 68 °C, 0.1× SSC. Signal detection was via chemiluminescence using CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science) as a reaction substrate.Protein extracts were prepared from 1 × 106 bloodstream or procyclic forms in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes via electroblotting, and effective transfer was verified by Ponceau staining. Blots were blocked with 5% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline overnight and then incubated with 1/500 dilution (in 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline) of anti-TbZFP3 antibody, this being raised against the peptide antigen N-DSSQMQQVGHDVPPMA-C in rabbits (by Eurogentec, Belgium). After incubation with a 1/5000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dako), signals were detected via chemiluminescence.For immunoprecipitation, 1–5 × 108 cells were pelleted and then snap frozen before resuspension in 0.5 ml of IP-150 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA). After 25–30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, the cell extract was cleared by microcentrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and used directly for immunoprecipitation, or centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor to yield a S100 supernatant or pellet. For immunoprecipitation cell extracts were incubated at 4 °C 1 h overnight with antibody (1:500), or with antibody preincubated with the peptide antigen (40 μg) to which it was raised (as a negative control). Washed protein G beads were then incubated with the extract for a further 1 h and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, yielding the flow-through. The beads were washed 6–9 times with IP-150 lysis buffer, and then bound proteins were extracted into boiling Laemmli sample buffer. For RNA immunoprecipitation, the same procedure was used with RNA being isolated in IP-150 lysis buffer plus 1% SDS at 65 °C, and then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNA retrieved from each sample was divided into two reverse transcription reactions using dT18Anchor (GCGCCGGCGCCTCAGCG) primer at 42 °C for 1 h. Equivalent quantities of cDNA obtained from all samples was amplified using the primers 5′-EP1 GGTGCTGCAACGCTGAAATCTGTTGC, or Actin 5′-GTATAGCGTGTGGATTGGCGGTTCC in combination with dT18Anchor at 65 °C for up to 35 cycles.For polysome fractionation 0.5–1 × 109 cells were incubated for 10 min with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and then centrifuged and resuspended in 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing cycloheximide and washed once. The cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of polysome buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl·6H2O, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 22 μm leupeptin, with 2 μl of RNasin per milliliter) containing cycloheximide, centrifuged at 1,000 × g, resuspended in 0.5 ml of polysome buffer, and subjected to 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with Nonidet P-40 being added to 1.2%. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g. The lysate was then fractionated on a 15–50% sucrose gradient at 240,000 × g in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor, and fractions were collected using a peristaltic pump connected to an AKTA Basic high-performance liquid chromatograph and fraction collector, with RNA concentration being monitored at 254 nm.Cell Image Acquisition and Morphometric Analysis—Cells were processed for immunofluorescence as previously described. Kinetoplast-posterior measurements were taken using Scion image 1.62. Cell images were captured using a Zeiss Axioscop 2 and processed using Adobe Photoshop CS.Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The Matchmaker system 3 (Clontech) was used throughout, and protocols were followed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following exceptions: the LexA DNA binding domain plasmid pSTT91 (25Sutton A. Heller R.C. Landry J. Choy J.S. Sirko A. Sternglanz R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3514-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoR1/BamH1to allow for in-frame ligation of the relevant TbZFP coding region. The activation domain plasmid pGADT7 was created using an EcoR1/XhoI digestion allowing the insertion of the appropriate TbZFP open reading frame. Co-transformation of 1 μg of both these fusion plasmids into the L40 yeast strain (26Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) was achieved using the high efficiency polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method (27Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar), and double transformants were selected on plates lacking Leu and Trp. Activation of the His3 reporter gene by reconstitution of the GAL4 transcription factor encoded in the fusion proteins was characterized by growth on plates lacking Leu/Trp/His/Ade. Activation of the β-galactosidase reporter gene was observed by replica-plating the colonies onto nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) on a YPDa plate, incubating for 16 h, and then performing a colony lift assay (28Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar).RESULTSWe searched the T. brucei genome sequence data base (www.geneDB.org) using the TbZFP1 and TbZFP2 protein sequences to identify further members of this protein family. This identified an open reading frame (Tb927.3.720) encoding a 130-amino acid predicted protein comprising a CCCH domain toward its C terminus and a WW protein-interaction domain toward its N terminus (Fig. 1A). This matched the overall motif organization of TbZFP2 (Tb11.01.6590), which has been previously characterized to have a role in trypanosome differentiation and posterior end morphogenesis (16Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similar to TbZFP2, the WW domain in the newly identified protein was most similar to a particular WW domain in E3 ubiquitin ligases. Unlike TbZFP2, however, TbZFP3 also possessed three intact copies of the RGG-predicted RNA-binding motif positioned centrally between the WW and CCCH domain. The newly identified gene has been recently described in the context of a bioinformatic analysis of homologous genes in T. cruzi and has been named TcZFP2b (29Caro F. Bercovich N. Atorrasagasti C. Levin M.J. Vazquez M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, although they share several motifs associated with molecular interactions, the primary amino acid sequences of TbZFP2a and -b are dissimilar (Fig. 1A), and their genes are unlinked. Therefore, we prefer to denote this by renaming of the new molecule TbZFP3.The previously characterized differentiation regulator TbZFP1 is silenced in bloodstream forms at the protein level but is transiently elevated during differentiation to procyclic forms where expression is then retained (16Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Hendriks E.F. Matthews K.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, TbZFP2 is expressed equally in bloodstream and procyclic forms and exhibits uniform expression throughout synchronous differentiation between stumpy and procyclic forms (16Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To address whether TbZFP3 is regulated during the parasite life cycle, we examined the mRNA and protein levels for this gene in bloodstream and procyclic forms. Fig. 1B demonstrates that this 390-bp-coding region is contained within an mRNA of ∼1.9 kb that is expressed equally in slender and stumpy bloodstream forms and in procyclic forms. To verify that the gene was translated into protein and to examine its expression profile, an anti-peptide antibody was raised to the sequence N-DSSQMQQVGHDVPPMA-C, this being located at the extreme C terminus of TbZFP3 protein. When reacted with protein derived from bloodstream monomorphic forms and procyclic forms, a band was detected at the predicted molecular mass for TbZFP3 (14 kDa) in each life-cycle stage, and at approximately equal levels, consistent with the RNA profile (Fig. 1B). The profile of TbZFP3 protein expression was also assayed during synchronous differentiation between bloodstream stumpy forms and procyclic forms, after culture in SDM-79 medium at 27 °C containing 6 mm cis-aconitate (Fig. 1C). This demonstrated approximately equivalent expression throughout differentiation with no evidence for a transient elevation in expression during this synchronous transition. This matched the expression profile of TbZFP2 but differs from TbZFP1, which is elevated in expression level around 4–8 h through differentiation (16Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, TbZFP3 is consistently expressed in both bloodstream and procyclic forms and during synchronous differentiation between these forms.Ectopic Expression of TbZFP3 Induces Enhanced Differentiation—Prior knockdown of TbZFP2 in bloodstream forms by RNAi had resulted in decreased efficiency of differentiation as assessed by gain of the insect-stage-specific antigen, EP procyclin (16Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This implicated TbZFP2 in the control of early differentiation events, contrasting with TbZFP1, which appears to act later in the differentiation program (17Hendriks E.F. Matthews K.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine whether TbZFP3 also had a role in developmental control, we initially attempted RNAi for this molecule in bloodstream forms. Although viable cell lines were generated using several available RNAi vectors, effective reduction of TbZFP3 protein was not achieved (a maximum reduction of 60% was observed, data not shown). However, cell lines were generated in which tetracycline-regulated ectopic overexpression of TbZFP3 was possible. Specifically, a copy of TbZFP3 encoding a C-terminal Ty1 epitope tag (denoted TbZFP3-Ty) was inserted into the trypanosome expression vector pHD451 (30Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and transfected into T. brucei 427 monomorphic bloodstream forms, which express the tetracycline repressor protein. The resulting cell lines were then induced to express TbZFP3-Ty by the addition of tetracycline, this being monitored by Western blotting using the TbZFP3-specific anti-peptide antibody allowing simultaneous detection of the endogenous and transgenic protein. Fig. 2B (Day 0 samples) shows inducible ectopic expression of TbZFP3-Ty in bloodstream forms was achieved, generating a combined 1- to 2-fold overexpression of TbZFP3 compared with wild-type cells.FIGURE 2TbZFP3 ectopic expression generates an enhanced differentiation phenotype. A, a graph shows the percent EP procyclin expressers in either parental cells in the presence or absence of tetracycline, or in a cell line in which TbZFP3-Ty expression is inducible. Procyclin expression was monitored for 3 days after exposure of the cells to 6 mm cis-aconitate by immunofluorescence. The data represent means of four independent experiments, with the standard error of the mean being presented for each bar. B, during the differentiation experiments shown in A, the expression of endogenous and ectopic TbZFP3 was monitored using the antibody to TbZFP3. In each case TbZFP-Ty expression was detected only in the induced population. C,an analysis of EP procyclin expression by flow cytometry. Cells were processed for staining with antibody to EP procyclin at 48 h after the initiation of differentiation, and then the proportion of cells expressing this surface marker was assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

https://openalex.org/W2065335379,"The vast majority of cancer cells have defective checkpoints that permit the cell cycle to progress in the presence of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation (IR) and radiomimetic drugs. ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related) has recently been shown to be activated by DSBs, although the consequences of this activity are largely unknown. In this report, we use advanced gene targeting methods to generate biallelic hypomorphic ATR mutations in human colorectal cancer cells and demonstrate that progression of the cancer cell cycle after IR treatment requires ATR. Cells with mutant ATR accumulated at a defined point at the beginning of the S phase after IR treatment and were unable to progress beyond that point, whereas cells at later stages of the S phase during the time of irradiation progressed and completed DNA replication. The prolonged arrest of ATR mutant cancer cells did not involve the ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent S-phase checkpoint, but rather closely resembled a previously characterized form of cell cycle arrest termed S-phase stasis. As ATR strongly contributed to clonogenic survival after IR treatment, these data suggest that blocking ATR activity might be a useful strategy for inducing S-phase stasis and promoting the radiosensitization of checkpoint-deficient cancer cells."

Here, we show that this NF-kappaB activation relies on the constitutive activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which is formed by the IKKalpha, IKKbeta and IKKgamma/NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) subunits. A cell-permeable peptide that mimics the leucine zipper subdomain of IKKgamma, thus preventing its oligomerization, inhibited the constitutive NF-kappaB activation and induced apoptotic cell death in a panel of human MDS and AML cell lines (P39, MOLM13, THP1 and MV4-11). Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit or the three IKK subunits including IKKgamma/NEMO also induced apoptotic cell death in P39 cells. Cell death induced by the IKKgamma/NEMO-antagonistic peptide involved the caspase-independent loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential as well as signs of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization with the consequent release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G. Primary bone marrow CD34(+) cells from high-risk MDS and AML patients also succumbed to the IKKgamma/NEMO-antagonistic peptide, but not to a mutated control peptide. Altogether, these data indicate that malignant cells in high-risk MDS and AML cells critically depend on IKKgamma/NEMO to survive. Moreover, our data delineate a novel procedure for their therapeutic removal, through inhibition of IKKgamma/NEMO oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1972822407,"In human post-natal somatic cells, low global levels of DNA methylation have been associated with the hypomethylation of several repetitive elements, a feature that has been proposed to be a surrogate epigenetic marker. These data, mainly derived from the analysis of cancer cells, suggest a potential association between loss of cell-growth control and altered differentiation with hypomethylation of repetitive sequences. Partial hydatidiform moles (PHMs) can be used as an alternative model for investigating this association in a non-tumorigenic context. This gestational disease is characterized by abnormal overgrowth and differentiation of the placenta and spontaneous abortion. Here, we comprehensively analyse the DNA methylation of these trophoblastic tissues in both PHM and normal placenta at global and sequence-specific levels. Analysis of the global 5-methylcytosine content and immunohistochemistry indicate that PHM and normal placenta have identical global levels of DNA methylation. In contrast, bisulfite genomic sequencing shows that, whereas Alu, NBL2 and satellite 2 repetitive elements are equally methylated, LINE-1 sequences are hypermethylated in PHM tissues ( approximately 2-fold relative to normal placenta). Interestingly, altered demethylation is also found in triploid diandric embryos that originate from dispermic fertilization of an oocyte, a common event responsible for most PHMs. In conclusion, alterations of DNA methylation do not seem to be randomly distributed in PHM, as several repeated elements remain unaltered, whereas LINE-1 sequences are hypermethylated. In addition, our findings suggest that the hypomethylation of repetitive elements in cancer is directly linked to the neoplasic process and not a simple consequence of loss of growth control observed in most of the cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2100705679,"DPP8 belongs to the family of prolyl dipeptidases, which are capable of cleaving the peptide bond after a penultimate proline residue. Unlike DPP-IV, a drug target for type II diabetes, no information is available on the crystal structure of DPP8, the regulation of its enzymatic activity, or its substrate specificity. In this study, using analytical ultracentrifugation and native gel electrophoresis, we show that the DPP8 protein is predominantly dimeric when purified or in the cell extracts. Four conserved residues in the C-terminal loop of DPP8 (Phe822, Val833, Tyr844, and His859), corresponding to those located at the dimer interface of DPP-IV, were individually mutated to Ala. Surprisingly, unlike DPP-IV, these single-site mutations abolished the enzymatic activity of DPP8 without disrupting its quaternary structure, indicating that dimerization itself is not sufficient for the optimal enzymatic activity of DPP8. Moreover, these mutations not only decreased kcat, as did the corresponding DPP-IV mutations, but also dramatically increased Km. We further show that the Km effect is independent of the substrate assayed. Finally, we identified the distinctive and strict substrate selectivity of DPP8 for hydrophobic or basic residues at the P2 site, which is in sharp contrast to the much less discriminative substrate specificity of DPP-IV. Our study has identified the residues absolutely required for the optimal activity of DPP8 and its unique substrate specificity.

Our study has identified the residues absolutely required for the optimal activity of DPP8 and its unique substrate specificity. This study extends the functional importance of the C-terminal loop to the whole family of prolyl dipeptidases. The prolyl dipeptidases have attracted extensive investigation in recent years because of their unique ability to cleave the peptide bond after a penultimate proline residue (1Rosenblum J.S. Kozarich J.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Proline is an imino acid that is not cleavable by many cellular proteases in vivo. The biological importance of the prolyl dipeptidases is underscored by the fact that many peptide hormones, chemokines, and neuropeptides contain one or more proline residues. Consequently, the processing and degradation of such biologically important regulatory peptides requires proline-cleaving proteases. The prolyl dipeptidase family includes dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), 2The abbreviations used are: DPP, dipeptidyl peptidase; pNA, p-nitroanilide; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; HA, hemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: DPP, dipeptidyl peptidase; pNA, p-nitroanilide; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; HA, hemagglutinin. fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DPP8, DPP9, and DPP2 (1Rosenblum J.S.

Determining the structures and catalytic properties of the prolyl dipeptidases is important both to discover DPP-IV selective inhibitors for disease treatments and to elucidate the biological functions of these prolyl-cleaving proteases in vivo. The biochemical properties of DPP-IV and FAP are significantly different from those of the classical serine proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and subtilisin, or the monomeric prolylcleaving prolyl oligopeptidase (7Polgar L.

The Glu-Glu motif (Glu256-Glu257) is also present in DPP8 and is necessary for its dipeptidase activity; mutations at this motif result in the inactivation of DPP8 enzymatic activity (16Ajami K.

However, tagging at the C terminus of DPP9 results in inactive and poor expression of the protease due to unclear reasons (29Bjelke J.R. Christensen J. Nielsen P.F. Branner S. Kanstrup A.B.

In this study, we determined the quaternary structure of human DPP8 using analytical ultracentrifugation and native gel electrophoresis coupled to Western blot analysis. We individually mutated four conserved residues in the C-terminal loop of DPP8 to Ala. The corresponding residues in DPP-IV are located at the dimer interface and are essential for dimer formation and the enzymatic activity of DPP-IV (13Chien C.H. Huang L.H. Chou C.Y. Chen Y.S.

We also identified the unique substrate specificity of DPP8. Materials—The chromogenic dipeptide substrates were purchased from Bachem. X-Pro-pNA and Ala-X-pNA libraries, in which X is any amino acid, were custom synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone. The nickel affinity column was from Novagen. Lipofectin and insect culture media (Grace's medium and Express Five medium) were from Invitrogen. The human liver cDNA library and linear viral vector were from Clontech. The Western detection kit Western Lightning™ was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Q-Sepharose™ High Performance was from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmid Construction—Oligonucleotides containing the sequence encoding the His tag and the factor Xa cleavage site (5′-GGATCCATGGGACACCATCATCATCATCACGGCGGGATTGAAGGTCGCTCTAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGCGACCTTCAATCCCGCCGTGATGATGATGATGGTGTCCCATGGATCC-3′) were annealed and cloned into pTOPO-II vector (Invitrogen), producing the plasmid pTOPO-MHF. The full-length cDNA of human DPP8 was amplified by PCR from a human liver cDNA library (Clontech) with 5′-TCTAGAGCTTCCATGGCAGCAGCAATGGAA-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTATATCACTTTTAGAGCAGC-3′ and cloned into the XbaI and NotI sites of pTOPO-MHF, producing pTOPO-MHF-DPP8. The BamHI-NotI fragment of pTOPO-MHF-DPP8 was further subcloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pBAC-PAK8 (28Chen Y.S. Chien C.H. Goparaju C.M. Hsu J.T. Liang P.H. Chen X. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), generating plasmid pBAC-MHF-DPP8 for the expression of DPP8 protein in baculovirus-infected insect cells. The estimated molecular mass of this tagged DPP8 is 103.4 kDa. Site-directed mutagenesis of DPP8 was performed as described previously (13Chien C.H. Huang L.H. Chou C.Y. Chen Y.S. Han Y.S. Chang G.G.

The primers used were 5′-GAGAATGTCCATGCTGCACATACCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTATGTGCAGCATGGACATTCTC-3′ for F822A; 5′-GAGTTTTTTAGCGAGGGCTGGAAAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTTTCCAGCCCTCGCTAAAAAACTC-3′ for V833A; 5′-GATTTACAGATCGCTCCTCAGGAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCTCCTGAGGAGCGATCTGTAAATC-3′ for Y844A; and 5′-CCTGAATCGGGAGAAGCTTATGAACTGCATCTTTTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAAAAGATGCAGTTCATAAGCTTCTCCCGATTCAGG-3′ for H859A. All coding regions were sequenced to verify that they contained no mutations other than those intended. To examine the subunit composition of DPP8 inside the cells, we constructed an expression plasmid for the expression of DPP8 in mammalian 293T cells. The DPP8 cDNA fragment was released from pTOPO-MHF-DPP8 by PstI digestion, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and further digested with XbaI. The PstI (blunted)-XbaI fragment was then ligated into pcDNA3-hemagglutinin (pcDNA3-HA) at the ApaI (blunted) and XbaI sites. The HA-DPP8 fragment was released from pcDNA-HA-DPP8 by digestion with HindIII and NotI, before ligation into the pEF-SCM vector (30Chen X. Wen S. Fukuda M.N. Gavva N.R. Hsu D. Akama T.O. Yang-Feng T. Shen C.K. Genomics. 2001; 73: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), to generate pEF-HA-DPP8. Digestion with HindIII and self-ligation resulted in pEF-DPP8 without the HA tag. Insect Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, Virus Selection, and Amplification—Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C. The transfection of DNA into Sf9 cells and the selection and amplification of the recombinant viruses were carried out as described previously (28Chen Y.S. Chien C.H. Goparaju C.M. Hsu J.T. Liang P.H. Chen X. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1, determined to be the optimal condition for protein expression, as described previously (28Chen Y.S. Chien C.H. Goparaju C.M. Hsu J.T. Liang P.H. Chen X. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the cells were harvested 72 h after infection.

Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The insect cell pellets were resuspended and sonicated in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m NaCl). The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation and filtration through a 0.45-μm filter before it was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. The column was equilibrated and washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer A, followed sequentially by 10 bed volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm and then 40 mm imidazole. Finally, the proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The buffer of the eluate was changed to buffer B, containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), before it was applied to a Q-Sepharose column. The DPP8 proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in buffer B. Gel filtration chromatography was performed with a Superdex 200 HR column, as described previously (13Chien C.H.

Native Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Plasmids pEF-DPP8, pEF-HA-DPP8, or the vector-only control were transfected into the human 293T embryonic kidney cell line with the calcium phosphate method in 6-well plates. After transfection, 106 cells were lysed with 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protein inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation and mixed with loading buffer (final composition of the loading buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). The lysate was fractionated on 8% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously, with anti-DPP8 antibody, which was generated in house by immunizing a rabbit with purified DPP8 protein from baculovirus-infected insect cells (28Chen Y.S.

The UV absorption of the cells was scanned every 10 min for 4 h. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with six-channel epon charcoal-filled centerpieces, as described previously (31Chou C.Y. Jen W.P. Hsieh Y.H. Shiao M.S. Chang G.G. J. Biol.

The loaded samples were centrifuged at speeds of 6,000, 9,000, 12,000, and 15,000 rpm, each for 14-18 h at 20 °C. In our study, DPP8 proteins achieved an equilibrium state after 12 h. At each channel, a single base-line parameter was included as a floating parameter common to all rotor speeds. The time invariant and radial invariant noise were also fitted for the better fitting quality. The scans at different rotor speeds were then globally fitted to a noninteracting discrete species model, as described previously (31Chou C.Y. Jen W.P. Hsieh Y.H. Shiao M.S. Chang G.G. J. Biol.

Mutant channels lacking RCK2 are nonfunctional despite their tetramerization and surface expression. The hydrophobic residues that are expected to form an interface between RCK1 and RCK2, based on the crystal structure of the bacterial MthK channel, are well conserved, and the interactions of these residues were confirmed by mutant cycle analysis.

Large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) 2The abbreviations used are: BKCa, large conductance calcium-activated potassium; RCK, regulators of K+ conductance; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; T, tesla. channels play a key role in modulating a number of important physiological processes, such as neuronal excitability, frequency tuning of hair cells, smooth muscle contraction, and immunity (1Robitaille R.

Nobles M. Segal A.W. Nature. 2004; 427: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). BKCa channels are activated by membrane depolarization and an increase in intracellular calcium (10Pallotta B.S. Magleby K.L. Barrett J.N. Nature. 1981; 293: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Zhang X. Solaro C.R. Lingle C.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 607-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, BKCa channels are considered to be molecular integrators of biochemical and electrical signals. Membrane depolarization and calcium binding activate BKCa channels independently via separate regions of the α subunit of the channel (Slo). The transmembrane segments of the Slo channel, S1-S6, are structurally similar to those of voltage-gated potassium channels, and as in these channels, charged residues in the Slo S1-S4 segments are thought to be involved in the voltage-dependent gating of the channel (14Diaz L. Meera P. Amigo J. Stefani E. Alvarez O. Toro L. Latorre R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32430-32436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Ma Z. Lou X.J. Horrigan F.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the bulky cytoplasmic C terminus of Slo is responsible for the calcium-dependent activation of the channel (21Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic C terminus of Slo has been proposed to contain more than two Ca2+-sensing sites, a high affinity site called the Ca2+ bowl, a low affinity site, and additional high affinity sites within a structural module known as the regulator of K+ conductance (RCK) domain (22Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

The Ca2+ bowl is composed of a series of Asp residues and binds Ca2+ with micromolar affinity. Mutations here have been shown to cause positive shifts in the conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship at constant [Ca2+], which are similar to those observed with the wild-type channel when [Ca2+] is lowered (22Schreiber M.

The RCK domain is found primarily in prokaryotic ligand-gated K+ channels and in some bacterial K+ uptake and efflux systems, in which it is also called the K+ transport nucleotide-binding (KTN) domain (25Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 32Schlosser A. Hamann A. Bossemeyer D. Schneider E. Bakker E.P.

The structure of the tetrameric MthK channel shows that an octameric complex could be formed by intermolecular interactions on fixed and flexible interfaces between a tetramer of dimeric RCK domains. This complex, called the gating ring, has been proposed to expand upon Ca2+ binding and to create a strain at the ends of the S6 helices for the opening of the channel (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 35Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the gating ring of the MthK channel, four RCK domains are provided by the four channel subunits. The other four intracellular domains are produced as a result of translation start at downstream initiation sites. Based on the octameric nature of the gating ring, two RCK domains have been proposed to lie in tandem within the long cytoplasmic region of the mammalian BKCa channel (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 37Roosild T.P. Le K.T. Choe S. Trends Biochem.

Ph.D. thesis, The Rockefeller University2003Google Scholar), and an RCK-like domain located at the proximal C terminus of the Slo protein has been characterized in detail using mutational analysis. This domain (RCK1) contains divalent cation binding sites, including the low-affinity site for Ca2+ (27Bao L. Rapin A.M. Holmstrand E.C. Cox D.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Zeng X.H. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, a gain-of-function mutation causing an epileptic seizure has also been localized to this region (39Du W. Bautista J.F. Yang H. Diez-Sampedro A. You S.A. Wang L. Kotagal P. Luders H.O. Shi J. Cui J. Richerson G.B. Wang Q.K. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In this study, we have located the second RCK domain in the rat Slo channel using amino acid sequence alignment and investigated its functional importance in channel gating. This domain (RCK2) contains several conserved amino acids and exhibits a strong similarity in secondary structure to the crystallographic structures of other RCK domains. Based on the sequence alignment, we mutated several residues that are critical to the structural integrity and functional activity of the Slo channel. Although mutation of putative salt bridge-forming residues in RCK2 resulted in only minor changes in function, mutations at the putative hydrophobic interface between RCK1 and RCK2 altered the channel gating significantly. The pairwise analysis of mutations across the hydrophobic interface revealed strong coupling between the residues on the two RCK domains. Thus, we suggest that an interaction between RCK1 and RCK2 via a hydrophobic interface is critical for the Ca2+-dependent activation of the channel. Expression of rSlo Channels in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-K1 Cells—The electrophysiological experiments were performed on CHO-K1 cells, except for the gating current measurements. The rSlo gene (GenBank™ accession number AF135265) was used in this study (40Ha T.S. Jeong S.Y. Cho S.W. Jeon H. Roh G.S. Choi W.S. Park C.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were maintained in F-12K nutrient mixture, Kaighn's modification (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To obtain high quality plasmid DNA for transient transfection, the plasmid DNA was prepared using a commercial kit (Qiagen). Expression of rSlo Channels in Xenopus Oocytes—To measure the gating currents, wild-type and mutant rSlo channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The complementary DNA of rSlo was subcloned into a modified pGH expression vector for high level expression in Xenopus oocytes. Complementary RNAs were synthesized in vitro from the NotI-linearized plasmid using T7 polymerase (Ambion). ∼150-200 ng of RNA were injected into oocytes, and the injected oocytes were incubated in ND96 solution at 18 °C for 4-8 days. Electrophysiological Recordings and Data Analysis—The macroscopic ionic currents carried by wild-type and mutant rSlo channels were recorded in excised membrane patches of CHO-K1 cells with an inside-out configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). All patch recordings were performed at room temperature at 24-48 h after transient transfection. Pipettes were prepared from thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments) and fire-polished to a resistance of 3-5 MΩ. Channel currents were activated by voltage pulses delivered from a holding potential of -100 mV to test potentials ranging from -150 mV to 200 mV in 10-mV increments. Signals were filtered at 1-2 kHz using a four-pole low pass Bessel filter digitized at a rate of 10 kHz using a Digidata 1200B digitizer (Axon Instruments) and stored in a personal computer. Commercial software packages, such as Clampex 8.1 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 6.1 (OriginLab), were used for the acquisition and analysis of macroscopic data. For gating current measurements, patch pipettes made of borosilicate glass (VWR) were coated with sticky wax (Sticky Wax) and fire-polished to a resistance of 0.5-1 MΩ. Voltage commands were filtered at 7.5 kHz. Data were acquired with an Axopatch 200B amplifier at 100 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. A Macintosh-based computer system equipped with an ITC-16 hardware interface (Instrutech) and Pulse acquisition software (HEKA Electronik) was used. Data analysis was performed with Igor Pro graphing and curve-fitting software (WaveMetrics Inc.) Solutions for macroscopic current recording were prepared according to Lim and Park (41Lim H.H. Park C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Pipette solutions contained 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 116 mm KOH, and 4 mm KCl. The intracellular solution for perfusing to the internal faces of excised patches was identical to the pipette solution except for supplemental CaCl2. To provide the precise free [Ca2+]i, the appropriate amounts of total Ca2+ added to the intracellular solution were calculated using the program MaxChelator (42Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with MES. Gating current recording solutions were prepared according to Bao and Cox (43Bao L. Cox D.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The composition of the pipette solution was (in mm) 127 triethylammonium-OH, 125 HMeSO3, 2 HCl, 2 MgCl2, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with HMeSO3 or triethanolamine-OH). The internal solution contained (in mm) 141 N-methyl-o-glucamine, 135 HMeSO3, 6 HCl, 20 HEPES, 40 μm (+)-18-crown-6-tetracarboxylic acid (18C6TA), and 5 EGTA, pH 7.2 (adjusted with NMDG and HMeSO3). Homology Modeling of the Dimeric Structure of RCK Domains—Homology modeling of the RCK domains in rSlo was performed using the program MODELLER8 version 1 (44Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) with the high resolution atomic coordinates of the MthK RCK domain in the Ca2+-bound form (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2AEF) (35Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as the template. The position-specific iterated (PSI)-BLAST alignment shown in Fig. 1B was manually modified to make the loop positions realistic. For each rSlo RCK domain, 10 three-dimensional models of each rSlo RCK domain were generated initially, and the best model with the lowest MODELLER discrete optimized protein energy restraint energy was chosen. The resulting model was further refined by energy minimization to remove clashes between atoms. The energy computations were performed with the GROMOS96 implementation of the Swiss-PdbViewer (45Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The figures were prepared using PyMOL (46DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—The wild-type (rSlo::EGFP) and RCK2 deletion mutant constructs (rSloΔRCK2::EGFP) (50-100 ng) were injected into Xenopus oocytes. The oocytes were incubated at 18 °C for 3-5 days in ND96 solution. Each oocyte was observed under a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems), and the images were analyzed using Leica software. Western Blotting Analysis—Cells that had been transiently transfected with the channel gene were lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min to pellet the insoluble material. After the addition of 5× loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol), the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and ∼30 μg of the protein sample was separated using SDS-PAGE (47Wang S.X.

Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TBS-T (10× TBS-T: 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 1 m HCl, and 0.5% Tween 20, pH 7.6) at room temperature for 1 h with agitation, washed three times with 1× TBS-T, and incubated in 10 ml of 1× TBS-T containing the primary antibody (anti-hSlo monoclonal antibody, 1:250) at room temperature for 2 h.

Localization of a Second RCK Domain in the BKCa Channel α Subunit—To define the location of a second RCK domain in the α subunit of the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel(Slo), we searched for RCK homologous sequences using PSI-BLAST (48Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Initially, we used the amino acid sequences of RCK1 (25Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) from rSlo (GenBank™ accession number AF135265; residues 410-586) as a query and ran the first round of PSI-BLAST with an inclusion threshold of 0.1. The primary hits with expectation values from 10-50 to 1 were selected as iterated queries, and the second round of BLAST was performed. From these results, we located a candidate region for a second RCK domain (RCK2) in rSlo, consisting of ∼160 amino acids from His-788 to Ile-949. This region was also detectable in the paralogues (Slick, Slack, and Slo3) as well as the orthologues of Slo protein from insect to human (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequences of the RCK domains of MthK, the E. coli 6TM K+ channel, and various orthologues of Slo are aligned in Fig. 1B, with the secondary structures of MthK indicated above the sequences (gray arrows and boxes) (49Rost B. Yachadav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar) and those predicted for RCK2 shown below the sequences (blue arrows and boxes). The RCK domain of MthK forms a typical Rossmann-folded N-lobe, with two α helices (αA and αB) on one side of six-stranded parallel β sheets (βA-βF) and three α helices (αC, αD, and αE) on the other side. It also contains a C-lobe composed of four β strands and three α helices (αF-αJ) (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The two lobes are connected by the turn between helices αF and αG. Whereas the similarities in both amino acid sequence and the secondary structure pattern are retained through the C-lobe in RCK1, RCK2 lacks a C-lobe, and its N-lobe is directly followed by the Ca2+ bowl. RCK1 and RCK2 contain several conserved residues that are functionally important in almost all RCK domains. Among these are the hydrophobic residues in αD that form the dimeric interface in MthK (Fig. 1B, green) and a pair of charged residues involved in salt bridging (Fig. 1B, blue and red). Functional Importance of RCK2 in Channel Gating—To examine the functional importance of the putative RCK2, this domain was deleted (rSloΔRCK2), and the activity of the mutant channel was compared with that of the wild type. Whereas the wild-type channels were robustly activated at various intracellular calcium concentrations and depolarizing membrane potentials (Fig. 2A), the mutant channels failed to generate any ionic current, even under extreme conditions (Fig. 2B). We also failed to reconstitute the functional channel by co-expressing rSloΔRCK2 and RCK2 (Fig. 2C). However, the co-expression of the Slo-“Core,” containing the entire transmembrane domains and RCK1, and the Slo-“Tail,” harboring RCK2, resulted in functional channels (Fig. 2D), as has been reported in previous studies (21Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 50Moss B.L. Magleby K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine whether the nonfunctionality of rSloΔRCK2 was because of the failure of tetramer formation and/or the lack of surface expression, we performed nonreducing gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis (41Lim H.H. Park C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 lysates containing the exogenously expressed rSlo::EGFP or rSloΔRCK2::EGFP proteins were pretreated with nonreducing Laemmli buffer. An immunoblot with anti-hSlo antibody showed that the oligomers up to the size of the tetramer, as well as the monomer, were detected in both the wild-type and the mutant channel (supplemental Fig. 1A). We then examined the surface expression of the RCK2 deletion mutant using confocal microscopy. EGFP signals were detected at the surface membrane in both the wild type and the deletion mutant. Soluble EGFP signals were widely distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. 1, B-D). These results indicate that the RCK2 deletion mutant can assemble into a tetrameric complex and can be delivered to the plasma membrane. Thus, the RCK2 domain appears to be essential for channel function rather than the overall assembly. Mutational Analysis of a Putative Salt Bridge and the Hydrophobic Interface in RCK2—RCK domains contain a structurally important salt bridge in the N-lobe Rossmann fold (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 25Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 37Roosild T.P. Le K.T. Choe S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 39-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In a previous study, mutation of the residues forming the salt bridge in RCK1 decreased the calcium sensitivity of the human Slo channel (25Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Whereas the positively charged Lys residue is conserved in RCK2 of all Slo orthologues (Fig. 1B, blue), the negatively charged Asp residue is conserved only in rat and chicken Slo (Fig. 1B, red). Furthermore, these residues are conserved in RCK1 domains of all Slo paralogues but not in RCK2 (supplemental Fig. 3). When we mutated these residues in RCK2 of rSlo (Lys-898 and Asp-927) to examine their functional roles, the G-V relationships of the two single mutants K898D and D927K and the reciprocal double mutant K898D/D927K were indistinguishable from that of the wild type (supplemental Fig. 2, A-C). At various calcium concentrations, the V1/2 values of the wild-type and each mutant channel were not significantly different (supplemental Fig. 2D). The amino acid residues corresponding to the fixed interface in MthK are well conserved in both RCK1 and RCK2 (Fig. 1B, green). To examine the functional importance of these hydrophobic residues (Ile-891, Leu-892, and Leu-895) on RCK2, we compared the Ca2+ sensitivities of the wild-type channel and mutant channels in which each residue was individually replaced with alanine. Single alanine substitutions at either Ile-891 or Leu-895 shifted the G-V relationship in the positive direction (Fig. 3, A and C) and increased V1/2 values by ∼30 mV (Fig. 3, E and G). The mutation of Leu-892 caused an opposite effect, a negative shift in the G-V relationship by 25-40 mV (Fig. 3, B and F). When Ile-891 and Leu-895 were simultaneously mutated, however, the G-V curves were shifted to the right by as much as 100 mV (Fig. 3, D and H), which is more than the sum of the shifts of each of the individual mutations (Fig. 3H, half-filled diamonds). Thus, Ile-891 and Leu-895 appear to function synergistically in calcium-dependent gating. To determine whether the rightward G-V shifts in the I891A/L895A mutant were caused by an alteration in voltage-dependent gating, we measured the gating current (Fig. 4). To our surprise, the Q-V relationships of the wild-type and mutant channels were superimposable, and their Boltzmann fit parameters were virtually identical. We were unable to record any channel current from the triple mutant (I891A/L892A/L895A), even under extreme conditions. Thus, it can be concluded that the mutations in the putative hydrophobic interface of RCK2 alter the Ca2+-dependent gating of the Slo channel without affecting its voltage-activated gating. Next, we examined the functional importance of three hydrophobic residues in RCK1, Ile-507, Met-508, and Ile-511. Each residue was mutated to alanine, and its functional activity was compared with the wild type. The G-V relation of I507A was positively shifted by ∼20-60 mV compared with the wild type (Fig. 5A). The difference in the V1/2 between the wild type and I507A decreased as the intracellular calcium concentration increased (Fig. 5D). The G-V curves of M508A were negatively shifted, similar to the shift observed in L892A (Fig. 5B). The I511A mutation caused a slight positive change in the G-V curves (Fig. 5C). The V1/2 values of the three mutants and the wild type are compared in Fig. 5D. Heterodimeric Interaction of RCK1 and RCK2 via the Hydrophobic Interface—Because the individual residues on the putative fixed interfaces of both RCK1 and RCK2 were so sensitive to mutation, we questioned whether we could determine the interaction across the dimeric surface. We generated combinations of double mutations with three hydrophobic residues on each domain. Of the nine double mutants, all but M508A/I891A and M508A/L892A showed macroscopic currents large enough for accurate and reproducible recordings. The G-V curves of the functional mutants are compared with that of the wild type in Fig. 6. Whereas the G-V curves of most of the double mutant channels were positively shifted, those of I507A/L892A and M508A/L895A were negatively shifted by ∼30-60 and ∼5-10 mV, respectively (Fig. 6, A-G). The V1/2 values of each mutant channel at various calcium concentrations are compared in Fig. 6, H and I. To examine the specific interactions between pairs of amino acid residues, we applied a systematic analysis of a “thermodynamic mutant cycle” (51Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 52Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This analysis quantifies the influence of one mutation on the effect of the second mutation as a pairwise coupling energy between the two mutated residues. A representative mutant cycle is shown in Fig. 7A. To calculate the coupling energy, we used V1/2 and z values from G-V curves of each single and double mutant at 5 μm calcium concentration. The coupling energy values between pairs are shown in Fig. 7B. Several pairs of amino acid residues showed significant energetic couplings. Three pairs, Ile-507:Leu-892, Ile-511:Leu-892, and Ile-511:Leu-895, had coupling energy values of 3.18 kT, 1.96 kT, and 1.98 kT, respectively. Three other pairs, Ile507: Ile891, Met508:Leu895, and Ile511: Ile891 also showed weak but appreciable couplings with coupling energy values of 1.29, 1.26, and 1.03 kT, respectively, because it is generally accepted that a coupling energy >1.5 kT represents a strong pairwise interaction between two amino acid residues (51Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The coupling energy between Ile-507 and Leu-895 was small with only 0.36 kT. In Fig. 7C, the relative strength between the hydrophobic residues are depicted with the thickness of arrows. Fig. 7D shows the heterodimeric structural model of the two RCK domains of Slo. We constructed homology models of both the RCK1 and RCK2 domains using the known structure of the MthK RCK domain as a template (35Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The configuration of the dimeric structure was based on the fixed interface of the octameric gating ring structure of MthK (PDB code 1LNQ) (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The dimeric interaction between the two RCK domains of the Slo channel via a putative hydrophobic interface is plausible on the basis of the results of the mutant cycle analysis and structural modeling. The atomic structure of the MthK channel has been determined and a similar structural arrangement has been proposed for the mammalian BKCa channels (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 25Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, the gating ring composed of eight RCK domains is a valuable structural model for Ca2+-dependent activation of this class of K+ channels. A region homologous to bacterial RCK domains was initially identified in the cytosolic C terminus of the human BKCa channel α subunit, which lies proximal to the transmembrane domains (25Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Since its localization, this first RCK domain (RCK1) has been under close experimental scrutiny. It has been suggested that divalent cation binding sites are located in this RCK domain of the BKCa channel and that the energy due to calcium binding in these sites is transferred to the S6 gates by spring-like linkers (22Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat.

Moreover, it has been reported that the N terminus of the RCK1 domain is important for transferring the conformational change from calcium binding to channel opening (54Krishnamoorthy G. Shi J. Sept D. Cui J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the tetrameric nature of the BKCa channel suggested the presence of a second RCK domain in the cytosolic domain of the channel for assembly of an octameric gating ring (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 37Roosild T.P. Le K.T. Choe S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 39-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Pico A. RCK Domain Model of Calcium Activation in BK Channels. Ph.D. thesis, The Rockefeller University2003Google Scholar). In this study, we have placed the second RCK domain (RCK2) ∼100 residues downstream of RCK1 and demonstrated the functional importance of this region. In addition, we have shown that the heterodimeric interaction between RCK1 and RCK2, via conserved hydrophobic residues, is critical for Ca2+-dependent activation of the channel. RCK2 exhibits a strong homology to other RCK domains in its N-terminal region, not only in its amino acid sequence but also in its predicted secondary structure (Fig. 1B). RCK2 also contains several key residues that confer structural integrity to RCK domains. However, there is a marked difference that distinguishes RCK2 from other RCK domains. RCK2 lacks a C-lobe, and its N-lobe, composed of a Rossmann fold, is directly linked to the highly negative Ca2+ binding site, the Ca2+ bowl. We can envision that the binding of Ca2+ to this high affinity site may evoke a conformational change of the gating ring, composed of a RCK1/2 heterooctamer, and shift the gating equilibrium to an open conformation. This mechanism is distinct from that of MthK, because the gating ring of the MthK channel is composed of eight identical RCK domains, and the conformational change is initiated by the direct binding of Ca2+ to a low affinity binding site within the RCK domains. It should be noted that the residues known to be involved in the binding of Ca2+ or other divalent cations in RCK1 (Fig. 1B, residues in yellow) are not conserved in RCK2. In the MthK gating ring, two different interfaces were initially noted, the fixed interface composed of four α helices (αD and αE) of two different RCK domains and the flexible interface formed by αF, αG, and the C-lobe (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic residues comprising the fixed interface of MthK are well conserved in both RCK1 and RCK2 of the Slo channels (Fig. 1B, residues in green), suggesting a hydrophobic interface between RCK1 and RCK2, and the formation of heterodimer via the interface. The hydrophobic residues of both RCK1 and RCK2 were highly sensitive to mutational substitution. Whereas the individual replacement of the four flanking residues (Ile-507 and Ile-511 of RCK1; Ile-891 and Leu-895 of RCK2) with alanine shifted the G-V curve to a positive voltage, indicating the stabilization of a closed conformation (Fig. 5, A and C; Fig. 3, A and C), alanine substitution of the two middle residues (Met-508 of RCK1 and Leu-892 of RCK2) resulted in negative shifts (Figs. 3B and 5B). Moreover, the mutational effects of multiple residues were synergistic rather than additive. Although the triple mutant failed to evoke any measurable current (data not shown), the cooperative contributions of individual mutations strongly suggest the functional significance of the hydrophobic interactions. In an attempt to reveal the pairwise interaction across the RCK1-RCK2 interface, we employed mutant cycle analysis on conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 7). First of all, the interaction between the two middle residues (Met-508 and Leu-892) appears to be critical for functional channels, because no macroscopic currents were recorded from the M508A/L892A double mutant. In addition, in several dozen trials, we only detected 1-3 functional channels for M508A/I891A. Significant energetic couplings were detected from several pairs, e.g. I507:L892, I511:L895, and I511:L892. Although it is difficult to predict the precise arrangement of the interactive surface because of the extreme sensitivity of hydrophobic interactions to side-chain geometry and local environments, we were able to apply our results to the structure of the fixed interface in MthK. The small couplings revealed for I507:L895 and I511:I891 are in good agreement with the structural model of the dimeric interface based on MthK (Fig. 7D). It should be noted that the mutational analysis utilized in this study has unavoidable shortcomings, in that such analysis represents the changes in overall equilibrium between a closed conformation and an open conformation rather than the changes in intrinsic binding energy between the two RCK domains due to the specific mutations. Recently, new crystal structures of MthK RCK were determined in the absence and the presence of Ca2+ (35Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Ye S. Li Y. Chen L. Jiang Y. Cell. 2006; 126: 1161-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subtle, but significant, movement of the fixed interface in the octameric gating ring was noticed during the conformational change of closed to open. Thus, the hydrophobic interface between RCK1 and RCK2 in Slo channel may not be entirely fixed, and such a relative movement may be involved in the conformational coupling of Ca2+ binding and opening of the channel conduction pore. A second interface known as “flexible interface” may also connect RCK1 and RCK2. This interface is formed, in part, by αG and αF as well as by the C-terminal lobe. It has been proposed that the relative movement of this interface is the main conformational change induced by Ca2+ binding in MthK (24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Because RCK2 is truncated at the seventh α helix (αG) and lacks the C-terminal subdomain protruding from the gating ring, however, it is difficult to envision that such an interface is strong enough to hold the two domains together. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the flexible interfaces found in MthK also exist in the heteromeric gating ring comprised of RCK1 and RCK2. It is also important to characterize the structural and functional connections among the three distinct modules, RCK1, RCK2, and the Ca2+ bowl, in the context of Ca2+-dependent conformational change. In summary, we have localized the second RCK domain in the BKCa channel and provided experimental evidence supporting the functional importance of RCK2 in Ca2+-dependent gating of the channel. We propose that RCK2 plays a critical role in the functional integrity of the Slo channel via heterodimeric interaction with RCK1 and transmits the conformational changes evoked by Ca2+ binding to the transmembrane gate.

Here we show that antithrombin antiangiogenic activity is mediated at least in part through the ability of the conformationally altered serpin to block the proangiogenic growth factors fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from forming signaling competent ternary complexes with their protein receptors and heparan sulfate co-receptors on endothelial cells. Cleaved and latent but not native forms of antithrombin blocked the formation of FGF-2-FGF receptor-1 ectodomain-heparin ternary complexes, and the dimerization of these complexes in solution and similarly inhibited the formation of FGF-2-heparin binary complexes and their dimerization.

Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels, is a key physiologic process whose dysregulation underlies many diseases (1Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (3424) Google Scholar). It is particularly important for the transition of tumors from a dormant state to a malignant state, because new vessels supply oxygen, essential nutrients, and growth factors that allow the tumor mass to expand. This expectation has led to the idea that angiogenesis inhibitors may be useful antitumor drugs (2Folkman J. Acta Pathologica, Microbiologica et Immunologica Scandinavica. 2004; 112: 496-507Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A number of naturally occurring angiogenesis inhibitors have been identified as potential antitumor therapeutic agents that are derived by modification of endogenous proteins, e.g. angiostatin is a fragment of plasminogen (3O'Reilly M.S.

Crystal structures of cleaved and latent antiangiogenic forms of antithrombin have revealed that the conformational alterations involve the insertion of the N-terminal end of an exposed reactive loop into the center of the major β-sheet of the protein (10Mourey L.

Blood. 2004; 103: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and suppressing the expression of the proangiogenic heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) perlecan, as well as other proangiogenic genes in cultured HUVECs (16Zhang W.

Olson S.T. Blood. 2004; 103: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of antithrombin antiangiogenic action still remain to be defined.We recently showed that the heparin-binding site of antithrombin, which mediates heparin binding and activation of the anticoagulant function of the serpin, is also a critical mediator of the antiangiogenic activity of cleaved and latent forms of the protein (18Zhang W. Swanson R. Izaguirre G. Xiong Y. Lau L.F. Olson S.T. Blood. 2005; 106: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This finding in conjunction with reports that other endogeneous angiogenesis inhibitors such as endostatin and kallistatin bind heparin or heparan sulfate to produce their antiangiogenic effects (19Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 20Miao R.Q. Chen V. Chao L. Chao J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1604-C1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggested that antiangiogenic forms of antithrombin similarly might act by binding endothelial cell-associated heparan sulfate molecules. Such binding could produce antiangiogenic effects if it blocked the binding of the proangiogenic growth factors, FGF-2 and VEGF, to their HSPG co-receptors (21Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 22Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar).In the present study we provide data to support such a mechanism of antithrombin antiangiogenic action. We thus show that antiangiogenic but not native forms of antithrombin inhibit FGF-2 binding to immobilized heparin, block FGF-2 self-dimerization mediated by heparin, and inhibit heparin-dependent binding of FGF-2 to FGF receptor-1 ectodomain as well as the dimerization of the FGF-2-FGF receptor-1 complex in solution (23Ornitz D.M.

David G. Vlodavsky I. Yayon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 114-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin molecules lacking the anticoagulant binding sequence for native antithrombin are as effective as unfractionated heparin in mediating these effects. Antiangiogenic antithrombin is further shown to inhibit I125-FGF-2 binding to its HSPG co-receptor and suppress HSPG-dependent signaling and growth by FGF-2 or VEGF receptor complexes in cultured HUVECs (21Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 22Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M.

Treatment of HUVECs with heparinase III to eliminate the HSPG co-receptor for FGF-2 is shown to abolish the inhibitory effect of latent antithrombin on growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation or capillary tube formation (26Sasisekharan R. Moses M.A. Nugent M.A. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the antiangiogenic function of antithrombin is mediated at least in part by blocking FGF-2 or VEGF binding to their HSPG co-receptors. This blockade results from the preferential binding of antiangiogenic forms of antithrombin to proangiogenic sequences or domains in heparin or heparan sulfate that are distinct from the anticoagulant sequence recognized by native antithrombin (27De Agostini A.I. Watkins S.C. Slayter H.S. Youssoufian H. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntithrombin—Native, latent, and neutrophil elastase-cleaved forms of human plasma-derived antithrombin were prepared as described previously (17Zhang W.

Blood. 2004; 103: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Heparin—Unfractionated heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa and with an average molecular weight of ∼15,000 was obtained from Sigma. A fractionated heparin with low affinity for native antithrombin because of the absence of the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide sequence and containing ∼26 saccharides (Mr =∼7900) was isolated from unfractionated heparin by size exclusion and repeated antithrombin-agarose affinity chromatography steps as previously described (28Olson S.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—HUVECs were purchased from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and cultured in Medium-200 containing 10% fetal calf serum plus growth supplements and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) (Cascade Biologics) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in air. HUVECs were used within 10 passages.FGF-2-Heparin Binding Assay—Heparin immobilized on acrylic beads (Sigma) was washed twice with Hanks' balanced saline solution (HBSS; Invitrogen), suspended in an equal volume of HBSS, and then 20 μl of the bead slurry was incubated with 10 ng/ml of FGF-2 (recombinant human form; Invitrogen) and varying amounts of native or cleaved antithrombin in a 50-μl total reaction volume for 30 min at room temperature. The heparin beads were washed with 0.5 ml of HBSS buffer three times to remove free FGF-2, and FGF-2 bound to heparin beads was released by suspending the beads in SDS electrophoresis buffer and boiling for 5 min. Bound FGF-2 samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and analyzed by immunoblotting. Protein on the polyacrylamide gel was first transferred onto Immobilon TM-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked by incubation at 25 °C for 60 min in 5% milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), incubated with mouse anti-FGF-2 antibodies (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA) for 16 h at 4 °C, washed in TBST, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 60 min at 25 °C. The immunoreactive proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands on immunoblots were quantitated with a Kodak Image Station 440-CF (Kodak, Rochester, NY).FGF-2 Binding to FGF Receptor-1 Ectodomain—The recombinant ectodomain of FGF receptor-1 isoform IIIc conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (FGFR1c-AP) was a generous gift from Dr. Alan Rapraeger (University of Wisconsin-Madison). The binding assay contained 10 ng/ml of FGF-2, 10 ng/ml FGFR1c-AP, 0.1 μg/ml unfractionated heparin, and varying amounts of native or cleaved antithrombin in HBSS in 200 μl of total volume (23Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). One set of samples was incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by adding 10 μl of anti-alkaline phosphatase antibody coupled to agarose beads (sigma) and incubating a further 2 h to immunoprecipitate FGFR1c-AP complexes with FGF-2. A second set of samples was treated with chemical cross-linker (see below) after the initial incubation and incubated an additional 30 min prior to immunoprecipitating the receptor in order to detect complex formation with antithrombin. Free FGF-2 and antithrombin were removed by washing the immobilized antibody beads twice with 1 ml of HBSS buffer. FGF-2 noncovalently bound to the receptor, and cross-linked antithrombin-receptor complexes were released from the beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%) as in the FGF-2-heparin bead binding experiments. Resolved proteins were then detected by immunoblotting with mouse anti-FGF-2 or sheep anti-antithrombin (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) primary antibodies together with appropriate species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-IgG antibodies as described above.Chemical Cross-linking of FGF-2 and FGF-2-FGFR1c-AP Complexes—To measure FGF-2 multimer formation in the presence of heparin, FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) was incubated in HBSS in the absence or presence of 0.5 μg/ml unfractionated heparin or 0.1 μg/ml ∼26-saccharide heparin with low antithrombin affinity and with varying levels of native or cleaved antithrombin as in the heparin bead binding assay. FGF-2-FGFR1c-AP complex formation was measured by incubating FGF-2, FGFR1c-AP, and heparin in the presence or absence of antithrombin in HBSS for 30 min as described above for the binding assay. Cross-linking of both types of complexes was initiated by adding bis-sulfosuccinimidyl-suberate (Pierce) to a final concentration of 0.01 mg/ml and incubating the mixture for a further 10 min. The reaction was quenched by adding ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0 (final concentration, 10 mm), and incubating for 15 min. Cross-linked protein complexes were then resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% gel for FGF-2 multimers and 8% gel for FGF-2-FGFR1c-AP complexes). Cross-linked FGF-2 multimers and FGF-2-FGFR1c-AP complexes were detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-FGF-2 antibody as above.125I-FGF-2 Binding to HUVECs—Passage 3 HUVECs (0.5 × 106 cells) in 24-well gelatin-coated tissue culture plates (BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA) were starved in 0.5% FBS medium for 12 h, washed three times with binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-buffered Medium-200, pH 7.4 containing 0.2% BSA), and then incubated at 4 °C with 0.2 nm 125I-FGF-2 (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.1 μg/ml heparin in the absence or presence of 5–25 μg/ml native or latent forms of antithrombin for 4 h (22Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). After the binding medium was removed, the cells were washed three times with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.2% BSA. 125I-FGF-2 bound to low affinity HSPG-binding sites was detected by collecting two 0.5-ml washes of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 2 m NaCl and 0.2% BSA. 125I-FGF-2 bound to high affinity FGF-2 receptors was measured by collecting two 0.5-ml washes of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, containing 2 m NaCl and 0.2% BSA. Collected washes were counted in an LKB gamma counter.FGF-2-FGFR1 Signaling in HUVECs—1 × 106 HUVEC cells were sparsely seeded on gelatin-coated six-well plates. Subconfluent cultures were starved in Medium-200 containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Starved HUVECs were preincubated with or without 5–25 μg/ml native or cleaved antithrombin for 30 min at 37 °C and then were stimulated with FGF-2 (15 ng/ml) for 15 min. Stimulated HUVECs were rinsed once with 1 mm Na3VO4 in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Roche Biosciences) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the total protein content in the supernatants was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). To assess FGFR1 autophosphorylation, 200 μgof cell lysate protein was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against FGFR1 cytoplasmic domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The complex was immunoprecipitated (16 h, 4 °C) with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (1:1 gel:buffer), and the bound material was washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated FGFR1 was suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated receptor was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (pY-20 from Santa Cruz), as described above. To analyze for p42/44 MAP kinase phosphorylation, lysates (50 μg of total protein) were subjected to 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon TM-P membranes. The immunoblots were processed as above using anti-phospho-p42/44 MAP kinase antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). To determine the total protein levels for each phosphorylated protein analyzed, each immunoblot membrane was stripped by incubation (30 min, 50 °C) with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by incubation with anti-p42/44 MAP kinase (Cell Signaling) or anti-FGFR-1 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) and processed as above. The blots were quantified with the Kodak Imaging Station.Effect of Heparinases on Antithrombin Inhibition of HUVEC Proliferation or Capillary Tube Formation—For cell proliferation assays, HUVECs were cultured in starving medium (Medium-200 containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum) for 6 h in a 96-well plate. The cells were incubated with 1 unit/ml of either heparinase I, heparinase II, or heparinase III (Sigma) for 4 h at 37°C (30Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with starving medium twice before they were treated with antithrombin and FGF-2. Cell proliferation rates were quantified after another 48-h incubation by adding 20 μl of Cell-Title solution (Promega, Madison, WI), incubating for 1–4 h and measuring the A490 as described previously (18Zhang W. Swanson R. Izaguirre G. Xiong Y. Lau L.F. Olson S.T. Blood. 2005; 106: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For capillary tube formation assays, the cells were treated with heparinases as above, then the cells were suspended in medium plus FGF-2 and seeded onto Matrigel-coated wells, and after allowing attachment cells were incubated in the absence or presence of different forms of antithrombin as described (18Zhang W. Swanson R. Izaguirre G. Xiong Y. Lau L.F. Olson S.T. Blood. 2005; 106: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Antithrombin Effects on VEGF-stimulated HUVEC Proliferation—HUVECs were starved by culturing in Medium-200 supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 12 h. They were then treated with either VEGF165 or VEGF121 (Invitrogen) together with native or cleaved forms of antithrombin and incubated for 48 h. Cell proliferation rates were quantified as above with Cell-Title solution.RESULTSEffect of Antithrombin on FGF-2 Binding to Heparin—The proangiogenic effects of FGF-2 are mediated by binding to an endothelial cell protein receptor and heparan sulfate proteoglycan co-receptor (26Sasisekharan R.

Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To test whether antiangiogenic antithrombin might block the proangiogenic effects of FGF-2 by competitively binding to its heparan sulfate co-receptor, we determined whether the antiangiogenic cleaved form of antithrombin could inhibit the binding of FGF-2 to heparin, an established model for the heparan sulfate co-receptor (22Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). FGF-2 binding to heparin immobilized on acrylic beads was assayed in the absence and presence of antiangiogenically active (cleaved) and inactive (native) forms of antithrombin. FGF-2-heparin complexes were collected by centrifugation and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-FGF-2 antibody. FGF-2 bound with high affinity to the immobilized heparin (Fig. 1, lane 2), and this binding could be almost completely inhibited by cleaved antithrombin in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 6–8). By contrast, native antithrombin failed to inhibit FGF-2 binding to heparin but rather modestly stimulated the binding at equivalent doses (lanes 3–5).Effect of Antithrombin on Heparin-mediated FGF-2 Dimerization—Heparin binds to FGF growth factors in a multivalent manner, resulting in their oligomerization (23Ornitz D.M.

To assess whether cleaved antithrombin could block the heparin-dependent oligomerization of FGF-2, FGF-2 was incubated with heparin in the absence or presence of native and cleaved forms of antithrombin, and then oligomerization of FGF-2 was analyzed by chemical cross-linking followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FGF-2. Heparin was observed to promote the formation of an FGF-2 dimer (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 5), and this dimerization was abrogated by cleaved antithrombin in a dose dependent fashion (lanes 6–8). Native antithrombin did not inhibit the dimerization and appeared to slightly enhance the formation of FGF-2 dimers (lanes 2–4), consistent with the ability of native antithrombin to promote FGF-2 binding to heparin (Fig. 1). Heparin lacking the anticoagulant binding sequence for native antithrombin and with low affinity for the serpin was just as effective as unfractionated heparin in mediating FGF-2 dimerization and in having this dimerization inhibited by cleaved but not native antithrombin (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Cleaved antithrombin blocks the heparin-mediated dimerization of FGF-2. FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) was incubated alone (lane 5) or with heparin (lane 1) and increasing concentrations of native antithrombin (AT, lanes 2–4) or cleaved antithrombin (lanes 6–8) for 1 h at 24°C. Bis-sulfosuccinimidyl-suberate was then added to initiate cross-linking, the reaction was quenched with ethanolamine, and cross-linked FGF-2 was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FGF-2 antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The upper panel shows experiments conducted with unfractionated heparin (0.5 μg/ml), and the lower panel shows experiments conducted with a fractionated ∼7900 Mr heparin lacking the anticoagulant binding sequence for native antithrombin (0.1 μg/ml).

The FGFR1c-AP receptor was then immunoprecipitated with anti-alkaline phosphatase antibody conjugated to Sepharose beads, and FGF-2 bound to the receptor was detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-FGF-2 antibody.

The formation of Z ring is negatively regulated by EzrA, which ensures only one ring at the midcell per cell cycle. The mechanism leading to the negative regulation of Z-ring formation by EzrA has been analyzed. Our data reveal that the interaction between EzrA and FtsZ not only reduces the GTP-binding ability of FtsZ but also accelerates the rate of GTP hydrolysis, both of which are unfavorable for the polymerization of FtsZ. Moreover, the acceleration in rate of GTP hydrolysis by EzrA is attributed to stabilization of the transition state for GTP hydrolysis and reduction in the affinity of GDP for FtsZ. Clearly, EzrA is able to modify the GTP hydrolysis cycle of FtsZ. On the basis of these results, a model for how EzrA acts to negatively regulate Z-ring formation is proposed.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 508-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FtsZ is a prokaryotic tubulin homologue that possesses GTPase activity. Although its amino acid sequence includes only a short segment with a high degree of sequence homology to tubulins, there is a remarkable similarity between the higher order structures of FtsZ and tubulin (7Nogales E.

Polymerization of FtsZ along the inner circumference of the cytoplasmic membrane is GTP-dependent (4Lutkenhaus J. Addinall S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 93-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and is regulated by the GTP hydrolysis cycle of FtsZ (11Romerg L. Levin P.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 125-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of Escherichia coli FtsZ has identified three catalytic amino acid residues in the GTPase-activating T7 loop of FtsZ, which are located far from the active site and are important for the GTPase but not nucleotide-binding activity of FtsZ (13Lu C. Stricker J. Erickson H.P. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Scheffers D.J. de Wit J.G. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Wang X. Huang J. Mukherjee A. Cao C. Luthkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5551-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). On the basis of the structural data of FtsZ, it was assumed that the three catalytic amino acid residues in the T7 loop of one FtsZ subunit of the protofilament can be brought into the vicinity of the catalytic site of the second FtsZ by making head-to-tail contact (16Leung A.K. Leucile White E. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. DeVito J.A. Borhani D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is the FtsZ in head-to-tail contact that possesses the GTPase activity (14Scheffers D.J. de Wit J.G. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the main form of nucleotide in FtsZ polymers was found to be GDP-Pi (17Scheffers D.J. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1517-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or GTP (12Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), depending on the treatment of FtsZ polymers. In addition, excess GDP was found to promote disassembly of the preformed FtsZ polymers (18Scheffers D.J. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). EzrA is a transmembrane protein involved in spatial regulation of Z-ring formation in Bacillus subtilis (19Levin P.A. Kurster I.G. Grossman A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is uniformly distributed throughout the plasma membrane in both nondividing and dividing cells and concentrates at the cytokinetic ring in an FtsZ-dependent manner during cell division (19Levin P.A. Kurster I.G. Grossman A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that EzrA plays both positive and negative roles in cell division (19Levin P.A. Kurster I.G. Grossman A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Chung K.M. Hsu H.H. Govindan S. Chang B.Y. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5926-5932Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Evidence for the positive role of EzrA came from the observation that low level expression of EzrA increases both cell length and percentage of filamentous cells of B. subtilis during growth (20Chung K.M. Hsu H.H. Govindan S. Chang B.Y. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5926-5932Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The negative role of EzrA was noted by the fact that null mutation of EzrA lowers the critical concentration of FtsZ required for Z-ring assembly and leads to the formation of polar Z rings and septa (19Levin P.A. Kurster I.G. Grossman A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, the null mutation of EzrA is able to suppress the instability of FtsZ polymer associated with minCD overexpression (21Levin P.A. Schwartz R.L. Grossman A.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 449-5452Crossref Google Scholar). However, how EzrA acts to fulfill both the positive and negative roles remains unclear. Recently, a purified thioredoxin-EzrA fusion protein was found to interact with FtsZ and to block FtsZ assembly but not disassembly in vitro. However, it did not significantly alter the GTPase activity of FtsZ (22Haeusser D.P. Schwartz A.M. Oates M.E. Levin P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This implies that EzrA binds neither to the nucleotide-binding site nor to the catalytic amino acids in the GTPase-activating T7 loop of FtsZ to drastically block the interaction between the FtsZ monomers and thus to eliminate the GTPase activity of FtsZ. Rather, EzrA may regulate FtsZ assembly through modulating the functional conformation of FtsZ. To verify the idea, we analyzed the effects of EzrA on the GTP hydrolysis cycle of FtsZ. On the basis of our data, a model for how EzrA acts to negatively regulate Z-ring formation during B. subtilis cell division is proposed. Construction of Plasmids for Expression of EzrA and FtsZ—The DNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain (amino acid residues 27–562) of EzrA was amplified from the chromosome DNA of B. subtilis by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET21d (Novagen). The resultant plasmid, pKM4, expressed a 59-kDa EzrA with a His6 tag fused at its C terminus. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers used for ezrA synthesis and cloning were 5′-AGACTACCATGGCCGAAATCGACCGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGTTACCTCGAGAGCGGATATGTCAGCTTTG-3′, respectively. The FtsZ having a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed using the pET21d-derived plasmid, pKM2. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers used for the synthesis and cloning of ftsZ were 5′-AGACTACCATGGCTTTGGAGTTCGAAACAAACATAG-3′ and 5′-CGTTACCTCGAGGCCGCGTTTATTACGGTTTC-3′, respectively. Purification of EzrA and FtsZ—E. coli BL21/DE3 harboring pKM2 or pKM4 plasmid was inoculated into the 2xYT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced at A550 of 0.8 by 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested 4 h later, pelleted at 8,000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min, and resuspended with 20 ml of ice-cold buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Both His-tagged EzrA and FtsZ were purified using the same method. Briefly, the cells containing the target proteins were lysed with a French press at 16,000 p.s.i. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm, 4 °C for 20 min. The target proteins in the supernatant were absorbed with TALON™ IMAC resin (Clontech) and washed extensively with the buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol) supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. The target proteins were then eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 150 mm imidazole. Sample fractions containing the target proteins were pooled, applied onto Superdex 200HR column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol). The purified EzrA and FtsZ were concentrated by Centricon 10 (Millipore), estimated to be at least higher than 95% in homogeneity, and stored in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50% glycerol at -20 °C. The proteins were dialyzed against a specific buffer before being used to assay the effect of EzrA on a specific property of FtsZ. Cross-linking Assay—The protein mixture containing 5 μm each of FtsZ and EzrA in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol) was cross-linked with a thiolcleavable primary amine-reactive homobifunctional cross-linker, 3,3-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. The concentration of the cross-linker was 250 μm. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Finally, the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-FtsZ and anti-EzrA. Effect of EzrA on Binding of BODIPY®FL-GTPγS 2The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); MES, morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin. to FtsZ—The analysis was based on relief of the fluorescence quenching of BODIPY®FL-GTPγS, a GTP analogue, upon its binding to FtsZ. To measure the effect of EzrA on binding of the GTP analogue to FtsZ, 400 μl of 500 nm BODIPY®FL-GTPγS in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) was loaded into a 1-ml cuvette. Basal fluorescence (λex = 485 nm and λem = 530 nm) of the GTP analogue was taken at room temperature with an F4500 FL Spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Afterward, 250 nm FtsZ either alone or preincubated with an equal concentration of EzrA (or bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 30 min was further added into the cuvette. Fluorescence of the GTP analogue for each treatment was again monitored. The apparent KD value for FtsZ and BODIPY®FL-GTPγS binding was determined by measuring the fluorescence of the GTP analogue (from 12.5 to 200 nm) after mixing with either 250 nm FtsZ or 250 nm FtsZ preincubated with an equal concentration of EzrA for 30 min. The data of relative fluorescence obtained at various concentrations of BODIPY®FL-GTPγS was fitted to the one-site-binding hyperbolic function of Grafit (version 5; Erithacus Software). Effect of EzrA on Binding Affinity of GTP, GDP-AlF-4 or GDP for FtsZ—The protein sample containing 500 nm FtsZ or 500 nm each of FtsZ and EzrA was mixed with 500 nm BODIPY®FL-GTPγS in a 1-ml cuvette. Fluorescence of the GTP analogue in each sample was followed immediately and referred to as 100% relative fluorescence, respectively. Then various concentrations of GTP, GDP-AlF-4 or GDP were added into the samples to compete with BODIPY®FL-GTPγS for FtsZ binding. The fluorescence obtained for each treatment was then divided by the reference fluorescence to determine the percentage of relative fluorescence. Effect of EzrA on the GTPase Activity of FtsZ—The GTPase activity of FtsZ was measured using the Enzchek free phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), which takes advantage of the spectrophotometric shift of maximal absorbance from 330 to 360 nm when the substrate, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside, is converted into ribose 1-phosphate and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine through the purine nucleoside phosphorylase-dependent addition of phosphate to 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside. In order to accurately measure the GTPase activity of FtsZ, 1 mm GTP was preincubated with the kit reagent for 10 min at 22 °C to deplete free phosphate before mixing with the protein sample, which includes FtsZ, EzrA, or a mixture of FtsZ and EzrA in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 175 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2. The concentration of FtsZ or EzrA in each experiment was 5 μm. The absorbance at 360 nm of the sample was taken every 10 s at room temperature with a U2001 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi). The rate of GTP hydrolysis was calculated based on the regression line of phosphate standards. To measure the effect of EzrA on the apparent kcat and Km of FtsZ, the GTPase activity of FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with EzrA was measured at 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 μm GTP. The initial rate of GTP hydrolysis for each reaction thus obtained was fitted to the enzyme kinetics program of Grafit (version 5; Erithacus Software) to determine the kcat and Km. Effect of EzrA on FtsZ Polymerization Assayed by Sedimentation—Procedures for sedimentation analysis were similar to those described in a previous report (23Trusca D. Scott S. Thompson C. Bramphill D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3946-3953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before sedimentation analysis, the purified FtsZ was cleared by spinning at 250,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min to remove any aggregate or preexisting polymer. Then FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with an equal molar concentration of EzrA (or BSA) was diluted with polymerization buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm KCl) at room temperature to a concentration of 5 μm for each protein. Afterward, 1 mm GTP or GTPγS was added to stimulate the polymerization of FtsZ. Bundle formation of FtsZ polymers was initiated by adding 0.1 mg/ml diethyl-aminoethyl-dextran hydrochloride (DEAE-dextran) to the assembly reaction. The final volume of each assembly reaction was 100 μl. The bundles were spun down at 250,000 × g for 10 min at 20 °C and resuspended in 100 μl of polymerization buffer. Both the supernatant and suspended bundle polymers were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE to determine the content of FtsZ. The Interaction between EzrA and FtsZ—It has been reported that the thioredoxin-EzrA fusion protein is able to interact with FtsZ; however, the interaction did not significantly alter the GTPase activity of FtsZ (22Haeusser D.P. Schwartz A.M. Oates M.E. Levin P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We speculated that the thioredoxin moiety of the fusion protein may have impaired the function of EzrA. To solve the potential problem, EzrA with a smaller His6 tag fused at the C terminus was constructed and used to examine the effect of EzrA on FtsZ function. Before the examination, the capability of interaction between EzrA and FtsZ was first verified using a chemical cross-linking method. As shown in Fig. 1A, a protein with a gel mobility expected for the cross-linked FtsZ-EzrA (∼100 kDa) was visualized when the mixture of FtsZ and EzrA was treated with the homobifunctional thio-cleavable cross-linker, 3,3-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate), and probed with anti-EzrA. To confirm that this protein was indeed FtsZ-EzrA, the specific protein was recovered from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel run in parallel with an immunoblot and then subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FtsZ and anti-EzrA under either reducing or nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1B). Both free FtsZ and EzrA appeared when the recovered protein was treated with the reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol; however, the fusion protein remained intact and reacted with both anti-FtsZ and anti-EzrA when β-mercaptoethanol was omitted (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that EzrA is able to interact directly with FtsZ. EzrA Reduces the Binding of the GTP Analogue, BODIPY®FL-GTPγS, to FtsZ—The ability of EzrA to directly interact with FtsZ raised the possibility that EzrA may modify the GTP hydrolysis cycle of FtsZ through mutual interaction. Thus, the change in GTP-binding activity of FtsZ was analyzed. The fluorescent GTP analogue, BODIPY®FL-GTPγS, used to study the functional mechanism of G-protein, was adopted for this analysis due to its convenience and applicability toward real time and continuous measurement (24Kimple R.J. Jones M.B. Shute A. Yerxa B.R. Siderovski D.P. Willard F.S. Combinatorial Chemistry & High Throughput Screening. 2003; 6: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Basically, the fluorescence of BODIPY (fluorophore) is significantly quenched in solution by intramolecular interaction between BODIPY and guanine base of the GTP analogue; however, the fluorescence increases appreciably upon binding of the analogue to the G-protein. As expected, fluorescence quenching of BODIPY was detected for the free GTP analogue (Fig. 2A, black line). A similar phenomenon was observed when the analogue was incubated with EzrA, indicating that EzrA is unable to bind the analogue (Fig. 2A, purple line). However, upon binding to FtsZ, fluorescence quenching of the GTP analogue was relieved, and an approximately 95% increase in relative fluorescence was obtained (Fig. 2A, blue line). Instead, only 57% increase was obtained when FtsZ was preincubated with equal concentration of EzrA (Fig. 2A, yellow line). Taken together, these results suggested that EzrA is able to lower the affinity of the GTP analogue for FtsZ. To confirm this idea, fluorescence of the GTP analogue added to FtsZ preincubated with various concentrations of EzrA was measured. As shown in Fig. 2B, fluorescence of the GTP analogue decreased as the dosage of EzrA was increased. Minimal fluorescence was obtained as the molar ratio of EzrA to FtsZ reached 1:1 or 2:1 (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that EzrA and FtsZ are able to form a 1:1 complex. The ability of EzrA to specifically affect binding of the GTP analogue to FtsZ was further strengthened by the fact that BSA did not have any significant effect on relief of fluorescence quenching caused by FtsZ (Fig. 2A, red line). Since the effect of EzrA on relief of fluorescence quenching disappeared when FtsZ was incubated with the GTP analogue prior to mixing with EzrA (Fig. 2A, green line), we proposed that EzrA plays its role not by acting on FtsZ polymers. Kinetic analysis of the binding affinity of BODIPY®FL-GTPγS for FtsZ was also performed (Fig. 2D). In the analysis, various concentrations of the GTP analogue were mixed with FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with an equal concentration of EzrA, since FtsZ and EzrA may form a 1:1 complex. Fluorescence of the GTP analogue was then measured, and the data were fitted to the one-site-binding hyperbolic function of Grafit to determine the KD value for FtsZ and BODIPY®FL-GTPγS binding. The value thus obtained was 27.30 ± 5.22 or 78.27 ± 28.98 nm, respectively, for FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with EzrA, indicating that EzrA is able to reduce the binding of the GTP analogue to FtsZ. EzrA Reduces the Binding Affinity of GTP for FtsZ—The reduction in binding of the GTP analogue to FtsZ by EzrA suggests that EzrA must be also able to modulate the affinity of GTP for FtsZ. To verify this, a competition assay was performed. FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with EzrA was mixed, respectively, with BODIPY®FL-GTPγS before adding various concentrations of GTP. Competition between GTP and the GTP analogue for FtsZ was then followed (Fig. 3A). A decrease in fluorescence was observed for both FtsZ and FtsZ preincubated with EzrA, indicating that GTP is able to replace the FtsZ-bound GTP analogue irrespective of whether or not FtsZ was preincubated with EzrA. However, the concentration of GTP (IC50) required to remove 50% of the GTP analogue away from FtsZ preincubated with equal molarity of EzrA (3.22 ± 0.47 μm) was 1.6-fold higher than that from FtsZ alone (2.05 ± 0.06 μm) (Fig. 3B). This indicated that EzrA is able to reduce the GTP-binding activity of FtsZ. We also analyzed the effects of different molar ratios of EzrA to FtsZ on IC50 of GTP. As shown in Fig. 3C, maximal IC50 of GTP was obtained as the molar ratio of EzrA and FtsZ reached 1:1, further indicating that a 1:1 complex of EzrA and FtsZ may be formed. EzrA Enhances the Binding of the Transition State Analogue of GTP but Lowers the Binding of the Hydrolyzed Product to FtsZ—The capability of EzrA to modify the binding of GTP to FtsZ led us to propose that EzrA may also modify the binding of FtsZ to GDP-AlF-4, a transition state analogue of GTP (25Coleman D.E.

Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) and also to the hydrolyzed product, GDP. The idea was put to test by adding various concentrations of GDP-AlF-4 or GDP to FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with equal molar concentration of EzrA in a fixed concentration of BODIPY®FL-GTPγS. With GDP-AlF-4 as the competitor, fluorescence decrease of the GTP analogue was more pronounced for FtsZ preincubated with EzrA than for FtsZ alone (Fig. 4A). The concentration of GDP-AlF-4 (IC50) required to remove 50% of the GTP analogue away from FtsZ in the presence or absence of EzrA was 0.46 ± 0.07 or 1.27 ± 0.28 μm, respectively (Fig. 4B). The relatively lower IC50 of GDP-AlF-4 for FtsZ preincubated with EzrA than for FtsZ alone implicated that EzrA is able to stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis of FtsZ. Since the lowest IC50 was obtained when the molar ratio of EzrA to FtsZ reached 1:1 or higher than 1:1, it was further suggested that EzrA is able to complex with FtsZ in 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 4E). To test whether EzrA can modulate the binding affinity of GDP for FtsZ, a competition assay was also performed. FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with EzrA was mixed, respectively, with BODIPY®FL-GTPγS before adding various concentrations of GDP. A decrease in fluorescence was observed for both FtsZ and FtsZ preincubated with EzrA (Fig. 4C). The IC50 of GDP for FtsZ preincubated with EzrA (3.87 ± 0.10 μm) was 1.26-fold higher than from FtsZ (3.07 ± 0.22 μm) (Fig. 4D), indicating that EzrA is able to lower slightly the affinity of GDP for FtsZ. Similarly, the maximal IC50 of GDP was observed when the molar ratio of EzrA to FtsZ was 1:1 or higher, which is also an indication of the formation of a 1:1 EzrA and FtsZ complex. EzrA Enhances the GTPase Activity of FtsZ—The increase in binding affinity of FtsZ for GDP-AlF-4 by EzrA suggests that EzrA is able to increase the GTPase activity of FtsZ by lowering the activation energy for GTP hydrolysis. To corroborate this idea, we analyzed the effect of EzrA on the GTP hydrolysis rate of FtsZ using a spectrophotometric method that measures the phosphate released from GTP hydrolysis. Our data revealed that GTP was hydrolyzed by FtsZ at a rate of 0.66 ± 0.10 GTP/FtsZ min-1 in the absence of EzrA (Fig. 5, solid triangles). However, the rate was increased about 1.6-fold to 1.05 ± 0.15 GTP/FtsZ min-1 as an equal molar concentration of EzrA was present (Fig. 5, solid and open circles). Moreover, the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis was dependent on the molar ratio of EzrA to FtsZ; the highest acceleration was achieved as the molar ratio reached 1:1 or higher (Fig. 5B). The apparent kcat and Km for GTP hydrolysis by FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with equal molar concentration of EzrA were also measured. As shown in Table 1, the kcat (0.75 min-1) for GTP hydrolysis by B. subtilis FtsZ is comparable with that reported previously (22Haeusser D.P. Schwartz A.M. Oates M.E. Levin P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); however, it is lower than those reported for E. coli FtsZ (12Romberg L. Mitchison T.J.

Moreover, the Km (39.45 μm) is also comparable with that reported for E. coli FtsZ (29Laöppchen T. Hartog A.F. Pinas V.A. Koomen G. den Blaauwen T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the presence of EzrA, the kcat for GTP hydrolysis by B. subtilis FtsZ increased about 1.67-fold (1.25 min-1/0.75 min-1), further confirming that EzrA is able to enhance the GTP hydrolysis rate of FtsZ. Moreover, consistent with the data from the competition assay (Fig. 3B), a 2.35-fold (92.92 μm/39.45 μm) increase in Km for GTPase activity was observed as FtsZ was preincubated with EzrA (Table 1), again supporting that EzrA is able to lower the GTP-binding activity of FtsZ.TABLE 1The apparent kcat and Km of FtsZ or FtsZ preincubated with EzrA The intracellular concentration of GTP is as high as 1-3 mm in exponentially growing cells (41Sonenshein A.L.

The effect of EzrA on FtsZ polymerization was then assayed using sedimentation analysis (23Trusca D. Scott S. Thompson C. Bramphill D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3946-3953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 34Mukherjee A. Luthenhaus J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This analysis relies on the formation of large bundles of FtsZ polymers in the presence of bundling agents, such as DEAE-dextran, and the efficient pelleting of high molecular weight bundles during centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 6B, EzrA efficiently inhibited FtsZ sedimentation when equal concentration of EzrA and FtsZ was incubated prior to the addition of GTPγS and DEAE-dextran. Similar results were obtained when GTPγS was replaced with GTP (Fig. 6A). However, most of the FtsZ precipitated when EzrA was replaced with BSA. These results demonstrated that the decrease in GTP-binding activity of FtsZ caused by EzrA is enough to inhibit the formation of FtsZ polymers in vitro. Moreover, study of the effect of EzrA on FtsZ polymerization by 90° angle light scattering was performed in the presence of GTP, since GTPγS is inappropriate for the assay (18Scheffers D.J. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similar to that reported previously (22Haeusser D.P. Schwartz A.M. Oates M.E. Levin P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), inhibition of FtsZ polymerization was also observed (data not shown). We have investigated the detailed mechanism responsible for the negative regulation of FtsZ polymerization by EzrA. Our results reveal that EzrA is able to reduce the affinity of GTP for FtsZ and enhance the GTPase activity of FtsZ, both of which prevent the assembly of FtsZ (Figs. 3, 5, and 6). These data, coupled with the ability of EzrA to directly interact with FtsZ (Fig. 1) (22Haeusser D.P. Schwartz A.M. Oates M.E. Levin P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), demonstrate that EzrA participates in the FtsZ GTP hydrolysis cycle to regulate FtsZ polymer dynamic. They also support a model for the negative regulation of Z-ring formation by EzrA (Fig. 7). As a negative regulator, the plasma membrane-bound EzrA prevents inappropriate Z-ring formation at any cellular locus other than the midcell by direct interaction with FtsZ (Fig. 7). The interaction reduces the GTP-binding ability of FtsZ, which inhibits Z-ring formation. It also enhances the GTPase activity of FtsZ by stabilizing the transition state for GTP hydrolysis and reduces the GDP-binding activity of FtsZ (Fig. 4), both of which promote the disassembly of polymerized FtsZ. The mechanism responsible for the enhancement of the GTPase activity of FtsZ by EzrA is similar to that reported for RSG, a GTPase activator for heterotrimeric G protein (35Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 36Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 37Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Both EzrA and RSG act to stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis of the GTP-binding protein. The 1.5–1.7-fold increase in the GTPase activity of FtsZ by EzrA as observed in the experiment is subtle but significant and is different from that reported for the thioredoxin-EzrA fusion protein, which shows no appreciable effect on the GTPase activity of FtsZ (22Haeusser D.P. Schwartz A.M. Oates M.E. Levin P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Apparently, the fused thioredoxin moiety has impaired the weak modulation activity of EzrA. Moreover, these results implicate that modulation of the polymer dynamics of FtsZ by EzrA is also subtle. In other words, prevention of Z-ring formation in vivo does not require a drastic change in the GTPase activity of FtsZ; a subtle change in GTPase activity may already have the ability to destabilize the Z-ring. A similar view for fine tuning of FtsZ polymer stability has been also reported by another research group (11Romerg L. Levin P.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 125-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). On the basis of the effects of various molar ratios of EzrA to FtsZ on the IC50 of GTP, GDP-AlF-4, and GDP and on the GTP hydrolysis rate of FtsZ (Figs. 3, 4, 5), it was clear that EzrA and FtsZ may form a 1:1 complex. This raises a possibility that the two rings of FtsZ and EzrA as observed at the initiation of cell division (19Levin P.A. Kurster I.G. Grossman A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) may associate in 1:1 stoichiometry at midcell. Several inhibitors for FtsZ assembly have been identified in E. coli and B. subtilis. E. coli SulA is the one that is well characterized. This protein negatively regulates Z-ring formation by inhibiting the GTPase activity of FtsZ (23Trusca D. Scott S. Thompson C. Bramphill D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3946-3953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mukherjee A. Cao C.N. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The inhibition is attributed to SulA binding to the GTPase-activating T7 loop (opposite to the nucleotide-binding site) of FtsZ (39Cordell S.C. Robinson E.J. Lowe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7889-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which in turn blocks the dimerization of FtsZ and therefore its GTPase activity (14Scheffers D.J. de Wit J.G. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 364-2371Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying the inhibition of Z-ring formation by EzrA is totally different from that found for SulA in terms of modulation of the GTPase activity of FtsZ (Fig. 5). The limited increase in the GTPase activity of FtsZ by EzrA suggests that EzrA does not contribute any catalytic amino acid residue to the active site of FtsZ to enhance the GTP-hydrolyzing activity of FtsZ. The seemingly contradictory effects of EzrA on FtsZ (i.e. the decrease in GTP-binding but increase in GTPase activity of FtsZ) raise the possibility that EzrA may act to fulfill its role simply by changing the conformation of FtsZ. This can be supported by the fact that EzrA is able to stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis and to slightly reduce the GDP-binding activity of FtsZ (Fig. 4)."

To avoid misacylation of non-cognate tRNAs, each synthetase recognizes identity elements idiosyncratic to their cognate substrates. tRNA identity elements can be unique and universally distributed, as in the case of the G3:U70 base pair presented by all tRNAAla (1Hou Y.M. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6800-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Gabriel K. Schneider J. McClain W.H. Science. 1996; 271: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the evolutionary constraints imposed by the necessity of translation fidelity are not rigid, and the set of recognition elements for many tRNAs has changed during evolution (1Hou Y.M. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6800-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Ribas de Pouplana L. Life. 2005; 57: 523-524PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the comparison between sets of tRNA recognition elements in extant species could be used to estimate their evolutionary or biological relatedness. Here we study the evolution of the serylation reaction of tRNASer and tRNASec by characterizing this activity in trypanosomatids, a group of protozoa normally considered to form a basal group within eukaryotes (4Baldauf S.L. Roger A.J. Wenk-Siefert I. Doolittle W.F. Science. 2000; 290: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the analysis of the evolutionary history of Trypanosoma seryl-tRNA synthetases (SerRSs) 3The abbreviations used are: SerRS, seryl-tRNA synthetases; RNAi, RNA interference. and the determination of the identity elements used by this enzyme to recognize tRNASer show that Trypanosoma SerRSs are closer relatives of metazoan SerRSs than plant, fungi, or other protozoan enzymes. SerRSs are class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that contain the characteristic active site domain of this family of enzymes (5Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 6Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Cell. 2001; 104: 191-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition to this domain, the structures of most SerRSs include a coiled-coil domain at the amino end of their sequences and, in the case of eukaryotic enzymes, a C-terminal extension that plays a modest role on protein stability and amino acid recognition (7Weygand-Durasevic I. Lenhard B. Filipic S. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Lenhard B. Filipic S. Landeka I. Skrtic I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1136-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The N-terminal coiled-coil domain is essential for the recognition of the elbow and, especially, the long variable loop of tRNASer (9Borel F. Vincent C. Leberman R. Härtlein M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Lenhard B. Praetorius-Ibba M. Filipic S. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Studies of the recognition modes between SerRS and tRNASer from different kingdoms of life have shown that some, but not all, tRNASer identity determinants have been conserved during evolution (for a review, see Ref. 11Lenhard B. Orellana O. Ibba M. Weygand-Durasevic I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and that different recognition modes exist. Thus, in bacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the specific charging of tRNASer depends on the recognition of some base pairs in the acceptor stem but not of the discriminator base at position 73 (12Himeno H. Yoshida S. Soma A. Nishikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Normanly J. Ollick T. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5680-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In these cases, the sequence of the variable loop is also crucial. The crystallographic structures of Thermus thermophilus SerRS complexed with tRNASer, confirm these observations (15Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Biou V. Yoremchuk M. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A second type of recognition mode, seen in archaeal and human SerRS, is characterized by the crucial role of the discriminator base (17Metzger A.U. Heckl M. Willbold D. Breitschopf K. RajBhandary U.L. Rosch P. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4551-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Achsel T. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3333-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In these cases, the sequence of the variable loop is not important, but its size and orientation are fundamental for the interaction with the enzyme (20Wu X.Q. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5589-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Heckl M. Busch K. Gross H.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The main common features between the bacterial and eukaryotic recognition strategies are the importance of the variable loop and the dispensable character of the anticodon stem-loop. Finally, a third type of tRNASer recognition is seen in the SerRSs of methanogenic archaea, which use an idiosyncratic N-terminal domain to recognize the acceptor stem and the variable loop of their tRNA substrates (22Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J. 2006; 4: 4Google Scholar). These unusual enzymes are also sensitive to the discriminator base position of their cognate tRNAs (23Bilokapic S. Korencic D. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SerRS also aminoacylates tRNASec with serine as the first step for the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins. Components of the selenocysteine insertion machinery have been identified by computational methods in species of the three branches of the tree of life. Recently, some of these components have also been identified in trypanosomatids, and the existence of a tRNASec in these organisms has been verified (24Cassago A. Rodrigues E.M. Prieto E.L. Gaston K.W. Alfonzo J.D. Iribar M.P. Berry M.J. Cruz A.K. Thiemann O.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 23: 23Google Scholar). The Trypanosoma selenoproteome appears to contain three selenoproteins, and Trypanosoma brucei is highly sensitive to the action of specific selenoprotein inhibitors (25Lobanov A.V. Gromer S. Salinas G. Gladyshev V.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4012-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the characterization of the selenoprotein incorporation machinery of Trypanosoma may offer new insights into an essential pathway for these parasites and offer new strategies for drug development. The serylation reaction of tRNASec has been characterized in detail in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens (26Amberg R. Mizutani T. Wu X.Q. Gross H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Baron C. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20375-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the system has not been characterized in protozoans or other basal eukaryotes. In H. sapiens and E. coli, tRNASec transcripts have been described as being, respectively, 10- and 100-fold less efficient substrates for SerRS than tRNASer. It has been proposed that this difference is caused by the unique structure of tRNASec (27Baron C. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20375-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the first characterization of the serylation of tRNASec in trypanosomatids. We confirm the expression of tRNASec in T. brucei and show that, unlike most trypanosomal tRNAs, it is exclusively localized in the cytosol. Furthermore, we characterize its aminoacylation with serine by Trypanosoma cruzi SerRS. We show that the aminoacylation constants of tRNASec in Trypanosoma differ substantially from those reported in other organisms, suggesting that kinetic differences in the serylation activity of tRNASec may be species-specific and that regulatory strategies may exist based on the efficiency of serine-tRNASec synthesis. Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. l-[3H]serine and HisTrap nickel columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Pfu Ultra DNA polymerase was from Stratagene, and vector pQE-70 was from Qiagen. Novablue cells were from Novagen. T. cruzi genomic DNA was a gift from Dr. P. Bonay (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain). RNAi-mediated Ablation of SerRS—RNAi-mediated ablation of the T. brucei SerRS was performed using stem-loop constructs containing the puromycin resistance gene as described (28Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As an insert, we used a 498-bp fragment (nucleotides 1–498) of the T. brucei SerS gene. Transfection of T. brucei (strain 29-13), selection with antibiotics, cloning, and induction with tetracycline were done as described (29McCulloch R. Vassella E. Burton P. Boshart M. Barry J.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 262: 53-86PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the in vivo charging levels of the tRNASer and the tRNASec, we isolated total RNA from uninduced and induced cells by using the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The tRNAs remain aminoacylated during this procedure due to the low pH employed by the method. Subsequently, the RNA samples were analyzed on 50-cm-long acid urea polyacrylamide gels as described (31Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can resolve aminoacylated from deacylated tRNAs. The gels were analyzed by Northern hybridization (32Tan T.H. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The following 32P5′-end labeled oligonucleotides were used as probes: 5′-TGGCGTCACCAGCAGGATTC-3′ (for the tRNASerCGA) and 5′-ACCAGCTGAGCTCATCGTGGC-3′ (for tRNASec). tRNA Localization Studies—To determine the intracellular localization of tRNASec, we prepared mitochondria free of cytosolic RNAs by digitonin extraction and subsequent RNase A digestion from procyclic T. brucei as described (32Tan T.H. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RNAs from total cells or isolated mitochondria were purified as indicated above (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). To test whether tRNASec concentrations were different in different life stages of T. brucei, total RNA of procyclic (strain 427) and bloodstream (strain AnTat1.1, a gift from Dr. Seebeck, University of Bern, Switzerland) stages of T. brucei was purified. To test whether expression of tRNASec is induced in medium containing selenium or under oxidative stress, total RNA was isolated from procyclic T. brucei grown in the absence (0) or the presence of 0.005 and 0.5 μg/ml added Na2SeO3 or in the absence or presence of 10 and 25 μmol of added H2O2 (data not shown). For all RNA fractions, the relative expression level of the tRNASec was analyzed by Northern hybridization using the tRNASec-specific oligonucleotide indicated above. The initiator tRNAMet and tRNAIle were detected using the oligonucleotide 5′-GTTGGTTTCGATCCAACG-3′ and 5′-TGCTCCCGGCGGGTTCGAA-3′, respectively. tRNA Preparation—Constructions containing a T7 promoter followed by the gene encoding wild type or mutated tRNAs were assembled using six DNA oligonucleotides that were first annealed, and then ligated, between HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of plasmid pUC19. In vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase was performed according to standard protocols (33Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Transcripts were separated on denaturing PAGE, and full-length tRNAs were eluted from gel using an electroelution apparatus (Schleicher & Schüll) and refolded (2 min at 90 °C followed by a gradual reduction of temperature in presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2). Finally, aminoacylation plateaus were used to calculate the concentration of active molecules for each tRNA preparation. Enzyme Cloning and Purification—The 1.4-kbp intron-less gene coding for T. cruzi SerRS (Tc00.1047053511163.10) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (strain MC) using Pfu Ultra DNA polymerase and cloned in the vector pQE-70 for bacterial expression of a C-terminal His6-tagged protein. The correct sequence of the gene was checked by sequencing it entirely. Novablue E. coli cells (Novagen) transformed with this construction were grown at 21 °C up to A700 nm = 0.3. Protein expression was then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside during 12 h. Purification on nickel affinity columns was performed using standard procedures. Aminoacylation Assays—Aminoacylation was performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 15 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm NaCl, 100 μm l-[3H]serine (300 Ci/mol) and varying concentrations of tRNA transcripts (1–80 μm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of pure enzyme, and samples of 20 μl were spotted onto Whatman No. 3MM discs at varying time intervals (usually 2 min). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Enzyme concentration was experimentally determined for each tRNA to obtain linear velocities. Kinetic constants were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots using a minimum of two independent measurements and five tRNA concentrations. Phylogenetic and Sequence Analyses—The sequences of seryl-tRNA synthetases used were pulled from GenBank™, either directly or by BLAST searches of available genomic sequences (34Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Wheeler D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D34-D38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The total set of sequences was aligned with CLUSTALX (35Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). All sequences were initially included in our analysis but were later culled to focus our analysis on the eukaryotic clade that contains the Trypanosoma sequences. Coiled-coil predictions were done using the programs PAIR-COIL (36Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), COILS (37Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), and MULTI-COIL (38Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic distributions were calculated by parsimony, distance and maximum likelihood methods using PHYLIP 3.63 package (39Felsenstein J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Maximum parsimony analysis was done using PROTPARS. The neighbor-joining method was applied using the programs NEIGHBOR and PROTDIST, with the Dayhoff 120 substitution matrix. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were calculated with the program PROML (39Felsenstein J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar) using the JTT substitution matrix. The programs SEQBOOT and CONSENSE (39Felsenstein J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar) were used to estimate the confidence limits of branching points from 1000 bootstrap replicates in the parsimony and distance calculations, whereas 100 bootstrap replicates were used for the maximum likelihood trees. Several combinations of sequences were used in our analyses to test the robustness of the trees obtained. All the groups of sequences used produced exactly the same tree topology reported here. RNAi-mediated Ablation of the Trypanosomal SerRS—To confirm that the putative T. brucei SerS gene encodes the functional enzyme in charge of serylation of tRNASer and tRNASec, we established a stable transgenic cell line that allows tetracycline-inducible RNAi-mediated ablation of the protein. This cell line stops growing after induction of RNAi, confirming that the putative SerRS is essential for normal growth of the parasite (Fig. 1A). To determine the biochemical phenotype of the RNAi cell line, we isolated total RNA from untreated cells and from cells grown in the presence of tetracycline. Subsequently, the RNAs were resolved on long acid urea polyacrylamide gels (31Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, in combination with Northern analysis, allow us to determine the ratio of charged to uncharged tRNASer and tRNASec, respectively. The results in Fig. 1, B and C, show that ablation of the putative SerRS results in selective accumulation of both uncharged tRNASer and uncharged tRNASec, indicating that the SerRS identified in our study is the enzyme responsible for in vivo serylation of both of these tRNAs. Localization of the tRNASec—Unlike in other eukaryotes, most tRNAs in trypanosomatids have a dual localization. Approximately 95% are found in the cytosol and function in cytosolic translation; however, a small fraction (∼5%) are imported into the mitochondrion and function in organellar protein synthesis (32Tan T.H. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, trypanosomal tRNAs are always encoded in nucleus and never on the mitochondrial DNA. T. brucei encodes a single selC gene, coding for the tRNASec (25Lobanov A.V. Gromer S. Salinas G. Gladyshev V.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4012-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To confirm the expression of this tRNA and to determine its intracellular localization, we carried out Northern blot analyses using total and mitochondrial RNA fractions from procyclic T. brucei. The result in Fig. 2A shows that the tRNASec is only detected in the cytosol but not in the mitochondrion. Exclusive cytosolic localization is exceptional in trypanosomatids, the only cytosol-specific tRNA known to date being the initiator tRNAMet (32Tan T.H. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). tRNASec Expression Is Not Influenced by the Life Cycle Stage, Selenium, or H2O2—In the next series of Northern blots, we tested whether the relative amount of tRNASec when compared with other tRNAs was dependent on the life cycle stage or sensitive to the concentration of selenium or H2O2 in the culture medium. Fig. 2B shows that trypanosomal tRNASec is expressed to very similar levels in both the procyclic and the bloodstream forms of T. brucei. This suggests that selenocysteine-containing proteins play a role throughout the life cycle of T. brucei. In contrast to reports in vertebrates (40Choi I.S. Diamond A.M. Crain P.F. Kolker J.D. McCloskey J.A. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the expression of the tRNASec in procyclic T. brucei is not affected by the addition of selenium to the growth medium (Fig. 2C). A similar result was obtained when the parasites were grown in the presence of H2O2 (data not shown). Characterization of the Serylation Reaction of tRNASer and tRNASec by T. cruzi SerRS—The cloning of SerRS gene was performed directly from genomic DNA. The 54-kDa protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Gel filtration experiments with the purified enzyme confirmed its ability to form dimers (data not shown), suggesting that T. cruzi SerRS is a classical class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (5Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Transcripts of Trypanosoma tRNASer and tRNASec were used in aminoacylation assays, and both were shown to be efficiently aminoacylated by SerRS (Fig. 3A). The kinetic constants for the serylation of both tRNAs by SerRS were then determined (Fig. 3B). The Km for tRNASer of T. cruzi SerRS was calculated at 3.2 μm, a value comparable with those found in other systems but 8-fold higher than that calculated for tRNASec with the same enzyme. On the other hand, the Kcat was essentially identical to that calculated for tRNASec. As a result, the Kcat/Km value for Trypanosoma tRNASer is 7-fold lower than that of T. cruzi tRNASec. Interestingly, these values are markedly different from those reported in other species. Thus, in the human system (26Amberg R. Mizutani T. Wu X.Q. Gross H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the serylation of tRNASec is 10-fold less efficient than that for tRNASer, and this difference grows to 100-fold in favor of tRNASer in E. coli (27Baron C. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20375-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). Identity Determinants in the Acceptor Stem of tRNASer—To understand how T. cruzi SerRS recognizes its cognate tRNAs, mutants of tRNASerCGA were produced, and their ability to be charged with serine was measured in vitro in the presence of purified SerRS. Fourteen tRNA variants were generated, covering nearly 80% of the primary structure. The design of the mutations was dictated both by the sequence conservation among T. cruzi tRNASer and tRNASec sequences (Fig. 4A) and by the distribution of identity elements in homologous tRNASer sets. A set of modifications targeted individual nucleotides or base pairs in the acceptor stem (variants 1–9) (Fig. 4B), whereas a second set of changes introduced large deletions or sequence swaps of discrete tRNA domains (variants 10–14) (Fig. 4C). The change of the discriminator base G73 for pyrimidines had a dramatic effect on the charging of tRNASer (mutants 1 and 2) (Table 1), indicating that the enzyme strongly recognizes this position of the acceptor stem. This sensitivity to the discriminator base sequence is reminiscent of the recognition mechanisms described for H. sapiens and archaeal SerRSs (17Metzger A.U. Heckl M. Willbold D. Breitschopf K. RajBhandary U.L. Rosch P. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4551-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Achsel T. Gross H.J.

Open table in a new tab The first base pair (1:72) was found to be the most sensitive position in the acceptor stem of tRNASer. Indeed, the simple inversion of the G1:C72 base pair (mutant 4) completely abolished the aminoacylation of this substrate by the enzyme. The introduction of a G1:U72 base pair in the tRNASer scaffold had no effect on the ability of this tRNA to be charged by SerRS (mutant 5), indicating that G1 may be contributing important contacts to the recognition by SerRS (Table 1). It should be noted that both the discriminator base G73 and the G1 base found to be essential for recognition of tRNASer by Trypanosoma SerRS are conserved in the sequences of tRNASec of the same species. Additional mutations in other regions of the acceptor stem had no significant effect on the overall recognition of tRNASer by T. cruzi SerRS (mutants 6–9). Overall, our acceptor stem mutations affect mostly Kcat values, suggesting a defect in the reactive positioning of the acceptor extremity rather than a loss in binding energy. Identity Determinants Beyond the Acceptor Stem of tRNASer— Next, we wanted to investigate the importance of the pseudoknot (D arm, T arm, and variable loop) and anticodon domains of T. cruzi tRNASer for its recognition by SerRS. The three domains of the tRNA that form the pseudoknot were individually flipped (mutants 11–13) to vary their sequences without modifying the local secondary structure or the strength of their internal base pairs (Fig. 4C). None of the three corresponding mutants showed any catalytic defect, suggesting that the recognition mechanism for the elbow of the tRNA is based exclusively on interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone (Table 1). To further test this hypothesis, the entire variable loop was excised and then replaced by the most commonly found class I variable loop (mutant 14) (Fig. 4C). This replacement had a dramatic effect on aminoacylation, causing a >8000-fold drop in Kcat/Km. This mutation affected both catalytic and affinity constants. Our combined data indicate that this domain is recognized in a sequence-unspecific manner, provides binding energy, and acts as a guide for the reactive positioning of the tRNA (Table 1). Finally, the entire anticodon loop was deleted and replaced by a stretch of four uridines (mutant 10) (Fig. 4C). This linker was used because it is the least likely to stabilize unanticipated structures in this region of the tRNA (13Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4467-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This deletion mutant had only a modest effect on the velocity of the aminoacylation reaction. This is in agreement with other studies that have shown that the anticodon domain of eukaryotic tRNASer contributes poorly to the serine identity (for a review, see Ref. 11Lenhard B. Orellana O. Ibba M. Weygand-Durasevic I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Phylogeny of Trypanosoma SerRS—The known genomes of Trypanosoma code for only one SerRS gene. The corresponding protein is likely used both in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria, but no conventional targeting sequence can be identified in their sequences. The protein is 477 amino acids long, and it contains an N-terminal domain predicted to form a coiled coil domain (37Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991;"
https://openalex.org/W1971025296,"In t(14;18) lymphomas, bcl-2 is juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IgH), resulting in increased bcl-2 transcription and resistance to apoptosis. Regulatory elements of both the bcl-2 promoter and the IgH enhancers are believed to play a role in the increased expression of bcl-2 in t(14;18) lymphoma cells. In addition, transcription of the translocated bcl-2 allele is deregulated with activation of the normally minor bcl-2 P2 promoter. The mechanisms involved in the promoter shift from P1 to P2 are not known. We found that the murine IgH 3' enhancers increased bcl-2 P2 promoter activity in an episomal model of the translocation, and IgH enhancer region HS12 had the greatest effect. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that localized histone H3 hyperacetylation of the P2 promoter was observed on the translocated allele in t(14;18) DHL-4 cells and also on the stably transfected bcl-2 promoter-IgH enhancer episomal construct. Analysis of the HS12 enhancer region revealed that a previously identified nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) site and a previously uncharacterized downstream Cdx site, both of which are conserved in the human and murine IgH enhancers, were important for its enhancer activity and promoter activation. ChIP assays showed that C/EBPbeta bound to the HS12 Cdx site in vivo, and mutation of this site abrogated the binding of C/EBPbeta. Reduced expression of C/EBPbeta by transfection of small interfering RNA or interference with NF-kappaB activity decreased transcription from the bcl-2 promoters. These results demonstrate that the IgH 3' enhancers, particularly HS12, are important for the deregulation of bcl-2 promoter usage in t(14;18) lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2068894136,"Eucaryotic genes that are coordinately expressed tend to be clustered. Furthermore, gene clusters across chromosomal regions are often upregulated in various tumors. However, relatively little is known about how gene clusters are coordinately expressed in physiological or pathological conditions. Cofactor of BRCA1 (COBRA1), a subunit of the human negative elongation factor, has been shown to repress estrogen-stimulated transcription of trefoil factor 1 (TFF1 or pS2) by stalling RNA polymerase II. Here, we carried out a genome-wide study to identify additional physiological target genes of COBRA1 in breast cancer cells. The study identified a total of 134 genes that were either activated or repressed upon small hairpin RNA-mediated reduction of COBRA1. Interestingly, many COBRA1-regulated genes reside as clusters on the chromosomes and have been previously implicated in cancer development. Detailed examination of two such clusters on chromosome 21 (21q22) and chromosome X (Xp11) reveals that COBRA1 is physically associated with a subset of its regulated genes in each cluster. In addition, COBRA1 was shown to regulate both estrogen-dependent and -independent transcription of the gene cluster at 21q22, which encompasses the previously identified COBRA1-regulated TFF1 (pS2) locus. Thus, COBRA1 plays a critical role in the regulation of clustered gene expression at preferred chromosomal domains in breast cancer cells."

The aim of this study was to determine the sites of glycan attachment and to assess their ability to affect the formation and stability of the homo-oligomer. Nine of the ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-41, Asn-152, Asn-234, Asn-270, Asn-330, Asn-426, Asn-452, Asn-546, and Asn-553) were found to be glycosylated in recombinant mouse meprin A using chemical and enzymatic deglycosylation methods and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

The removal of two glycans in the protease domain at Asn-234 and Asn-270, as well as one in the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor domain at Asn-452, by a deglycosidase under nondenaturing conditions decreased the chemical and thermal stability of the homo-oligomer without affecting quaternary structure. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that no single glycan was essential for oligomer formation; however, the combined absence of the glycans at Asn-152 and Asn-270 in the protease domain hindered intersubunit disulfide bond formation, prevented noncovalent associations, and abolished enzymatic activity.

It forms unique crescent, ring, barrel, and spiral structures through both disulfide bonds and noncovalent associations, and it is composed of α subunits that have a monomeric molecular mass of 78–85 kDa depending on the species (1Bertenshaw G.P.

In addition, mutants that are not oligomeric are much less stable than the wild type, and this may serve to protect the protein from the harsh extracellular milieu (10Marchand P. Volkmann M.

The MAM domain has also been implicated in oligomerization through the presence of intersubunit disulfide bonds, in addition to forming part of the noncovalent interface (3Ishmael F.T. Norcum M.T.

However, the influence of protein modifications such as glycosylation on the formation and structure of the homo-oligomer has not been investigated. Glycosylation accounts for ∼18–20% of the molecular mass of the meprin α subunit (14Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence, the secreted α subunit from mouse contains 10 potential N-linked glycosylation sites with the consensus sequence of NX(S/T), where X is any amino acid except proline (Fig. 1) (15Jiang W. Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Beynon R.J. Grant G.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9185-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation can influence the structure and function of a protein in several ways. During biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), protein folding is monitored by the glycan-mediated interaction of the protein with ER-resident chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin (16Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). The placement of glycosylation sites within critical folding regions of the protein can recruit the chaperones to these regions and determine which set of ER chaperones will bind to the molecule (17Hebert D.N. Zhang J.X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Glycosylation also influences the physicochemical properties of a protein, such as conformational stability and protein solubility (21Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Structure. 1999; 7: R155-R160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Wang C. Eufemi M. Turano C. Giartosio A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7299-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Some glycans mediate protein-protein interactions at the cell surface by influencing the orientation of the proteins and by serving as recognition and binding determinants between the molecules (23Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Huang M. Mattsson N. Speir J.A. DiGennaro J.A. Fetrow J.S. Dwek R.A. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For instance, glycans are involved in the recognition and binding of meprin to the C-type serum lectin mannan-binding protein (MBP), the first endogenous inhibitor of meprin to be identified (24Hirano M. Ma B.Y. Kawasaki N. Okimura K. Baba M. Nakagawa T. Miwa K. Oka S. Kawasaki T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3177-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of each individual glycosylation site in mouse meprin A demonstrated that no one particular glycan was responsible for targeting homo-oligomeric meprin A to the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells (25Kadowaki T. Tsukuba T. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25577-25584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, several of the glycosylation site mutants decreased peptidase activity as well as the stability of meprin A, as assessed by heat inactivation assays. These changes may result from subtle differences affecting catalysis or an overall change in the tertiary or quaternary structure. Previous attempts at mapping meprin glycosylation sites by lectin blotting of cyanogen bromide fragments detected 2–3 glycans in the MAM and TRAF domains of the α subunit in kidney-purified meprin A (15Jiang W. Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Beynon R.J. Grant G.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9185-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This isoform of meprin A is a membrane-bound hetero-oligomer of α and β subunits. However, the lectin experiments did not account for the other glycosylation sites, and there is no information regarding the glycosylation of the α subunit within the context of the homo-oligomer. To gain insight into the role of the carbohydrates of meprin, the glycosylation sites of the mouse meprin A homo-oligomer were first mapped using a mass spectrometry approach. To elucidate the effect of glycans on the native, folded protein, the structure and stability of a partially deglycosylated oligomer were then investigated. Finally, the effect of glycans on the formation of the oligomer was assessed using a series of single and multiple glycosylation site mutants. Expression and Purification of Wild-type Meprin A—Homooligomeric meprin A was purified from the media of human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293; ATCC 1573 CRL) stably expressing the wild-type, full-length meprin mouse α cDNA (26Marchand P.

The cells were then maintained in serum-free media for 3–4 days. The protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography for the full-length protein or by a nickel chelating column for the His-tagged protein, as described previously (11Doll B.A. Villa J.P.

The N270Q mutation was introduced with the following primers: 5′-ATA AGA CTG AAT CGA ATG TAC CAG TGC ACC GCA ACA CAT ACT CTG-3′ and 5′-CAG AGT ATG TGT TGC GGT GCA CTG GTA CAT TCG ATT CAG TCT TAT-3′. All plasmids were sequenced by Joe Bednarczyk at the Molecular Genetics Core Facility of Pennsylvania State College of Medicine. Wild-type and mutant plasmids were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, 60 × 15-mm plates of HEK-293 cells were grown to 90% confluency in DMEM with 10% FBS but without antibiotics/antimycotics. The meprin plasmids (8 μg) and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were each diluted into Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Invitrogen), mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and added to the plates of HEK-293 cells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 h and then the media were replaced with DMEM lacking FBS. The medium from each plate was collected 24 h post-transfection and analyzed for protein expression by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For oligomeric size, stability, and activity assays, the 24-h post-transfection media samples were concentrated 4-fold using YM-50 Centricon concentrators (Amicon), and the EDTA-free Complete Mini inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added after concentrating. The media samples were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until further use. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—For SDS-PAGE, samples were separated on 7.5% Tris-HCl Ready gels (Bio-Rad) or 8% polyacrylamide gels at 40–45 mA in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.5, with 0.1% SDS. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 16 V using a Bio-Rad semi-dry blotting apparatus with transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.04% SDS, and 20% methanol. Blots were blocked in 10% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris, 138 mm NaCl, with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then incubated with an appropriate anti-meprin α antibody. Anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) was added after washing in TBS-T, and blots were developed with the appropriate chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico or West Dura, Pierce). N-Linked Glycosylation Site Mapping—To facilitate glycosylation site mapping, a mass marker was created at each glycosylation site using a chemical deglycosylation method adapted from previously published protocols (29Sojar H.T. Bahl O.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Edge A.S. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert Jr., L.E. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). For detection of peptides by electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (ESI/MS), a 500-μg aliquot of purified meprin A was concentrated to dryness in a Speedvac and then reconstituted in 75 μl of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS; Sigma). The deglycosylation reaction proceeded for 2 h on ice and was quenched with the slow addition of pre-chilled 60% pyridine (200 μl, aqueous). The sample was dialyzed against Nanopure water for 4 h, using SpectraPor dialysis tubing (10 mm, 3500 molecular weight cutoff). The deglycosylated meprin was again concentrated to dryness, resuspended in 100 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and digested 1:20 with trypsin (Sigma) for 24 h at 37 °C. Disulfide bonds were reduced with 50 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) immediately prior to injection onto the HPLC column. One-half of the tryptic digest was injected onto a BetaBasic C18 column (5 μm, 150 × 1 mm) coupled to a Mariner mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). The split flow rate was 0.05 ml/min, and a gradient program was used to partially separate the peptides. Peptides were loaded onto the column under the starting conditions of 100% solvent A (0.1% formic acid/H2O) for 6 min, diverting the flow to prevent salt interference. The peptides were eluted under a gradient to 95% solvent B (0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile) over 44 min. Following elution of the peptides, the conditions were held for 5 min, and then the column was flushed with 90% solvent C (0.1% formic acid/isopropyl alcohol). Electrospray ionization in positive mode was used for detection, and data were collected between m/z 200 and 2500. MS data were analyzed using the accompanying DataExplorer version 4.0.0.1 software (Applied Biosystems), utilizing the extracted ion chromatogram feature to search for the predicted m/z values of the glycopeptides. A separate sample of meprin A was also incubated in the presence or absence of the deglycosidase PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) to determine the occupancy of the glycosylation sites. A 500-μg sample (500 μl of a 11.8 μm solution) of mouse meprin α was denatured by boiling for 5 min at 100 °C and then the disulfides were reduced in the presence of 20 mm DTT (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. N-Ethylmaleimide (Sigma) dissolved in 100% ethanol (HPLC grade; Sigma) was added to the sample (in the presence of the DTT) to a final concentration of 60 mm, and the sample was incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. After denaturation, reduction, and capping of cysteines, the sample was exhaustively dialyzed into Nanopure water (2 × 2 liters) and then concentrated ∼5.5-fold using a Speedvac. The sample was then split into two, and one-half of the sample was incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 5 h in the presence of the deglycosidase PNGaseF (glycerol-free; New England Biolabs), and the other half was incubated under the same conditions in the absence of PNGaseF. After deglycosylation, trypsin (Promega Gold in 50 mm acetic acid; Sigma) was added to each sample so that the final trypsin/meprin ratio was 1:20, and the pH was 7.5 (in 50 mm phosphate buffer). The meprin samples were digested with trypsin at 37 °C for 39 h. One-tenth of each sample was analyzed using a Waters 2695 HPLC system with a Discovery Bio C5 column (Supelco, 5 μm,5cm × 2.1 mm) with a gradient similar to the chemically deglycosylated samples. A Waters LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer in positive ion mode was used to detect the peptide ions, and Waters MassLynx 4.0 software was used to search for the expected peptide ions. Cross-linking of the Meprin Homo-oligomer Noncovalent Dimer through the Carbohydrate Moieties—The carbohydrate moieties of the meprin A homo-oligomer were oxidized in the presence of 10 mm sodium periodate (Sigma) in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, for 2 h at 23 °C in the dark. Excess sodium periodate was removed with a 1-ml desalting column packed with G-25 Sephadex resin (Sigma) equilibrated with water. For the cross-linking reaction, triethanolamine, pH 7.5, was added to the sample at a final concentration of 40 mm, and reduction of the intersubunit disulfide bond to yield the noncovalent dimer was achieved in the presence of 5 mm Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine HCl (TCEP), pH 8.0. After ∼15 min, the carbohydrate and cysteine-reactive cross-linker N-[β-maleimidopropionic acid] hydrazide·trifluoroacetic acid (BMPH; Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm in 10% dimethylformamide (Fisher). The cross-linking reaction proceeded for 2 h at 23 °C. The samples were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Partial Deglycosylation of the Meprin Homo-oligomer— For partially deglycosylated samples, meprin A was incubated in the presence of PNGaseF (New England Biolabs), in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol (BME) and SDS (nonreducing and nondenaturing conditions). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then used for further experiments. A typical deglycosylation reaction contained at least 300–500 units of deglycosidase to 20 μg of meprin. Mapping Glycans Removed by PNGaseF—To determine which glycans were removed in the partially deglycosylated protein, 900 μl of 4.6 μm meprin (330 μg total) was treated with 20 μl of glycerol-free PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) under nondenaturing and nonreducing conditions (–SDS, –BME, but +Nonidet P-40) and prepared for ESI/MS as described above. One-half of the sample was digested with trypsin (1:20 in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The data set collected from the tryptic digest was searched using the extracted ion chromatogram tool of the DataExplorer software, looking for the predicted tryptic fragments plus 1 mass unit, which resulted from the conversion of Asn to Asp by PNGaseF. Circular Dichroism and Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The far-UV CD spectra of the wild-type and partially deglycosylated proteins in the absence of urea were obtained using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter fitted with a xenon lamp. Samples were scanned from 190 to 250 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm/min at 25 °C using quartz cuvettes with a path length of 1 mm. Spectra are an average of three scans. Samples of latent meprin A were partially deglycosylated as described above, then diluted to 3.2 μm with Nanopure water (8 mm sodium phosphate, final), and incubated at 23 °C for 15 min before analysis. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a PTI QuantaMaster luminescence spectrometer. Wild-type and partially deglycosylated samples were diluted to 10 μg/ml (118 nm) in Nanopure water. Tris and NaCl were added to a final concentration of 20 and 150 mm, respectively, at pH 7.5. Samples were incubated at 23 °C for 30 min before analysis. Quartz cuvettes with path lengths of 1 cm × 2 mm were used, and the cuvette holder was kept at 25 °C. Excitation slit width was 0.5 nm, and emission slit width was 2.0 nm. Excitation wavelength was 280 nm to measure total protein fluorescence (from tryptophan and tyrosine), and the emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm. Size Exclusion Chromatography—The oligomeric states of purified and crude meprin A samples were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. A 200-μl sample was injected at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. A small portion of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the appropriate meprin antibody to determine the elution profile of the protein. Urea-induced Unfolding of the Meprin A Homo-oligomer— The urea-induced unfolding of the meprin oligomer (wild-type and partially deglycosylated) was followed by the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Samples were diluted to 10 μg/ml with Nanopure water and increasing amounts of urea (0.6 mm phosphate, final) and then incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence spectra were acquired with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 0.25 and 1.75 nm, respectively. The fluorescence intensity at the wavelength of maximal emission (λmax) of the wild-type protein was recorded and plotted versus urea concentration to obtain an unfolding curve. Activity Assays—The peptidase activity of meprin A was measured using the fluorogenic substrate 2-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-OH (BK+), where Dnp is dinitrophenyl, as described previously (10Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out after activation of the samples by limited trypsin digestion (1:20 trypsin/meprin for purified samples or 5 ng/μl trypsin for crude media samples) for 30–60 min at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, to remove the prosequence. Trypsin was inhibited with a 3–10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) for 15–20 min at 25 °C before assaying activity in 50 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 8.7, in the presence of 10 μm BK+ (final). The fluorescence was monitored at 320 nm excitation and 417 nm emission using a Hitachi-F2000 fluorimeter. For crude media samples, the specific activities of each protein were calculated by Western blot and densitometry. The concentration of the wild-type protein in the media sample was measured from its BK+ activity compared with the fluorescence/μg of purified protein. Tryptic Stability Assays—To test the activation and stability of the meprin glycosylation mutants, crude media samples were incubated with increasing amounts of trypsin (0, 5, 40, and 80 ng/μl) for 45 min at 37 °C. Trypsin was inhibited for 15 min at 23 °C by a 3-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (+BME) and immediately boiled. The entire set of samples was then boiled for an additional 5 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Heat Stability Assays—To measure the heat stability of partially deglycosylated meprin A, activated samples were incubated in the presence and absence of PNGaseF under native conditions, as described above. The samples were then incubated at 55 °C for 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min. At each time point, a small aliquot of the protein was removed, cooled to 23 °C, diluted into assay buffer, and assayed for BK+ activity in triplicate at 23 °C. The percent of initial activity over time was plotted for each treatment. For crude media samples of meprin A mutants, the samples were activated as indicated, then incubated at 55 °C for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 45 min, and processed as described for partially deglycosylated protein except that the samples were diluted into assay buffer and allowed to equilibrate at 23 °C for at least 15 min. The samples were then equilibrated to 30 °C, and BK+ activity was measured at this temperature. N-Linked Glycosylation Site Mapping of the Mouse Meprin A Homo-oligomer—Chemical deglycosylation with TFMS removes the carbohydrate moieties from glycoproteins with the exception of the innermost GlcNAc residue. This creates a mass marker of +203 mass units on each glycopeptide that can then be detected by mass spectrometry. Under certain conditions, the innermost GalNAc residue of O-linked sugars also remains on the protein (29Sojar H.T. Bahl O.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Edge A.S. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert Jr., L.E. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). However, there was no detectable GalNAc in a total carbohydrate analysis of meprin A, and the protein was not detected by a carbohydrate-reactive label after the protein was fully deglycosylated by PNGaseF, a deglycosidase that removes all types of N-linked glycans; thus there is no significant O-linked glycosylation on meprin A (data not shown). The predominant monosaccharides in the carbohydrate analysis were GlcNAc, galactose, and mannose, with a small amount of fucose. Further study is needed to accurately quantify these monosaccharides and determine the location of the fucose in the context of the terminal glycosylation pattern. ESI/MS was used to detect glycopeptides from a tryptic digest of chemically deglycosylated meprin A. The total ion chromatogram from the digest was searched for the presence of glycopeptide ions at their calculated mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. Peptide ions consistent with glycosylation at Asn-152, Asn-234, Asn-270, Asn-452, Asn-546, and Asn-553 were also detected (Table 1). Because there were no potential proteolytic cleavage sites between Asn-546 and Asn-553, these two glycosylation sites were contained in the same peptide. Masses consistent with both one and two GlcNAc residues were observed in the total ion chromatogram, indicating heterogeneity in this region (Table 1). The only site not glycosylated was Asn-614, near the putative C terminus. There were no ions corresponding to either the u"

In addition, we have recently demonstrated that Ago1 function is required for enactment of cell cycle checkpoints (Carmichael, J. B., Provost, P., Ekwall, K., and Hobman, T. C. (2004) Mol. Biol. Cell 15, 1425-1435). Here, we provide evidence that the amino terminus of Ago1 binds to proteins that function in cell cycle regulation including 14-3-3 proteins. Interestingly, the amino terminus of human Ago2, the endonuclease that cleaves siRNA-targeted mRNAs, was also demonstrated to bind 14-3-3 proteins. Overexpression of the Ago1 amino terminus in yeast resulted in cell cycle delay at the G2/M boundary. Further investigation revealed that nuclear import of the mitosis-inducing phosphatase Cdc25 is inhibited by overexpression of the Ago1 amino terminus. Under these conditions, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine 15, thereby reducing the activity of this kinase, a situation that delays entry into mitosis. We hypothesize that 14-3-3 proteins are required for Argonaute protein functions in cell cycle and/or gene-silencing pathways.

Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11564) Google Scholar), a gene-silencing process that occurs in most eukaryotes with the exception of budding yeast. Members of the Argonaute family form the core of ribonucleoprotein complexes that effect gene silencing by targeted mRNA cleavage, translational repression, or chromatin modification (reviewed in Refs. 5Jaronczyk K. Carmichael J.B. Hobman T.C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and 6Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3485) Google Scholar). Small RNAs that are bound to the Argonaute subunit target the ribonucleoprotein complexes to homologous mRNAs or genomic loci. It has been estimated that Argonaute-dependent RNAi controls the expression of more that 30% of genes in the human genome (7Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9723) Google Scholar). Many of the genes regulated by the RNAi pathway encode proteins including transcription factors that regulate signaling pathways and cell cycle progression.The study of RNAi in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has led to a number of important breakthroughs including the realization that, in addition to functioning at the post-transcriptional level (2Sigova A. Rhind N. Zamore P.D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2359-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), this pathway regulates chromatin structure and transcriptional gene silencing (1Volpe T.A. Kidner C.

Science. 2002; 297: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We are interested in the relationship between the yeast RNAi apparatus and cell cycle progression. Unlike in higher eukaryotes, the central RNAi effector proteins in yeast, Ago1, Dcr1, and Rdp1, do not appear to play a major role in regulating global gene expression (9Provost P. Silverstein R.A. Dishart D. Walfridsson J. Djupedal I. Kniola B. Wright A. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Ekwall K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transcriptome profiling revealed that the yeast RNAi apparatus regulates the expression of only 42 transcripts. Of the genes that are negatively regulated by RNAi, none have defined roles in cell proliferation pathways. Rather, many of these transcripts are noncoding and originate from centromeric repeats and retrotransposons. Our recent work suggests that yeast Argonaute and Dicer proteins function in cell cycle progression in a pathway that does not require small interfering RNAs (3Carmichael J.B. Provost P. Ekwall K. Hobman T.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, human Ago2, a central component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (11Hammond S.M. Boettcher S. Caudy A.A. Kobayashi R. Hannon G.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), was shown to compliment the checkpoint defects in ago1 null mutants (3Carmichael J.B. Provost P. Ekwall K. Hobman T.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that Argonautes have the capacity to regulate cell cycle progression in higher eukaryotes. To further investigate the role of Argonautes in cell cycle events, we employed a dominant negative strategy to disrupt cell cycle progression in yeast. In this study, we report that Argonaute proteins interact with 14-3-3 proteins. In yeast, these interactions are important for regulating the phosphorylation state of the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—A list of S. pombe strains used in this study and their corresponding genotypes are shown in Table 1. Unless otherwise indicated, yeast were cultured at 30 °C in yeast extract or essential minimal medium (EMM) lacking nutritional supplements as described (12Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993Google Scholar). The transformation of yeast strains was performed using the alkali cation method (12Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993Google Scholar). To induce expression of genes under the control of the nmt (no message thiamine) promoter, cultures were grown overnight in EMM lacking thiamine. The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for propagation of plasmids (Table 2).TABLE 1S. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceFY254can1-1 leu1–32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18 h–S.

Walworth, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Open table in a new tab Plasmid Construction—For expression in S. pombe, a cDNA encoding Ago1 was amplified by PCR using primers AgoSalI-F 5′-GGGGTCGACGATGTCGTAT-3′ and Ago1SalI-R 5′-GTGGTATATGTAAGTCGACCC-3′ with Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and then subcloned into the shuttle vector pGEM-T (Promega). The ago1 fragment was excised with SalI and then ligated in frame to the 3′ end of the GST cassette of pDS473a (13Forsburg S.L. Sherman D.A. Gene. 1997; 191: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) to create GST-Ago1. The GST-NT-Ago1 and GST-CT-Ago1 expression plasmids were constructed by excising the 5′ and 3′ halves of the ago1 cDNA from pGEM-T-Ago1 using SalI and BglII or BglII and SmaI, respectively, followed by ligation into the pDS473a vector. Red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged NT-Ago1 was constructed as follows. The RFP cassette and NT-Ago1 fragment were amplified by PCR using the primer sets nRFPfNotI-F (5′-ATATGCGGCCGCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG-3′), RFP-4Gly-KpnI-R (5′-ATATGGTACCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′), RFP-NT-KpnI-F (5′-ATATGGTACCTCGTATAAACCAAGCTCAGAAATAGC-3′), and NT-SacI-R (5′-ATATGAGCTCTTAAGATCTAATAGGAGCCCTCGGCGG-3′), respectively. The resulting RFP and NTAgo1 products were digested with NotI and KpnI and with KpnI and SacI, respectively. The fragments were subcloned via a three-part ligation reaction into the NotI and SacI sites of the pAALN vector (14Xu H.P. Rajavashisth T. Grewal N. Jung V. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Wigler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For some experiments, we used Ago1 expression plasmids that contained a G418 resistance marker instead of leucine or uracil markers. The G418 resistance cassette was amplified using the two primers 5′-ATACGCTCTAGAAAGCTTGCCTCGTCCCCG-3′ and 5′-ATACGCTCTAGAACTGGATGGCGGCGTTAGTAT-3′ and then blunt end-ligated into a pAALN vector in which the leu2 marker had been removed by HindIII digestion.For expression in bacteria, the NT-Ago1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers AgoSalI-F (5′-GGGGTCGACGATGTCGTAT-3′) and AgoNotI-R (5′-GCTCGGTACCCGCGGCCTTAGAAAGGTCGTTGGACCGC-3′) and then ligated into the shuttle vector pGEM-T. The NT-Ago1 fragment was excised from pGEM-T using SalI and NotI and subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 for expression in E. coli strain BL-21.Hydroxyurea (HU) Survival Assay—Serial dilutions of actively growing yeast cultures were spotted onto EMM media lacking uracil in the presence or absence of the S-phase arrest-inducing drug, HU (3.5-10 mm). After 3-5 days at 30 °C, samples were scored for growth.Septation Analyses—Yeast strain FY254 was transformed with pDS473a, pDS473a-Ago1, or pDS473a-NT-Ago1 and then cultured at 30 °C in EMM lacking uracil to mid-log phase (A595 = 0.6-0.9), treated with 10 mm HU for 4 h, washed once in EMM lacking uracil, resuspended in EMM lacking uracil, and incubated for an additional 4 h. The numbers of septated cells in each sample were determined at hourly intervals pre- and post-treatment with hydroxyurea. For each sample, at least 300 cells were scored.GST Pulldowns—Bacteria transformed with pGEX4T-1 or pGEX4T-1-NT-Ago1 were grown to an A600 = 0.2. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce expression of the fusion proteins, and the cultures were incubated for a further 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by sonication, and the resulting lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.Lysates were prepared from S. pombe strains as follows. Cell pellets (500 μl) were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 containing Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were added to samples (50% volume), which were then subjected to four cycles of homogenization at 4 °C by bead beating (Mini Beadbeater-8, BioSpec Products). The resulting slurries were clarified by centrifugation (1000 × g) for 10 min.Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), washed three times in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated by rotation with bacterial lysates containing the expressed fusion protein for 3 h at 4 °C. Fusion protein-glutathione bead complexes were washed three times in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors and incubated with the yeast lysates overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. Bound protein complexes were washed three times with PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors, resuspended in 5× sample buffer, and boiled. Protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblot analysis. Proteins excised from Coomassie Blue-stained gels were subjected to mass spectrometry at the Institute for Biomolecular Design (University of Alberta).Where indicated, GST-Argonaute fusion proteins were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and binding proteins were isolated as described (15Tahbaz N. Carmichael J.B. Hobman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43294-43299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The association of 14-3-3 proteins with human Ago2 fusion proteins was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal sera to 14-3-3 proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Cdc2 Phosphorylation Assay—FY254 expressing GST or GST-NT-Ago1 was cultured at 30 °C in EMM lacking uracil to A595 = 0.3, after which time the samples were divided into two aliquots. HU was added to one of the aliquots to a final concentration of 10 mm. Incubation of the cultures was continued for an additional 3 h. Lysates were prepared by mechanically breaking cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with glass beads using a Beadbeater-8 device. Cells were subjected to three cycles of bead beating on the maximum setting (30 s of beating followed by 1 min on ice per cycle). SDS was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the resulting mixtures were boiled for 3 min. Lysates were subsequently cleared by centrifugation (1000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE through a 10% acrylamide gel. Total Cdc2 levels and Cdc2 (tyrosine 15) phosphorylation levels were detected using anti-PSTAIR (Sigma) and anti-phospho-cdc2 (Tyr-15) (Cell Signaling Technology), respectively.Microscopy—Strains were grown to mid-log phase, collected by centrifugation (1000 × g) for 5 min, resuspended in a DAPI/water solution (1 μg/ml), and placed on slides coated with agarose (0.8%). Yeast transformed with plasmids containing a G418 resistance marker was cultured in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Where indicated, cultures were treated with leptomycin B (100 ng/ml) for 1-2 h prior to analyses. Samples were viewed using an Ultraview ERS spinning disc confocal imager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) attached to an Axiovert 200 m microscope (Zeiss).Flow Cytometry—Aliquots of 106 cells were collected from mid-log liquid cultures, pelleted, and fixed by resuspension in 1 ml of 70% ethanol. Cells were washed in 3 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate, resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were stained by adding 0.5 ml of sodium citrate solution containing 2 mm Sytox Green (Molecular Probes) and stored at 4 °C until processed. Cells were vortexed for 45 s prior to analyses on a BD Biosciences FACScan. For each sample, 20,000 cells were analyzed.RESULTSOverexpression of the Ago1 N Terminus Affects Cell Cycle Progression—We had previously demonstrated that Ago1 function is required to enact the S-phase replication checkpoint in fission yeast (3Carmichael J.B. Provost P. Ekwall K. Hobman T.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a consequence, ago1 null mutants are unable to survive in the presence of HU. Our strategy was to identify a region of Ago1 that when overexpressed would confer sensitivity to HU, presumably by preventing enactment of the replication checkpoint. Regions of the Ago1 cDNA that included the PAZ (NT-Ago1) or PIWI (CT-Ago1) domain-encoding regions were subcloned downstream from the GST cassette in the expression vector pDS473a (Fig. 1A). The plasmids were transformed into the S. pombe haploid strain FY254. Yeast were cultured in the absence of thiamine to induce overexpression of the GST-Ago1 fusion proteins. Cultures were spotted onto EMM with or without HU and scored for growth. Overexpression of the amino-terminal region of Ago1 (NT-Ago1) caused marked hypersensitivity to HU (Fig. 1B). Relative to yeast overproducing GST alone, the CT-Ago1 strain exhibited a slight growth defect on HU but otherwise appeared normal when examined by light microscopy. Microscopic examination of yeast cells overexpressing the NT-Ago1 protein revealed that they were relatively large and contained prominent but abnormal nuclei (Fig. 1C). The DAPI-stained nuclei of NT-Ago1 overproducers were noticeably larger than the other strains, an observation that prompted us to use FACS analyses to determine whether these cells contained more nuclear DNA than cells overexpressing GST or CT-Ago1. Because fission yeast have an unusually long G2-phase (16Fantes P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and also begin replication prior to completion of cytokinesis, the bulk of exponentially growing cells in a haploid strain exhibit a 2N DNA profile. As expected, the majority of yeast overexpressing GST or CT-Ago1 exhibited a 2N content of DNA (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the DNA content of NT-Ago1-expressing cells was predominantly 4N, suggesting that these cells had rereplicated their DNA and were delayed at the G2/M boundary.To further examine the nature of the NT-Ago1-dependent HU hypersensitivity, we monitored the cell cycle progression of this strain during and after exposure to HU. Normally, when exposed to replication stress, yeast will activate the replication checkpoint to arrest the cell cycle until the stress is relieved. Checkpoint activation in yeast can be monitored microscopically by scoring for the presence of septa, a cellular structure that functions in cell division (17Dunaway S. Walworth N.C. Methods. 2004; 33: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because the onset mitosis precedes septum formation in fission yeast, blocking the cell cycle prior to the onset of mitosis leads to a decrease in the number of septated cells. Thus, in an actively growing population of yeast cells, replication stress will result in cell cycle delay and concomitant decreased septation. As expected, yeast overexpressing GST alone exhibited a sharp decrease in their septation indices following exposure to HU (Fig. 2). Shortly after removal of HU, cell cycle progression resumed as evidenced by an increase in the proportion of septated cells. In contrast, yeast overexpressing GST-NT-Ago1 did not immediately delay their cell cycle but, instead, appeared to progress toward mitosis (Fig. 2). After this point, the cells were not able to recover from the HU treatment. It is likely that when exposed to HU, yeast expressing NT-Ago1 are unable to activate the S-phase checkpoint and die from “mitotic catastrophe” (18Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) as a result of entering mitosis with incompletely replicated chromosomes. From these results, we conclude that the NT-Ago1 construct acts as a dominant negative protein that competes for Ago1-specific interactions with the cell cycle apparatus.FIGURE 2Yeast expressing NT-Ago1 fail to enact the replication checkpoint in response to HU treatment. Exponentially growing cultures of yeast expressing GST, GST-NT-Ago1, or GST-Ago1 were treated with HU, and the percentages of septated cells (n = 300) were determined at hourly intervals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Argonaute Proteins Bind to 14-3-3 Proteins—To gain insight into how NT-Ago1 may be exerting its effects on the cell cycle machinery, we used affinity purification to identify proteins that bind to the amino terminus of Ago1. The NT-Ago1 fusion was expressed in bacteria, isolated on glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 3A), and incubated with lysates prepared from an ago1 null strain. Bound proteins were eluted from the agarose beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3A). Although many of the proteins that eluted from the NT-Ago1 column were bacterial in origin, by using mass spectrometry we were able to identify a limited number of yeast proteins that bound to GST-NT-Ago1 but not GST (Fig. 3A). One of these proteins was Rad25, a member of the 14-3-3 family. The identification of Rad25 as an Ago1-interacting protein was of particular interest because 14-3-3 proteins have well documented roles in cell cycle transition and checkpoint enactment (19Ford J.C. al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Importantly, we were able to demonstrate an interaction between Rad25 and full-length endogenous Ago1 by reciprocal GST pulldown and immunoblotting assays (Fig. 3B). A Δago1 strain was used as a negative control for these experiments. Rad25 is closely related to a second S. pombe 14-3-3 protein, Rad24, that has similar functions (20Graves P.R. Lovly C.M. Uy G.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1839-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We also detected interactions between Rad24 and Ago1 (Fig. 3B); however, it is unclear whether Ago1 interacts directly with Rad24 or with Rad24/25 heterodimers (21Ozoe F. Kurokawa R. Kobayashi Y. Jeong H.T. Tanaka K. Sen K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7105-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether binding interactions between 14-3-3 proteins and Argonautes have been conserved throughout evolution, we looked for interactions between 14-3-3 proteins and the RNAi slicer activity-containing protein, human Ago2 (22Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Indeed stable interaction between the PAZ-containing region of human Ago2, and 14-3-3 proteins was evident (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Ago1 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins. A, NT-Ago1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria, immobilized on glutathione-agarose, and then incubated with lysates prepared from Δago1 (TV292) cells. Bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Proteins that bound to NT-Ago1 were subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry. The arrowhead indicates the region of the gel where Rad25 migrates. The positions of GST and GST-NT-Ago1 are indicated. B, lysates prepared from ago1+ (FY254) or Δago1 (TV292) strains were incubated with GST, GST-Rad24, or GST-Rad25. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of Ago1. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to show the levels of GST fusion proteins used in the pulldowns. C, GST, GST-hAgo2, or GST-PAZ constructs were expressed in HeLa cells, and bound proteins were isolated and detected by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-14-3-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpression of NT-Ago1 Affects Cdc25 Transport and Phosphorylation of Cdc2—Rad25 functions together with Rad24 to regulate cell cycle progression and enactment of checkpoints. For example, binding between Rad24/25 and Chk1, a protein kinase required for enacting the DNA damage checkpoint (23Fotou E. al-Khodairy F. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 24Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), is stimulated by DNA damage (25Chen L. Liu T.H. Walworth N.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, one of the functions of activated Chk1 is to phosphorylate the mitotic inducer Cdc25, thereby creating 14-3-3 binding sites. For yeast and vertebrate isoforms of Cdc25, binding of 14-3-3 proteins induces export of this phosphatase from the nucleus (26Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 27Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Nuclear exclusion of Cdc25 correlates with an inability to enter mitosis because the phosphatase no longer has access to its substrate, the Cdc13-Cdc2 complex, which is located in the nucleus (27Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Because dephosphorylation of Cdc2 by Cdc25 is required for transition from G2 to M phase (reviewed in Ref. 28Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar), mutations that reduce Cdc25 activity can result in elongated cells that are blocked at G2/M (29Fantes P. Nature. 1979; 279: 428-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Previously, we showed that Ago1 is required for phosphorylation of Cdc2 on tyrosine 15 in response to genotoxic stress (3Carmichael J.B. Provost P. Ekwall K. Hobman T.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reasoned that the elongated phenotype of NT-Ago1-expressing cells may result from an inability of Cdc25 to gain access to and dephosphorylate Cdc2, possibly via a mechanism that involves impaired nuclear import of Cdc25. The yeast strain Q2017, which contains a GFP cassette integrated at the 3′ region of the cdc25 locus (30Chua G. Lingner C. Frazer C. Young P.G. Genetics. 2002; 162: 689-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed with plasmids encoding Ago1, and the localization of Cdc25-GFP was examined by confocal microscopy. Cultures of Q2017 expressing RFP contained a mixture of cells, those with nuclear-localized Cdc25-GFP and those without (Fig. 4A). This observation is in agreement with previous data indicating that nuclear accumulation of Cdc25-GFP peaks during late G2 and early mitosis (30Chua G. Lingner C. Frazer C. Young P.G. Genetics. 2002; 162: 689-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with our theory that NT-Ago1 has a negative effect on nuclear import of Cdc25, cells with nuclear-localized Cdc25-GFP were less abundant in yeast strains expressing RFP-NT-Ago1 (Fig. 4A). To examine this phenomenon further, we created a situation in which nuclear export is inhibited, the rationale being that differences in nuclear import of Cdc25 would be more evident under these conditions. Leptomycin B is an anti-fungal agent that binds to and inhibits the function of the nuclear export factor Crm1 (31Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of fission yeast with this antibiotic has been shown to induce nuclear accumulation of Cdc25 (32Zeng Y. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7410-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, most cells expressing RFP alone contained Cdc25-GFP in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). Although some nuclear Cdc25-GFP was evident among RFP-NT-Ago1-expressing cells, the proportion of cells with distinctly nuclear Cdc25-GFP was always much lower than in cells expressing RFP alone. In addition, the relative levels of nuclear Cdc25-GFP were low compared with RFP-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). RFPNT-Ago1 was seen to accumulate in cytoplasmic puncta (Fig. 4B) that resemble the ribonucleoprotein complexes that contain Ago1, Dcr1, and Rdp1 (33Carmichael J.B. Stoica C. Parker H. Simmonds A.J. McCaffery J.M. Hobman T.C. Traffic. 2006; 8: 1032-1044Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, Cdc25-GFP was not detected in these structures, suggesting that NT-Ago1 was not simply sequestering"

Trans-splicing has been observed in mammalian systems but is low level (sometimes referred to as noise), and a contribution to hybrid protein expression is unclear. In the study of rat sperm tail proteins a cDNA, called 1038, was isolated representing a hybrid mRNA derived in part from the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 3 (Oaz3) gene located on rat chromosome 2 fused to sequences encoded by a novel gene on chromosome 4. Cytoplasmic Oaz3 mRNA is completely testis specific. However, in several tissues Oaz3 is transcribed and contributes to hybrid 1038 mRNA synthesis, without concurrent Oaz3 mRNA synthesis. 1038 mRNA directs synthesis of a hybrid 14-kDa protein, part chromosome 2- and part chromosome 4-derived as shown in vitro and in transfected cells. Antisera that recognize a chromosome 4-encoded C-terminal peptide confirm the hybrid character of endogenous 14-kDa protein and its presence in sperm tail structures and 1038-positive tissue. Our data suggest that the testis-specific OAZ3 gene may be an example of a mammalian gene that in several tissues is transcribed to contribute to a hybrid mRNA and protein.

The mammalian sperm tail contains unique structures not present in cilia, viz. the outer dense fibers (ODF) 2The abbreviations used are: ODF, outer dense fiber; FS, fibrous sheath; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR; HA, hemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: ODF, outer dense fiber; FS, fibrous sheath; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR; HA, hemagglutinin. and the fibrous sheath (FS). In the midpiece region of spermatozoa ODF are each associated with one microtubule doublet of the axoneme. In the sperm tail principal piece, two ODF are replaced by the longitudinal columns of the FS that are connected throughout the principal piece by ribs (1Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Irons M.J. Clermont Y. Anat. Rec. 1982; 202: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ODF are thought to provide elastic recoil for tail movement (4Baltz J.M. Williams P.O. Cone R.A. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and FS acts as scaffold for components involved in signaling pathways (5Eddy E.M. Toshimori K. O'Brien D.A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Several major ODF proteins, including Odf1, Odf2, and Spag4, have been cloned by us (6Schalles U. van der Shao X. Hoorn F.A. Oko R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8van der Tarnasky H.A. Hoorn F.A. Nordeen S.K. Dev.

Hoorn F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6105-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For example, we showed that Spag4 precedes synthesis of other ODF proteins, binds to the forming axoneme, and likely acts as starting point for ODF development by attracting Odf1, followed by several other ODF proteins (12Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. van der Oko R. Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). ODF in turn bind ODF-associated proteins, including Spag5, which plays multiple roles both in germ cells and in somatic cells (13Shao X. van der Xue J. Hoorn F.A. Mol. Reprod.

Analysis of major ODF proteins indicated that several appear related and are encoded by differentially spliced mRNAs. For example, differentially spliced mRNAs encoding Spag5 (14Fitzgerald C.J. van der Oko R.J. Hoorn F.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2006; 73: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Odf2 (17Hoyer-Fender S. Neesen J. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 103: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) variants were detected. Clearly, differential splicing expands the protein repertoire available to spermatids and can result in production of functionally different but related proteins. Indeed, it has been estimated that 40–60% of human genes are alternatively spliced (18Matlin A.J. Clark F. Smith C.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Few reports have been published demonstrating mammalian trans-splicing, and results from these data support the notion that trans-splicing may be a rare occurrence (19Song M.S. Chang J.S. Song S.J.

Graessmann A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); for example, the amount of trans-spliced Cyp3A43/3A4 transcript is estimated at 0.15% of that of Cyp3A43 mRNA (23Finta C. Zaphiropoulos P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5882-5890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In most instances trans-spliced mRNAs are predicted to encode a regular, not hybrid, protein (20Zhang C. Xie Y. Martignetti J.A. Yeo T.T. Massa S.M. Longo F.M. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Hirano M. Noda T. Gene. 2004; 342: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, trans-spliced human ACAT1 mRNA was shown to direct synthesis of a hybrid protein under experimental transfection conditions (25Yang L. Lee O. Chen J. Chen J. Chang C.C. Zhou P. Wang Z.Z. Ma H.H. Sha H.F. Feng J.X. Wang Y. Yang X.Y. Wang L. Dong R. Ornvold K. Li B.L. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46253-46262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Elements and exonic splicing enhancer sequences that play a role in trans-splicing have been identified (26Caudevilla C. Codony C. Serra D. Plasencia G. Roman R. Graessmann A. Asins G. Bach-Elias M. Hegardt F.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3108-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and trans-splicing was shown to involve both regular and cryptic splice sites. Based on current data on mammalian trans-splicing it has been suggested that this process might resemble a level of noise associated with normal nuclear RNA processing (27Takahara T. Tasic B. Maniatis T. Akanuma H. Yanagisawa S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 245-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of uncertain functional importance. Here we report that an integral component of sperm tail ODF and FS, a 14-kDa protein, is a hybrid protein encoded by a hybrid mRNA. The hybrid mRNA has contributions from the spermatid-specific Oaz3 gene (28Ivanov I.P. Rohrwasser A. Terreros D.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) located on rat chromosome 2 and a novel gene on rat chromosome 4. Oaz3 (previously called Oaz-t) (29Tosaka Y. Tanaka H. Yano Y. Masai K. Nozaki M. Yomogida K. Otani S. Nojima H. Nishimune Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) belongs to the family of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme genes that also include ubiquitous somatic Oaz1 and Oaz2 genes. Translation of all OAZ mRNAs is induced by polyamines and depends on translational frameshift at the same TCCTGA sequence (30Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In addition, we discovered that other tissues, including lung, transcribe these two genes to give rise to detectable levels of the hybrid mRNA and its hybrid protein, but not of normal spliced Oaz3 mRNA. Male Germ Cell and Component Isolation—Rat male germ cells, including pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongating spermatids, were isolated by centrifugal elutriation as described previously (31Junco A. Bhullar B. van der Tarnasky H.A. Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Rat ODF and FS were isolated from tails of rat epididymal spermatozoa as described previously (1Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised against peptide YQNQQLEKESRSSQEHLC, located in the chromosome 4-specific part of 1038 protein. Affinity purification of anti-1038 antibodies was done using peptide covalently coupled to agarose beads. Polyclonal antibodies were also raised against total rat ODF and FS proteins, and anti-14 antibodies were isolated by affinity purification using filters containing immobilized 14-kDa protein as described previously (12Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. van der Oko R. Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning of 1017 and 1038 cDNAs—Affinity-purified anti-14 antiserum, which recognizes the 14-kDa polypeptide in ODF and FS, was used to screen a rat testicular λ Zap II cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the method of Young and Davis (32Young R.A. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The phagemids of six positive clones were excised by transfecting them with helper phage into XL-1 Blue cells, and the resulting secreted and circularized plasmids were transformed into SOLAR cells with ampicillin selection. The selected colonies were plasmid isolated and sequenced by Cortec Service (Queen's University, Kingston, ON) using the ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit with AmpliTag® DNA polymerase. Representative clones of 1017 and 1038 were chosen for second and third round sequencing analysis in which both strands were sequenced completely. Rat-Hamster Radiation Hybrid Mapping—Radiation hybrid mapping was PCR based using genomic DNA from hybrid cells of the T55 panel (5255 genetic markers) as template at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Genome Resource Facility, The Centre for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The T55 panel contains a map of the rat genome using 5255 genetic markers. Genomic location of the 3′-end of 1038 cDNA was mapped using primers 5′-GGAGAGAATGTGGGGAATACCAG-3′ and 5′-GCCTCTAGCCATGTTCCTCAAGC-3′, which generate a 346-bp PCR fragment. The 5′-1038 cDNA region was mapped using primers 5′-GAGAAACTGCCTTGTACCAGGTCC-3′ and 5-′CCCTGCCACTTAGGAAATTCTCTC-3′, which generate a 336-bp PCR fragment. Twenty-five nanograms of hybrid DNA was used in PCR analysis. For linkage analysis, PCR typing results were submitted to the Otsuka GEN Research Institute data base (ratmap.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/menu/RH.html). RNA Isolation—RNA was isolated from 100 mg of rat tissues and from elutriated male germ cells. Tissue was homogenized at 4 °C in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine tetrachloride). The extract was filtered and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The pellet was washed three times in 1 ml of homogenization buffer and resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) to isolate nuclear RNA. The supernatant was used for cytoplasmic RNA extraction using TRIzol. All nuclear RNA preparations were incubated with RNase-free DNase to remove any contaminating DNA. RT-PCR—RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the M-MLV RT kit (Invitrogen); for each tissue, 2 μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear RNA was used with 100 ng of random primers to generate cDNA. For each primer set, 35 cycles of PCR were carried out under the following conditions: a denaturing step for 30 s at 94 °C, an annealing step for 30 s at 54 °C, and an elongation step for 1 min at 72 °C. For PCR the following primers were used: pr678, 5′-GAGAAACTGCCTTGTACCAGGTCC-3′; pr438, 5′-GCCTCTAGCCATGTTCCTCAAGC-3′; pr117a, 5′-GTGGAAGTCTAACTGAACTGAACTGGGTCTTG-3′; β-actin, 5′-CAACACCCCAGCCATGTACG-3′ and 5′-AGGAAGAGGATGCGGCAGTGG-3′; Odf1, 5′-CATCCCGGGTCTATTTGTCGTCCTTCTGAG-3′ and 5′-CATGTCGACTAAATGGCCGCACTGAGTTGTCTTTTG-3′. PCR fragments were analyzed at the University of Calgary Core DNA Services. Mass Spectrometry—Gel-separated proteins were submitted to the Southern Alberta Mass Spectrometry facility (University of Calgary). Proteins were trypsinized, treated with or without iodoacetamide, and initially analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization on a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems). Selected peptide sequences were obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy using an Agilent Nano LC chromatographic system and a QSTAR Pulsar iHybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Protein Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (12Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. van der Oko R. Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In short, proteins were boiled in loading buffer, separated on 10–18% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gradient gels, transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (54 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% dry nonfat milk), and analyzed using primary antibodies (anti-1038 dilution, 1/100; anti-14 dilution, 1/200) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) diluted 1/12,000. Prestained Protein Ladder SM0671 (Fermentas) was used as a size marker. LumiGLO substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) was used to develop the blot. The image was captured using a 3000 Versa-Doc Imaging System (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Translation and Immunoprecipitations—HA-tagged 1038 protein was produced in vitro using the TNT system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine as described (12Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. van der Oko R. Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and 25 μl of in vitro translated HA or HA-1038 fusion protein were incubated with anti-1038, anti-14, and anti-HA antibodies. Immune complexes were precipitated using Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech), washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described (12Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. van der Oko R. Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Transfection—Constructs expressing HA or HA-1038 fusion protein were transfected into human 293 cells and mouse 3T3 cells using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. 36 h after transfection proteins were extracted from these cells and complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-1038, anti-HA, and anti-14 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies as described above. Immunoelectron Microscopy—The LR-white-embedded rat testicular and epididymal tissues were processed for immunogold labeling by using previously described procedures (33Tovich P.R. Sutovsky P. Oko R.J. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ultrathin sections were mounted on formvar-coated nickel grids and blocked with 10% normal goat serum prior to overnight incubation of the affinity-purified anti-1038 antibodies at 4 °C. The sections were then washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (1:20; Sigma) followed by counterstaining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. In indicated instances anti-1038 antibody was preincubated with C-terminal 1038-specific peptide bound to Sepharose beads before use in electron microscopy. The final sections were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (Hitachi 7000). Rat ODF and FS contain several major proteins, one of which is 14,000 in size. We raised an antiserum against all major ODF proteins from which an anti-14 antibody was affinity purified with specificity for the 14-kDa protein. Screening a rat testicular cDNA expression library with affinity-purified anti-14 antibodies resulted in isolation of two cDNAs, 1017 (GenBank™ DQ431008) and 1038 (GenBank™ DQ431007). Sequence analysis demonstrated that they have identical 5′, but different 3′, sequences. We determined that 1017 cDNA is encoded by the rat Oaz3 (28Ivanov I.P. Rohrwasser A. Terreros D.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) gene, located on chromosome 2 (Fig. 1A). Analysis of 1038 cDNA demonstrated that it is composed of sequences derived from Oaz3 exon 1 and part of exon 2 (Fig. 1A, indicated as exon Δ2) and from sequences on rat chromosome 4 (Fig. 1A). No genes have yet been described or predicted for this region. This suggested that 1038 mRNA is a hybrid mRNA. Northern blotting using 1017- and 1038-specific probes confirmed the presence of the two mRNAs in both rat and mouse (supplemental Fig. S1). To verify the 1038 cDNA bioinformatics result and exclude cloning artifacts, we screened genomic DNA from rat-hamster radiation hybrid cell panel T55 using primer pairs that specifically detect rat sequences representing either the 5′-region shared by 1017 and 1038 cDNAs or the 1038-specific 3′-region. Fig. 1B shows that 1038-specific genomic sequences are located in close proximity to four rat chromosome 4 markers (4.020-D4Rat22, 4.019-D4Rat20, 4.021-D4Rat96, and 4.018-D4Got39) that are at the location predicted for 1038 (position 61.437). As expected, the 5′-sequences shared between 1017 and 1038 mapped to the known location of the rat Oaz3 gene on chromosome 2 (Fig. 1B, markers 2.039-D2Rat134, 2.040-D2Mgh9, and 8.022-D8Got54). We conclude that 1038 mRNA is a genuine hybrid transcript. Analysis of the crossover point between chromosome 2 and 4 sequences in 1038 mRNA and comparison to the corresponding chromosome 2 and chromosome 4 genomic sequences showed that formation of the hybrid 1038 mRNA appears to involve a cryptic 5′-splice site on chromosome 2 (AG CT) and a canonical 3′-splice site on chromosome 4 (CCAGCCAG CA). The Oaz3 exon 2 5′-splice site (AG TA) is used in formation of 1017 (Oaz3) mRNA. These results suggest, but do not prove, that trans-splicing may be involved in 1038 hybrid mRNA production. Hybrid 1038 mRNA Expression in Postmeiotic Male Germ Cells—To demonstrate expression of the novel, hybrid 1038 mRNA in male germ cells we used Northern blot and RT-PCR approaches. First, developmental Northern blots using specific riboprobes showed that trans-spliced 1-kb 1038 mRNA and normal spliced 1-kb 1017 mRNA can first be detected in rat testis starting at postnatal day 31 (Fig. 2A, lane 2, panels I and II), a time corresponding to the first appearance of spermatids. No 1038 mRNA is expressed at day 27 (lane 1), corresponding to late pachytene spermatocytes. Second, hybrid 1038 mRNA spermatid expression was demonstrated by RT-PCR using cytoplasmic RNA from fractionated pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongating spermatids (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). PCR products observed using spermatocyte RNA (lane 1) result from the presence of small numbers of spermatids in the spermatocyte fraction, because primers specific for Odf1, a gene exclusively expressed in spermatids (12Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Lee J.P. van der Oko R. Hoorn F.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 34van der Oosterhuis J.H. Hoorn F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11708-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), generated Odf1 PCR fragment using spermatocyte RNA. Thus hybrid 1038 mRNA expression in testis appears restricted to postmeiotic cells. OAZ3 Transcription in Support of Hybrid 1038 mRNA Synthesis—Oaz3 expression had been suggested to be testis specific (28Ivanov I.P. Rohrwasser A. Terreros D.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We analyzed 1017 (Oaz3) mRNA and 1038 mRNA expression in various tissues by RT-PCR of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA using 1038-specific primers and 1017-specific primers (locations as shown in Fig. 3). The result of cytoplasmic RNA analysis shows that 1017 (Oaz3) mRNA is exclusively expressed in testis (Fig. 3, panel cytoplasmic RNA, lane 5), confirming the above suggestion (28Ivanov I.P. Rohrwasser A. Terreros D.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly however, we observed cytoplasmic hybrid 1038 RNA in kidney, small intestine, lung, brain, and ovary (panel cytoplasmic RNA, lanes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9). Because 1038 hybrid mRNA derives in part from Oaz3 gene sequences, this result indicates that Oaz3 must be actively transcribed in these tissues. Analysis of nuclear RNA using the primers confirmed that indeed Oaz3 nuclear pre-mRNA can be detected in all 1038 mRNA-positive tissues (Fig. 3, nuclear RNA panel, 1248 bp DNA, lanes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9) indicative of transcription of the Oaz3 gene. Several tissues express neither transcript. 1038 mRNA Encodes a Hybrid 14-kDa Protein in Transfected Cells—Sequence analysis and comparison of 1017 and 1038 cDNAs show that at the position where 1017 mRNA has 5 adenosine residues (position 68–72), 1038 mRNA has 6 adenosine residues (position 68–73) (Fig. 1D, boxed A residue). We confirmed by genomic PCR that the Oaz3 gene encodes 5 adenosine residues at that position, not 6 (in agreement with the Oaz3 GenBank™ NM_016901 entry). We also determined by RT-PCR that whereas nuclear 1017 pre-mRNA has 5 adenosine residues, nuclear trans-spliced 1038 RNA has 6 adenosine residues. This suggests that an unknown nuclear process adds 1 adenosine residue to hybrid 1038 RNA before transport to the cytoplasm, which addition affects the reading frame from that point on (see Fig. 1D). We also determined by N-terminal sequence analysis of purified rat sperm tail 14-kDa protein that the N-terminal sequence is PCTR (not shown), indicative of a translation start at the Leu codon (Fig. 1D, boxed CTG codon). Translation starts at the Leu codon and other non-AUG codons have been reported in several instances (reviewed in Ref. 35Touriol C. Bornes S. Bonnal S. Audigier S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Vagner S. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Based on translation start at the Leu codon, the additional adenosine residue and the (previously published; Ref. 28Ivanov I.P. Rohrwasser A. Terreros D.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) occurrence of a translational frameshift at the sequence UCCUGA present in both 1038 and 1017 mRNA (Fig. 1D, boxed TCCTGA sequence), hybrid 1038 mRNA is predicted to encode a hybrid 14-kDa protein whose N-terminal 105 amino acids are encoded on chromosome 2 and its C-terminal 33 amino acids by the novel gene on chromosome 4 (Fig. 1E). We sought first to establish that under experimental conditions hybrid 1038 mRNA can direct synthesis of the predicted 14-kDa hybrid protein. For this we generated antibodies (anti-1038) raised against a chromosome 4 1038-specific peptide (Fig. 1E, boxed residues in bold). In indicated experiments we also employed anti-14 antibodies used to isolate the 1038 cDNA clones. First, HA-1038 cDNA (encoding a HA-tagged 1038 fusion protein of 15 kDa) directs synthesis of a 15-kDa protein as shown by immunoprecipitation using anti-1038 and anti-14 antisera (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 4). Preincubation of anti-1038 antiserum with peptide blocks immunoprecipitation (lanes 2 and 3). Second, we transfected human 293 and mouse 3T3 cells with an HA-1038 expression construct and with an HA construct lacking the insert. Extracts from transfected cells were investigated by immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis. Fig. 4B shows that HA-1038 cDNA directs synthesis of a hybrid 15-kDa protein recognized by anti-HA and by anti-1038 antibodies in both 293 cells (lanes 2 and 6) and 3T3 cells (lane 4). In addition, as expected, the HA-1038-directed 15-kDa protein is recognized by anti-14 antiserum (lane 8). HA controls lack this protein (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). We observed that the translational frameshift does not, however, occur in bacteria; a construct linking 1038 mRNA to maltose-binding protein (MBP) coding sequences, called MBP-1038, was expressed in bacteria and the resulting protein isolated and its sequence analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry sequencing results (supplemental Fig. S2) established that the amino acid sequence of bacterially produced 1038 was in accordance with the sequence predicted based on the presence of 6 adenosine residues, not 5, but that the translational frameshift did not occur: maltose-binding protein 1038 was shorter than expected and is recognized by anti-14, but not by anti-1038, antibodies. Hybrid 14-kDa Protein Localizes to ODF and FS—We find that in testis hybrid 1038 mRNA is a postmeiotic transcript, and we sought to detect expression of the corresponding hybrid 14-kDa protein in rat ODF and FS by immunoelectron microscopy of rat epididymal sperm and by Western blotting of purified ODF and FS preparations using affinity-purified anti-1038 antiserum. The results show that in the midpiece and principal piece of spermatozoa gold label was detected over ODF and FS. Fig. 5A shows staining of several principal piece (PP) sections and one midpiece (MP) section. Fig. 5B shows two midpiece sections with gold label predominantly over ODF as well as two endpiece sections. Additional higher power images are presented in supplemental Fig. S3). Preincubation of anti-1038 antiserum with peptide abolished gold label (Fig. 5C shows two examples), and use of preimmune serum did not result in any gold labeling of these structures, as expected. Western blotting demonstrated that anti-1038 antibodies recognize the 14-kDa (1038) protein in both ODF and FS (Fig. 5D, lanes 1 and 2, respectively), more so in ODF. Preimmune sera did not detect 14-kDa protein when used in Western blotting experiments (not shown). Relative intensity on Westerns and abundance of gold label over ODF compared with FS are in agreement. Hybrid 14-kDa Protein Expression in Lung—Several tissues, including lung, express hybrid 1038 mRNA, but not normal spliced 1017 (Oaz3) mRNA. First, we used Western blot analysis of lung, testis, and liver protein extracts and showed that lung contains hybrid 14-kDa 1038 protein (Fig. 6A, lane 3). As expected from the immunoelectron microscopic results, testis expresses the hybrid 14-kDa protein (Fig. 6A, lane 2). Reprobing these blots, after complete stripping, with anti-14 antiserum detected the same protein band, indicating that the 14-kDa protein contains epitopes recognized by both anti-14 and anti-1038 sera as expected for the hybrid protein. 1038 protein is not expressed in liver (Fig. 6A, lane 1), a tissue negative for 1038 mRNA (Fig. 3, lane 7). Second, we covalently coupled anti-1038 antibodies to Sepharose beads, incubated these beads with protein extracts from testis, lung, and liver, and analyzed the bound complexed proteins by Western blotting using anti-14 antiserum. The results (Fig. 6B) show that the 14-kDa hybrid protein is complexed to immobilized anti-1038 antibodies and detected with anti-14 antiserum in testis and lung, but not in liver. In this work we have documented the expression of a hybrid 1038 mRNA and protein in postmeiotic male germ cells. In addition we observed that several rat tissues express hybrid 1038 mRNA without concurrent accumulation of 1017 (Oaz3) mRNA. This indicates that in these latter tissues, the Oaz3 gene is transcribed for the purpose of contributing to a hybrid mRNA, rather than expression of normal spliced Oaz3 mRNA. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that a mammalian gene can be transcribed in one tissue (testis) to give rise to both normal and hybrid mRNA species but in other tissues only contributes to the hybrid mRNA. We have demonstrated that 1038 mRNA is a fusion of sequences originating from Oaz3 on rat chromosome 2 and a novel gene on chromosome 4. In addition, we showed that the hybrid mRNA encodes a true hybrid 14-kDa protein that is a significant constituent of two important sperm tail structures, ODF and FS. The role of this hybrid protein, as indeed of other ODF proteins, remains to be determined, but ODF have been suggested to play a role in elastic recoil (4Baltz J.M. Williams P.O. Cone R.A. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Of note, Drosophila sperm contains structures similar to ODF: products of the testis-specific Mst(3)CGP family contribute to those structures and mutation of Mst(3)CGP genes renders animals infertile (36Schafer M. Borsch D. Hulster A. Schafer U. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kuhn R. Kuhn C. Borsch D. Glatzer K.H. Schafer U. Schafer M. Mech. Dev. 1991; 35: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mammalian trans-splicing has been documented in a number of instances. In these reports the trans-spliced transcripts are rare (sometimes described as noise) (27Takahara T. Tasic B. Maniatis T. Akanuma H. Yanagisawa S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 245-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and usually involve fusion of an untranslated region derived from one gene spliced to a region containing a complete coding sequence derived from another gene. In addition, in previous reports cells displaying low levels of trans-spliced mRNAs invariably express higher levels of corresponding normal spliced mRNAs (23Finta C. Zaphiropoulos P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5882-5890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A recent review suggested that transsplicing is perhaps an aberrant process not intended to produce relevant hybrid proteins (27Takahara T. Tasic B. Maniatis T. Akanuma H. Yanagisawa S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 245-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and new bioinformatics algorithms to predict alternative splicing also suggest transsplicing results from gene level abnormalities (38Shao X. Shepelev V. Fedorov A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We do not know the underlying mechanisms involved in synthesis of hybrid 1038 mRNA. We do not believe it involves recombination of genomic DNA in, for example, a subset of germ cells, because hybrid protein is present in all elongating spermatids (as shown in Fig. 5) and genomic PCR using appropriate primer combinations failed to reveal evidence for genomic DNA rearrangements (not shown). Sequence analysis of the involved genomic regions on chromosomes 2 and 4 and comparison to the 1038 mRNA sequence suggested the use of a cryptic 5′-splice site on chromosome 2 (5′-AG CT-3′) and a consensus 3′-splice site on chromosome 4 (5′-CCAGCCAG CA-3′) to generate 1038 hybrid mRNA (Fig. 1, C and D). This suggested the involvement of trans-splicing mechanisms, but we cannot rule out other RNA recombination events. Use of non-canonical splice sites in formation of trans-spliced mRNA had been reported previously (20Zhang C. Xie Y. Martignetti J.A. Yeo T.T. Massa S.M. Longo F.M. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Hirano M. Noda T. Gene. 2004; 342: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also showed here that the normal exon 2 donor splice site (5′-AG TA-3′) is used in generation of normal spliced 1017 (Oaz3) mRNA (Fig. 1C). Several interesting implications emerge from our findings. First, the enzymatic activity of OAZ3 protein, an exclusively postmeiotic male germ cell-specific protein, is known. Because the ∼100 amino acid residues in the C-terminal part of OAZ3 are replaced by 33 amino acids derived from chromosome 4, one can predict a novel (currently unknown) function for the hybrid 14-kDa protein. Of note, however, this replacement did not alter the subcellular localization; both 1017 (OAZ3) protein (not shown) and 1038 (14 kDa) protein localize to ODF and FS. We had demonstrated previously that many ODF proteins specifically interact using dimerization motifs resembling leucine zippers (reviewed in Ref. 39Kierszenbaum A.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); it is interesting to note that the 1017-encoded 14-kDa protein contains a motif resembling a leucine zipper (L-N6-I-N6-L-N6-I-N6-L) that may well interact with the functional Odf1 or Odf2 leucine zippers. In contrast, the 1038-encoded 14-kDa protein does not encode such a predicted motif. In this regard it is also noteworthy that those tissues that only express hybrid 1038 mRNA have a common endodermal origin, except brain. More importantly, 1038 mRNA-positive tissues contain ciliated cells, and it will be interesting to determine the subcellular localization of the hybrid 14-kDa protein to ascertain a possible role during development or in cilia. Be that as it may, the characterization of the hybrid 14-kDa protein is a first example showing that spermatids are able to expand their protein repertoire by using hybrid mRNA. Second, our data indicate clearly that the testis-specific characteristic of the Oaz3 gene, as evidenced by the presence of cytoplasmic Oaz3 mRNA, is the result of multiple contributions: (i) Oaz3 is actively transcribed in several tissues, including testis, but not in many others, indicating a distinct regulation at the transcription initiation stage, and (ii) Oaz3 nuclear pre-mRNA undergoes normal splicing exclusively in spermatids. These data thus demonstrate that tissue specificity is not necessarily only a consequence of transcription regulation. A corollary to our findings is that care should be exercised when interpreting results from global gene expression analyses. Clearly, the use of RNA or corresponding expressed sequence tags from entire tissues and whole cells would result in inclusion of nuclear transcripts that, in the case documented here for Oaz3, do not necessarily appear as mature cytoplasmic transcripts. Our analysis of the hybrid 1038 mRNA transcript and corresponding hybrid protein, which localizes to two essential sperm tail structures, documents a novel way to increase the protein repertoire of a cell.

https://openalex.org/W1971103546,"p21cip1 inhibits S phase entry by binding to cyclin-cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase-2) complexes. The levels of p21cip1 are rapidly induced after mitogenic stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts and then down-regulate as the cells reach late G1 phase and activate cyclin E-cdk2. In this study, we have shown that pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), expression of dominant negative PKCδ, or knockdown of PKCδ with small interfering RNA elevates p21cip1 protein levels in mouse embryo fibroblasts. This effect is selective, post-transcriptional, and proteasome-dependent but distinct from previously identified post-transcriptional control mechanisms involving cyclin D1 and Skp2. PKCδ inhibition results in a reduced entry into S phase, and this effect is not detected in p21cip1-null cells. Thus, post-transcriptional destabilization of p21cip1 appears to be a major mitogenic effect of PKCδ in fibroblasts. p21cip1 inhibits S phase entry by binding to cyclin-cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase-2) complexes. The levels of p21cip1 are rapidly induced after mitogenic stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts and then down-regulate as the cells reach late G1 phase and activate cyclin E-cdk2. In this study, we have shown that pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), expression of dominant negative PKCδ, or knockdown of PKCδ with small interfering RNA elevates p21cip1 protein levels in mouse embryo fibroblasts. This effect is selective, post-transcriptional, and proteasome-dependent but distinct from previously identified post-transcriptional control mechanisms involving cyclin D1 and Skp2. PKCδ inhibition results in a reduced entry into S phase, and this effect is not detected in p21cip1-null cells. Thus, post-transcriptional destabilization of p21cip1 appears to be a major mitogenic effect of PKCδ in fibroblasts. p21cip1 is a dual regulator of the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). 4The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; FBS, fetal bovine serum; SFK, Src family kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; BrdUrd, bromouridine; DN, dominant negative; PP1, 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1′-naphthyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine. It was initially described as a cdk inhibitor that could prevent the activation of cyclin-cdk complexes or bind to proliferating cell nuclear antigen and repress DNA synthesis (1Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 3Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Although the cdk inhibitory role of p21cip1 is now firmly established, subsequent studies have also described a positive role for p21cip1 as an assembly factor for cyclin D1-cdk4/6 complexes during G1 phase (4LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 5Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M.

One of the best-studied aspects of p21cip1 is its induction during DNA damage and the activation of its promoter by p53 (6Tokino T. el-Deiry W.S. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar). However, p21cip1 gene expression is also regulated by many signals that are p53-independent (7Zeng Y.X. el-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1557-1564PubMed Google Scholar, 8Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In addition to the control of gene expression, p21cip1 levels can be regulated post-transcriptionally through the proteasome (9Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Rousseau D. Cannella D. Boulaire J. Fitzgerald P. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3290-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism and role of E3 ubiquitin ligases are still under debate. For instance, p21cip1 can be ubiquitinated, but this modification is not required for the proteosomal degradation of p21cip1 (11Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 15Chen X. Chi Y. Bloecher A. Aebersold R. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We and others have previously reported that the levels of p21cip1 oscillate during cell cycle re-entry of nontransformed quiescent fibroblasts (8Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 16Bottazzi M.E. Zhu X. Bohmer R.M. Assoian R.K. J.

The levels of p21cip1 mRNA and protein are low in quiescent cells, transiently increase as a consequence of mitogen-stimulated cell cycle reentry, and then decline in late G1 phase. The early G1 phase induction of p21cip1 is thought to play a role in the assembly of cyclin D-cdk4/6 complexes (4LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 5Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), whereas the subsequent decline in p21cip1 contributes to the activation of cyclin E-cdk2 (16Bottazzi M.E. Zhu X. Bohmer R.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity is required for the growth factor-dependent induction of p21cip1 mRNA in early G1 phase but does not affect the late G1 phase down-regulation associated with S phase entry (16Bottazzi M.E. Zhu X. Bohmer R.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Rho is thought to have the opposite effect, suppressing p21cip1 gene expression and destabilizing the protein to allow for efficient S phase entry, at least in transformed cells (18Adnane J. Bizouarn F.A. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6962-6970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Coleman M.L. Densham R.M. Croft D.R. Olson M.F. Oncogene. 2006; Google Scholar). In addition to ERK and Rho, the PKC family of isozymes has an established role in cell proliferation and as regulators of p21cip1. However, the biological outcome of PKC stimulation or inhibition is strongly influenced by the isozyme that is regulated and the cell type in which the effect occurs (22Black J.D. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D406-D423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Borner C. Ueffing M. Jaken S. Parker P.J. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 78-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For example, PKC isozymes can stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation depending on the cell type (24Frey M.R. Clark J.A. Leontieva O. Uronis J.M. Black A.R. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, several PKC isozymes have been reported to increase p21cip1 levels to promote cell cycle arrest and initiate differentiation or apoptosis (25Han J.W. Ahn S.H. Kim Y.K. Bae G.U. Yoon J.W. Hong S. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.W. Lee H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42084-42090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Wan X. Kong J. Li Y.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In lung adenocarcinoma cells, the p21cip1-dependent G1 arrest mediated by PKC was attributed specifically to PKCδ (28Nakagawa M. Oliva J.L. Kothapalli D. Fournier A. Assoian R.K. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33926-33934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These effects of PKCδ have been typically accompanied by corresponding changes in the levels of p21cip1 mRNA. In this study, we have examined the effect of PKC on p21cip1 levels and S phase entry in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our results show that PKCδ selectively destabilizes p21cip1 protein levels, and this effect is required for optimal S phase entry. In addition to identifying a novel post-transcriptional effect of PKC, our results emphasize that a single PKC isoform can stimulate or inhibit S phase entry, even when its target is the same cell cycle regulator. Cell Culture—GF109203X (bisindolyl-maleimide I), LY294002, and MG132 were purchased from Calbiochem. PP1 was purchased from Biomol. All stocks were made in Me2SO. PMA was obtained from LC Laboratories and dissolved in ethanol. Spontaneously immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type and p21cip1-null mice were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Unless noted otherwise, MEFs were grown to near confluence in 5% FBS-DMEM and then serum-starved in DMEM-1 mg/ml heat-inactivated, fatty acid-free BSA (DMEM-BSA) for 48 h. The quiescent cells were trypsinized, suspended in DMEM-BSA (1–1.5 × 106 cells/10 ml), plated in a 100-mm dish, and stimulated with 10% FBS. In some experiments, the suspended cells were preincubated in suspension with 25 μm LY294002, 10 μm PP1, 10 μm GF109203X, or 10 μm MG132 for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected and lysed as described previously (29Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To monitor entry into S phase, quiescent wild-type and p21cip1-null MEFs were infected with adenoviruses as described below. At the end of the starvation period, the cells were reseeded at 50% confluence in 6-well dishes containing autoclaved glass coverslips and incubated in 2 ml of DMEM-10% FBS with 3 μg/ml bromouridine (BrdUrd) (Amersham Biosciences; 1000-fold dilution). Formaldehyde-fixed cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd as described previously (30Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Pure E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Multiple fields of view (usually 50–100 cells in 3–4 fields) were counted per sample to determine the percentage of BrdUrd-labeled nuclei. Adenoviral Infections and Plasmid RNA Interference Transfections—Adenoviruses expressing dominant negative PKCδ (DN-PKCδ), dominant negative PKCα (DN-PKCα), LacZ, or green fluorescent protein were generated as described in Refs. 31Ohba M.

The dominant negative adenoviruses are kinase-dead due to a mutation from Arg to Lys in the ATP-binding site of the catalytic domain. The Skp2 adenovirus was a generous gift of Keiichi Nakayama. Infections with adenoviruses were performed as follows. Near confluent MEFs in 150-mm dishes were incubated in DMEM-BSA for 8 h. Adenoviruses were then directly added to the culture medium. After overnight infection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM-BSA, and the cells were starved for an additional 24 h. MEFs were transiently transfected with cyclin D1 RNA interference in pSUPER (kindly provided by Michael Olson) using 5 μg of plasmid and Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as described previously (29Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The infected/transfected cells were trypsinized, reseeded at subconfluence, and stimulated with FBS as described above. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed using 25–75 μg of total cellular protein and the following antibodies: actin (sc-8432, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); cdk4 (AH20202, BIOSOURCE), cyclin D1 (sc-8396, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21cip1 (sc-6246, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PKCδ (sc-213, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p27kip1 (K25020, BD Transduction Laboratories), ERK (610031, BD Transduction Laboratories), Skp2 (32-3400, Invitrogen) and PKCα (610107, BD Transduction Laboratories). Proteins were detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and film. Autoradiograms were digitized by scanning, and figures were assembled using PhotoShop version 6.0. Vertical spaces in Figs. 1C and 4A indicate where extraneous information was removed from a scanned image.FIGURE 4Inhibition of PKCδ regulates p21cip1 protein stability through the proteasome. A, asynchronous MEFs (∼106) were seeded in 100-mm dishes and incubated overnight in DMEM-10% FBS. The cells were then incubated with 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) in fresh medium for the times shown. B, near confluent MEFs in 150-mm dishes were infected with DN-PKCδ or LacZ adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 100 in DMEM-10% FBS and incubated overnight. Cells were reseeded into four 100-mm dishes and cultured in DMEM-10% FBS for 24 h before the addition of fresh medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Samples were collected at the times shown. Light and dark exposures were chosen to normalize the starting levels of p21cip1 in the control and PKC-inhibited cells. C, asynchronous MEFs were transfected with irrelevant siRNA (Control) or PKC-δ siRNA-A. Cycloheximide was added 48 h after transfection, and the cells were collected at the times shown. D, quiescent MEFs were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100 with LacZ or DN-PKCδ adenoviruses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells (∼106 in 10 ml of DMEM-BSA) were trypsinized and pretreated with Me2SO or 10μm MG132 in suspension for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were seeded and stimulated with 10% FBS for the times indicated. Lysates (A–D) were analyzed by Western blotting for the proteins shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Isolation of total RNA, cDNA synthesis, and PCR was performed as described previously (33Stewart S.A.

For mouse p21cip1, the real-time PCR reaction contained 900 nm forward primer TCC ACA GCG ATA TCC AGA CAT T, 900 nm reverse primer CGG ACA TCA CCA GGA TTG G, and 250 nm probe 6FAM-AGA GCC ACA GGC ACC-minor groove binder-nonfluorescent quencher (MGB-NFQ). For 18 S rRNA, we used 150 nm forward primer CCT GGT TGA TCC TGC CAG TAG, 150 nm reverse primer CCG TGC GTA CTT AGA CAT GCA, and 100 nm probe VIC-TGC TTG TCT CAA AGA TTA-MGB-NFQ. p21cip1 mRNA and 18 S rRNA levels were quantified by standard curve using ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system software. The levels of p21cip1 mRNA were normalized to 18 S rRNA. Duplicate PCR reactions were run for each sample, and results were plotted as mean ± S.D. PKC Knockdown with Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—MEFs (∼5 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates with antibiotic-free DMEM-10% FBS and incubated overnight. The near confluent cultures were washed three times with OptiMEM before transfection in duplicate with either an irrelevant siRNA (GGUAUUGACAGGGAUCUGAtt; Ambion 156130) or siRNAs specific to mouse PKCδ). The sequences for the PKCδ siRNAs were CCGUCGUGGAGCCAUUAAAtt (Ambion 151132; called siRNA-A) and CCAUGUAUCCUGAGUGGAAtt (Ambion 151130; called siRNA-B). The transfection used Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; 1 μl/25,000 cells) diluted in OptiMEM and generally followed the procedure described by the manufacturer. siRNAs were diluted in OptiMEM and used at a final concentration of 300 nm. The final transfection volume was 1 ml. The transfected cells were washed twice in DMEM (4–6 h after transfection), incubated in antibiotic-free DMEM-10% FBS for 42–44 h, collected, and analyzed. Inhibition of PKC Up-regulates p21cip1 Levels as Fibroblasts Progress into Late G1 Phase—Our initial studies used pharmacological inhibitors of several kinases to identify signal transducers other than Rho (see Introduction) that control the down-regulation of p21cip1 during G1 phase progression in fibroblasts. Inhibition of Src family kinases (SFKs) with PP1 (Fig. 1A) reduced the induction of p21cip1, but when we inhibited SFKs after the initial induction of p21cip1 occurred, we found p21cip1 down-regulation was normal in the SFK-inhibited cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with LY294002 did not affect the down-regulation of p21cip1 during late G1 phase (Fig. 1C). In contrast, inhibition of the PKC family with GF109203X, a pharmacological inhibitor that blocks PKCα,-β,-δ, and -ϵ (34Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), prevented the down-regulation of p21cip1 protein seen in late G1 phase (Fig. 1D). Studies in epithelial cells indicate that phorbol ester-sensitive PKCs usually act as anti-mitogens and that their anti-mitogenic effects are due to the stimulation of p21cip1 gene expression (Introduction). To determine whether PKCs could stimulate p21cip1 levels in fibroblasts, we compared the levels of p21cip1 after quiescent MEFs were treated with the phorbol ester PMA (an activator of conventional and novel PKCs), serum, or the combination of PMA and serum (Fig. 2A). PMA alone did increase the level of p21cip1 in early G1 phase of MEFs (Fig. 2A, 3 h), but this effect was transient, and p21cip1 levels were barely detectable by late G1 phase (Fig. 2A, 9–18 h). Serum stimulation also resulted in a transient increase in p21cip1 levels, and PMA did not enhance the duration of the serum-stimulated signal (Fig. 2A). Although quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR did reveal a small stimulatory effect of PMA on p21cip1 mRNA relative to serum-treated MEFs (Fig. 2B), PMA (alone or in the presence of serum) did not allow for the sustained increase in p21cip1 gene expression that is characteristic of PMA-stimulated PKC activation in epithelial cells (28Nakagawa M. Oliva J.L. Kothapalli D. Fournier A. Assoian R.K. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33926-33934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that (i) a pro-mitogenic PKC is effectively activated by serum and inhibited by GF109203X in MEFs, (ii) activation of phorbol ester-sensitive PKCs can stimulate p21cip1 gene expression in MEFs, but the effect is very short-lived, and (iii) the dominant PKC effect in MEFs is the late G1 phase reduction in p21cip1. PKCδ Mediates the Post-transcriptional Down-regulation of p21cip1—To identify the PKC family member required for the down-regulation of p21cip1, we infected MEFs with adenoviruses encoding LacZ (control) or DN-PKCα and -PKCδ, two of the major PKC isozymes targeted by GF109203X and expressed in MEFs. Despite similar levels of expression, DN-PKCα did not affect the levels of p21cip1 during G1 phase, whereas DN-PKCδ strongly inhibited the late G1 phase down-regulation of p21cip1 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the effect of DN-PKCδ on p21cip1 protein was not accompanied by changes in the level of p21cip1 mRNA (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that PKCδ is required for the post-transcriptional down-regulation of p21cip1 in late G1 phase in MEFs. This post-transcriptional regulation of p21cip1 by PKCδ that we see in fibroblasts is notably distinct from the transcriptional control of p21cip1 that is commonly seen in response to altered PKCδ activity in epithelial cells (28Nakagawa M. Oliva J.L. Kothapalli D. Fournier A. Assoian R.K. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33926-33934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Selective knockdown of PKCδ with two different siRNAs increased p21cip1 levels 2.2–2.6-fold without comparable effect on p21cip1 mRNA (not shown), confirming that the δ isoform of PKC is responsible for the post-transcriptional down-regulation of p21cip1 (Fig. 3C). PKCδ Regulates p21cip1 Protein Stability—Because we found that PKCδ regulates p21cip1 post-transcriptionally, we asked whether it was affecting p21cip1 protein stability. The half-life of p21cip1 in MEFs is ∼30 min (16Bottazzi M.E. Zhu X. Bohmer R.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and indeed we found that p21cip1 levels were almost undetectable 2 h after exposure of MEFs to cycloheximide (Fig. 4A). We then infected MEFs with an adenovirus expressing LacZ or DN-PKCδ, blocked protein synthesis with cycloheximide, and determined the stability of p21cip1 during the subsequent 2 h (Fig. 4B). In LacZ-infected MEFs, p21cip1 levels decayed with a half-life of ∼60 min. In contrast, p21cip1 levels remained nearly constant in cycloheximide-treated MEFs expressing DN-PKCδ for at least 120 min. A similar, although somewhat less pronounced, effect was detected after siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCδ (Fig. 4C). Thus, PKCδ destabilizes the p21cip1 protein in MEFs. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that the pronounced effect of DN-PKCδ on late G1 phase p21cip1 levels (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 2–4 and 6–8) was lost when the 20 S proteasome was inhibited with MG132 (Fig. 4D; compare lanes 9–11 and 12–14). PKC Stabilizes p21cip1 Independently of Skp2 and cyclin D1—Some studies have implicated the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFSkp2 in the degradation of p21cip1 (35Bornstein G. Bloom J. Sitry-Shevah D. Nakayama K. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25752-25757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We therefore treated MEFs with GF109203X or DN-PKCδ to assess the effect of PKC inhibition on Skp2 expression, the rate-limiting component of the SCFSkp2 complex. In some experiments, the expression of Skp2 was partially inhibited by GF109203X (Fig. 5A) or DN-PKCδ (not shown), whereas in other experiments, these treatments had no effect on Skp2 levels (not shown). However, even when these treatments caused a reduction in Skp2, the magnitude of the effect was insufficient to prevent the down-regulation of p27kip1 (Fig. 5A), the best established substrate of the SCFSkp2 complex. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of Skp2 did not affect the levels of p21cip1 during G1 phase progression in either control or GF109302X-treated MEFs (supplemental Fig. 1). We therefore conclude that the effect of PKC on p21cip1 half-life is independent of its effect on the expression of Skp2. Additionally, these data show that the effect of GF109203X and DN-PKCδ on p21cip1 levels are not due to a nonspecific inhibition of G1 phase progression, because p27kip1 down-regulates normally in these PKC-inhibited cells. Coleman et al. (36Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2036-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) propose that p21cip1 is stabilized by cyclin D1 in Ras-transformed cells, because cyclin D1 competes with the C8α subunit of the 20 S proteasome for binding to p21cip1. To determine whether cyclin D1 is required for the PKC-dependent destabilization of p21cip1, we transiently transfected MEFs with pSuper vectors encoding cyclin D1 RNA interference. We found that p21cip1 levels were slightly higher after knockdown of cyclin D1, suggesting that cyclin D1 expression was not stabilizing p21cip1 in this system. Additionally, p21cip1 was down-regulated with similar kinetics in both control and RNA interference-treated cells, and GF109203X inhibited the down-regulation of p21cip1 in both conditions (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that destabilization of p21cip1 by PKC is independent of cyclin D1. PKC-dependent S Phase Entry and Cell Proliferation in MEFs—We asked whether the effect of PKCδ on p21cip1 was functionally significant for S phase entry by infecting quiescent wild-type or p21cip1-null MEFs with control (LacZ or green fluorescent protein) adenoviruses or the DN-PKCδ adenovirus. The infected cells were serum-starved and then incubated with FBS in the presence of BrdUrd. DN-PKCδ inhibited S phase entry by ∼50% as compared with the infected controls (Fig. 6A). In contrast, DN-PKCδ was unable to inhibit S phase entry in p21cip1-null MEFs (Fig. 6A). Thus, the inhibitory effect of DN-PKCδ on S phase entry requires p21cip1. Consistent with its effect on S phase entry, DN-PKCδ inhibited the proliferation of MEFs (Fig. 6B), and the magnitude of the proliferative effect was in general agreement with the magnitude of the DN-PKCδ effect on S phase entry. The down-regulation of p21cip1 in late G1 phase is thought to contribute to the activation of cdk2 and entry into S phase. We now report that PKC is required for the post-transcriptional destabilization of p21cip1 protein in MEFs. S phase entry is reduced by inhibiting PKCδ, and this effect is lost in p21cip1-null MEFs. Thus, a major mitogenic effect of PKCδ appears to be its destabilizing effect on p21cip1 protein. Interestingly, similar results have also been reported for Rho (at least in Ras-transformed cells); inhibition of Rho destabilizes p21cip1 protein (18Adnane J. Bizouarn F.A. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6962-6970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Coleman M.L. Densham R.M. Croft D.R. Olson M.F. Oncogene. 2006; Google Scholar) and inhibits S phase entry in wild-type but not p21cip1-null fibroblasts (19Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Thus, the p21cip1 protein is the major cell cycle target for both Rho and PKCδ. However, the Rho effect is not selective for p21cip1 protein, as Rho inhibition also results in increased expression of p21cip1 mRNA (19Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The increased level of p21cip1 protein seen upon inhibition of PKCδ was dependent on the proteasome. Although one report linked the degradation of p21cip1 to ubiquitination by the SCFSkp2 complex (35Bornstein G. Bloom J. Sitry-Shevah D. Nakayama K. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25752-25757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), Sheaff et al. (12Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) showed that p21cip1 can be degraded by the proteasome, even when all of its lysines are mutated to arginines to prevent its ubiquitination. Additionally, the N terminus of p21cip1 appears to be acetylated in vivo, precluding its use as a site for attachment of ubiquitin (15Chen X. Chi Y. Bloecher A. Aebersold R. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we did not find a role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2 in the regulation of p21cip1 by PKCδ. Skp2 levels were slightly reduced by GF109203X or DN-PKCδ, but this effect is not likely to be functionally significant, because it was not accompanied by a change in the level of p27kip1, the major SCFSkp2 substrate. Additionally, the elevated levels of p21cip1 seen in PKCδ-inhibited cells were not affected by overexpression of Skp2. Several studies have identified kinases that phosphorylate p21cip1, although on different sites, and regulate its stability (37Li Y. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 41Kim G.Y. Mercer S.E. Ewton D.Z. Yan Z. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29792-29802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For example, Akt-dependent phosphorylation has been linked to the cytoplasmic retention and increased stability of p21cip1 (37Li Y. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 39Rossig L. Badorff C. Holzmann Y. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that PKC has the opposite effect, decreasing p21cip1 levels and enhancing S phase entry. One study reported that a 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK)-dependent activation of PKCζ leads to increased p21cip1 degradation (40Scott M.T. Ingram A. Ball K.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6771-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), as does PKCδ in our studies. However, PDK is not likely involved in our system, because direct inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (which should inhibit PDK activation) did not up-regulate p21cip1 in MEFs. Moreover, PKCζ is not targeted by GF109203X or the other approaches we used to inhibit PKC. Our data reveal specificity in the PKC isoform regulating p21cip1 stability; the effect is readily detected by inhibiting PKCδ but not by inhibiting PKCα. One difference between the two isoforms is that PKCδ can be tyrosine-phosphorylated by SFKs (42Steinberg S.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that SFK-dependent phosphorylation is not playing a role in regulating p21cip1 stability, because direct inhibition of SFKs did not mimic the effect of PKCδ inhibition and up-regulate p21cip1. Similarly, the ability of PKCδ to bind RasGRP3 and enhance ERK activity (43Brodie C. Steinhart R. Kazimirsky G. Rubinfeld H. Hyman T. Ayres J.N. Hur G.M. Toth A. Yang D. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is unlikely to underlie its effects on p21cip1 protein stability, because changes in ERK activity regulate p21cip1 mRNA levels in MEFs (16Bottazzi M.E. Zhu X. Bohmer R.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and p21cip1 mRNA levels are not strongly affected by inhibiting PKCδ. Another difference between PKCα and PKCδ is that the δ isoform has a much broader subcellular distribution, being detected in mitochondria and in the perinuclear region as well as in the cytosol and plasma membrane (32Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Han K.C. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 44Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have yet to determine whether redirecting PKCα to these noncanonical compartments would allow it to regulate p21cip1 stability. Unfortunately, detailed analysis of the pathway that mediates PKC-dependent p21cip1 stability is compromised by the fact that the mechanism of p21cip1 degradation is not yet established (see above). Although the results shown here indicate that PKCδ is responsible for the destabilization of p21cip1 and stimulation of S phase entry in MEFs, we have recently reported that PKC stimulates p21cip1 gene expression and inhibits S phase entry in transformed epithelial cells (28Nakagawa M. Oliva J.L. Kothapalli D. Fournier A. Assoian R.K. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33926-33934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In that study, we also observed that the PKC effect on p21cip1 was dependent on PKCδ and not PKCα. Thus, it appears that PKCδ can have two opposing effects in cells, it can increase the expression of p21cip1 mRNA, and it can destabilize p21cip1 protein. The final proliferative effect of PKCδ will therefore depend on how cells respond to an activated PKCδ signal. Interestingly, many of the studies showing the anti-mitogenic effect of PKC have been performed with transformed epithelial cell lines (see Introduction). It will be interesting to determine whether the distinct effects of PKCδ on p21cip1 reflect different cell lineages (mesenchymal versus epithelial) or the process of cellular transformation.

https://openalex.org/W1981184358,"Pantothenate synthetase catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of pantoate and β-alanine to yield pantothenate, the essential precursor to coenzyme A. Bacterial and plant pantothenate synthetases are dimeric enzymes that share significant sequence identity. Here we show that the two-step reaction mechanism of pantothenate synthetase is conserved between the enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Escherichia coli. Strikingly, though, the Arabidopsis enzyme exhibits large allosteric effects, whereas the Escherichia coli enzyme displays essentially non-allosteric behavior. Our data suggest that specific subunit contacts were selected and maintained in the plant lineage of the pantothenate synthetase protein family and that the resulting allosteric interactions are balanced for efficient catalysis at low pantoate levels. This is supported by mutations in the putative subunit interface of Arabidopsis pantothenate synthetase, which strongly attenuated or otherwise modified its allosteric properties but did not affect the dimeric state of the enzyme. At the molecular level, plant pantothenate synthetases exemplify functional adaptation through allostery and without alterations to the active site architecture. We propose that the allosteric behavior confers a selective advantage in the context of the subcellular compartmentation of pantothenate biosynthesis in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2108340136,"Nitrate transport activity of the LtnT permease of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is activated when LtnA, a response regulator without an effector domain, is phosphorylated by LtnB, a hybrid histidine kinase. We identified a protein (LtnC) that is required for activation of LtnT. LtnC consists of an N-terminal histidine-containing phosphoacceptor (HisKA) domain, a receiver domain, and a unique C-terminal domain found in some cyanobacterial proteins. Because LtnC lacks an ATP-binding kinase domain of a histidine kinase, it is incapable of autophosphorylation, but LtnC is phosphorylated by LtnA. The histidine residue in the HisKA domain but not the aspartate residue in the receiver domain is essential for phosphorylation of LtnC and activation of LtnT. LtnC phosphorylation leads to oligomerization of the protein. Fusion of the C-terminal domain of LtnC to glutathione S-transferase, which forms oligomers, also activates LtnT, suggesting that oligomerization of the LtnC C-terminal domain causes LtnT activation. These results indicate that the C-terminal domain of LtnC acts as an effector domain that directs the output of the signal from the phosphorelay system. The two-step (His-Asp-His) phosphorelay system, composed of the LtnB, LtnA, and LtnC proteins, is distinct from the known phosphorelay systems, namely, the typical two-component system (His-Asp) and the multistep phosphorelay system (His-Asp-His-Asp), because the HisKA domain of LtnC is the terminal phosphoacceptor that determines the signal output.

LtnC is a new class of signal transducer in His-Asp phosphorelay systems that contains a HisKA domain and an effector domain. To adapt to fluctuating environments, living organisms possess various mechanisms for monitoring environmental signals and regulating cellular activities to achieve optimal growth under new conditions. One of the main regulatory mechanisms for signal transduction in bacteria, yeast, and plants is the twocomponent system consisting of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator (1Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar, 3Varughese K.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sensor histidine kinases consist of an N-terminal domain that detects various stimuli, a histidine-containing phosphoacceptor domain (histidine kinase A domain or HisKA, 2The abbreviations used are: HisKA, histidine kinase A domain; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; CAP_ED, effector domain of the cAMP receptor protein family; CmR, chloramphenicol-resistant; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HATPase, histidine kinase ATPase; HODR, high order oligomerization-dependent regulatory; HPt, histidine-containing phosphotransfer; NRT, nitrate transport system; ORF, open reading frame; REC, receiver. NCBI accession number cd00082), and an ATP-binding kinase domain (histidine kinase ATPase or HAT-Pase, NCBI accession number cd00075). The conserved histidine residue of the HisKA domain is autophosphorylated by the HATPase domain. Most of the response regulators consist of an N-terminal receiver domain (REC, NCBI accession number cd00156) and an effector domain. The conserved aspartate residue of the REC domain receives the phosphoryl group from the histidine residue of the HisKA domain of the sensor histidine kinase, and this phosphorylation regulates the activity of the C-terminal effector domain. Most response regulators have a DNA-binding effector domain and function as transcription factors, although some lack effector domains, and a few have effector domains with enzymatic activity. To date, two types of His-Asp phosphorelay system, namely, the typical or classic two-component system described above and the multistep phosphorelay system, have been demonstrated. The typical two-component system mediates a single phosphotransfer reaction (His-Asp) from the HisKA domain of the sensor histidine kinase to the REC domain of the response regulator (e.g. Ref. 4Mizuno T. Mizushima S. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 5A). In contrast, the multistep phosphorelay system additionally requires both an intermediate REC domain and a histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) domain. This system catalyzes three phosphotransfer reactions (His-Asp-His-Asp) between a HisKA domain of the sensor histidine kinase, the intermediate REC domain, the HPt domain, and the REC domain of the terminal response regulator in this order (e.g. Ref. 5Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 5B). In both systems, the REC domain of a response regulator is the terminal acceptor of the phosphoryl group, and the phosphorylated response regulators act as molecular switches to certain cellular events by regulating the activity of their C-terminal effector domains. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has an ATP-binding cassette-type (ABC-type) nitrate transport system (NRT) encoded by the four genes, nrtA,-B,-C, and -D (6Omata T. Ohmori M. Arai N. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6612-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Omata T. Andriesse X. Hirano A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The NA3 mutant, which is constructed by deleting the nrtA,-B, -C, and -D genes, lacks NRT activity and is unable to grow in low concentrations of nitrate (<5mm) (9Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Genetic characterization of a pseudorevertant of NA3 (NA3R) capable of uptake of low concentrations of nitrate identified a sulfate permeaselike protein (LtnT) having latent nitrate transport activity and whose C-terminal domain inhibits the transport activity (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of this permease, whose affinity for nitrate is much lower than that of ABC-type NRT, remains to be elucidated, the presence of a novel mechanism for regulation of the permease was revealed by the characterization of NA3R. A two-component system involving a hybrid sensor histidine kinase with two REC domains (LtnB) and a response regulator with no effector domain (LtnA) is required to activate the LtnT permease (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments using recombinant LtnA and LtnB proteins showed that autophosphorylated LtnB transfers the phosphoryl group from its HisKA domain to the Asp52 residue in the REC domain of LtnA. Overexpression of LtnA in NA3, but not an LtnA derivative carrying an Asp to Glu amino acid substitution at the phosphorylation site, conferred on the mutant the ability to assimilate nitrate, showing that phosphorylation of LtnA by LtnB alleviates the inhibitory effect of the LtnT C-terminal domain on transport activity. Because the NA3R pseudorevertant has a nonsense mutation, which results in expression of a truncated LtnB protein with no REC domain, it was deduced that the role of the LtnB REC domains is to interfere with the signal transmission to LtnA by quenching the phosphorylation signal in the HisKA domain (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified and characterized a previously unidentified component (LtnC) of this signal transduction system. LtnC consists of the N-terminal HisKA domain, the central REC domain, and the C-terminal domain of a unique amino acid sequence. Our data show that LtnC receives the phosphoryl group of LtnA at the histidine residue in its HisKA domain. Phosphorylation of the protein promotes oligomerization of LtnC, which in turn activates the LtnT activity. The aspartate residue in the REC domain of LtnC is not required for activation of LtnT, indicating that the histidine residue in the HisKA domain acts as the terminal phosphoacceptor that directs transmission of the signal from LtnC to downstream components of the pathway.

The basal medium used was a nitrogen-free medium obtained by modification of the BG11 medium (12Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (13Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2688-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ammonium-containing medium was prepared by adding 3.75 mm (NH4)2SO4 to the basal medium. Nitrate-containing medium was prepared by adding KNO3 at indicated concentrations to the basal medium. Solid medium was prepared by adding 1.5% Bacto Agar (Difco) to the liquid medium. All media were buffered with 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.2). When appropriate, kanamycin (25 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) or both was added to the media.

Szalay A.A. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 24: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DNA fragments that contained complete or partial sequences of the target open reading frames (ORFs) of Synechococcus were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEM-T Vector (Promega Corp.). A chloramphenicol-resistant (CmR) marker (15Dzelzkalns V.A. Owens G.C. Bogorad L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8917-8925Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was subsequently inserted at a suitable restriction site in each of the ORFs in the same orientation as the ORFs. The resulting plasmids were used to transform of Synechococcus to chloramphenicol resistance through homologous recombination. The transformants were allowed to grow on solid medium supplemented with chloramphenicol. After serial streak purifications to promote segregation of alleles and to isolate homozygous mutants, genomic DNA from selected clones was analyzed by PCR to confirm the presence and position of the CmR marker. Expression of Plasmid-encoded Proteins in Synechococcus—A shuttle expression vector (pSE1) (9Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used to express cloned genes in Synechococcus. The coding regions of ltnC and ltnD were amplified from the Synechococcus chromosomal DNA by PCR. The 5′ primers carried mismatches with the genomic sequence, which created a BspHI recognition site at the translation start site without changing the encoded amino acid sequence, and the 3′ primers carried a BglII or a BamHI recognition sequence immediately downstream of the termination codon. Two ltnC derivatives were generated by overlap extension PCR (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar): one had CAT-to-GAG base substitutions at nucleotides 46-48 that change the histidine residue at position 16 to a Glu residue (H16E), and the other had a G-to-A base substitution at nucleotide 667 that changes the Asp residue at position 223 to an Asn residue (D223N). To express the C-terminal portion of the LtnC and LtnD proteins, the relevant regions of ltnC and ltnD were amplified by PCR using 5′ primers carrying mismatches with the genomic sequence to create an NcoI recognition site, which provides the initiation codon, at nucleotide position 898 of ltnC and 532 of ltnD. The PCR-amplified ltnC, ltnD, and their derivatives were digested with a combination of BspHI and BglII, BspHI and BamHI, NcoI and BglII, or NcoI and BamHI and cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pSE1. To express the translational fusions of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the C-terminal region of LtnC and LtnD, a shuttle expression vector (pSE1GST) was constructed from the pSE1 vector as follows. The GST coding sequence corresponding to amino acids 1-225 of GST of Schistosoma japonicum was amplified by PCR with the plasmid DNA of pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). For cloning, the 5′ primer carried mismatches with the GST sequence, which created a BspHI recognition site at the translation start site without changing the encoded amino acid sequence, and the 3′ primer carried an NcoI recognition sequence. The PCR-amplified GST gene was cloned into the NcoI site of pSE1 after digestion with BspHI and NcoI. The 3′ region of the ltnC and ltnD genes amplified by PCR as described above was digested with a combination of NcoI and BglII or NcoI and BamHI and cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pSE1GST. The resulting plasmids were introduced into the Synechococcus cells after verification of the nucleotide sequence. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) was used to overexpress LtnC and its derivatives as His-tagged proteins. The coding sequences of the ltnC gene and its derivatives encoding LtnC(H16E) and LtnC(D223N) were prepared essentially as described above, except that the 5′ primers used for PCR carried mismatches with the genomic sequence to create a BglII recognition sequence immediately upstream of the translation start codon. The PCR products were digested with BglII and cloned into the BamHI site of pQE30. After verification of the nucleotide sequence, the resulting plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli M15 (pREP4) (Qiagen), and His-tagged proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. To overexpress GST and its fusion with the C-terminal region of LtnC, the pSE1GST plasmid and its derivative carrying the 3′ region of ltnC were transformed into E. coli JM105, expression of the encoded proteins was induced by 50 μm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose resin. To coexpress LtnA, the histidine kinase domain of LtnB (amino acids 408-735) and LtnC in E. coli, transcriptional fusion of the ltnA gene and the truncated ltnB gene was constructed by overlap extension PCR (17Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested with a combination of BspHI and XbaI and cloned between the NcoI and XbaI sites of pSE1. The resulting plasmid and the pQE30 derivative carrying ltnC (see above) were cotransformed into E. coli JM105. Expression of the protein was induced with 50 μm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the His-tagged LtnC protein coexpressed with the untagged LtnA and LtnB proteins was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Phosphotransfer Experiment—Purified proteins were incubated in 15 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol supplemented with 0.05 mm [γ-32P]ATP (200 TBq/mmol), according to the protocol of Aiba et al. (18Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8563-8567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of SDS buffer containing 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 60% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. The samples were subjected to 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and the 32P-labeled signals were detected using a Bio-image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). Gel-filtration Chromatography—Purified proteins were concentrated by an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and fractionated on a prepacked HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and eluted fractions were collected as 2 ml/fraction. The column was size-calibrated with ferritin, catalase, aldolase, bovine serum albumin, chymotrypsinogen A, and cytochrome c. Other Methods—Chromosomal DNA was extracted from Synechococcus cells and purified as described by Williams (19Williams J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Manipulations and analyses of DNA were performed according to standard protocols. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).

Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we identified three genes (ltnA, ltnB, and ltnT) required for nitrate transport by the NA3R mutant, a pseudorevertant of the NA3 mutant of S. elongatus lacking the ABC-type NRT. Downstream of the ltnA and -B genes involved in activation of the permease encoded by ltnT are two ORFs syc2279_d and syc2280_d, which are oriented in the same direction as ltnAB and which overlap with the upstream genes by 8 and 77 bases, respectively (Fig. 1). syc2279_d encodes a protein of 411 amino acids, which is similar to hybrid histidine kinase and carries a HisKA domain in the N-terminal region and a REC domain in the central region, although it lacks an HATPase domain. syc2280_d encodes a protein of 271 amino acids and has an effector domain of the cAMP receptor protein family (CAP_ED domain, NCBI accession number cd00038) in the N-terminal region. The C-terminal regions of Syc2279_d and Syc2280_d are 47% identical, but they do not belong to known domains proposed in the conserved domain data base of NCBI, and their function is unknown. To characterize the syc2279_d and syc2280_d genes, we inactivated them by inserting a CmR cassette in the NA3R pseudorevertant (Fig. 1) and compared the growth of the resulting mutants with that of the wild-type strain, the NRT-deficient mutant (NA3), the NA3R pseudorevertant, and the previously constructed NA3R derivatives (Fig. 2, strains a-g). The wildtype strain grew equally well on ammoniumor nitrate-containing medium (a). The NA3 mutant grew as well as the wildtype strain on ammonium-containing medium but hardly grew on a medium containing nitrate and showed yellow color because of reduced pigmentation (b), as described previously (9Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NA3R cells grew as well as the wild-type strain on plates containing nitrate (c), but interruption of ltnA or ltnB in NA3R abolished the ability to grow on nitrate (d and e), as described previously (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Interruption of syc2279_d but not syc2280_d in NA3R abolished the ability to grow on nitrate (f and g), indicating that syc2279_d but not syc2280_d was required for the LtnTdependent nitrate transport activity of NA3R. syc2279_d was named ltnC.FIGURE 2Growth test showing the effects of interrupting the ltn genes in the NA3R pseudorevertant and the effects of expressing the Ltn proteins and their derivatives in the Synechococcus mutants on the expression of nitrate transport activity. Synechococcus cells (n = 105) were spotted on solid medium containing ammonium (7.5 mm) or nitrate (5 mm) as nitrogen sources and incubated under illumination for 4 days. Where indicated, isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mm) was added to overexpress the proteins from the plasmid-borne genes. WT, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Structure-Function Relationship of LtnC—To study the structure-function relationship of LtnC in activating LtnT, we used the pSE1 shuttle expression vector (9Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) to introduce the ltnC gene and its derivatives into the NA3R derivative carrying insertionally inactivated ltnC and examined the growth of the resulting transformants (Fig. 2). Expression of the LtnC protein and its derivative, whose Asp223 residue in the REC domain had been replaced with Asn, supported cell growth on plates containing 5 mm nitrate (i and k). In contrast, expression of an LtnC derivative whose His16 residue in the HisKA domain had been replaced with Glu did not support cell growth on 5 mm nitrate (j). These results indicate that the His16 residue in the HisKA domain of LtnC is required for activation of the LtnT permease but that the Asp223 residue in the REC domain of LtnC is not. Phosphotransfer from LtnA to LtnC—To examine whether phosphotransfer occurs from LtnA to LtnC, LtnA and two soluble forms of LtnB, one (LtnB-(408-977)) lacking the N-terminal stimulus-detection domain and the other (LtnB-(408-735)) lacking both the N-terminal stimulus-detection domain and the C-terminal region carrying the two REC domains, were expressed as His-tagged proteins in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3), as reported previously (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). LtnC, LtnC(H16E), and LtnC(D223N) were also expressed as His-tagged proteins in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6). When incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 0.05 mm [γ-32P]ATP, LtnB-(408-977) and LtnB-(408-735) were radiolabeled (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 8), as reported previously (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but LtnC was not (Fig. 3B, lane 1), indicating that LtnC is not capable of autophosphorylation. The radiolabel in the LtnB derivatives did not decrease when LtnC was incubated with LtnB-(408-977) or LtnB-(408-735) (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 9), indicating that the phosphoryl group was not transferred to LtnC from either the HisKA domain or the REC domains of LtnB. When LtnA was incubated with the LtnB derivatives, the radiolabel in the LtnB derivatives decreased due to the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the LtnA protein (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 10), as reported previously (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of LtnC was observed when LtnC was incubated with LtnA and the LtnB derivatives (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 11), indicating that the phosphoryl group of LtnA was transferred to LtnC. LtnC(D223N) received the phosphoryl group from LtnA (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 13), but LtnC(H16E) was not radiolabeled (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 12), indicating that His16 of the HisKA domain but not Asp223 of the REC domain acts as the phosphoacceptor site of the LtnC protein. When radiolabeled, the 32P signal was stronger in LtnC than in LtnA (Fig. 3B, lanes 4-5 and 10-11), indicating that the phosphoryl group of the HisKA domain of LtnC is more stable than that of the REC domain of LtnA. Adding LtnC(H16E) to the reaction mixture, including LtnA, LtnB, and [γ-32P]ATP increased the 32P signal of LtnA (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 12), indicating that LtnC(H16E) inhibits the dephosphorylation of LtnA. This suggests that LtnC(H16E) interacts with LtnA even though it cannot receive the phosphoryl group and that His16 of the HisKA domain is not required for the interaction of LtnC with LtnA. Promotion of LtnC Oligomerization by Phosphorylation—To investigate the roles of the C-terminal region of the LtnC protein, ltnC and its derivatives were introduced into the S. elongatus NA3 mutant using the shuttle expression vectors pSE1 and pSE1GST. The LtnT activity is latent in NA3, because LtnA is not phosphorylated by LtnB. The pSE1GST vector was used to express a protein as a fusion to GST, which mediates dimer formation. The ability of the resulting transformants to grow on nitrate was examined (Fig. 2). Whereas expression of the genes encoding full-length LtnC or the C-terminal region of LtnC lacking the HisKA and REC domains did not confer the ability to grow on agar plates containing 5 mm nitrate on NA3 (Fig. 2, n and o), expression of the translational fusion of the C-terminal region of LtnC to GST supported cell growth on nitrate (Fig. 2, p). Expression of GST alone did not support nitrate utilization (Fig. 2, m). These results suggest that the transport activity of the LtnT permease is activated by dimerization of the C-terminal region of LtnC. However, gel-filtration chromatography analysis (Fig. 4) showed that the His-tagged LtnC protein, which has a calculated molecular mass of 47,844 Da, was eluted in a peak corresponding to a calibrated molecular mass of 100 kDa (Fig. 4A, open square), indicating that unphosphorylated LtnC is in a dimeric form. The GST protein, which has a calculated molecular mass of 27,795 Da, was eluted in a peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig. 4A, open circle), confirming that GST is in a dimeric form, as reported previously (20Clapper M.L. Hoffman S.J. Tew K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fusion of the C-terminal region of LtnC and GST, having a calculated molecular mass of 39,279 Da, was eluted in a broad peak corresponding to a molecular mass range of >230 kDa (Fig. 4A, closed circle), indicating that the fused protein forms hexamer and higher order oligomers. These results indicate that dimerization of LtnC is not sufficient for activation of LtnT and that higher order oligomerization of the protein is required. To examine whether phosphorylation of LtnC causes high order oligomerization of the protein, His-tagged LtnC protein was coexpressed with untagged LtnA and LtnB-(408-735) proteins in E. coli cells, purified to homogeneity, and subjected to gelfiltration chromatography. The purified His-tagged LtnC was eluted in two peaks (Fig. 4A, closed square), one of which corresponded to a molecular mass range of >400 kDa but was not observed when LtnC alone was expressed in E. coli (Fig. 4A, open square). These results show that phosphorylation of LtnC results in the formation of octamer or higher order oligomers. The results also suggest that LtnT permease is activated by formation of high order oligomers of the C-terminal region of LtnC in the cell. Identification of the ltnD Gene—Although Syc2280_d is dispensable for manifestation of the LtnT activity in NA3R (discussed above), its C-terminal region is 47% identical to the C-terminal region of LtnC, suggesting that the protein may activate LtnT under certain circumstances. Expression of the full-length Syc2280_d protein or the C-terminal region of Syc2280_d did not confer on NA3 the ability to grow on nitrate (Fig. 2, q and r). However, expression of the fusion of the C-terminal region of Syc2280_d to GST supported cell growth on plates containing 5 mm nitrate (Fig. 2, s). These results suggest that the C-terminal region of Syc2280_d, which is similar to the corresponding region of LtnC, can activate the LtnT permease upon formation of high order oligomers. Thus, we named syc2280_d ltnD, although it is currently unknown when and how the protein forms oligomers in vivo. By characterizing the NA3R mutant of S. elongatus, in which a nitrate transport system distinct from the ABC-type NRT is activated, we previously identified two regulatory genes (ltnA and ltnB) required for activation of the permease encoded by the ltnT gene (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ltnB encodes a hybrid histidine kinase and ltnA encodes a response regulator with no effector domain. Phosphotransfer from LtnB to LtnA is essential for activation of the LtnT permease (10Maeda S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5869-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the next step of this signal transduction pathway was unknown. In the present study, we identified the third component of this phosphorelay system, which is encoded by the gene (ltnC) located downstream of the ltnA and ltnB genes (Fig. 1). LtnC contains a HisKA domain and a REC domain, but because it lacks an HATPase domain, the protein is incapable of autophosphorylation (Fig. 3, lane 1). LtnC is nevertheless capable of accepting the phosphoryl group from LtnA (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 11), showing that it comprises a phosphorelay system with LtnB and LtnA. Analyses including site-specific amino acid substitution in LtnC showed that the His16 residue in the HisKA domain is essential for phosphorylation of LtnC in vitro (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 12) and activation of LtnT in vivo (Fig. 2, i and j). HPt domains are known to mediate signal transmission in multistep (His-Asp-His-Asp) phosphorelay systems. By contrast, the HisKA domain of LtnC seems to be the first example of this type of His-containing domain that accepts a phosphoryl group from a REC domain. Another unique feature of LtnC is that its C-terminal region acts as a molecular switch that activates the LtnT permease upon formation of high order oligomers (discussed below). Although LtnC has a REC domain, Asp223 in the REC domain is not required for acceptance of a phosphoryl group from LtnA in vitro or activation of LtnT in vivo. These findings indicate that the phosphorylation of the HisKA domain triggers signal output from the phosphorelay system. The role of the LtnC REC domain is unknown. It may dephosphorylate the HisKA domain to modulate the activity of LtnC in signaling. In the conventional His-Asp phosphorelay systems, namely, a typical two-component system (Fig. 5A) and a multistep phosphorelay system (Fig. 5B), response regulators, whose aspartate residues of the REC domains are terminal phosphoacceptors, act as molecular switches to certain cellular events. Thus, the LtnB, LtnA, and LtnC proteins comprise a newly described two-step (His-Asp-His) phosphorelay system that terminates with a “HisKA-containing regulator” carrying an effector domain (Fig. 5C). The NCBI conserved domain search program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) shows 203 proteins that have a HisKA domain but lack an HATPase domain in addition to LtnC. Among these, 37 lack the conserved histidine residue of the HisKA domains and hence would not receive a phosphoryl group. Eight of the others consist only of the HisKA domain and may function as intermediate phosphotransfer molecules like HPt proteins. The remaining 158 proteins, found in the genomes of 4 archaea, 101 bacteria, and 2 eukaryotes, may include HisKA-containing regulators (supplementary Fig. S1). However, only two of these proteins have known effector domains. One, from Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA 1090, has a predicted permease domain (COG0730), a sigma-54 interaction domain (pfam00158), and a Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) domain (HTH_8; pfam02954) (Fig. 6). Downstream of the gene encoding this protein is the pivNG gene encoding a sitespecific recombinase (21Carrick C.S. Fyfe J.A. Davies J.K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 220: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting possible involvement of the HisKA-containing protein in DNA rearrangements. The other putative HisKA-containing regulator, from Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110, has a REC domain and an adenylate cyclase catalytic domain (CyaA; COG2114) (Fig. 6), but its function remains to be identified. As in the case of LtnC, other HisKA-containing proteins might have uncharacterized effector domains. Because these proteins have no known sequence signatures for DNA binding, they would function as post-translational regulators rather than as transcriptional regulators. It should be noted that 61 of these HisKA-containing proteins have putative signal-accepting domain(s), such as GAF (pfam01590) (22Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), HAMP (smart00304) (23Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PAS (pfam00989) (24Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R674-R677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PAC (C-terminal to a subsets of PAS domains; pfam00785), REC, and the predicted periplasmic ligand-binding sensor (COG3452) domains (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that they also accept signal(s) other than HisKA phosphorylation that comprise complex signal-transduction mechanisms. The C-terminal portion of LtnC activates LtnT when expressed as a fusion protein with GST in the S. elongatus NA3 mutant (Fig. 2, p). Because expression of GST does not activate LtnT in NA3 (Fig. 2, m), we conclude that the C-terminal portion of LtnC acts as the effector domain that activates LtnT permease. However, expressing the domain alone in NA3 failed to activate LtnT (Fig. 2, o). Because the effector domain formed insoluble material when expressed in E. coli, 3S.-i. Maeda, unpublished results. we infer that the fusion to GST contributes to stabilizing the LtnC effector domain in NA3 cells. Whereas GST by itself forms a dimer in solution (Ref. 20Clapper M.L. Hoffman S.J. Tew K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 4A), the fusion of the LtnC effector domain to GST forms hexamer or higher order oligomers (Fig. 4A), indicating that the LtnC effector domain can promote the formation of the high order oligomers. However, LtnC is in a dimeric structure when expressed in E. coli, and the oligomers are formed when coexpressed with LtnB and LtnA in E. coli cells (Fig. 4A). These observations and the known ability of the HisKA domain to mediate dimer formation (25Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) suggest that LtnC dimer is formed by the interaction between the HisKA domains of two unphosphorylated LtnC molecules and, in these conditions, that the ability of the effector domain to promote oligomerization is inhibited. Phosphorylation of the HisKA domain presumably causes conformational change in LtnC to allow its C-terminal domain to promote oligomer formation. Because phosphorylation of the HisKA domain of LtnC is essential for activation of LtnT in vivo (Fig. 2, i and j), we conclude that phosphorylation-induced oligomerization of the effector domain somehow triggers activation of LtnT. We therefore define the effector domain of LtnC as a “high order oligomerization-dependent regulatory (HODR)” domain. The gene located downstream of ltnC, which we named ltnD, encodes a protein whose C-terminal portion can activate LtnT when expressed as a fusion to GST (Fig. 2, s). Because the C-terminal portion of this protein and the LtnC effector domain are 47% identical in amino acid sequence (Fig. 7A), it seems reasonable to suppose that the C-terminal domain of LtnD is the second member of HODR domains, although oligomer formation remains to be verified experimentally. Because the N-terminal portion of the LtnD protein comprises a CAP_ED domain, this domain seems to accept an as-yet unidentified signal to promote oligomerization of the protein to activate the LtnT permease. It is currently unknown whether the oligomerized HODR domains interact with LtnT or whether one or more additional signaling proteins are involved in activation of LtnT. Further study is required to clarify the molecular mechanism of LtnT activation. Proteins containing HODR-like sequences are found only in proteins from cyanobacteria Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (Tll2374), Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501 (Cwat_3664), Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (All2034), Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 (Ava_1137), and Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (Npun02006412, Npun02004888, and Npun02006607) with the exception of Methylococcus capsulatus str. Bath (MCA0452) (Fig. 7A). In all cases, the putative HODR domains are located in the C-terminal region of the respective protein (Fig. 7B). All of these proteins except for Cwat_3664 contain putative signal-accepting domain(s), such as HAMP, PAS, Cache (pfam02743) (26Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 535-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and COG4192 (Fig. 7B). Thus, these proteins are likely to be involved in signal-transduction mechanisms in which their reception of a specific signal initiates the formation of high order oligomers to regulate certain cellular processes.
