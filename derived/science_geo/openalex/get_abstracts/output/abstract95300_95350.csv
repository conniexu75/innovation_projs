https://openalex.org/W2034299466,"The site of plasminogen activator release by differentiated neuroblastoma clonal cell lines was determined with a fibrin overlay assay. Release of plasminogen activator was seen at the growth cone in 72 percent of the cells bearing neurites. For 21 percent of these cells the growth cone was the predominant or exclusive site of this enzyme activity. Selective release of protease at the ""trailblazing"" tip of the neurite may be important in neuron migration and neurite growth in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2082192837,"Abstract PC12, an NGF responsive cell line, exhibits two classes of NGF receptors which we designate and Slow. Fast receptors, accounting for 75% of specific NGF binding, are distinguished by their rapid rates for association and dissociation of 125 I-NGF. At 37°C, binding of 125 I-NGF to Fast receptors is 5-fold more rapid than to Slow receptors and dissociation of 125 I-NGF from Fast receptors is 40-fold more rapid than from Slow receptors. No evidence was obtained for a ligand-induced conversion of receptors from Fast to Slow characteristics. Scatchard analysis of binding experiments indicates that PC12 cells possess 60,000 specific receptors for NGF of which 15,000 are of the Slow class. Despite having very different kinetic constants, Slow and Fast receptors have similar equilibrium binding constants (about 2 × 10 −10 M) due to cancelling effects of differing association and dissociation rates. Brief digestion of PC12 cells with trypsin before addition of NGF inactivates essentially all Fast receptors without significantly affecting Slow receptors. Therefore Fast and Slow classes of receptors must exist prior to addition of NGF, and the observed receptor heterogeneity is not due to ligand-induced changes. 125 I-NGF bound to Slow receptors is preferentially associated with preparations of Triton X-100 insoluble cytoskeletons, while 125 I-NGF bound to Fast receptors is solubilized by this procedure. Cytoskeletally associated NGF is almost exclusively associated with the extranuclear cytoskeletal matrix rather than with the nucleus itself. Preparation of nuclei by various methods suggests that the presence of contaminating cytoskeletal elements should be considered in evaluating the existence of translocation and binding of NGF to the nucleus. Inhibition of endocytotic internalization of NGF either by lowering of temperature to O°C or by preincubation of cells with sodium azide in medium lacking glucose does not reduce the slowly released component of bound NGF, nor alter its cytoskeletal association. The possible functional roles of Slow and cytoskeletal receptors are discussed."

R5020 effectively induced oocyte maturation with half-maximal response at a concentration of 1.4 X 10(-6) M. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of plasma membranes following photolysis with tritiated R5020 resulted in the identification of a single labeled protein with a Mr = 110,000. The specificity of this steroid receptor interaction for R5020 was demonstrated by the competitive inhibition of R5020 photolabeling with nonradioactive R5020 and the lack of inhibition by 17 beta-estradiol. Covalent labeling of the 110,000-dalton protein was saturable with both time of photolysis and concentration of R5020 with the maximum number of photolabeled binding sites equal to 0.7 pmol/oocyte, and kinetic analysis of the photolabeling of the 110,000-dalton receptor protein yielded an apparent KD of 1 X 10(-6) M R5020. Progesterone had a biphasic effect on the kinetics of photolabeling with concentrations of progesterone below 5 microM increasing photolabeling by elevating Vmax up to 5-fold and higher concentrations of progesterone reducing the rate of photolabeling. Membrane-associated adenylate cyclase measured in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate was inhibited up to 70% after photolysis with [3H]R5020. Inhibition was proportional to the level of [3H]R5020 covalently bound to the 110,000-dalton protein, and significant inhibition was observed at 1 X 10(-6) M R5020."

https://openalex.org/W2077756177,"The effects of long- and short-term administration of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine on intracranial self-stimulation in rats were studied with electrodes in the A10 region of the dopamine-containing cell bodies of the ventromedial tegmentum. Long-term desipramine administration resulted in a significant shift to the left in the ascending portion of the rate--current intensity function, indicating that the activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system was enhanced. These findings point to a possible dopaminergic mechanism of action of antidepressants and support speculations concerning the role of dopamine-containing neurons in the pathophysiology of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2079822589,"The genomic DNAs of most organisms contain modified bases. In vertebrates, 5-methyl-cytosine (“C) is the only modified base; it results from enzymatic transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-methionine to cytosine residues in DNA. Most but not all “C occurs in the dinucleotide 5’-CpG, and in mammals and birds approximately 50-70% of all such dinucleotides are modified. Considerable interest in DNA methylation has been created by increasing evidence linking methylation patterns to patterns of gene expression; this subject has been recently reviewed elsewhere (Razin and Riggs, Science 270, 604-610, 1980). The actual distribution of “C within specific genes can be probed with the use of bacterial restriction endonucleases, such as Hpa II and Hha I, that will not cleave recognition sequences containing “CpG. Tissue-specific differences in methylation patterns have been noted (Waalwijk and Flavell. NAR 5, 46314641, 1978; Mandel and Chambon, NAR 7, 20812103, 1979; McGhee and Ginder, Nature 280, 419420, 1979; van der Ploeg and Flavell, Cell 19, 947958, 1980) and strong correlations exist between methylation and transcriptional inactivity of integrated viral genomes (Desrosiers et al., PNAS 76, 38393843, 1979; Cohen, Cell 19, 653-662, 1980; Sutter and Doerfler, PNAS 77, 253-256, 1980). Experiments with DNA-mediated gene transfer have suggested a causal link between methylation and inhibition of gene expression (Pollack et al., PNAS 77, 6463-6467, 1980; Wigler et al., Cell 24, 33-40, 1981). Recent experiments involving oocyte microinjection and in vitro transcription with DNA molecules methylated in vitro also confirm this conclusion (recently reported at the 1981 Annual Genetics Meeting in Koln, Germany). Agents that can disrupt DNA methylation in vivo can cause diverse effects such as alterations in the pathway of differentiation and reactivation of genes residing in the inactive X chromosome (Taylor and Jones, Cell 7 7, 771-779, 1979; Mohandas et al., Science 27 7, 393-396, 1981). If, in fact, methylation can modulate gene expression, it is important to understand the factors that determine methylation patterns in the cells of vertebrate organisms. It was hypothesized that a methylation pattern, once established in somatic cells, could become inherited in progeny cells (Holiday and Pugh, Science 787, 226-232, 1975; Riggs, Cytogen. Cell Gen. 14, 9-25, 1975). Because the CpG dinucleotide, which bears most of the vertebrate methylation, is a simple palindrome, methylation on one strand could direct the methylation on a newly replicated strand through the action of a “maintenance” methylase that recognizes only hemimethylated sites. In this manner, the organism would have at least one mechanism for the stable somatic inheritance of methylation patterns. Such phenomena as maintenance of X chromosome inactivation and the stability of the differentiated phenotype could be explained in this way. In recent years, evidence has been obtained in favor of this model. Bird (JMB 7 78, 49-60, 1978) studied the distribution of methylation in the ribosomal genes of Xenopus laevis red blood cells. These genes exist in a highly methylated state. They are virtually resistant to digestion with Hpa II, although a few unmethylated Hpa II sites are randomly distributed within these genes. The sensitivity to Hpa II digestion of denatured and reannealed ribosomal genes indicated that virtually all methylated sites were symmetrically methylated, thus suggesting the action of a maintenance methylase of the type postulated above. The amplified ribosomal genes of Xenopus, however, are not methylated (Dawid et al., JMB 57, 341-360, 1970; Bird and Southern, JMB 7 18, 27-47, 1978) which suggests that the specificity for methylation does not reside in the DNA sequence immediately flanking a potential site. Similarly, the endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus sequences are heavily methylated but the integrated sequences arising by horizontal infection are not methylated (Cohen, lot. cit.). Finally, direct evidence for the passive maintenance of methylation patterns comes from two recent studies that have utilized the techniques of DNA-mediated transformation in cultured mouse cells (Pollack et al., lot. cit.; Wigler et al., lot. cit.). DNA molecules were methylated in vitro with the bacterial modification enzyme M-Hpa II, which methylates the internal cyto-"
https://openalex.org/W1597345807,"The cross-reactivity of progestins for glucocorticoid receptors was exploited to photoaffinity label glucocorticoid receptors from cultured rat hepatoma (HTC) and mouse lymphoma (S49) cell cytosol. The synthetic progestin, 17 alpha, 21-dimethyl-19-nor-pregna-4,9-diene-3,20-dione (R5020), rapidly forms covalent bonds with protein upon irradiation of either cytosol with 350 nm light. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions reveals a single band photolabeled by R5020 that is not observed when excess nonradioactive dexamethasone is included in the incubation. This protein band corresponds to a molecular weight of about 87,000 in both HTC and S49 cell cytosol; it is entirely absent in cytosol from glucocorticoid-resistant S49(r-) cells which lack receptor-binding activity. Another steroid-resistant mutant, S49 (nti), which exhibits normal levels of steroid-binding activity but increased binding of receptor-steroid complexes by the nucleus, yields a receptor which, when photolabeled, has an apparent molecular weight of only 39,000. These results demonstrate that glucocorticoid receptors can be photoaffinity-labeled; the data are consistent with the notion that the binding form of the receptor consists of a single polypeptide chain, Mr = 87,000, in two different species, rat and mouse, and in cells of either hepatic or lymphoid origin. The data also suggest that the lesion in the steroid-resistant S49 (nti) lymphoma cell line is a mutation of the structural gene for the glucocorticoid receptor which results in the synthesis of a truncated protein."
https://openalex.org/W1970784200,"The association of controlled extracellular proteolysis, mediated by plasminogen activator, with embryonic tissue remodeling and cell migration was studied in the developing bursa of Fabricius of quail and chick embryos. We found: that the specific activity of plasminogen activator in the bursa changes as a function of developmental age; that these changes are correlated temporally with the migration of hemopoietic cells into the bursal rudiment and with the period of extensive remodeling in the bursal epithelium; that the enzyme is distributed asymmetrically in the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the bursa. Chick and quail plasminogen activators can be distinguished by differences in their rates of electrophoretic migration. When interspecific grafts between quail and chick embryos were analyzed in this way, we observed that hemopoietic precursor cells produce plasminogen activator during their colonization of the bursa."

https://openalex.org/W2057579455,"RNA transcripts complementary to a genomic histone repeat are found in high concentration in sea urchin egg pronuclei. In situ hybridizations with the recombinant plasmid pCO2 indicate that the nuclear concentration is at least 25 to 50 fold higher than that in the cytoplasm. If nuclear transcripts are predominantly histone mRNAs, they comprise about 12% of the histone mRNA in eggs, or about 0.36 pg. After fertilization these molecules persist through pronuclear fusion but disappear from nuclei by mid 2-cell stage. A similar high nuclear concentration is not observed for polyadenylated mRNAs. The high steady-state concentration of nuclear histone repeat transcripts suggests that they have an unusually long lifetime in pronuclei of unfertilized sea urchin eggs."

https://openalex.org/W2007223204,"Actin in transformed sarcoma 180 cells is composed of the nonmuscle β and γ species and of a third, more acidic stable variant termed ζ. Two-dimensional peptide analysis shows that ζ is similar to β actin, differing in the mobility of only one tryptic peptide. Several lines of evidence indicate that ζ is not a modified β-actin species. This third actin species comprises 20% of the total labeled actin, has the same molecular weight as the β and γ actins and has a different mobility in isoelectric focusing gels from that of the known a actins from skeletal, cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. Like β and γ actin, ζ can be extracted with the actin depolymerizing factor from slime mold. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing) of the 35S-methionine-labeled polypeptides synthesized by a single sarcoma 180 cell showed that all three major actin species coexist within the same cell. This analysis also showed for the first time the coexistence of α and β tubulin, vimentin, α actinin and three other polypeptides present in intermediate-filament-enriched cytoplast cytoskeletons (spots 12, 24 and 31). Determination of the ratio of γ plus β to ζ actin in different cytoskeletal preparations of intact and enucleated sarcoma 180 cells indicated that this actin species is not localized specifically to any of the major actin-containing structures preserved in the cytoskeletons."

https://openalex.org/W1969451595,"Previous work has suggested that the activation of the sea urchin egg at fertilization is the result of a transient increase in intracellular free calcium and an increase in intracellular pH. We have investigated the absence of nuclear activation in incompletely activated eggs and have found a correlation between nuclear activation and the levels of total reduced nicotinamide nucleotides (NAD[P]H). Eggs activated with ammonia show a similar correlation: besides its action as a weak base in raising intracellular pH (which we conclude is insufficient to stimulate or maintain nuclear activation as judged by nuclear envelope breakdown or DNA synthesis), ammonia increases NAD(P)H. This increase is associated with the stimulation of 6-3H-thymidine incorporation into egg DNA. Removing ammonia decreased NAD(P)H, and tritiated thymidine incorporation ceases. We conclude that a critical level of NAD(P)H is essential to nuclear activation and that the increase of NAD(P)H at fertilization must be included with the increase in calcium and pH as a causal agent in development."
https://openalex.org/W2159143932,"alpha-Protein, a major glycoprotein in the cytosol fraction of rat ventral prostate, has a molecular weight of about 50,000 and can be dissociated, by sodium dodecyl sulfate, into two different subunits (A and B). alpha-Protein has three different polypeptide components with apparent molecular weights of 10,000 (I), 14,000 (II), and 15,000 (III). These components were purified to homogeneity and their amino acid compositions were determined. Subunit A is composed of Components I and III, whereas subunit B is composed of Components II and III. Carbohydrate was detectable only on Component III. Component III isolated from subunit A and Component III isolated from subunit B appear to be identical. The purified alpha-protein contains 0.7-1 mol of cholesterol/mol of protein. If cholesterol was removed by acetone, about 1 mol of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone or pregnenolone could bind to 1 mol of alpha-protein. In the presence of 2 mM ZnCl2, alpha-protein can form dimers and tetramers. In cell-free systems, alpha-protein can inhibit binding of the androgen-receptor complex to nuclear chromatin and also can promote the release of the complex already bound to chromatin. This effect is due to polypeptide Component I."
https://openalex.org/W2070798514,"We examined the filaments associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane in rabbit exudate PMNs during phagocytosis of particles, or during “frustrated phagocytosis” with exocytosis of storage granules. Cells were plated onto yeast particles glued to coverslips with polylysine or onto coverslips coated with sheets of heat-agglutinated IgG. After periods ranging from 1 to 15 min, we disrupted the cells by a jet of salt solution and exposed their inner membranes. These broken cells were fixed immediately and processed for SEM. Whole cells were also prepared for SEM or TEM. At the site of PMN adherence to an opsonized yeast particle, a network of globular centers and thin, branched filaments appears on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, while the outstretching lamellipodia contain a mesh of such filaments but no globular centers. Within 1 to 2 minutes, these structures disappear from the invaginating portion of the developing vacuole, and the cell's storage granules fuse with the barren membrane regions. These activities occur in rapid sequence over the vacuolar membrane after the first contact, until the phagocytosed particle is wholly encircled by a smooth, loose membrane, separated from the cell surface. A comparable filament pattern or complex was seen during “frustrated phagocytosis” on IgG sheets. At times between 1 and 5 min after plating, the cytoplasmic surfaces of these adherent membranes contain denuded central regions and peripheral nets of globular centers with radiating, thin, branched filaments. Granules apparently fuse with the bare areas. Thus we have obtained evidence of filament association with the plasma membrane at sites of adherence (to phagocytosable or nonphagocytosable surfaces) and have traced the subsequent disappearance of the filaments with degranulation."
https://openalex.org/W1555953755,"Luciferase activity in cell-free extracts of the bioluminescent marine dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra undergoes a cyclic daily change such that activities of extracts made in the middle of the night phase may be 10 times greater than in extracts of day phase cells. These cyclic changes continue under constant conditions, in a manner indicative of control by an endogenous circadian cellular mechanism. This paper describes the purification and properties of the higher molecular weight unproteolyzed luciferase from both day and night phase cells. Comparisons of the two preparations with respect to several physicochemical, enzymatic, and immunological criteria were made in order to establish the basis for the activity difference; no differences between day and night species were found. A given amount of antiluciferase inactivated the same amount of luciferase activity in both day and night extracts; their specific activities are therefore the same. These data strongly suggest that the luciferase is the same polypeptide in day and night extracts, and that such extracts contain different amounts of the enzyme. We therefore postulate that the circadian rhythm of luciferase activity is a result of biological clock-controlled synthesis and/or degradation of the luciferase polypeptide."

There is no variation in the affinity of the receptors for estradiol, and the rhythm is not due to estrogens from nonovarian sources.

The factors that cause this rhythm is brain estrogen receptors may be one means by which light affects reproductive function."
https://openalex.org/W2040772756,"When bound to cell surfaces, certain lectins such as concanavalin A induce a drop in the average diffusion coefficients (D) of a number of cell surface molecules. To find whether such anchorage modulation occurs naturally, D of surface antigens on different cell and tissue types were measured by fluorescence photobleaching recovery. Values for cells of the same tissue origin under different conditions of growth and association - in tissues, in small aggregates, and as isolated cells - varied by less than twofold when polyspecific monovalent antibodies to cell surface antigens were used, a range much less than the sixfold decrease in D observed after lectin-induced anchorage modulation. Thus, if reversible modulation of the diffusion rate is used naturally as a means of cell signaling, it must involve only a few kinds of surface receptors not detected by the antibodies used in this study. In certain tissues, however, a significant proportion of cells showed no apparent receptor mobility. This ""all or none"" modulation of lateral diffusion may reflect relatively long-lasting alterations in the states of a single cell type or differentiation among the cells of the particular tissue."

The secondary structure was probed under a variety of ionic conditions using limited pancreatic and T1 ribonuclease digestion and rapid gel sequencing techniques. The results generally supported the burp gun model previously proposed for all 5.8 S rRNAs (Nazar, R. N., Sitz, T. O., and Busch, H. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8591-8597) and were inconsistent with a recently suggested cloverleaf configuration (Luoma, G. A., and Marshall, A. G. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 4901-4905). Theoretical considerations of the overall stability also appear to favor the former estimate. As previously observed with other 5.8 S RNAs the sequence of T. lanuginosus RNA is strikingly homologous with other species; it differs in only 13 positions from that of yeast. When compared to yeast, the differences appear not to contribute to the stability of the secondary structure but probably lead to a more stable 5.8 S-25 S rRNA interaction in the large ribosomal subunit. A general comparison of T. lanuginosus 5.8 S RNA with all known 5.8 S RNA sequences indicates that, although modified nucleotides differ significantly between species, they are always located in four highly conserved regions of the 5.8 S molecule, probably contributing to the unique character of these very essential sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1560558171,"Both basal and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-stimulated human platelet adenylate cyclase activity are inhibited by Na+ and other monovalent cations. Inhibition occurs when the cations are present in concentrations of 20 to 120 mM. Inhibition of basal activity by epinephrine requires the presence of GTP but not Na+. In the presence of epinephrine and GTP, Na+ further reduces basal activity, and the combined effects of all three ligands results in a 70% reduction of basal activity. Sodium, however, does not increase the fractional inhibition of basal activity attributable to epinephrine. Sodium increases the concentrations of epinephrine and of PGE1 required for half-maximal inhibition and stimulation of adenylate cyclase but does not alter the apparent km for Mg2+ or ATP. The rate and extent of adenylate cyclase activation by the GTP analog guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate is reduced by Na+, although the cation does not prevent the acceleration of activation by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate induced by PGE1. Other monovalent cations also inhibit the platelet cyclase with an order of potency of Na+ greater than Li+ greater than K+ greater than choline+. In addition to demonstrating that Na+ is not required for hormonal inhibition of platelet adenylate cyclase, these studies demonstrate the multiple inhibitory effects which can be induced by Na+ and other monovalent cations. The pattern of these effects suggests that the cations interfere with functional coupling between receptors, guanine nucleotide binding units, and catalytic units of the adenylate cyclase complex."

RBP was identified and separated from other translated products by immunoprecipitation with specific rabbit anti-rat RBP antiserum. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography of the immunoprecipitate consistently revealed one major product which migrated more slowly than purified rat serum RBP. The protein (preRBP) had an approximate molecular weight of 24,000. When dog pancreas microsomal membranes were cotranslationally present, the newly synthesized preRBP was processed to a protein which migrated coincidentally with purified rat serum RBP, approximately 20,500 daltons.

Mixtures prepared from normal nitrate reductase and the demolybdoenzyme could not be resolved by disc gel electrophoresis or by centrifugation in a density gradient. By a two-step enzyme induction (1, incubation with nitrate in absence of Mo; 2, incubation with Mo in absence of nitrate) the process of nitrate reductase synthesis could be cleanly separated from growth into two steps: Step 1, induction of cytochrome c reductase, was completely inhibited by cycloheximide. Step 2 was unaffected by cycloheximide, and most of the nitrate reductase synthesized accumulated in the form of the reversibly inactivated HCN complex of the enzyme."

The enzymatic activity is inhibited by high NADP+ concentrations in presence of low concentrations of substrate, whereas at high substrate concentrations no inhibition by NADP+ is showed. These data suggest that: 1) the enzyme exhibits an half-of-the-sites reactivity during the catalytic cycle; 2) the recycle of the enzyme occurs mainly through an abortive ternary complex enzyme-substrate-NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1608825855,"Demolybdo nitrate reductase (also called cyt c reductase) of Chlorella vulgaris has been converted to active nitrate reductase by insertion of Mo from Na2MoO4 in vitro. A procedure is described which consistently gives about 0.3 unit of nitrate reductase from about 6 units of cyt c reductase, a yield of 30% of the maximum expected, if we calculate on a basis of a ratio of 6 to 1 for the cyt c reductase/nitrate reductase of purified normal enzyme. The demolybdoenzyme is incubated for 30 s at 31 degrees C with molybdate and reduced glutathione (GSH) at pH 4.8, and the pH is then raised to 7, and the incubation continued for 20 min. At the acid pH, there must be a partial denaturation or unfolding which permits Mo insertion, with a refolding to active enzyme at the higher pH. The GSH is not essential for activation, but in its absence the yield of active enzyme was about 50% lower. Experiments with labeled GSH showed that no GSH was incorporated into the protein during the activation procedure. Although the enzyme activity measurements suggested that only 30% of the enzyme was activated, measurements with 99Mo showed that there was one Mo incorporated per subunit weight of 90,000. The Km for nitrate of the activated nitrate reductase was identical with the Km for nitrate of the normal enzyme. On gradient centrifugation, activated nitrate reductase, cyt c reductase, and normal nitrate reductase all behaved identically."
