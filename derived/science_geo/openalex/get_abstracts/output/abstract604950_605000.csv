https://openalex.org/W2793071520,"A total of 22 Lactobacillus strains, which were isolated from infant feces were evaluated for their probiotic potential along with resistance to low pH and bile salts. Eight isolates (L. reuteri 3M02 and 3M03, L. gasseri 4M13, 4R22, 5R01, 5R02, and 5R13, and L. rhamnosus 4B15) with high tolerance to acid and bile salts, and ability to adhere to the intestine were screened from 22 strains. Further, functional properties of 8 Lactobacillus strains, such as anti-oxidation, inhibition of α-glucosidase activity, cholesterol-lowering, and anti-inflammation were evaluated. The properties were strain-specific. Particularly, two strains of L. rhamnosus, 4B15 (4B15) and L. gasseri 4M13 (4M13) showed considerably higher anti-oxidation, inhibition of α-glucosidase activity, and cholesterol-lowering, and greater inhibition of nitric oxide production than other strains. Moreover, the two selected strains substantially inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10 stimulated the treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with LPS. In addition, whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of 4B15 and 4M13 indicated them as novel genomic strains. These results suggested that 4B15 and 4M13 showed the highest probiotic potential and have an impact on immune health by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2789685640,"Development of antibiotic resistance in foodborne pathogens, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter, is a public health concern. Public demand to reduce the use of sub-therapeutic antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) in poultry feeding has resulted in greater adoption of antibiotic-free poultry production systems. There is a need to understand the effects of AGP removal from poultry feed on gut microbiota and its impact on prevalence of foodborne pathogens. The effect of antibiotic withdrawal from poultry feed on gut microbial community, host performance and immunity, and prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter was evaluated. Birds were raised on three phase diets (starter [d0-22], grower [d23-35] and finisher [d36-42]) with and without bacitracin dimethyl salicyclate (BMD). At early growth stage, bird performance was improved (P ≤ 0.05) with BMD treatment, whereas performance was better (P ≤ 0.05) in control group (no BMD in the feed) at the time of commercial processing. Acetate and butyrate production was affected (P ≤ 0.05) by age, whereas propionate production was affected (P ≤ 0.05) by both the treatment and age. The bacterial communities in the cecum were more diverse (P ≤ 0.001) and rich compared to the ileal communities, and they shifted in parallel to one another as the chicks matured. Differences in diversity and species richness were not observed (P > 0.05) between the BMD-fed and control groups. Comparing all ages, treatments and diets, the composition of cecal and ileal bacterial communities was different (P ≤ 0.001). Inclusion of BMD in the feed did not affect the bacterial phyla. However, predictable shift in the ileal and cecal bacterial population at lower taxonomic level was observed in control vs BMD-fed group. Cytokines gene expression (IL-10, IL-4, IFN-γ, beta-defensin, and TLR-4) was affected (P≤ 0.05) in the BMD-fed group at early stages of growth. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. showed higher abundance in the ilea of BMD-fed chicks compared to control group. Overall, this study provided insight of the impact of AGP supplementation in the feed on gut microbial modulations, bird performance, host immunity and pathogen prevalence. This information can assist in designing alternative strategies to replace antibiotics in modern poultry production and for food safety."
https://openalex.org/W2786015437,"We review the status of marine shellfish ecosystems formed primarily by bivalves in Australia, including: identifying ecosystem-forming species, assessing their historical and current extent, causes for decline and past and present management. Fourteen species of bivalves were identified as developing complex, three-dimensional reef or bed ecosystems in intertidal and subtidal areas across tropical, subtropical and temperate Australia. A dramatic decline in the extent and condition of Australia's two most common shellfish ecosystems, developed by Saccostrea glomerata and Ostrea angasi oysters, occurred during the mid-1800s to early 1900s in concurrence with extensive harvesting for food and lime production, ecosystem modification, disease outbreaks and a decline in water quality. Out of 118 historical locations containing O. angasi-developed ecosystems, only one location still contains the ecosystem whilst only six locations are known to still contain S. glomerata-developed ecosystems out of 60 historical locations. Ecosystems developed by the introduced oyster Crasostrea gigas are likely to be increasing in extent, whilst data on the remaining 11 ecosystem-forming species are limited, preventing a detailed assessment of their current ecosystem-forming status. Our analysis identifies that current knowledge on extent, physical characteristics, biodiversity and ecosystem services of Australian shellfish ecosystems is extremely limited. Despite the limited information on shellfish ecosystems, a number of restoration projects have recently been initiated across Australia and we propose a number of existing government policies and conservation mechanisms, if enacted, would readily serve to support the future conservation and recovery of Australia's shellfish ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2786706949,"The ability to reason about fairness plays a defining role in the development of morality. Thus, researchers have long been interested in understanding when and how a sensitivity to fairness first develops. Here, we examined infants’ ability to use fairness information in selecting social partners. Using a novel experimental paradigm that combined pre-recorded stimuli with an active behavioral measure, we tested whether infants preferred to socially engage with an individual they had previously seen behave fairly or unfairly. After viewing an individual distribute goods to third parties either equally (i.e., 3:3 distribution) or unequally (i.e., 5:1 distribution), both 13- and 17-month-old infants selectively chose to engage in a social interaction with (i.e., take a toy from) an individual who distributed resources equally. The use of a novel paradigm to assess infants’ fairness preferences demonstrates that infants’ previously established fairness preferences extend across different, more demanding paradigms, and may therefore be more enduring in nature. Together, these findings provide new insights into the nature of infants’ fairness representations, and fill in key gaps in the developmental timeline of infants’ ability to use fairness information in their consideration of potential social partners. In sum, these findings build on previous research by demonstrating that infants not only hold an expectation that resources should be distributed fairly, they also preferentially interact with those who have previously done so. The early-emerging ability to both reason about and use fairness information may play an influential role in the development of complex prosocial behaviors related to morality more broadly."
https://openalex.org/W2793641926,"Stem cell (SC) therapy for ischemic cardiomyopathy is hampered by poor survival of the implanted cells. Recently, SC-derived exosomes have been shown to facilitate cell proliferation and survival by transporting various proteins and non-coding RNAs (such as microRNAs and lncRNAs). In this study, miR-21 was highly enriched in exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Interestingly, exosomes collected from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-treated MSCs (H-Exo) contained higher levels of miR-21 than exosomes released from MSCs under normal conditions (N-Exo). The pre-treatment of C-kit+ cardiac stem cells (CSCs) with H-Exos resulted in significantly increased levels of miR-21 and phosphor-Akt (pAkt) and decreased levels of PTEN, which is a known target of miR-21. AnnexinV-FITC/PI analysis further demonstrated that the degree of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was markedly lower in H-Exo-treated C-kit+ CSCs than that in N-Exo-treated cells. These protective effects could be blocked by both a miR-21 inhibitor and the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. Therefore, exosomal miR-21 derived from H2O2-treated MSCs could be transported to C-kit+ cardiac stem cells to functionally inhibit PTEN expression, thereby activating PI3K/AKT signaling and leading to protection against oxidative stress-triggered cell death. Thus, exosomes derived from MSCs could be used as a new therapeutic vehicle to facilitate C-kit+ CSC therapies in the ischemic myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2793409442,"Metagenomics uses nucleic acid sequencing to characterize species diversity in different niches such as environmental biomes or the human microbiome. Most studies have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify bacteria. However, the decreasing cost of sequencing has resulted in a gradual shift away from amplicon analyses and towards shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Shotgun metagenomic data can be used to identify a wide range of species, but have rarely been applied to fungal identification. Here, we develop a sequence classification pipeline, FindFungi, and use it to identify fungal sequences in public metagenome datasets. We focus primarily on animal metagenomes, especially those from pig and mouse microbiomes. We identified fungi in 39 of 70 datasets comprising 71 fungal species. At least 11 pathogenic species with zoonotic potential were identified, including Candida tropicalis. We identified Pseudogymnoascus species from 13 Antarctic soil samples initially analyzed for the presence of bacteria capable of degrading diesel oil. We also show that Candida tropicalis and Candida loboi are likely the same species. In addition, we identify several examples where contaminating DNA was erroneously included in fungal genome assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W2785710423,"Near-death experiences (NDEs) refer to profound psychological events that can have an important impact on the experiencers’ (NDErs) lives. Previous studies have shown that NDEs memories are phenomenologically rich. In the present study, we therefore aimed to extract the common themes (referred to as “features” in the NDE literature) reported by NDErs by analyzing all the concepts stored in the narratives of their experiences. A qualitative thematic analysis has been carried out on 34 cardiac arrest survivors’ NDE narratives. Our results shed the light on the structure of the narratives by identifying 10 “time-bounded” themes which refer to isolated events encountered during the NDE and 1 “transversal” theme which characterizes the whole narrative and generally appears as a retrospective comment of self-reflection on the experience. The division of narratives into themes provides us with detailed information about the vocabulary used by NDErs to describe their experience. This established thematic method enables a rigorous description of the phenomenon, ensuring the inclusion of all self-reported manifestations of themes in narratives."
https://openalex.org/W2785432275,"Behavioral problems are a major source of poor welfare and premature mortality in companion dogs. Previous studies have demonstrated associations between owners’ personality and psychological status and the prevalence and/or severity of their dogs’ behavior problems. However, the mechanisms responsible for these associations are currently unknown. Other studies have detected links between the tendency of dogs to display behavior problems and their owners’ use of aversive or confrontational training methods. This raises the possibility that the effects of owner personality and psychological status on dog behavior are mediated via their influence on the owner’s choice of training methods. We investigated this hypothesis in a self-selected, convenience sample of 1564 current dog owners using an online battery of questionnaires designed to measure, respectively, owner personality, depression, emotion regulation, use of aversive/confrontational training methods, and owner-reported dog behavior. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses identified modest, positive associations between owners’ use of aversive/confrontational training methods and the prevalence/severity of the following dog behavior problems: owner-directed aggression, stranger-directed aggression, separation problems, chasing, persistent barking, and house-soiling (urination and defecation when left alone). The regression models also detected modest associations between owners’ low scores on four of the ‘Big Five’ personality dimensions (Agreeableness, Emotional Stability, Extraversion & Conscientiousness) and their dogs’ tendency to display higher rates of owner-directed aggression, stranger-directed fear, and/or urination when left alone. The study found only weak evidence to support the hypothesis that these relationships between owner personality and dog behavior were mediated via the owners’ use of punitive training methods, but it did detect a more than five-fold increase in the use of aversive/confrontational training techniques among men with moderate depression. Further research is needed to clarify the causal relationship between owner personality and psychological status and the behavioral problems of companion dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2790844793,"Recent work suggests that diet affects brain metabolism thereby impacting cognitive function. Our objective was to determine if a western diet altered brain metabolism, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport and inflammation, and induced cognitive impairment in C57BL/6 (WT) mice and low-density lipoprotein receptor null (LDLr -/-) mice, a model of hyperlipidemia and cognitive decline. We show that a western diet and LDLr -/- moderately influence cognitive processes as assessed by Y-maze and radial arm water maze. Also, western diet significantly increased BBB transport, as well as microvessel factor VIII in LDLr -/- and microglia IBA1 staining in WT, both indicators of activation and neuroinflammation. Interestingly, LDLr -/- mice had a significant increase in 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose uptake irrespective of diet and brain 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed increased lactate and lipid moieties. Metabolic assessments of whole mouse brain by GC/MS and LC/MS/MS showed that a western diet altered brain TCA cycle and β-oxidation intermediates, levels of amino acids, and complex lipid levels and elevated proinflammatory lipid mediators. Our study reveals that the western diet has multiple impacts on brain metabolism, physiology, and altered cognitive function that likely manifest via multiple cellular pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2790292328,"Mathematics anxiety (MA) and mathematics motivation (MM) are important multi-dimensional non-cognitive factors in mathematics learning. While the negative relation between global MA and MM is well replicated, the relations between specific dimensions of MA and MM are largely unexplored. The present study utilized latent profile analysis to explore profiles of various aspects of MA (including learning MA and exam MA) and MM (including importance, self-perceived ability, and interest), to provide a more holistic understanding of the math-specific emotion and motivation experiences. In a sample of 927 high school students (13–21 years old), we found 8 distinct profiles characterized by various combinations of dimensions of MA and MM, revealing the complexity in the math-specific emotion-motivation relation beyond a single negative correlation. Further, these profiles differed on mathematics learning behaviors and mathematics achievement. For example, the highest achieving students reported modest exam MA and high MM, whereas the most engaged students were characterized by a combination of high exam MA and high MM. These results call for the need to move beyond linear relations among global constructs to address the complexity in the emotion-motivation-cognition interplay in mathematics learning, and highlight the importance of customized intervention for these heterogeneous groups."

As PERK is generally known as a translational regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), the underlying cause of these β cell defects has often been attributed to derepression of proinsulin synthesis, resulting in proinsulin overload in the ER. Using high-resolution imaging and standard protein fractionation and immunological methods we have examined the PERK-dependent phenotype more closely. We found that whereas proinsulin aggregation requires new protein synthesis, global protein and proinsulin synthesis are down-regulated in PERK-inhibited cells, strongly arguing against proinsulin overproduction being the root cause of their aberrant ER phenotype. Furthermore, we show that PERK regulates proinsulin proteostasis by modulating ER chaperones, including BiP and ERp72. Transgenic overexpression of BiP and BiP knockdown (KD) both promoted proinsulin aggregation, whereas ERp72 overexpression and knockdown rescued it. These findings underscore the importance of ER chaperones working in concert to achieve control of insulin production and identify a role for PERK in maintaining a functional balance among these chaperones.

Two alternative hypotheses have dominated the subsequent inquiry into the molecular mechanisms that govern PERK function in β cells. The first was based on early observations of chemically induced ER stress in cultured cells. During ER stress, PERK is activated to phosphorylate its major substrate, eIF2α, leading to depressed global translation initiation and increased expression of transcription factors that function to either relieve the stress or, failing that, induce apoptosis. Thus, it was initially postulated that the proinsulin overload within the ER lumen associated with PERK and eIF2α mutations was caused by derepression of protein synthesis (7Harding H.P. Zeng H.

Using this inhibitor, Harding and co-workers (27Harding H.P. Zyryanova A.F. Ron D.

They interpreted these correlative findings as additional evidence for the proinsulin over-synthesis model of PERK function in β cells. In parallel, we discovered that within seconds to minutes, PERKi treatment perturbs calcium fluxes, which are critical for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, we found that within 24 h, PERKi induces an Impacted-ER phenotype that is indistinguishable from what is seen in genetic models of PERK ablation, indicating that the phenotype is a generalized feature of PERK ablation in β cells (11Wang R. McGrath B.C. Kopp R.F. Roe M.W. Tang X. Chen G. Cavener D.R. Insulin secretion and Ca2+ dynamics in beta-cells are regulated by PERK (EIF2AK3) in concert with calcineurin.J. Biol.

The goal of the work presented herein is to directly test the two competing hypotheses for how the absence of PERK function leads to β cell dysfunction and the Impacted-ER phenotype. Consistent with our previous finding in genetic models of PERK ablation we do not observe increases in global protein or proinsulin synthesis in a population of PERKi-treated cells. On the contrary, we clearly demonstrate that both are significantly reduced, specifically in Impacted-ER cells, thereby ruling out the ER stress-based proinsulin over-synthesis hypothesis. Instead, we uncover compelling evidence for the alternative hypothesis that loss of functional coordination among key PERK-dependent ER chaperones is primarily responsible for β cell dysfunctions and diabetes in Perk mutant mice and humans afflicted with WRS. Proinsulin abnormally accumulates in the ER of β cells in rodent models of PERK ablation (Fig. 1, A–D, and Fig. S1, A and B), and this is purported to be the major reason for insulin insufficiency and diabetes in Perk KO mice (9Feng D. Wei J. Gupta S. McGrath B.C. Cavener D.R. Acute ablation of PERK results in ER dysfunctions followed by reduced insulin secretion and cell proliferation.BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10 (19732428): 6110.1186/1471-2121-10-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar10Gupta S.

Because the diabetes in Perk KO mice is similar to the diabetes in WRS-afflicted humans, we asked if they share the same subcellular β cell defects. As was previously shown (28Collardeau-Frachon S. Vasiljevic A. Jouvet A. Bouvier R. Senée V. Nicolino M. Microscopic and ultrastructural features in Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, a permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus: about two autopsy cases.Pediatr. Diabetes. 2015; 16 (25131821): 510-52010.1111/pedi.12201Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the number of insulin-positive β cells was greatly diminished in pancreata from human WRS. Furthermore, human WRS islets also contained Impacted-ER cells that were indistinguishable from those seen in Perk KO islets (Fig. 1, E and F). More detailed examination (Fig. 1, G–I) of PERK-inhibited β cells in culture identified intermediate cells in which proinsulin could be detected both within and just outside of its normal Golgi localization (Fig. 1H). “Super” Impacted-ER cells in which proinsulin was dispersed throughout the cell body, reaching the periphery, were also observed (Fig. 1I). Additionally, the structure of the Golgi appears less organized, but not wholly lost, in the super Impacted-ER cells. This observation is consistent with previous data that showed mixing of the ER and Golgi compartments when PERK function was ablated genetically (10Gupta S. McGrath B. Cavener D.R. PERK (EIF2AK3) regulates proinsulin trafficking and quality control in the secretory pathway.Diabetes. 2010; 59 (20530744): 1937-194710.2337/db09-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The appearance of proinsulin as insoluble, HMW aggregates in PERKi-treated cells (27Harding H.P. Zyryanova A.F. Ron D. Uncoupling proteostasis and development in vitro with a small molecule inhibitor of the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase, PERK.J. Biol.

A previously described ultracentrifugation method (27Harding H.P. Zyryanova A.F. Ron D. Uncoupling proteostasis and development in vitro with a small molecule inhibitor of the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase, PERK.J. Biol.

Proinsulin aggregates were detectable at 4 h and continued to increase through 24 h post-treatment with PERKi (Fig. 1, J and K). The timing of this aggregation coincided with the appearance of the Impacted-ER phenotype cytologically (Fig. 1L). Importantly, eIF2α-P levels at these time points were not elevated in contrast to levels seen in cells exposed to the ER stress-inducing agent thapsigargin, indicating the absence of a canonical ER stress response (Fig. 1M). It was previously reported by Harding and co-workers (27Harding H.P. Zyryanova A.F. Ron D. Uncoupling proteostasis and development in vitro with a small molecule inhibitor of the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase, PERK.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (23148209): 44338-4434410.1074/jbc.M112.428987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that PERKi modestly increases proinsulin synthesis in rat whole pancreatic islets, which was correlated with the formation of HMW proinsulin aggregates in cultured mouse MIN6 β cells. However, when we repeated these experiments using rat INS1 832/13 β cells, we found no significant change in proinsulin (Fig. 2, A and B) or global protein synthesis over time (Fig. 2, C and D), whereas both were significantly reduced at all time points by treatment with the global protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (AN). Impacted-ER cells typically comprise less than 20% of the total cell population in PERKi-treated cells. Therefore, our inability to detect PERKi-induced changes in proinsulin or total protein synthesis may have been due to the overwhelming excess of unaffected β cells that obscured changes in the comparatively minor population of Impacted-ER cells. To assess the status of protein synthesis only in Impacted-ER cells, a single cell-based fluorescence assay was employed, which incorporates an alkyne-modified analog of methionine, which allows for fluorescence detection of cells that are active for protein synthesis. When fluorescence intensities of total populations of INS1 832/13 cells were compared, no significant differences in total protein synthesis were found in cells treated with PERKi compared with the controls (Fig. 2E). However, when Impacted-ER and non-Impacted-ER cells within the same PERKi-treated population were compared, a reduction in total protein synthesis by ∼50% for Impacted-ER compared with non-Impacted-ER cells was observed at all time points tested (Fig. 2, F–N). A significant reduction was also seen in MIN6 cells (Fig. S2A). These results strongly argue against total protein or proinsulin over-synthesis as being the cause of ER and proinsulin dysfunctions seen in PERK-ablated β cells. In normal β-cells there is a low steady-state level of proinsulin in the ER due to rapid transit to the Golgi (9Feng D. Wei J. Gupta S. McGrath B.C. Cavener D.R. Acute ablation of PERK results in ER dysfunctions followed by reduced insulin secretion and cell proliferation.BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10 (19732428): 6110.1186/1471-2121-10-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Gupta S.

Thus, we speculated that aggregate formation requires ongoing new proinsulin synthesis. To test this, β cells were co-treated with PERKi and a moderately high dose (50 nm) of AN, which reduced proinsulin synthesis by 40% after 1 h and 65% after 12 h (Fig. 2A). As expected, this level of reduction in proinsulin synthesis was correlated with an almost complete elimination of the Impacted-ER phenotype at 24 h (Fig. 3A). However, a lower dose of AN (15 nm), which achieved a 25% reduction in proinsulin synthesis after 24 h (Fig. 2B), was permissive for proinsulin aggregation and the Impacted-ER phenotype, albeit to a lesser degree than PERKi treatment alone (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine whether prior reduction of proinsulin synthesis predisposes cells to aggregate formation in response to PERKi, cells were pre-treated with AN for 15 min before adding PERKi. Under these conditions, the Impacted-ER phenotype was still readily observable after 24 h of PERK inhibition, albeit to a slightly lesser extent than with co-treatment (Fig. 3D). To summarize, PERK inhibition still leads to proinsulin aggregation even when protein synthesis is modestly reduced, however, some level of ongoing synthesis is needed to provide proinsulin to the accumulating aggregates once their formation has been initiated by loss of PERK function. Collectively, these findings strongly argue that the root cause of the Impacted-ER phenotype in PERK-ablated cells is not ER client protein over-synthesis. Previously, we showed that BiP and ERp72 expression in Perk-deficient mice and cultured β cells were substantially elevated compared with other ER trafficking-related proteins (9Feng D. Wei J. Gupta S. McGrath B.C. Cavener D.R. Acute ablation of PERK results in ER dysfunctions followed by reduced insulin secretion and cell proliferation.BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10 (19732428): 6110.1186/1471-2121-10-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Gupta S.

Similarly, in INS1 832/13 cells treated for 24 h with PERKi we observed an increase in Erp72 and Bip mRNAs (Fig. 4A). BiP protein levels were modestly elevated after a 24-h PERKi treatment, with the most significant increase occurring between 8 and 24 h of PERKi exposure (Fig. 4B). Thus, up-regulation of this critical chaperone is delayed with respect to the onset of proinsulin aggregate formation.

To assist the study and documentation of this iconic taxon, we present a 3D atlas on the appendage musculature, with specific focus on the muscles of the cephalothoracic appendages. As L. polyphemus appendage musculature has been the focus of extensive study, depicting the muscles in 3D will facilitate a more complete understanding thereof for future researchers. A large museum specimen was CT scanned to illustrate the major exoskeletal features of L. polyphemus. Micro-CT scans of iodine-stained appendages from fresh, non-museum specimens were digitally dissected to interactively depict appendage sections and muscles. This study has revealed the presence of two new muscles: one within the pushing leg, located dorsally relative to all other patella muscles, and the other within the male pedipalp, located in the modified tibiotarsus. This atlas increases accessibility to important internal and external morphological features of L. polyphemus and reduces the need for destructive fresh tissue dissection of specimens. Scanning, digitally dissecting, and documenting taxa in 3D is a pivotal step towards creating permanent digital records of life on Earth."

This study, conducted in an acute geriatric setting, aims to compare self-reported capability beliefs on EBP between health professionals and students, and to compare the use of EBP between health professional groups. Occupational therapists, physicians, physiotherapists and registered nurses with three or more months’ employment, and all students from the occupational therapy, medical, physiotherapy and nursing programs, who had conducted workplace learning at the department, were invited. Data on capability beliefs and use of EBP were collected using the Evidence-based Practice Capabilities Beliefs Scale assessing six activities of EBP: formulate questions; search databases; search other sources; appraise research reports; participate in implementation in practice; and participate in evaluation. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used. Capability beliefs on EBP: The health professionals (n = 101; response rate 80%) reported high on search other sources but less on appraise research reports. The students (n = 124; response rate 73%) reported high on all EBP activities. The health professionals reported significantly higher on search other sources than the students. The students reported significantly higher on formulate questions and appraise research reports than the health professionals. No significant differences were identified between the health professional groups or between the student groups. Use of EBP: Health professionals reported wide-ranging use from several times each month to once every six months. The physicians reported significantly more frequent use than registered nurses and occupational therapists. Health professionals supervising students reported more frequent use of appraise research reports than the non-supervising group. There is a need for improving the use of EBP, particularly among registered nurses and occupational therapists. Supervision of students might enhance the motivation among staff to increase the use of EBP and students’ high EBP capability beliefs might inspire staff in this matter."

https://openalex.org/W2791214180,"Protein S-glutathionylation is a reversible redox modification that regulates mitochondrial metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in liver and cardiac tissue. However, whether or not it controls ROS release from skeletal muscle mitochondria has not been explored. In the present study, we examined if chemically-induced protein S-glutathionylation could alter superoxide (O2●-)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release from isolated muscle mitochondria. Disulfiram, a powerful chemical S-glutathionylation catalyst, was used to S-glutathionylate mitochondrial proteins and ascertain if it can alter ROS production. It was found that O2●-/H2O2 release rates from permeabilized muscle mitochondria decreased with increasing doses of disulfiram (100-500 μM). This effect was highest in mitochondria oxidizing succinate or palmitoyl-carnitine, where a ~80-90% decrease in the rate of ROS release was observed. Similar effects were detected in intact mitochondria respiring under state 4 conditions. Incubation of disulfiram-treated mitochondria with DTT (2 mM) restored ROS release confirming that these effects were associated with protein S-glutathionylation. Disulfiram treatment also inhibited phosphorylating and proton leak-dependent respiration. Radiolabelled substrate uptake experiments demonstrated that disulfiram inhibited pyruvate import but had no effect on carnitine uptake. Immunoblot analysis of complex I revealed that it contained several protein S-glutathionylation targets including NDUSF1, a subunit required for NADH oxidation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that O2●-/H2O2 release from muscle mitochondria can be altered by protein S-glutathionylation. We attribute these changes to the protein S-glutathionylation complex I and inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier."
https://openalex.org/W2787614373,"Background Postpartum depression carries adverse consequences for mothers and children, so widespread screening during primary care visits is recommended. However, the rates, timing, and factors associated with significant depressive episodes are incompletely understood. Methods and findings We examined the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient, Emergency Department, and Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases from California (2005–2011) and Florida (2005–2012). Within 203 million records, we identified 3,213,111 births and all mothers who had hospital encounters for severe depression within 40 weeks following delivery. We identified 15,806 episodes of postpartum depression after 11,103 deliveries among 10,883 unique women, and calculated an overall rate of 36.7 depression- associated hospital visits per 10,000 deliveries. Upward trends were observed in both states, with combined five-year increases of 34%. First depressive events were most common within 30 days of delivery, but continued for the entire observation period. About half (1,661/3,325) of PPD first episodes occurred within 34 days of delivery, 70% (2,329/3,325) by the end of the second month, and 87% (2,893/3,325) before four-months of the delivery. Women with private insurance were less likely to have hospital encounters for depression than women with public insurance and women with depression were much more likely to have had some kind of hospital encounter at some time during their pregnancies. Rates of depression increased with the number of prenatal hospital encounters in a “dose-dependent” fashion: the rate of depression was 17.2/10,000 for women with no prenatal hospital visits, doubling for women with at least one encounter (34.9/10,000), and increasing 7-fold to 126/10,000 for women with three or more encounters during their pregnancies. Conclusions Our findings suggest that (1) hospital encounters for post-partum depression are increasing, (2) screening should begin very early and continue for the first year after delivery, and (3) added attention should be given to women who had hospital encounters during their pregnancies."

Materials and methods We utilized 8,131 hospitalization events (ICD-9 codes 430–438) collected from the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study in 2005 and 2010. Detailed information from patients’ medical records was abstracted for each event by trained research nurses. By analyzing the broad list of demographic and clinical variables, the machine learning algorithms predicted whether an event was a stroke case and, if so, the stroke subtype. The performance was validated on gold-standard labels adjudicated by stroke physicians, and results were compared with stroke classifications based on ICD-9 discharge codes, as well as labels determined by study nurses. Results The best performing machine learning algorithm achieved a performance of 88.57%/93.81%/92.80%/93.30%/89.84%/98.01% (accuracy/precision/recall/F-measure/area under ROC curve/area under precision-recall curve) on stroke case detection. For detecting stroke subtypes, the algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 87.39% and greater than 85% precision on individual subtypes. The machine learning algorithms significantly outperformed the ICD-9 method on all measures (P value<0.001). Their performance was comparable to that of study nurses, with better tradeoff between precision and recall. The feature selection uncovered a subset of predictive variables that could facilitate future development of effective stroke phenotyping algorithms. Discussion and conclusions By analyzing a broad array of patient data, the machine learning technologies held promise for improving detection of stroke diagnosis, thus unlocking high statistical power for subsequent genetic and genomic studies."

Disease severity on roots of subterranean clover, white clover, winter and summer vetch grown as cover crop and living mulch species across five European sites as well as the frequency, distribution and aggressiveness to pea of Fusarium spp. recovered from the roots were assessed in 2013 and 2014. Disease symptoms were very low at all sites. Nevertheless, out of 1480 asymptomatic roots, 670 isolates of 14 Fusarium spp. were recovered. The most frequently isolated species in both years from all hosts were F. oxysporum and F. avenaceum accounting for 69% of total isolation percentage. They were common at the Swiss, Italian and German sites, whereas at the Swedish site F. oxysporum dominated and F. avenaceum occurred only rarely. The agressiveness and effect on pea biomass were tested in greenhouse assays for 72 isolates of six Fusarium species. Isolates of F. avenaceum caused severe root rot symptoms with mean severity index (DI) of 82 and 74% mean biomass reduction compared to the non-inoculated control. Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani isolates were higly variable in agressiveness and their impact on pea biomass. DI varied between 15 and 50 and biomass changes relative to the non-inoculated control -40% to +10%. Isolates of F. tricinctum, F. acuminatum and F. equiseti were non to weakly agressive often enhancing pea biomass. This study shows that some of the major pea pathogens are characterized by high ecological plasticity and have the ability to endophytically colonize the hosts studied that thus may serve as inoculum reservoir for susceptible main legume grain crops such as pea."
https://openalex.org/W2790805300,"Background An estimated 214 million women have unmet need for family planning in developing regions. Improved utilization of the private sector is key to achieving universal access to a range of safe and effective modern contraceptive methods stipulated by FP2020 and SDG commitments. Until now, a lack of market data has limited understanding of the private sector’s role in increasing contraceptive coverage and choice. Methods In 2015, the FPwatch Project conducted representative outlet surveys in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and DRC using a full census approach in selected administrative areas. Every public and private sector outlet with the potential to sell or distribute modern contraceptives was approached. In outlets with modern contraceptives, product audits and provider interviews assessed contraceptive market composition, availability, and price. Findings Excluding general retailers, 96% of potential outlets in Ethiopia, 55% in Nigeria, and 41% in DRC had modern contraceptive methods available. In Ethiopia, 41% of modern contraceptive stocking outlets were in the private sector compared with approximately 80% in Nigeria and DRC where drug shops were dominant. Ninety-five percent of private sector outlets in Ethiopia had modern contraceptive methods available; 37% had three or more methods. In Nigeria and DRC, only 54% and 42% of private sector outlets stocked modern contraceptives with 5% and 4% stocking three or more methods, respectively. High prices in Nigeria and DRC create barriers to consumer access and choice. Discussion There is a missed opportunity to provide modern contraception through the private sector, particularly drug shops. Subsidies and interventions, like social marketing and social franchising, could leverage the private sector’s role in increasing access to a range of contraceptives.

However, little is known about head movements and postures in the context of pain. In this regard, we analyze videos of three publically available datasets. The BioVid dataset was recorded with healthy participants subjected to painful heat stimuli. In the BP4D dataset, healthy participants performed a cold-pressor test and several other tasks (meant to elicit emotion). The UNBC dataset videos show shoulder pain patients during range-of-motion tests to their affected and unaffected limbs. In all videos, participants were sitting in an upright position. We studied head movements and postures that occurred during the painful and control trials by measuring head orientation from video over time, followed by analyzing posture and movement summary statistics and occurrence frequencies of typical postures and movements. We found significant differences between pain and control trials with analyses of variance and binomial tests. In BioVid and BP4D, pain was accompanied by head movements and postures that tend to be oriented downwards or towards the pain site. We also found differences in movement range and speed in all three datasets. The results suggest that head movements and postures should be considered for pain assessment and research. As additional pain indicators, they possibly might improve pain management whenever behavior is assessed, especially in nonverbal individuals such as infants or patients with dementia. However, in advance more research is needed to identify specific head movements and postures in pain patients."
https://openalex.org/W2789599415,"Due to the ubiquitous nature of disruptive extreme events, functionality of the critical infrastructure systems (CIS) is constantly at risk. In case of a disruption, in order to minimize the negative impact to the society, service networks operating on the CIS should be restored as quickly as possible. In this paper, we introduce a novel network science inspired measure to quantify the criticality of components within a disrupted service network and develop a restoration heuristic (Cent-Restore) that prioritizes restoration efforts based on this measure. As an illustrative case study, we consider a road network blocked by debris in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The debris obstructs the flow of relief aid and search-and-rescue teams between critical facilities and disaster sites, debilitating the emergency service network. In this context, the problem is defined as finding a schedule to clear the roads with the limited resources. First, we develop a mixed-integer programming model for the problem. Then we validate the efficiency and accuracy of the Cent-Restore heuristic on randomly generated instances by comparing it to the model. Furthermore, we use Cent-Restore to recommend real-time restoration plans for disrupted road networks of Boston and Manhattan and analyze the performance of the plans over time through resilience curves. We compare Cent-Restore to the current restoration guidelines proposed by FEMA and other strategies that prioritize the restoration efforts based on different measures. As a result we confirm the importance of including specific post-disruption attributes of the networks to create effective restoration strategies. Moreover, we explore the relationship between a service network’s resilience and its topological and operational characteristics under different disruption scenarios. The methods and insights provided in this work can be extended to other disrupted large-scale critical infrastructure systems in which the ultimate goal is to enable the functions of the overlaying service networks."
https://openalex.org/W2794252237,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the potential to form any cell type in the body, making them attractive cell sources in drug screening, regenerative medicine, disease and developmental processes modeling. However, not all hESC lines have the equal potency to generate desired cell types in vitro. Significant variations have been observed for the differentiation efficiency of various human ESC lines. The precise underpinning molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this work, we compared transcriptome variations of four hESC lines H7, HUES1, HUES8 and HUES9. We found that hESC lines have different gene expression profiles, and these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are significantly enriched in developmental processes, such as ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal development. The enrichment difference between hESC lines was consistent with its lineage bias. Among these DEGs, some pluripotency factors and genes involved in signaling transduction showed great variations as well. The pleiotropic functions of these genes in controlling hESC identity and early lineage specification, implicated that different hESC lines may utilize distinct balance mechanisms to maintain pluripotent state. When the balance is broken in a certain environment, gene expression variation between them could impact on their different lineage specification behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2793485375,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important metabolic regulator expressed predominantly in the liver. In this study, we evaluated the role of LY2405319, an analogue of FGF21, in hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and in a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD)-diet induced mouse model of liver fibrosis. During liver injury, HSCs trans-differentiate into activated myofibroblasts which produce alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and become a major cell type in hepatic fibrogenesis. Succinate and succinate receptor (GPR91) signaling has emerged as a regulator to promote α-SMA production in MCD diet- induced mice. Treatment with palmitate or MCD medium on LX-2 cells (HSCs) increased succinate concentration in the conditioned medium and cell lysate of LX-2 cells and increased production of GPR91 and α-SMA. However, LY2405319 administration ameliorates palmitate or MCD media-induced succinate production and decreases over-expression of GPR91 and α-SMA in LX2-cells. In an in vivo study, the MCD diet treatment caused increased steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis compared with the control diet in mice. Administration of LY2405319 improved steatohepatitis ameliorated GPR91 and α -SMA production in the liver, decreased succinate concentration in both liver and serum of MCD diet -induced mice. These results suggest that FGF21 reduces production of α-SMA by inhibiting the succinate-GPR91 pathway. We conclude that FGF21 acts as an inhibitor of the succinate-GPR91 pathway to control liver fibrosis. This suggests that FGF21 has therapeutic potential for treating liver fibrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2794025374,"The accuracy of quantitative stereological analysis tools such as the (physical) disector method substantially depends on the precise determination of the thickness of the analyzed histological sections. One conventional method for measurement of histological section thickness is to re-embed the section of interest vertically to its original section plane. The section thickness is then measured in a subsequently prepared histological section of this orthogonally re-embedded sample. However, the orthogonal re-embedding (ORE) technique is quite work- and time-intensive and may produce inaccurate section thickness measurement values due to unintentional slightly oblique (non-orthogonal) positioning of the re-embedded sample-section. Here, an improved ORE method is presented, allowing for determination of the factual section plane angle of the re-embedded section, and correction of measured section thickness values for oblique (non-orthogonal) sectioning. For this, the analyzed section is mounted flat on a foil of known thickness (calibration foil) and both the section and the calibration foil are then vertically (re-)embedded. The section angle of the re-embedded section is then calculated from the deviation of the measured section thickness of the calibration foil and its factual thickness, using basic geometry. To find a practicable, fast, and accurate alternative to ORE, the suitability of spectral reflectance (SR) measurement for determination of plastic section thicknesses was evaluated. Using a commercially available optical reflectometer (F20, Filmetrics®, USA), the thicknesses of 0.5 μm thick semi-thin Epon (glycid ether)-sections and of 1-3 μm thick plastic sections (glycolmethacrylate/ methylmethacrylate, GMA/MMA), as regularly used in physical disector analyses, could precisely be measured within few seconds. Compared to the measured section thicknesses determined by ORE, SR measures displayed less than 1% deviation. Our results prove the applicability of SR to efficiently provide accurate section thickness measurements as a prerequisite for reliable estimates of dependent quantitative stereological parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2792927636,"Background In August 2011, Ontario, Canada introduced a rotavirus immunization program using Rotarix™ vaccine. No assessments of rotavirus vaccine coverage have been previously conducted in Ontario. Methods We assessed vaccine coverage (series initiation and completion) and factors associated with uptake using the Electronic Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD), a collection of family physician electronic medical records (EMR) linked to health administrative data. Series initiation (1 dose) and series completion (2 doses) before and after the program’s introduction were calculated. To identify factors associated with series initiation and completion, adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using logistic regression. Results A total of 12,525 children were included. Series completion increased each year of the program (73%, 79% and 84%, respectively). Factors associated with series initiation included high continuity of care (aOR = 2.15; 95%CI, 1.61–2.87), maternal influenza vaccination (aOR = 1.55; 95%CI,1.24–1.93), maternal immmigration to Canada in the last five years (aOR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05–2.04), and having no siblings (aOR = 1.62; 95%CI,1.30–2.03). Relative to the first program year, infants were more likely to initiate the series in the second year (aOR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.39–2.10) and third year (aOR = 2.02; 95% CI 1.56–2.61) of the program. Infants receiving care from physicians with large practices were less likely to initiate the series (aOR 0.91; 95%CI, 0.88–0.94, per 100 patients rostered) and less likely to complete the series (aOR 0.94; 95%CI, 0.91–0.97, per 100 patients rostered). Additional associations were identified for series completion. Conclusions Family physician delivery achieved moderately high coverage in the program’s first three years. This assessment demonstrates the usefulness of EMR data for evaluating vaccine coverage. Important insights into factors associated with initiation or completion (i.e. high continuity of care, smaller roster sizes, rural practice location) suggest areas for research and potential program supports."
https://openalex.org/W2786711343,"The hylid tribe Cophomantini is a diverse clade of Neotropical treefrogs composed of the genera Aplastodiscus, Boana, Bokermannohyla, Hyloscirtus, and Myersiohyla. The phylogenetic relationships of Cophomantini have been comprehensively reviewed in the literature, providing a suitable framework for the study of chromosome evolution. Employing different banding techniques, we studied the chromosomes of 25 species of Boana and 3 of Hyloscirtus; thus providing, for the first time, data for Hyloscirtus and for 15 species of Boana. Most species showed karyotypes with 2n = 2x = 24 chromosomes; some species of the B. albopunctata group have 2n = 2x = 22, and H. alytolylax has 2n = 2x = 20. Karyotypes are all bi-armed in most species presented, with the exception of H. larinopygion (FN = 46) and H. alytolylax (FN = 38), with karyotypes that have a single pair of small telocentric chromosomes. In most species of Boana, NORs are observed in a single pair of chromosomes, mostly in the small chromosomes, although in some species of the B. albopunctata, B. pulchella, and B. semilineata groups, this marker occurs on the larger pairs 8, 1, and 7, respectively. In Hyloscirtus, NOR position differs in the three studied species: H. alytolylax (4p), H. palmeri (4q), and H. larinopygion (1p). Heterochromatin is a variable marker that could provide valuable evidence, but it would be necesserary to understand the molecular composition of the C-bands that are observed in different species in order to test its putative homology. In H. alytolylax, a centromeric DAPI+ band was observed on one homologue of chromosome pair 2. The band was present in males but absent in females, providing evidence for an XX/XY sex determining system in this species. We review and discuss the importance of the different chromosome markers (NOR position, C-bands, and DAPI/CMA3 patterns) for their impact on the taxonomy and karyotype evolution in Cophomantini."
https://openalex.org/W2791937499,"A computational model of the physiological mechanisms driving an individual's health towards onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is described, calibrated and validated using data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The objective of this model is to quantify the factors that can be used for prevention of T2D. The model is energy and mass balanced and continuously simulates trajectories of variables including body weight components, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin among others on the time-scale of years. Modeled mechanisms include dynamic representations of intracellular insulin resistance, pancreatic beta-cell insulin production, oxidation of macronutrients, ketogenesis, effects of inflammation and reactive oxygen species, and conversion between stored and activated metabolic species, with body-weight connected to mass and energy balance. The model was calibrated to 331 placebo and 315 lifestyle-intervention DPP subjects, and one year forecasts of all individuals were generated. Predicted population mean errors were less than or of the same magnitude as clinical measurement error; mean forecast errors for weight and HbA1c were ~5%, supporting predictive capabilities of the model. Validation of lifestyle-intervention prediction is demonstrated by synthetically imposing diet and physical activity changes on DPP placebo subjects. Using subject level parameters, comparisons were made between exogenous and endogenous characteristics of subjects who progressed toward T2D (HbA1c > 6.5) over the course of the DPP study to those who did not. The comparison revealed significant differences in diets and pancreatic sensitivity to hyperglycemia but not in propensity to develop insulin resistance. A computational experiment was performed to explore relative contributions of exogenous versus endogenous factors between these groups. Translational uses to applications in public health and personalized healthcare are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2793473024,"In the last decade robotic devices have been applied in rehabilitation to overcome walking disability in neurologic diseases with promising results. Robot assisted gait training (RAGT) using the Lokomat seems not only to improve gait parameters but also the perception of well-being. Data on the psychosocial patient-robot impact are limited, in particular in the real-world of RAGT, in the rehabilitation setting. During rehabilitation training, the Lokomat can be considered an “assistive device for movement”. This allowed the use of the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Device Scale- PIADS to describe patient interaction with the Lokomat. The primary aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the psychosocial impact of the Lokomat in an in-patient rehabilitation setting using the PIADS; secondary aims were to assess whether the psychosocial impact of RAGT is different between pathological sub-groups and if the Lokomat influenced functional variables (Functional Independence Measure scale–FIM and parameters provided by the Lokomat itself). Thirty-nine consecutive patients (69% males, 54.0±18.0 years) eligible for Lokomat training, with etiologically heterogeneous walking disabilities (Parkinson’s Disease, n = 10; Spinal Cord Injury, n = 21; Ictus Event, n = 8) were enrolled. Patients were assessed with the FIM before and after rehabilitation with Lokomat, and the PIADS was administered after the rehabilitative period with Lokomat. Overall the PIADS score was positive (35.8±21.6), as well as the three sub-scales, pertaining to “ability”, “adaptability” and “self-esteem” (17.2±10.4, 8.9±5.5 and 10.1±6.6 respectively) with no between-group differences. All patients significantly improved in gait measure and motor FIM scale (difference after—before treatment values: 11.7±9.8 and 11.2±10.3 respectively), increased treadmill speed (0.4 ± 0.2m/s), reduced body weight support (-14.0±9.5%) and guidance force (-13.1 ± 10.7%). This pilot study indicates that Lokomat, in a real-world in-patient setting, may have a generalised approval, independent of disease, underlining the importance of the psycho-social framework for patients training with assistive robotic-devices."

When considering osteogenesis, developments have been made with regards to chemical induction (e.g. differentiation media) and physical induction (e.g. material stiffness, nanotopography), targeting established early transcription factors or regulators such as runx2 or bone morphogenic proteins and promoting increased numbers of cells committing to osteo-specific differentiation. Recent research highlighted the involvement of microRNAs in lineage commitment and terminal differentiation. Herein, gold nanoparticles that confer stability to short single stranded RNAs were used to deliver MiR-31 antagomiRs to both pre-osteoblastic cells and primary human MSCs in vitro. Results showed that blocking miR-31 led to an increase in osterix protein in both cell types at day 7, with an increase in osteocalcin at day 21, suggesting MSC osteogenesis. In addition, it was noted that antagomiR sequence direction was important, with the 5 prime reading direction proving more effective than the 3 prime. This study highlights the potential that miRNA antagomiR-tagged nanoparticles offer as novel therapeutics in regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2785961361,"Background Early information on treatment response of HCC to local ablative therapy is crucial. Elastography as a non-invasive method has recently been shown to play a potential role in distinguishing between benign and malignant liver lesions. Elastography of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in early response to local ablative therapy has not been studied to date. Methods We prospectively included a cohort of 14 patients with diagnosis of HCC who were treated with local ablative therapy (transarterial chemoembolization, TACE and/or radiofrequency ablation, RFA). We used 2D shear-wave elastography (RT 2D-SWE) to examine stiffness of HCC lesion before and 3, 30 and 90 days after local ablative therapy. Contrast-enhanced imaging after 90 days was performed to evaluate treatment response. Primary endpoint was stiffness of HCC in response to local ablative therapy. Secondary end point was tumor recurrence. Results Stiffness of HCC nodules and liver showed no significant difference prior to local ablative therapy. As early as three days after treatment, stiffness of responding HCC was significantly higher compared to non-responding. Higher stiffness before treatment was significantly associated with tumor recurrence. Conclusion Nodule stiffness in general and RT 2D-SWE in particular could provide a useful tool for early prediction of HCC response to local ablative therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2790943230,"Objective This study evaluated the possibility of accelerated gadolinium accumulation in irradiated brain parenchyma where the blood-brain barrier was weakened. Methods From January 2010 to June 2015, 44 patients with supratentorial glioblastoma were retrospectively identified who underwent pre- and post-radiation brain MR imaging, including R1 mapping. The mean dose of administered gadobutrol (Gadovist, Bayer, Germany) was 5.1 vials. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around tumors that were located within 50–100% iso-dose lines of maximum radiation dose. ROIs were also drawn at globus pallidus, thalamus, and cerebral white matter. Averages of R1 values (unit: s-1) before and after radiation and those of R1 ratio (post-radiation R1 / pre-radiation R1) were compared by t-test or rank sum test as appropriate. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate independent association factors for R1 value increase at irradiated parenchyma. Results The mean R1 values in peri-tumoral areas were significantly increased after radiotherapy (0.7901±0.0977 [mean±SD] vs. 0.8146±0.1064; P <.01). The mean R1 ratio of high radiation dose areas was significantly higher than that of low dose areas (1.0055±0.0654 vs. 0.9882±0.0642; P <.01). The mean R1 ratio was lower in those who underwent hypofractionated radiotherapy (mean dose, 45.0 Gy) than those who underwent routine radiotherapy (mean dose, 61.1 Gy) (0.9913±0.0740 vs. 1.0463±0.0633; P = .08). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that only radiotherapy type was significantly associated with increased R1 (P = .02) around tumors. Conclusions Radiotherapy can induce R1 value increase in the brain parenchyma, which might suggest accelerated gadolinium accumulation due to damage to the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2791531289,"For non-ellipsoidal extended targets and group targets tracking (NETT and NGTT), using an ellipsoid to approximate the target extension may not be accurate enough because of the lack of shape and orientation information. In consideration of this, we model a non-ellipsoidal extended target or target group as a combination of multiple ellipsoidal sub-objects, each represented by a random matrix. Based on these models, an improved gamma Gaussian inverse Wishart probability hypothesis density (GGIW-PHD) filter is proposed to estimate the measurement rates, kinematic states, and extension states of the sub-objects for each extended target or target group. For maneuvering NETT and NGTT, a multi-model (MM) approach based GGIW-PHD (MM-GGIW-PHD) filter is proposed. The common and the individual dynamics of the sub-objects belonging to the same extended target or target group are described by means of the combination between the overall maneuver model and the sub-object models. For the merging of updating components, an improved merging criterion and a new merging method are derived. A specific implementation of prediction partition with pseudo-likelihood method is presented. Two scenarios for non-maneuvering and maneuvering NETT and NGTT are simulated.

https://openalex.org/W2785590460,"Lowe syndrome is an X-linked condition characterized by congenital cataracts, neurological abnormalities and kidney malfunction. This lethal disease is caused by mutations in the OCRL1 gene, which encodes for the phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase Ocrl1. While in the past decade we witnessed substantial progress in the identification and characterization of LS patient cellular phenotypes, many of these studies have been performed in knocked-down cell lines or patient's cells from accessible cell types such as skin fibroblasts, and not from the organs affected. This is partially due to the limited accessibility of patient cells from eyes, brain and kidneys. Here we report the preparation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patient skin fibroblasts and their reprogramming into kidney cells. These reprogrammed kidney cells displayed primary cilia assembly defects similar to those described previously in cell lines. Additionally, the transcription factor and cap mesenchyme marker Six2 was substantially retained in the Golgi complex and the functional nuclear-localized fraction was reduced. These results were confirmed using different batches of differentiated cells from different iPSC colonies and by the use of the human proximal tubule kidney cell line HK2. Indeed, OCRL1 KO led to both ciliogenesis defects and Six2 retention in the Golgi complex. In agreement with Six2's role in the suppression of ductal kidney lineages, cells from this pedigree were over-represented among patient kidney-reprogrammed cells. We speculate that this diminished efficacy to produce cap mesenchyme cells would cause LS patients to have difficulties in replenishing senescent or damaged cells derived from this lineage, particularly proximal tubule cells, leading to pathological scenarios such as tubular atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2786139684,"Objective Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, inhibits the endometrial cancer cell growth in vivo by improving the insulin resistance; however, its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and its inhibition restores the insulin resistance. This study investigated the antitumor effect of metformin on endometrial cancer with a focus on PP2A. Methods Metformin (1,500–2,250 mg/day) was preoperatively administered to patients with endometrial cancer for 4 to 6 weeks. Expression of the PP2A regulatory subunits, 4 (PPP2R4) and B (PP2A-B), was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using paired specimens obtained before and after metformin treatment. The effect of PPP2R4 inhibition with small interfering RNA was evaluated in the endometrial cancer cell lines HEC265 and HEC1B. P values of < .05 were considered statistically significant. Results Preoperative metformin treatment significantly reduced the expression of PP2A-B, as determined using IHC, and the mRNA expression of PPP2R4, as determined using RT–PCR, in the patients with endometrial cancer. However, metformin could not directly alter the PPP2R4 mRNA levels in the endometrial cancer cell lines in vitro. PPP2R4 knockdown reduced the proliferation and induced the apoptosis by activating caspases 3/7 in HEC265 and HEC1B cells. Conclusions Downregulation of the PP2A-B subunit, including PPP2R4, is an important indirect target of metformin. Inhibition of PP2A may be an option for the treatment of endometrial cancer patients with insulin resistance. Trial registration This trial is registered with UMIN-CTR (number UMIN000004852)."
https://openalex.org/W2790442136,"The role of interspecific social interactions during species invasions may be more decisive than previously thought. Research has revealed that invasive fish improve their foraging success by shoaling with native Mexican species, and potentially increase the chances of invasion success. However, do native individuals tend to associate with invaders as well? We tested the hypothesis that the twoline skiffia (Neotoca bilineata) and the Lerma livebearer (Poeciliopsis infans), both native endemic Mexican topminnows, will associate with guppies, a notorious invasive species present in Mexico. Our investigation shows that guppies, twoline skiffias and Lerma livebearers have a mutual tendency to associate with each other. Although there is a marked tendency to shoal with heterospecifics in this system, shoaling partners do not necessarily benefit equally from the association. Further research on invasive-native social interactions is needed to promote our understanding of potential facilitation by natives."

One disorder that shares clinical features with NPHP-RC is Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS). Serologically defined colon cancer antigen 8 (SDCCAG8; also known as NPHP10 and BBS16) is an NPHP gene that is also associated with BBS. To better understand the patho-mechanisms of NPHP and BBS caused by loss of SDCCAG8 function, we characterized an SDCCAG8 mouse model (Sdccag8Tn(sb-Tyr)2161B.CA1C2Ove) generated by Sleeping Beauty Transposon (SBT)-mediated insertion mutagenesis. Consistent with the previously reported, independent SDCCAG8 mouse models, our mutant mice display pre-axial polydactyly in their hind limbs. In addition, we report patterning defects in the secondary palate, brain abnormalities, as well as neonatal lethality associated with developmental defects in the lung in our mouse model. The neonatal lethality phenotype is genetic background dependent and rescued by introducing 129S6/SvEvTac background. Genetic modifier(s) responsible for this effect were mapped to a region between SNPs rs3714172 and rs3141832 on chromosome 11. While determining the precise genetic lesion in our mouse model, we found that SBT insertion resulted in a deletion of multiple exons from both Sdccag8 and its neighboring gene Akt3. We ascribe the patterning defects in the limb and the secondary palate as well as lung abnormalities to loss of SDCCAG8, while the developmental defects in the brain are likely due to the loss of AKT3. This mouse model may be useful to study features not observed in other SDCCAG8 models but cautions are needed in interpreting data."

Serum lipid levels have been related to depressive disorders, but very limited literatures are available regarding the lipid levels in women with postpartum depression. The present study is aimed to examine the association of serum lipids with the development of postpartum depressive symptoms. This is a cross sectional study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in South India. Women who came for postpartum check-up at 6th week post-delivery were screened for PPD (September 2014-October 2015). Women with depressive symptoms were assessed using EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). The study involved 186 cases and 250 controls matched for age and BMI. Serum levels of lipid parameters were estimated through spectrophotometry and the atherogenic indices were calculated in all the subjects. Low serum levels of Total Cholesterol (TC) and High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) were significantly low in PPD women with severe depressive symptoms. The study recorded a significant negative correlation between HDL-c and the EPDS score in PPD women (r = -0.140, p = 0.05). Interestingly, the study also observed a significant negative correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and EPDS scores in case group (r = -0.146, p = 0.047), whereas a positive correlation between the same in controls (r = 0.187, p = 0.004). Our study demonstrated that low levels of serum HDL-c is correlated with the development of severe depressive symptoms in postpartum women.

Eight physically active individuals (24 ± 3 years; 78.3 ± 8.7 kg; 179 ± 5 cm; 9.0 ± 2.5% body fat) performed four different efforts at constant intensity to exhaustion in order to determine CP and W’. The mechanical power values obtained were subsequently plotted with their corresponding time to exhaustion (limit time) for application of three mathematical models: power hyperbolic versus time limit (Hyp), linear power versus 1/time (P vs 1/t) and linear work versus time limit (Ԏ vs t). The 3MT test was carried out on the last day to determine end power (EP) and anaerobic capacity (WEP) using this methodology. EP value of 181.7 ± 52 was similar (p = 0.486) to 178.2 ± 61 (CP Hyp), 191.4 ± 55 (Ԏ vs t) and 188.3 ± 55 (P vs 1/t). WEP value of 17.9 ± 4.8 was not similar (p = 0.000) to 50.2 ± 15.3 (CP Hyp), 44.8 ± 8.7 (Ԏ vs t) and 45.5 ± 8.4 (P vs 1/t). Positive results (r = 0.78–0.98 and ICC = 0.88–0.99) of Pearson correlation and intraclass correlation (ICC–absolute agreement) were found for aerobic applications of conventional CP and 3MT. For anaerobic data, only the three models of conventional CP were correlated (r = 0.76–0.93); however, W’ from the three models was not correlated with WEP (r = 0.37–0.52). The results of this study suggest that 3MT in tethered running on non-motorized treadmills is a valid test for estimating CP aerobic parameters in a single day of application but not anaerobic parameters of W’."

Here, we present Waggawagga-CLI, a command-line tool for predicting and analysing SAH-domains in protein sequence datasets. Using Waggawagga-CLI we predicted SAH-domains in 24 datasets from eukaryotes across the tree of life. SAH-domains were predicted in 0.5 to 3.5% of the protein-coding content per species. SAH-domains are particularly present in longer proteins supporting their function as structural building block in multi-domain proteins. In human, SAH-domains are mainly used as alternative building blocks not being present in all transcripts of a gene. Gene ontology analysis showed that yeast proteins with SAH-domains are particular enriched in macromolecular complex subunit organization, cellular component biogenesis and RNA metabolic processes, and that they have a strong nuclear and ribonucleoprotein complex localization and function in ribosome and nucleic acid binding. Human proteins with SAH-domains have roles in all types of RNA processing and cytoskeleton organization, and are predicted to function in RNA binding, protein binding involved in cell and cell-cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal protein binding. Waggawagga-CLI allows the user to adjust the stabilizing and destabilizing contribution of amino acid interactions in i,i+3 and i,i+4 spacings, and provides extensive flexibility for user-designed analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2793757115,"HBV vaccine induces protective antibodies only in 23-56% of HIV-infected children. The aim of our study is to evaluate the immunologic effects of a booster dose of HBV vaccine in HIV-infected youth.53 young HIV-infected patients in whom HBV vaccination did not elicit protective Ab titers were enrolled. All patients were on ART with optimal immunological and viral response.All patients received a booster dose of HBV vaccine (HBVAXPRO 10 μg i.m.). HBV-specific Ab titer, viral load and CD4+ T cells were measured at baseline (T0), T1, T6 and T12 months. In a subgroup of 16 patients HBV-specific cell mediated immune responses were evaluated at baseline, at T1 and T6.The booster dose induced seroconversion in 51% of patients at T1, 57% at T6, and49% at T12; seroconversion rate was significantly correlated with CD4+T cells at T0 and to the CD4 nadir. The booster dose induced HBV-specific cell mediated immunity at T6 mainly in Responders (Rs): Effector Memory CD8+T cells, HBV-specific TNFα-, IFNγ-, granzyme secreting CD8+ T cells and IL2-secreting CD4+ T cells were significantly increased in Rs compared to T0. In Non Responders (NRs), HBV-specific IL2-secreting CD4+ T cells, Central and Effector Memory CD8+ T cells were the only parameters modified at T6.Seroconversion induced by a booster dose of vaccine correlates with the development of T cell immunological memory in HIV-infected patients who did not respond to the standard immunization. Alternate immunization schedules need to be considered in NRs."
https://openalex.org/W2794076904,"There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a genetically heterogeneous disease. However, the extent of this heterogeneity, and what observations may distinguish different forms, is unclear. One indicator may be T1D-related microvascular complications (MVCs), which are familial, but occur in some families, and not others. We tested the hypothesis that T1D plus MVC is genetically distinct from T1D without MCV. We studied 415 families (2,462 individuals, 896 with T1D) using genome-wide linkage analysis, comparing families with and without MVC. We also tested for interaction between identified loci and alleles at the HLA-DRB1 locus. We found significant linkage scores at 1p36.12, 1q32.1, 8q21.3, 12p11.21 and 22q11.21. In all regions except 1p36.12, linkage scores differed between MVC-based phenotype groups, suggesting that families with MVCs express different genetic influences than those without. Our linkage results also suggested gene-gene interaction between the above putative loci and the HLA region; HLA-based strata produced significantly increased linkage scores in some strata, but not others within a phenotype group. We conclude that families with type 1 diabetes plus MVCs are genetically different from those with diabetes alone."
https://openalex.org/W2786831445,"This study aimed to monitor the course of liver regeneration by multiparametric magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) after partial liver resection characterizing Small-for-Size Syndrome (SFSS), which frequently leads to fatal post-hepatectomy liver failure (PLF). Twenty-two C57BL/6 mice underwent either conventional 70% partial hepatectomy (cPH), extended 86% partial hepatectomy (ePH) or SHAM operation. Subsequent MRI scans on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 in a 4.7T MR Scanner quantified longitudinal and transverse relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the magnetization-transfer ratio (MTR) of the regenerating liver parenchyma. Histological examination was performed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. After hepatectomy, an increase of T1 time was detected being larger for ePH on day 1: 18% for cPH vs. 40% for ePH and on day 2: 24% for cPH vs. 49% for ePH. An increase in T2 time, again greater in ePH was most pronounced on day 5: 21% for cPH vs. 41% for ePH. ADC and MTR showed a decrease on day 1: 21% for ePH vs. 13% for cPH for ADC, 15% for ePH vs. 11% for cPH for MTR. Subsequently, all MR parameters converged towards initial values in surviving animals. Dying PLF animals exhibited the strongest increase of T1 relaxation time and most prominent decreases of ADC and MTR. The retrieved MRI biomarkers indicate SFSS and potentially developing PLF at an early stage, likely reflecting cellular hypertrophy with extended water content and concomitantly diluted cellular components as features of liver regeneration, appearing more intense in ePH as compared to cPH."
https://openalex.org/W2789002710,"Amphimeriasis, a fish-borne zoonotic disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp., has recently been reported as an emerging disease affecting an indigenous Ameridian group, the Chachi, living in Ecuador. The only method for diagnosing amphimeriasis was the microscopic detection of eggs from the parasite in patients' stool samples with very low sensitivity. Our group developed an ELISA technique for detection of anti-Amphimerus IgG in human sera and a molecular method based on LAMP technology (named LAMPhimerus) for specific and sensitive parasite DNA detection. The LAMPhimerus method showed to be much more sensitive than classical parasitological methods for amphimeriasis diagnosis using human stool samples for analysis. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using dried stool samples on filter paper as source of DNA in combination with the effectiveness of our previously designed LAMPhimerus assay for successfully Amphimerus sp. detection in clinical stool samples. A total of 102 untreated and undiluted stool samples collected from Chachi population were spread as thin layer onto common filter paper for easily transportation to our laboratory and stored at room temperature for one year until DNA extraction. When LAMPhimerus method was applied for Amphimerus sp. DNA detection, a higher number of positive results was detected (61/102; 59.80%) in comparison to parasitological methods (38/102; 37.25%), including 28/61 (45.90%) microscopy-confirmed Amphimerus sp. infections. The diagnostic parameters for the sensitivity and specificity werecalculated for our LAMPhimerus assay, which were 79.17% and 65.98%, respectively. We demonstrate, for the first time, that common filter paper is useful for easy collection and long-term storage of human stool samples for later DNA extraction and molecular analysis of human-parasitic trematode eggs. This simple, economic and easily handling method combined with the specific and sensible LAMPhimerus assay has the potential to beused as an effective molecular large-scale screening test for amphimeriasis-endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2793867007,"Real-time, quantitative measurement of muscle progenitor cell (myoblast) differentiation is an important tool for skeletal muscle research and identification of drugs that support skeletal muscle regeneration. While most quantitative tools rely on sacrificial approach, we developed a double fluorescent tagging approach, which allows for dynamic monitoring of myoblast differentiation through assessment of fusion index and nuclei count. Fluorescent tagging of both the cell cytoplasm and nucleus enables monitoring of cell fusion and the formation of new myotube fibers, similar to immunostaining results. This labeling approach allowed monitoring the effects of Myf5 overexpression, TNFα, and Wnt agonist on myoblast differentiation. It also enabled testing the effects of surface coating on the fusion levels of scaffold-seeded myoblasts. The double fluorescent labeling of myoblasts is a promising technique to visualize even minor changes in myogenesis of myoblasts in order to support applications such as tissue engineering and drug screening."
https://openalex.org/W2786723715,"To utilize Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the quantification of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to evaluate the combined use of multiple types of quantification.Eighty-seven patients (67 men, 20 women; age, 67.4 ± 11.0 years) who had undergone computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function test (PFT) were included. The heterogeneity of CT attenuation in emphysema (HC) was obtained by analyzing a distribution of CT attenuation with GMM. The percentages of low-attenuation volume in the lungs (LAV), wall area of bronchi (WA), and the cross-sectional area of small pulmonary vessels (CSA) were also calculated. The relationships between COPD quantifications and the PFT results were evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficients and through linear models, with the best models selected using Akaike information criterion (AIC).The correlation coefficients with FEV1 were as follows: LAV, -0.505; HC, -0.277; CSA, 0.384; WA, -0.196. The correlation coefficients with FEV1/FVC were: LAV, -0.640; HC, -0.136; CSA, 0.288; WA, -0.131. For predicting FEV1, the smallest AIC values were obtained in the model with LAV, HC, CSA, and WA. For predicting FEV1/FVC, the smallest AIC values were obtained in the model with LAV and HC. In both models, the coefficient of HC was statistically significant (P-values = 0.000880 and 0.0441 for FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, respectively).GMM was applied to COPD quantification. The results of this study show that COPD severity was associated with HC. In addition, it is shown that the combined use of multiple types of quantification made the evaluation of COPD severity more reliable."
https://openalex.org/W2785443528,"To understand the neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of crossing nerve transfer for brachial plexus injuries in human patients, we investigated the cortical responses after crossing nerve transfer in mice using conventional and tomographic optical imaging. The distal cut ends of the left median and ulnar nerves were connected to the central cut ends of the right median and ulnar nerves with a sciatic nerve graft at 8 weeks of age. Eight weeks after the operation, the responses in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) elicited by vibratory stimulation applied to the left forepaw were visualized based on activity-dependent flavoprotein fluorescence changes. In untreated mice, the cortical responses to left forepaw stimulation were mainly observed in the right S1. In mice with nerve crossing transfer, cortical responses to left forepaw stimulation were observed in the left S1 together with clear cortical responses in the right S1. We expected that the right S1 responses in the untreated mice were produced by thalamic inputs to layer IV, whereas those in the operated mice were mediated by callosal inputs from the left S1 to layer II/III of the right S1. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed tomographic imaging of flavoprotein fluorescence responses by macroconfocal microscopy. Flavoprotein fluorescence responses in layer IV were dominant compared to those in layer II/III in untreated mice. In contrast, responses in layer II/III were dominant compared to those in layer IV in operated mice. The peak latency of the cortical responses in the operated mice was longer than that in the untreated mice. These results confirmed our expectation that drastic reorganization in the cortical circuits was induced after crossing nerve transfer in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2792497560,"[11C]CURB is a novel irreversible radioligand for imaging fatty acid amide hydrolase in the human brain. In the present work, we validate an algorithm for generating parametric map images of [11C]CURB acquired with a high resolution research tomograph (HRRT) scanner. This algorithm applies the basis function method on an irreversible two-tissue compartment model (k4 = 0) with arterial input function, i.e., BAFPIC. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to assess bias and variability of the binding macroparameters (Ki and λk3) as a function of the voxel noise level and the range of basis functions. The results show that for a [11C]CURB time activity curve with noise levels corresponding to a voxel of an image acquired with the HRRT and reconstructed with the filtered back projection algorithm, the implementation of BAFPIC requires the use of a constant vascular fraction of tissue (5%) and a cutoff for slow frequencies (0.06 min-1). With these settings, BAFPIC maintains the probabilistic distributions of the binding macroparameters with approximately Gaussian shape and minimizes the bias and variability for large physiological ranges of the rate constants of [11C]CURB. BAFPIC reduces the variability of Ki to a third of that given by Patlak plot, the standard graphical method for irreversible radioligands. Application to real data demonstrated an excellent correlation between region of interest and BAFPIC parametric data and agreed with the simulations results. Therefore, BAFPIC with a constant vascular fraction can be used to generate parametric maps of [11C]CURB images acquired with an HRRT provided that the limits of the basis functions are carefully selected."
https://openalex.org/W2793235532,"Surveillance computed tomography (CT) is usual practice for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) in complete remission (CR). However, evidence to support this strategy is lacking. We retrospectively analyzed our institutional lymphoma registry, including patients with lymphoma consecutively enrolled from June 1995 to October 2016. Of 1,385 patients with aNHL, 664 achieved CR and were followed up with or without surveillance CT. Surveillance CT was performed for 609 patients every 3 or 6 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 or 12 months thereafter. Relapse was detected in 171 patients, of whom 152 underwent surveillance CT during follow-up. Of these 152 patients, asymptomatic relapse was detected in 67 (44%) using surveillance CT, and symptomatic relapse outside the surveillance interval was detected in the remaining 85 (56%). Detection of asymptomatic relapse using surveillance CT did not improve the overall or post-relapse survival in patients with relapsed aNHL. Surveillance CT interval (3 or 6 months) did not affect survival. No subgroups were identified that favored the use of surveillance CT to detect relapse. The results of this study suggest that routine surveillance CT in patients with aNHL to detect asymptomatic relapse might have a limited role in improving survival. CT is recommended when a relapse is clinically suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2787312847,"NutramilTM Complex is a multicomponent food product that meets the requirements of a food for special medical purpose. As a complete, high-energy diet it consists of properly balanced nutrients, vitamins and minerals. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of NutramilTM Complex on breast and prostate carcinoma cells. Our results showed that NutramilTM Complex reduced the viability and proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells and that this process was associated with the induction of apoptosis via activation of caspase signalling. Data showed elevated levels of p53 tumour suppressor, up-regulation of p38 MAPK and SAPK / JNK proteins and downregulation of anti-apoptotic ERK1/2, AKT1 and HSP27. Treatment with NutramilTM Complex also affected the expression of the BCL2 family genes. Results also showed down-regulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic members such as BAX, BAD, BID. In addition, we also observed regulation of many other genes, including Iκβα, Chk1 and Chk2, associated with apoptotic events. Taken together, our results suggest activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as most likely mechanism of anti-carcinogenic activity of NutramilTM Complex."
