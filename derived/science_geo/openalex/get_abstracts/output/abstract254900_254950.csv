The neural mechanisms by which the brain detects and resolves emotional conflict are still largely unknown, however. Drawing on the classic Stroop conflict task, we developed a protocol that allowed us to dissociate the generation and monitoring of emotional conflict from its resolution. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we find that activity in the amygdala and dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices reflects the amount of emotional conflict. By contrast, the resolution of emotional conflict is associated with activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Activation of the rostral cingulate is predicted by the amount of previous-trial conflict-related neural activity and is accompanied by a simultaneous and correlated reduction of amygdalar activity. These data suggest that emotional conflict is resolved through top-down inhibition of amygdalar activity by the rostral cingulate cortex.

The Principles of Psychology. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1890Crossref Google Scholar), we are exposed, in our everyday life, to a larger number of sensory stimuli than we can dedicate processing resources to. As a result, we engage attentional mechanisms to prioritize processing and diminish distraction by stimuli irrelevant to the task at hand (Broadbent, 1958Broadbent D.E. Perception and Communication. Pergamon, London1958Crossref Google Scholar). To ensure optimal performance, the brain is thought to resolve “conflict” by monitoring continuously for distracters that produce responses that are incompatible with the current task (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring and cognitive control.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 624-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (4797) Google Scholar). Emotionally salient stimuli, such as those that signal potential danger, are particularly effective in interfering with ongoing cognitive processing (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E.

Orienting to exogenous cues and attentional bias to affective pictures reflect separate processes.Br. J. Psychol. 2000; 91: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, despite the important role that control over the effects of emotional distracters plays in both normal functioning and in clinical mood and anxiety disorders (Mathews, 1990Mathews A. Why worry? The cognitive function of anxiety.Behav. Res. Ther. 1990; 28: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, Mathews and MacLeod, 1985Mathews A. MacLeod C. Selective processing of threat cues in anxiety states.Behav. Res. Ther. 1985; 23: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), the neural mechanisms by which emotional conflict is monitored and resolved are largely unknown. This stands in sharp contrast to nonemotional (cognitive) conflict, where extensive knowledge already exists. Here, we exploit some of the methodological insights gained from the study of cognitive conflict resolution and apply them to emotional conflict. The classic paradigm for studying nonemotional conflict is the color-word Stroop task (MacLeod, 1991MacLeod C.M. Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: an integrative review.Psychol. Bull. 1991; 109: 163-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3816) Google Scholar, Stroop, 1935Stroop J.R. Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions.J. Exp. Psychol. 1935; 18: 643-662Crossref Scopus (11808) Google Scholar). In this task, subjects are asked to indicate the type-face (ink) color of a word (e.g., “green” or “red”) that is also the name of a color (e.g., “RED” or “GREEN”). When the ink color and the word meaning are not the same (i.e., incongruent), processing of the word meaning and the ink color lead to different, incompatible responses, thereby generating conflict and slowing reaction times. In the Stroop task, therefore, semantic incompatibility between the task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions produces response conflict. Previous studies of emotional conflict employed a different form of the Stroop task, the “emotional Stroop” task. In this task, subjects are asked to identify the ink color of words that are either emotionally neutral (e.g., “apple”) or emotionally salient (e.g., “death”) (Mathews and MacLeod, 1985Mathews A. MacLeod C. Selective processing of threat cues in anxiety states.Behav. Res. Ther. 1985; 23: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, McKenna, 1986McKenna F.P. Effects of unattended emotional stimuli on color-naming performance.Curr. Psychol. Res. Rev. 1986; 5: 3-9Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Slowing of reaction times for color naming of emotional words relative to neutral words serves as a measure of emotional interference. The emotional Stroop task, however, is not thought to assess directly the interference of emotional processing with cognitive processing. Rather it assesses the ability of emotional stimuli, processed in parallel, to withdraw attention from the main task. This is because the meaning of the emotional word stimuli is neither semantically related to the task-relevant information (ink color) nor does it lead to responses that directly compete with the selection of the correct response (Algom et al., 2004Algom D. Chajut E. Lev S. A rational look at the emotional stroop phenomenon: a generic slowdown, not a stroop effect.J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 2004; 133: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The traditional emotional Stroop task, therefore, does not provide a measure of emotional conflict comparable to the measure of cognitive conflict provided by the classic color-word Stroop task. Moreover, in normal subjects, behavioral interference by these emotional distracters is either not detected at all (Williams et al., 1996Williams J.M. Mathews A. MacLeod C. The emotional Stroop task and psychopathology.Psychol. Bull. 1996; 120: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar) or habituates very rapidly (Compton et al., 2003Compton R.J. Banich M.T. Mohanty A. Milham M.P. Herrington J. Miller G.A. Scalf P.E. Webb A. Heller W. Paying attention to emotion: an fMRI investigation of cognitive and emotional stroop tasks.Cogn. Affect. Behav.

Rev. 1986; 5: 3-9Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Such lack of reliable behavioral effects limits the conclusions that can be drawn from previous imaging studies that used emotional Stroop-like tasks (Bishop et al., 2004Bishop S. Duncan J. Brett M. Lawrence A.D. Prefrontal cortical function and anxiety: controlling attention to threat-related stimuli.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, Compton et al., 2003Compton R.J. Banich M.T. Mohanty A. Milham M.P. Herrington J. Miller G.A. Scalf P.E. Webb A. Heller W.

To assess more directly the effects of emotional conflict, we developed a paradigm in which emotional conflict arises from incompatibility between the task-relevant and task-irrelevant emotional dimensions of a stimulus. We modified the classic color-word Stroop paradigm and developed an emotional conflict task in which faces with fearful and happy expressions were presented with the words “happy” or “fear” written across them (cf. Carroll and Young, 2005Carroll N.C. Young A.W. Priming of emotion recognition.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. A. 2005; 58: 1173-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We then asked subjects to identify the emotional expression of the faces while ignoring the words, which were either congruent or incongruent with the facial expression (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 1 for example stimuli). Incongruent stimuli were thus associated with response conflict that arose from an emotional incompatibility between task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions (e.g., a fearful expression with the word “happy”). Our emotional conflict task therefore represents an appropriate emotional analog to the color-word Stroop task (Algom et al., 2004Algom D. Chajut E. Lev S. A rational look at the emotional stroop phenomenon: a generic slowdown, not a stroop effect.J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 2004; 133: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The anterior cingulate cortex has frequently been thought to play a critical role in executive attention (Botvinick et al., 2004Botvinick M.M. Cohen J.D. Carter C.S.

The role of the medial frontal cortex in cognitive control.Science. 2004; 306: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar). Examination of cytoarchitecture and connectivity patterns, as well as lesion and imaging studies, however, has led some authors to divide the anterior cingulate cortex into a dorsal “cognitive” division and a ventral “affective” division (Bush et al., 2000Bush G.

Functional heterogeneity in cingulate cortex: the anterior executive and posterior evaluative regions.Cereb. Cortex. 1992; 2: 435-443PubMed Google Scholar). The dorsal cingulate and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are connected with “cognitive” regions such as the lateral prefrontal and motor/premotor cortices (van Hoesen et al., 1993van Hoesen G.W. Morecraft R.J. Vogt B.A. Connections of the Monkey Cingulate Cortex.in: Vogt B.A. Gabriel M. Neurobiology of Cingulate Cortex and Limbic Thalamus: A Comprehensive Handbook. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1993: 249-284Crossref Google Scholar). The ventral division, composed of rostral (pregenual) and subgenual components, is connected with “affective” regions such as the amygdala (Carmichael and Price, 1995Carmichael S.T. Price J.L.

Birkhauser, Boston, MA1993: 249-284Crossref Google Scholar). The dorsal and ventral divisions of the anterior cingulate are also interconnected with each other (Musil and Olson, 1988aMusil S.Y.

Birkhauser, Boston, MA1993: 249-284Crossref Google Scholar). Response conflict on cognitive tasks commonly activates the dorsal division of the anterior cingulate and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Botvinick et al., 2004Botvinick M.M. Cohen J.D.

The role of the medial frontal cortex in cognitive control.Science. 2004; 306: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar). It was uncertain, however, whether these regions were responsible for monitoring or for resolving conflict, and thus resolution of this issue required an experimental paradigm capable of dissociating conflict monitoring from conflict resolution (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M.

Such a dissociation can be achieved by examining the behavioral effects of trial sequence, and these studies reveal that there is less reaction time interference (i.e., less conflict) for incongruent trials if they are preceded by an incongruent trial than if they are preceded by a congruent trial (Botvinick et al., 1999Botvinick M.

Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control.Science. 2004; 303: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the conflict generated by an immediately prior incongruent trial activates an anticipatory mechanism, which leads to improved conflict resolution on the next trial (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring and cognitive control.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 624-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (4797) Google Scholar). Incongruent trials can thus be separated depending on whether they are associated with high conflict resolution and consequently less conflict (an incongruent trial preceded by an incongruent trial) or low conflict resolution and thus more conflict (an incongruent trial preceded by a congruent trial). Neural activity in regions responsible for either generating or monitoring conflict should reflect the amount of behavioral conflict, resulting in higher activity for low conflict resolution trials in these regions, while in brain regions implicated in conflict resolution, reduced conflict should be associated with increased neural activity. This distinction between otherwise identical incongruent trials allows for a dissociation between conflict generating/monitoring and conflict resolving processes. Indeed, a series of recent neuroimaging studies have found activity in the dorsal cingulate and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex associated with the monitoring of conflict, whereas activity in the lateral prefrontal cortices was associated with the resolution of conflict (Botvinick et al., 1999Botvinick M.

Cognitive control mechanisms resolve conflict through cortical amplification of task-relevant information.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1784-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The dorsal cingulate most likely does not constitute a functionally homogenous region. The dorsal cingulate and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, for example, have additional roles in general outcome evaluation (Rushworth et al., 2004Rushworth M.F. Walton M.E. Kennerley S.W.

In contrast to the understanding we now have of cognitive conflict, emotional conflict has not been comparably investigated. A variety of tasks involving emotional processing in general (Bush et al., 2000Bush G. Luu P. Posner M.I. Cognitive and emotional influences in anterior cingulate cortex.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2000; 4: 215-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar), the processing of emotional distracters (Vuilleumier et al., 2001Vuilleumier P. Armony J.L. Driver J.

By extrapolation from the involvement of the dorsal cingulate in the processing of cognitive conflict, the rostral and subgenual cingulate have been thought to play a role in processing emotional conflict (Bishop et al., 2004Bishop S.

The exact function of the rostral cingulate in emotional conflict, therefore, remains unclear. We wanted to determine whether the rostral cingulate acts as the emotional analog to the dorsal cingulate by monitoring emotional conflict, as has been suggested by some investigators (Bishop et al., 2004Bishop S. Duncan J. Brett M. Lawrence A.D. Prefrontal cortical function and anxiety: controlling attention to threat-related stimuli.Nat.

Psychiatry. 1998; 44: 1219-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), or whether it plays a different role, for instance by resolving emotional conflict. In the current study, we distinguished between trials of high and low conflict resolution to differentiate the neural processes that track emotional conflict (because they are involved in conflict generation or monitoring) from those associated with emotional conflict resolution. We expected that the emotional nature of the stimuli will recruit regions such as the amygdala and rostral cingulate. We also reasoned that because emotional conflict in our task results in response conflict, regions involved in processing response conflict may also be activated. After determining which regions tracked emotional conflict and which regions were involved in emotional conflict resolution, we turned our attention to their functional interconnectivity. We specifically tested whether neural conflict resolution would be recruited in a flexible manner on the current trial, to the degree appropriate for the amount of conflict signaled by conflict-tracking regions on the previous trial (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M.

Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control.Science. 2004; 303: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Finally, for conflict resolution to be successful, the regions underlying conflict resolution must in turn regulate the source of the emotional conflict. Thus, we examined whether increased activity in regions involved in conflict resolution was associated with decreased activity in upstream regions involved in conflict processing. We carried out the emotional conflict task on a group of 19 healthy volunteers and, based on reaction times, found robust behavioral interference associated with emotional conflict in every subject (all incongruent versus congruent trials, p = 0.0000002; Figure 2A). A similar effect was seen for accuracy (p = 0.0001, Figure 2B), indicating that the reaction-time effect was not a result of a speed-accuracy tradeoff. We next compared reaction times on low conflict resolution trials (incongruent trials that followed congruent ones) with high conflict resolution trials (incongruent trials that followed incongruent ones). The data showed reduced reaction time interference during high conflict resolution trials (p = 0.01, Figure 2A), consistent with activation of an anticipatory mechanism by the previous incongruent trial, which bolstered conflict resolution on the current trial (previous × current trial ANOVA p = 0.03; Figure 2A). A similar effect was evident at a trend level for accuracy (p = 0.096; Figure 2B). Also, as seen in Figure 2C, no reaction time differences were seen between presentation of fearful and happy faces (p = 0.76) or words (p = 0.54), which were counterbalanced across congruency conditions, suggesting that behavior in this task was driven primarily by emotional conflict. Finally, since high conflict resolution trials entailed a repetition of an incongruent stimulus, which does not occur on low conflict resolution trials, it remained a possibility that repetition priming rather than conflict resolution could mediate faster reaction times in high conflict resolution trials (Mayr et al., 2003Mayr U. Awh E. Laurey P. Conflict adaptation effects in the absence of executive control.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 450-452PubMed Google Scholar). In designing the task we avoided direct stimulus repetition. However, we could not avoid repetition of the stimulus category in some high"

While leptin receptor (Lepr) function has been well studied in the hypothalamus, the functional relevance of Lepr expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) has not been investigated. The VTA contains dopamine neurons that are important in modulating motivated behavior, addiction, and reward. Here, we show that VTA dopamine neurons express Lepr mRNA and respond to leptin with activation of an intracellular JAK-STAT pathway and a reduction in firing rate. Direct administration of leptin to the VTA caused decreased food intake while long-term RNAi-mediated knockdown of Lepr in the VTA led to increased food intake, locomotor activity, and sensitivity to highly palatable food. These data support a critical role for VTA Lepr in regulating feeding behavior and provide functional evidence for direct action of a peripheral metabolic signal on VTA dopamine neurons.

These data support a critical role for VTA Lepr in regulating feeding behavior and provide functional evidence for direct action of a peripheral metabolic signal on VTA dopamine neurons. An imbalance between the natural drive to feed and excess resources has contributed to the increased rates of obesity (Mokdad et al., 2003Mokdad A.H. Ford E.S. Bowman B.A. Dietz W.H. Vinicor F. Bales V.S. Marks J.S. Prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and obesity-related health risk factors, 2001.JAMA. 2003; 289: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (4322) Google Scholar). In order to understand this problem and to design effective treatments, the molecular and neural mechanisms by which the brain regulates food intake need to be better defined. In the last ten years, great progress has been made in the identification of peripheral signals that communicate metabolic information to the brain. In particular, the identification of leptin, the gene mutated in the obese (ob) mouse, initiated a highly productive stage of feeding research. Leptin is a secreted protein expressed in adipocytes and is a critical signal that conveys levels of peripheral fat stores to the brain (Frederich et al., 1995Frederich R.C. Lollmann B. Hamann A. Napolitano-Rosen A. Kahn B.B. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. Expression of ob mRNA and its encoded protein in rodents. Impact of nutrition and obesity.J. Clin.

Localization of leptin receptor mRNA expression in mouse brain.Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2635-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An elegant model has been proposed whereby Lepr activity inhibits the orexigenic neurons while exciting the anorexigenic neurons within the arcuate nucleus (Cowley et al., 2001Cowley M.A. Smart J.L. Rubinstein M. Cerdan M.G. Diano S. Horvath T.L. Cone R.D. Low M.J.

Ongoing work is identifying the role that hypothalamic neuronal populations play in controlling metabolism and body weight in response to leptin (Balthasar et al., 2004Balthasar N. Coppari R.

While most studies have investigated leptin signaling in the hypothalamus, there is evidence that leptin has direct effects in other brain regions. Extrahypothalamic Lepr expression is seen in the hippocampus, brain stem, cortex, and midbrain (Elmquist et al., 1998Elmquist J.K. Bjorbaek C. Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Saper C.B. Distributions of leptin receptor mRNA isoforms in the rat brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 395: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Moreover, leptin administration to the brain stem has been shown to modulate feeding behavior (Grill et al., 2002Grill H.J. Schwartz M.W. Kaplan J.M. Foxhall J.S. Breininger J. Baskin D.G. Evidence that the caudal brainstem is a target for the inhibitory effect of leptin on food intake.Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), while administration to the hippocampus enhances synaptic plasticity (Shanley et al., 2001Shanley L.J. Irving A.J. Harvey J. Leptin enhances NMDA receptor function and modulates hippocampal synaptic plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC186PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that leptin function can be mediated via direct signaling to extrahypothalamic regions of the brain. Expression of Lepr in the dopamine neurons of the midbrain (Figlewicz et al., 2003Figlewicz D.P. Evans S.B. Murphy J. Hoen M. Baskin D.G.

Intriguingly, existing data demonstrate that leptin is able to modulate reward-seeking behavior and drug relapse (Figlewicz et al., 2004Figlewicz D.P. Bennett J. Evans S.B. Kaiyala K. Sipols A.J.

Leptin attenuates acute food deprivation-induced relapse to heroin seeking.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC129PubMed Google Scholar), behaviors known to depend on the function of mesolimbic dopamine circuits. Likewise, changes in leptin levels could affect feeding behavior via direct action on VTA dopamine neurons. Here, we present data demonstrating that Lepr-mediated signaling occurs in dopamine neurons and that modulation of VTA Lepr signaling can modify dopamine neuron activity and food intake. Previous work using fluorescent immunohistochemistry suggested that the Lepr protein is expressed within dopamine neurons of the VTA (Figlewicz et al., 2003Figlewicz D.P. Evans S.B. Murphy J. Hoen M. Baskin D.G. Expression of receptors for insulin and leptin in the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra (VTA/SN) of the rat.Brain Res. 2003; 964: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We used double-label fluorescent in situ hybridization to identify the transcripts of both Lepr and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) simultaneously. TH is an enzyme in the dopamine synthesis pathway and therefore serves as a marker of dopamine neurons. We observed staining of both Lepr mRNA and TH mRNA within the VTA (Figure 1A). Extensive colocalization of Lepr and TH is apparent under high magnification (Figure 1B), suggesting that Lepr mRNA is expressed in dopamine neurons. While it remains possible that some nondopaminergic neurons (e.g., GABAergic interneurons) in the VTA express Lepr, >90% of neurons with Lepr mRNA are dopamine neurons (Figure 1B). In addition, ∼60% of the dopamine neurons express detectable Lepr mRNA (Figure 1). These Lepr mRNA localization results, together with previous protein localization data (Figlewicz et al., 2003Figlewicz D.P. Evans S.B. Murphy J. Hoen M. Baskin D.G. Expression of receptors for insulin and leptin in the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra (VTA/SN) of the rat.Brain Res. 2003; 964: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), suggest that leptin could have a major impact on overall VTA function. In order to assess whether VTA Lepr is functional, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was evaluated with phosphoprotein analysis. This signaling cascade is activated upon leptin binding to Lepr in the hypothalamus (Ghilardi et al., 1996Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R. Heim M.H. Skoda R.C. Defective STAT signaling by the leptin receptor in diabetic mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, Vaisse et al., 1996Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Leptin activation of Stat3 in the hypothalamus of wild-type and ob/ob mice but not db/db mice.Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), resulting in the phosphorylation of STAT3. Mice with point mutations in Lepr that block the binding and phosphorylation of STAT3 become severely hyperphagic and obese, a phenotype that closely resembles mice with a Lepr null mutation (Bates et al., 2003Bates S.H. Stearns W.H. Dundon T.A. Schubert M. Tso A.W. Wang Y. Banks A.S. Lavery H.J. Haq A.K. Maratos-Flier E. et al.STAT3 signalling is required for leptin regulation of energy balance but not reproduction.Nature. 2003; 421: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). To determine if leptin causes phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) in the VTA, animals were injected with leptin (3 mg/kg intraperitoneal, within dose-response range for phosphorylation of hypothalamic STAT3, see Vaisse et al., 1996Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Leptin activation of Stat3 in the hypothalamus of wild-type and ob/ob mice but not db/db mice.Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis on VTA tissue collected 2 hr after leptin administration revealed increased phosphorylation of pSTAT3 at tyrosine residue 705 (Figure 2A). Although this phosphorylation data suggest that circulating leptin can activate part of the JAK-STAT pathway in the VTA, we could not rule out indirect activation of JAK-STAT as a result of primary leptin action on the hypothalamus. To asses whether leptin can directly increase phosphorylation of VTA STAT3, leptin was delivered directly to the VTA of rats via surgically implanted bilateral cannulae. Robust pSTAT3 labeling was observed within the VTA 45 min after infusion of leptin (Figure 2B; see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Moreover, the pSTAT3 staining was found in TH-positive neurons, indicating that the dopamine neurons are the primary population of neurons responding to the administered leptin, in agreement with the localization of Lepr on TH-positive neurons. These data indicate that leptin can directly activate the JAK-STAT pathway within VTA dopamine neurons. In order to more effectively quantify the cell populations responding to the leptin, we assessed pSTAT3/TH colocalization throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the VTA following intracerebroventricular (ICV) leptin infusions (Figure 2C). A survey indicated that most, but not all, of the VTA neurons responding were dopaminergic: at −5.2 bregma, 82% (73/89) were TH positive; at −5.6 bregma, 80% (80/100) were TH positive; at −6.0 bregma, 95% (95/100) were TH positive. To evaluate the role of Lepr signaling in the VTA, a series of doses of leptin (100 ng, 330 ng, or 1 μg, based on data from Grill et al., 2002Grill H.J. Schwartz M.W. Kaplan J.M. Foxhall J.S. Breininger J. Baskin D.G.

Ogawa Y. Katsuura G. Hayase M. Tsuji T. Imagawa K. Yoshimasa Y. Nishi S. Hosoda K. Nakao K. The arcuate nucleus as a primary site of satiety effect of leptin in rats.Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 224: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was administered to the VTA, and food consumption was monitored over a 24 hr period beginning at the onset of the dark cycle. A summary of cannula placements used in this analysis is shown in Figure S2. All doses of leptin caused a significant decrease in food intake over the first 4 hr (treatment main effect, F(3,71) = 15.18, p < 0.001; treatment x time interaction, F(6,194) = 2.3, p < 0.05; Figure 3A), and the suppression of feeding was maintained over 24 hr of cumulative food intake. Infusion of 330 ng (165 ng/side) of leptin inhibited food intake by approximately 30% over the first 2 hr of feeding. Doses higher than 330 ng did not further inhibit feeding, suggesting a maximal leptin effect at this dose range. The observed decrease in food intake is consistent with the anorectic effects of systemic or ICV leptin (Halaas et al., 1995Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D.

Metab. Res. 1996; 28: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The VTA also has a role in controlling locomotor and exploratory behavior (Badiani et al., 1995Badiani A. Leone P. Stewart J. Intra-VTA injections of the mu-opioid antagonist CTOP enhance locomotor activity.Brain Res. 1995; 690: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Mogenson and Yang, 1991Mogenson G.J.

Biol. 1991; 295: 267-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that Lepr signaling to midbrain dopamine neurons could effect general activity. To address this question, ambulation was measured following delivery of leptin to the VTA. At the onset of the dark cycle, rats received either vehicle alone or 1 μg (500 ng/side) of leptin directly to the VTA, and their activity was assessed. No significant differences in the number of beam breaks were observed over a 3 hr period following the infusions (Figure 3B), suggesting that the changes in feeding were not the result of alterations in general locomotor activity. To test if circulating leptin could affect the electrophysiological properties of neurons in the VTA, the frequency of dopamine cell firing was observed following leptin administration. Extracellular, single-unit recordings were made in the VTA of anesthetized rats before and after intravenous delivery of 2 mg/kg leptin. Dopamine neurons were identified by use of characteristic electrophysiological properties (Henry et al., 1989Henry D.J. Greene M.A. White F.J.

Uniform inhibition of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area by aversive stimuli.Science. 2004; 303: 2040-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures for details), and anatomical placement was confirmed by histological analysis (Figure S3). Leptin caused an ∼40% decrease in the frequency of dopamine cell firing when compared to baseline or saline (treatment main effect, F(1,66) = 8.65; p < 0.001; Figure 4). This effect appeared 10 min after leptin delivery and remained consistent up to 35 min (time main effect, F(5,41) = 5.1, p < 0.001; treatment × time interaction, F(5,66) = 2.01, p = 0.08; Figure 4). The decrease in firing rate was not due to reduced recording stability, as activity was stable over time for animals receiving saline (Figure 4, white bars; time main effect, F(5,25) = 0.5, p = 0.81). While the animal studies are consistent with leptin action in VTA neurons, it is possible that the changes in activity are secondary to direct action in the hypothalamus. Experiments were performed to examine if leptin directly influences the electrophysiological responses of dopamine neurons by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the VTA of brain slices (Figure 5). Dopamine neurons under electrophysiological analysis were within the boundaries of the VTA and were identified based on their characteristic hyperpolarization-activated (Ih) current (Johnson and North, 1992Johnson S.W. North R.A. Opioids excite dopamine neurons by hyperpolarization of local interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 483-488PubMed Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2005Liu Q.S. Pu L. Poo M.M. Repeated cocaine exposure in vivo facilitates LTP induction in midbrain dopamine neurons.Nature. 2005; 437: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Spontaneous action potentials were recorded in dopamine neurons under current clamp after their identities were confirmed. The average frequency of action potentials in all tested dopamine neurons was 2.8 ± 0.8 Hz (n = 9). After at least 10 min of stable recording of action potentials, leptin (100 nM, as used by Cowley et al., 2001Cowley M.A. Smart J.L. Rubinstein M. Cerdan M.G. Diano S. Horvath T.L. Cone R.D. Low M.J. Leptin activates anorexigenic POMC neurons through a neural network in the arcuate nucleus.Nature. 2001; 411: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar) was applied to the recorded dopamine neurons via bath application. Leptin induced a fast and reversible reduction of the frequency of action potentials in dopamine neurons (Figure 5B). The frequency of action potential was reduced to 79.7% ± 6.6% of control in the presence of leptin and 103.8% ± 7.5% of control after the withdrawal of leptin (Figure 5C). The reduction of the frequency of action potentials was significant (F(1,25) = 5.43, p < 0.05). The presence of leptin caused a modest, but not significant, hyperpolarization in membrane potential (control, −43.8 ± 1.3 mV; 100 nM leptin, −44.7 ± 1.2 mV; n = 9; p > 0.05 by t test). This response suggests that leptin can modify VTA dopamine neuron excitability via direct action that is independent of the hypothalamus. To complement the leptin administration studies, a rat genetic model with reduced Lepr expression was developed. Viral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) was used to generate rats with conditional gene knockdown of Lepr specifically in the VTA. Adenoassociated virus (AAV) vectors were engineered to express either a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Lepr mRNA (AAV-shLEPR), or a shRNA that does not have an endogenous mRNA target to serve as a negative control (AAV-shCTRL). This strategy offers both spatial and temporal control of gene knockdown and has been shown to be effective in mouse VTA dopamine neurons (Hommel et al., 2003Hommel J.D. Sears R.M. Georgescu D. Simmons D.L. DiLeone R.J. Local gene knockdown in the brain using viral-mediated RNA interference.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Incorporation of an EGFP marker into the viral construct allowed the regions of infection to be accurately identified. Fluorescent microscopy analysis demonstrated that the AAV efficiently infects rat VTA and that a high population of dopamine neurons are infected (Figure 6A). Animals with infection limited to the VTA were chosen for the final data analysis (see Figure S4). AAV-shLEPR or AAV-shCTRL was administered directly into the VTA of rats, resulting in Lepr conditional knockdown (LEPRVTA) and control (CTRLVTA) animals, respectively. A reduction in Lepr mRNA levels in LEPRVTA, but not CTRLVTA, rats was demonstrated by in situ hybridization analysis of the VTA (Figure 6B). To evaluate changes in behavior, a set of rats was infused bilaterally with either AAV-shLEPR or AAV-shCTRL. Following infusion, food intake and body weight measurements over a 30 day period revealed that LEPRVTA animals increased their food intake compared to CTRLVTA animals (AAV-shLEPR treatment main effect, F(1,20) = 4.26, p < 0.05; Figure 6C). The LEPRVTA animals began to show increased feeding between the second and third week following viral delivery, consistent with the time of peak AAV expression and RNAi-mediated knockdown within VTA neurons (Hommel et al., 2003Hommel J.D. Sears R.M. Georgescu D. Simmons D.L. DiLeone R.J. Local gene knockdown in the brain using viral-mediated RNA interference.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Despite the increase in food intake, no change was observed in the average body weight of LEPRVTA animals (Figure 6D). In addition, LEPRVTA rats had a 3- to 5-fold increase in ambulatory beam breaks when compared to CTRLVTA rats, with the differences apparent during the dark (active) cycle (Figure 6E) . Following the food intake measurements of the CTRLVTA and LEPRVTA rats, we tested the same animals for responses to a sucrose solution and high-fat food. In the sucrose-sensitivity test, animals were maintained in their home cage and given a choice between two bottles: one bottle contained water and the other bottle a low concentration of sucrose (0.2% w/v) which is not high enough to produce a significant preference in CTRLVTA animals. However, the LEPRVTA rats exhibited increased sensitivity to sucrose, as they consumed 50% more of the 0.2% sucrose solution than water alone (Figure 7A). To assess feeding responses to fat, LEPRVTA and CTRLVTA rats were switched from standard rodent chow to a high-fat rodent chow (45% calories from fat). LEPRVTA rats significantly increased their food intake over the first three days of being presented with a high-fat diet, while CTRLVTA rats did not alter their food intake (in grams) when switched to a high-fat diet. LEPRVTA rats returned to their baseline intake during days 4–7 of the high-fat diet treatment (Figure 7B). This increase in caloric intake over the first 3 days did not result in a significant increase in body weight in the LEPRVTA rats compared to CTRLVTA rats (Figure S5). Based on the expression of Lepr in the VTA, we hypothesized that leptin signals directly to midbrain dopamine neurons to regulate energy homeostasis. We tested this hypothesis by administering leptin directly to the VTA or by knocking down Lepr in the VTA followed by measuring food intake, body weight, and locomotor activity. Four principal findings emerged: (1) administration of leptin either peripherally or directly to the VTA causes phosphorylation of STAT3 primarily in dopamine neurons; (2) leptin decreases the firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons in vivo and in vitro; (3) delivery of leptin to the VTA decreases food intake but does not alter general locomotor activity; (4) long-term genetic knockdown of Lepr in the VTA causes an increase in food intake and dark-cycle locomotor activity but does not alter body weight. Together, the biochemical, cellular, and behavioral data presented indicate that leptin can regulate food intake and locomotion by directly modulating dopamine neuron function in the VTA. The present data, together with evidence that leptin decreases nucleus accumbens dopamine levels (Krugel et al., 2003Krugel U. Schraft T. Kittner H. Kiess W. Illes P. Basal and feeding-evoked dopamine release in the rat nucleus accumbens is depressed by leptin.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 482: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggest that leptin inhibits the firing of VTA dopamine neurons leading to a decrease in both dopamine release and food intake. This is consistent with the changes in mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine circuits and feeding behavior following GABA or opioid modulation of the VTA (Badiani et al., 1995Badiani A. Leone P.

https://openalex.org/W2147152912,"Synaptogenesis, the generation and maturation of functional synapses between nerve cells, is an essential step in the development of neuronal networks in the brain. It is thought to be triggered by members of the neuroligin family of postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins, which may form transsynaptic contacts with presynaptic alpha- and beta-neurexins and have been implicated in the etiology of autism. We show that deletion mutant mice lacking neuroligin expression die shortly after birth due to respiratory failure. This respiratory failure is a consequence of reduced GABAergic/glycinergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission and network activity in brainstem centers that control respiration. However, the density of synaptic contacts is not altered in neuroligin-deficient brains and cultured neurons. Our data show that neuroligins are required for proper synapse maturation and brain function, but not for the initial formation of synaptic contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2050684182,"Leptin is an adipose-derived hormone that acts on hypothalamic leptin receptors to regulate energy balance. Leptin receptors are also expressed in extrahypothalamic sites including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), critical to brain reward circuitry. We report that leptin targets DA and GABA neurons of the VTA, inducing phosphorylation of signal-transducer-and-activator-of-transcription-3 (STAT3). Retrograde tracing combined with pSTAT3 immunohistochemistry show leptin-responsive VTA neurons projecting to nucleus accumbens (NAc). Assessing leptin function in the VTA, we showed that ob/ob mice had diminished locomotor response to amphetamine and lacked locomotor sensitization to repeated amphetamine injections, both defects reversed by leptin infusion. Electrically stimulated DA release from NAc shell terminals was markedly reduced in ob/ob slice preparations, and NAc DA levels and TH expression were lower. These data define a role for leptin in mesoaccumbens DA signaling and indicate that the mesoaccumbens DA pathway, critical to integrating motivated behavior, responds to this adipose-derived signal."
https://openalex.org/W2135719485,"The maintenance of synaptic transmission requires that vesicles be recycled after releasing neurotransmitter. Several modes of retrieval have been proposed to operate at small synaptic terminals of central neurons, including a fast ""kiss-and-run"" mechanism that releases neurotransmitter through a fusion pore. Using an improved fluorescent reporter comprising pHluorin fused to synaptophysin, we find that only a slow mode of endocytosis (tau = 15 s) operates at hippocampal synapses when vesicle fusion is triggered by a single nerve impulse or short burst. This retrieval mechanism is blocked by overexpression of the C-terminal fragment of AP180 or by knockdown of clathrin using RNAi, and it is associated with the movement of clathrin and vesicle proteins out of the synapse. These results indicate that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major, if not exclusive, mechanism of vesicle retrieval after physiological stimuli."

Here we use a metagenomic approach to describe four co-occurring symbionts from the marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis, a worm lacking a mouth, gut and nephridia. Shotgun sequencing and metabolic pathway reconstruction revealed that the symbionts are sulphur-oxidizing and sulphate-reducing bacteria, all of which are capable of carbon fixation, thus providing the host with multiple sources of nutrition. Molecular evidence for the uptake and recycling of worm waste products by the symbionts suggests how the worm could eliminate its excretory system, an adaptation unique among annelid worms. We propose a model that describes how the versatile metabolism within this symbiotic consortium provides the host with an optimal energy supply as it shuttles between the upper oxic and lower anoxic coastal sediments that it inhabits."

In general, Aβ levels are determined by the balance between Aβ production and removal, and defects in the proteolytic degradation of Aβ peptides could contribute to AD, especially late-onset sporadic AD (Selkoe, 2001Selkoe D.J.

Chronic transgenic overexpression of IDE or NEP in AD-related animal models markedly decreased the levels of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-x, establishing the importance of those enzymes in regulating Aβ turnover in vivo (Leissring et al., 2003Leissring M.A. Farris W.

The pronounced reductions in cerebral Aβ levels in APP/presenilin transgenic mice housed in an enriched environment were associated with elevated levels of NEP (Lazarov et al., 2005Lazarov O.

These results suggest that the activation of Aβ degradation and clearance is a promising therapeutic approach. Thus, understanding how levels of Aβ, especially Aβ1-42, are regulated by proteolysis has significant implications for both the pathogenesis and the treatment of AD. Cathepsin B (CatB) (EC 3.4.22.1), a cysteine protease of the papain superfamily, degrades peptides and proteins that enter the endolysosomal system by endocytosis or phagocytosis (Chapman et al., 1997Chapman H.A. Riese R.J. Shi G.P. Emerging roles for cysteine proteases in human biology.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Enzymatically active CatB is secreted through exocytosis (Linebaugh et al., 1999Linebaugh B.E. Sameni M. Day N.A. Sloane B.F. Keppler D. Exocytosis of active cathepsin B.

In AD brains, neuronal CatB is localized in most early endosomes, a site of internalization and processing of APP to form Aβ (Cataldo et al., 1997Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A.

Extracellular CatB is associated with amyloid plaques (Cataldo et al., 1997Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A.

Enzymatically active lysosomal proteases are associated with amyloid deposits in Alzheimer brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 3861-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). CatB also colocalizes with both Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 in regulated secretory vesicles in chromaffin cells (Hook et al., 2005Hook V. Toneff T. Bogyo M. Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Neveu J. Lane W.

Despite the close association of CatB with intracellular and extracellular Aβ, the exact roles of CatB in APP processing and Aβ metabolism in the central nervous system remain to be defined. It was suspected that CatB might cleave APP and contribute to Aβ generation, exacerbating neuronal deficits in AD (Cataldo et al., 1997Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A.

Biochem. 1997; 244: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CatB may catalyze the cleavage of Aβ peptides, resulting in Aβ degradation and neuroprotection. Here we demonstrate that CatB reduces the relative abundance of Aβ1-42 through limited proteolysis, suggesting that activation of CatB could offer a therapeutic strategy for AD. To determine the role of CatB in APP processing and Aβ metabolism in vivo, we crossed CatB−/− mice with hAPP mice that produce high levels of Aβ in neurons. CatB activity was undetectable in CatB−/− mice and reduced to 50% of wild-type levels in heterozygotes (CatB+/−) (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Western blot analyses with an anti-hAPP antibody (CT-15) revealed that CatB ablation in hAPP mice did not affect levels of C-terminal fragments (CTF) of hAPP, including α-CTF, β-CTF, or full-length hAPP (FL-hAPP) (Figure 1A). Levels of α-sAPP, detected with 6E10 antibody (Esposito et al., 2004Esposito L. Gan L. Yu G.Q. Essrich C. Mucke L. Intracellularly generated amyloid-beta peptide counteracts the antiapoptotic function of its precursor protein and primes proapoptotic pathways for activation by other insults in neuroblastoma cells.J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1260-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), were not affected by CatB ablation either (Figure 1A). These results suggest that CatB does not significantly affect the processing of hAPP. Interestingly, hippocampal plaque loads were significantly higher in hAPP/CatB−/− mice than hAPP/CatB+/+ mice at 6 months of age, as shown by immunostaining with an anti-Aβ antibody, 3D6 (Figures 1B and 1C). The number of neuritic plaques labeled with thioflavin S was also significantly higher in hippocampi of hAPP/CatB−/− mice than in hAPP/CatB+/+ mice (Figure 1D). In addition, more amyloid deposits were detected in the cortex of hAPP/CatB−/− mice than in hAPP/CatB+/+ mice (Figure 1E). These results indicate that CatB is involved in reducing Aβ deposition. Using an ELISA assay for human Aβ, we next examined the effects of CatB ablation on hippocampal Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-x (approximates total Aβ) levels. Although the increase in the absolute levels of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-x in hAPP/CatB−/− mice did not reach statistical significance (Figure S2), Aβ1-42/Aβ1-x ratios were significantly higher in hAPP/CatB−/− mice than hAPP/CatB+/+ mice at 6–7 months of age (Figure 1F). This result is consistent with the increased plaque deposition in 6- to 7-month-old hAPP/CatB−/− mice. In 3- to 4-month-old hAPP mice before plaque deposition, ablation of CatB did not affect the absolute Aβ1-42 or Aβ1-x levels or the relative abundance of Aβ1-42 (Figure S2), suggesting that CatB exerts its antiamyloidogenic effects during or after the formation of plaques. Learning deficits in hAPP mice are influenced by Aβ1-42 levels and, on an inbred C57BL/6 background, correlated strongly with the depletion of the calcium binding protein calbindin-D28k in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (Palop et al., 2003Palop J.J. Jones B. Kekonius L. Chin J. Yu G.-Q. Raber J. Masliah E. Mucke L. Neuronal depletion of calcium-dependent proteins in the dentate gyrus is tightly linked to Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive deficits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Palop et al., 2005Palop J.J. Chin J. Bien-Ly N. Massaro C. Yeung B.Z. Yu G.Q. Mucke L. Vulnerability of dentate granule cells to disruption of arc expression in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9686-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Consistent with their increased levels of Aβ1-42, 6- to 7-month-old hAPP/CatB−/− mice had significantly lower calbindin levels in the dentate gyrus than age-matched hAPP/CatB+/+ mice (Figures 1G and 1H). These results suggest that CatB reduces plaque deposition and relative Aβ1-42 levels and protects neurons against the Aβ-induced depletion of synaptic activity-dependent proteins. To understand the mechanisms underlying the antiamyloidogenic and neuroprotective effects of CatB, we characterized the association of CatB with amyloid plaques in 16- to 20-month-old hAPP mice. Brain sections from hAPP mice were colabeled with a CatB-specific antibody and with either 3D6, which stains both mature and diffuse Aβ deposits, or thioflavin S, which labels the β sheet structures in mature plaques (Figure 2A). CatB was present in a subpopulation of 3D6-positive deposits (Figure 2A) and thioflavin S-positive plaques (Figure 2A). More thioflavin S-positive than 3D6-positive deposits were immunoreactive for CatB, indicating that CatB accumulates preferentially in mature plaques (Figure 2B). Anti-CatB immunostaining of brain sections from hAPP/CatB−/− mice yielded no fluorescent signal in 3D6-positive plaques or NeuN-positive neurons, confirming the specificity of CatB antibody (Figure S3). Notably, in 6- to 7-month-old hAPP/CatB+/+ mice, CatB was present in most of the amyloid plaques (Figure S4), consistent with the plaque-reducing effect of CatB in hAPP mice at this age (Figures 1B–1E). Within neuritic plaques, CatB immunoreactivity overlapped with dystrophic neurites labeled with an anti-hAPP antibody (8E5) (Cheng et al., 2004Cheng I.H. Palop J.J. Esposito L.A. Bien-Ly N. Yan F. Mucke L. Aggressive amyloidosis in mice expressing human amyloid peptides with the Arctic mutation.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1190-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). These CatB-positive amyloid plaques were also associated with clusters of reactive astroglia labeled with GFAP antibody (Figure 2D), as well as microglia, as shown by crossing hAPP mice with CX3CR1+/GFP mice, in which microglia are labeled with GFP (Figure 2E). Interestingly, CatB activity was present in the supernatants of primary cultures enriched for neurons, astrocytes, or microglia; the highest levels were detected in microglial cultures (Figure S5). These results suggest that extracellular CatB accumulating within neuritic plaques could be produced by all three cell types, including activated microglia surrounding the plaques. CatB in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of hAPP mice colocalized with lysosomal membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1), a lysosomal marker (Figure 2F). CatB also colocalized with endosome-associated autoantigen 1 (EEA-1)-positive early endosomes, a site involved in APP processing and Aβ generation (Figure 2F). The accumulation of CatB in early endosomes in neurons of vulnerable regions of hAPP brains is consistent with a role of neuronal CatB in modulating Aβ levels. To investigate whether CatB directly affects Aβ levels in neurons, we transduced primary cortical neurons from CatB−/− mice and CatB+/+ littermate controls with an adenoviral vector expressing hAPP. Aβ1-42 levels were significantly higher in the supernatants from CatB−/− neurons than CatB+/+ neurons (Figure 3A). Lack of CatB did not increase Aβ1-x levels in these cultures significantly (Figure 3B). In complementary experiments, we inhibited CatB expression in primary cortical neuronal cultures from hAPP mice with a lentiviral vector encoding a small hairpin RNA targeting CatB (Lenti-shCatB) (Figure 3C). CatB activity was significantly lower in cultures expressing Lenti-shCatB than in cultures expressing a scrambled shRNA (Lenti-shSCR) (Figure 3D). Inhibiting CatB significantly increased Aβ1-42 levels, suggesting that CatB negatively regulates Aβ1-42 levels (Figure 3E). Aβ1-x levels were also significantly elevated in cultures infected with Lenti-shCatB, indicating that CatB also reduces total Aβ levels (Figure 3F). To further confirm the effects of CatB on Aβ levels, we increased CatB activity in primary neuronal cultures from hAPP mice with a lentiviral vector encoding mouse CatB cDNA (Lenti-CatB). Infection with Lenti-CatB resulted in significant increase in CatB activity (Figure 3G). Both Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-x levels were significantly reduced in cultures overexpressing CatB (Figures 3H and 3I). Our results so far demonstrate that levels of Aβ, including Aβ1-42, are downregulated by CatB in hAPP mice and primary neuronal cultures. Notably, elevated levels of Aβ1-42 stimulate microglia to express more CatB mRNA (Gan et al., 2004Gan L. Ye S. Chu A. Anton K.E. Yi S. Vincent V.A. von Schack D. Chin D. Murray J. Lohr S. et al.Identification of cathepsin B as a mediator of neuronal death induced by Aβ-activated microglial cells using a functional genomics approach.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5565-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine if Aβ1-42 also regulates CatB in neuronal cells, where the majority of Aβ is made, we stimulated neuroblastoma (N2A) cells with increasing amounts of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40. Both CatB mRNA levels (Figure 4A) and enzymatic activities (Figure 4B) were markedly increased by Aβ1-42; Aβ1-40 had little or no effect. Treatment with preaggregated Aβ1-40, however, induced a modest but significant increase in CatB activity, supporting the notion that regulation of CatB is influenced by the assembly states of Aβ peptides (Figure 4C). To determine if Aβ levels modulate CatB activities in vivo, we compared the enzymatic activities of CatB in the hippocampus of hAPP mice. Compared with age-matched nontransgenic controls, CatB levels were higher in hAPP mice both before (1–3 months) and after (7–8 months) plaque deposition (Figure 4D), suggesting that the hAPP/Aβ-induced increase in CatB activities does not depend on insoluble Aβ deposits in vivo. At 16–20 months, CatB activities were similar to those in nontransgenic controls, indicating that hAPP/ Aβ failed to stimulate CatB at old age (Figure 4D). Since the relative abundance of Aβ1-42 was increased in the hippocampus of hAPP/CatB−/− mice and in CatB−/− neurons overexpressing hAPP, we hypothesized that Aβ1-42 is a substrate for CatB and that CatB reduces levels of Aβ1-42 through proteolytic cleavage. Under cell-free conditions, synthetic Aβ1-42 was incubated with purified CatB at pH 6.0, a pH close to that of endosomes, where CatB is likely to encounter Aβ intracellularly (Cataldo et al., 1997Cataldo A.M.

Neurochem. 2002; 81: 237-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Figure 1F). The proteolytic products were analyzed with SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Incubating Aβ1-42 with CatB resulted in the dose-dependent generation of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-38, and Aβ1-33 through proteolytic cleavage at Val40-Ile41, Gly38-Gly39, and Gly33-Leu34 (Figure 5A). No truncations occurred in the presence of the inhibitor CA074 or in the absence of CatB, confirming that the truncations were dependent on the proteolytic activity of CatB. Increasing the concentration of CatB decreased Aβ1-42 and increased Aβ1-38 (Figures 5A). The dose-dependent cleavage of Aβ1-42 was confirmed by western blot analysis of acid-urea gels (Figure 5B). Levels of Aβ1-40 were increased initially at lower doses (100–400 ng/ml), but decreased at higher doses (0.4–2.5 μg/ml) (Figure 5A). These results indicate that CatB acts as a carboxydipeptidase that cleaves Aβ1-42 at the C terminus to generate Aβ1-40, which in turn serves as a substrate for the generation of Aβ1-38. Although CatB did not appear to completely degrade Aβ peptides, Aβ1-33 was also generated (Figures 5A and 5D) in a dose-dependent manner, presumably by endopeptidase activity. Consistent with the weaker endopeptidase than carboxydipeptidase activity of CatB at acidic pH (4.0–6.0) (Musil et al., 1991Musil D. Zucic D. Turk D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T.

Storer A.C. Portaro F.C. Carmona E. Juliano L. Menard R. Major increase in endopeptidase activity of human cathepsin B upon removal of occluding loop contacts.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12608-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), higher concentrations of CatB were required to generate Aβ1-33 than to generate Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-38 (Figure 5A). Interestingly, even when Aβ1-40 was almost completely converted to Aβ1-38, no Aβ1-36 was generated from Aβ1-38 (Figure S6), indicating that Aβ1-38 is not a substrate for CatB's carboxydipeptidic activity. Thus, CatB may counteract amyloidosis by catalyzing the sequence-specific C-terminal truncation of Aβ1-42. Next, we investigated whether CatB also cleaves soluble and insoluble Aβ1-42 assemblies. The assembly state of Aβ1-42 was confirmed with negative-staining electron microscopy (Figure 5C). Nonfibrillar Aβ1-42 assemblies were highly toxic in cultured primary neurons (Chen et al., 2005Chen J. Zhou Y. Mueller-Steiner S. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Yi S. Mucke L. Gan L.

Incubation of CatB induced a marked decrease in the amounts of high-molecular weight (MW) Aβ assemblies, as shown on Tricine SDS-PAGE gels. Levels of low-MW Aβ1-42 oligomers and monomers, detected with an antibody specific for Aβ1-42, were also reduced. Inclusion of the CatB inhibitor CA074 significantly diminished such effects (Figure 5E). These results suggest that CatB effectively targets Aβ assemblies in vitro. At neutral pH (∼7.0), the ability of CatB to cleave Aβ, especially nonaggregated (fresh) Aβ, was markedly reduced (Figure 5F). Nevertheless, nonfibrillar and fibrillar Aβ assemblies were cleaved by CatB even at neutral pH, resulting in the same truncated Aβ species observed at pH 6.0 (Figures 5A and 5F). The ability of CatB to cleave even aggregated Aβ1-42 suggested that CatB might be able to reduce preformed Aβ fibrils. Indeed, incubation of fibrillar Aβ1-42 with CatB did reduce the amount of fibrillar structures (Figure 5G). This effect depended on the proteolytic activity of CatB, as demonstrated by inhibition with CA074 (Figure 5G). The ability of CatB to cleave Aβ1-42 aggregates and the accumulation of CatB within amyloid plaques support the notion that CatB might reduce established plaques in aged hAPP mice. To test this hypothesis, we injected Lenti-CatB, the vector we used to increase CatB levels in primary neuronal cultures (Figure 3G), into the hippocampus of 12- to 15-month-old hAPP mice, which have significant plaque deposition. Lenti-control, which does not encode a functional protein, served as a negative control for nonspecific viral effects. A lentiviral vector overexpressing NEP (Lenti-NEP) (Marr et al., 2003Marr R.A.

Here we show that postsynaptic LTP is unaffected at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum of αCaMKII−/− mice. In contrast, a long-term depression (LTD) protocol resulted in only transient depression in juvenile αCaMKII−/− mutants and in robust potentiation in adult mutants. This suggests that the function of αCaMKII in parallel fiber-Purkinje cell plasticity is opposite to its function at excitatory hippocampal and cortical synapses. Furthermore, αCaMKII−/− mice showed impaired gain-increase adaptation of both the vestibular ocular reflex and optokinetic reflex. Since Purkinje cells are the only cells in the cerebellum that express αCaMKII, our data suggest that an impairment of parallel fiber LTD, while leaving LTP intact, is sufficient to disrupt this form of cerebellar learning."

The molecular mechanisms involved in priming one neurite to become the axon, particularly those regulating the microtubule network, remain elusive. Here we report the identification of DOCK7, a member of the DOCK180-related protein superfamily, as a Rac GTPase activator that is asymmetrically distributed in unpolarized hippocampal neurons and selectively expressed in the axon. Knockdown of DOCK7 expression prevents axon formation, whereas overexpression induces formation of multiple axons. We further demonstrate that DOCK7 and Rac activation lead to phosphorylation and inactivation of the microtubule destabilizing protein stathmin/Op18 in the nascent axon and that this event is important for axon development. Our findings unveil a pathway linking the Rac activator DOCK7 to a microtubule regulatory protein and highlight the contribution of microtubule network regulation to axon development."

In the present study, we found that NO up-regulates Bcl-2 expression, which provides a key mechanism against Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. The mechanism by which NO regulates Bcl-2 involves S-nitrosylation of the protein, which was also observed under other stress conditions, including exposure to death ligand and glutathione depletion. S-Nitrosylation of Bcl-2 prevents its down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Mutational analysis indicated the involvement of Cys158 and Cys229 in S-nitrosylation and ubiquitination of Bcl-2. These findings reveal the existence of a novel mechanism of NO-mediated regulation of Bcl-2 that could be important in apoptosis resistance and the development of lung cancer induced by Cr(VI) and other carcinogens.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Reagents—The human lung epithelial cancer cell line NCI-H460 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a5%CO2 environment at 37 °C. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), NO inhibitors aminoguanidine (AG) and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxy-3-oxide (PTIO), lactacystin, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), dithiothreitol (DTT), diaminonaphthalene, mercury(II) chloride (HgCl2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sulfonilamide, N-1-naphthyl ethylenediamine dehydrochloride, sodium nitrite (NaNO2), and sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7·2H2O) (Cr(VI)) were obtained from Sigma. The NO donor dipropylenetriamine (DPTA) NONOate, Fas ligand (FasL), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the fluorogenic caspase substrates IETD-amino-4-methylcoumarin (IETD-AMC) and LEHD-AMC were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The NO fluorescent probe 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-DA) and the apoptosis dye Hoechst 33342 were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Antibodies for Bcl-2, phospho-Bcl-2 (Ser87), Myc, peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies, anti-Myc agarose beads, and protein A-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for S-nitrosocysteine, ubiquitin, and β-actin were from Sigma, and the transfecting agent Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen.Plasmid and Transfection—The Bcl-2 plasmid was generously provided by Dr. Christian Stehlik (West Virginia University Cancer Center, Morgantown, WV). The open reading frame of Bcl-2 and ubiquitin were amplified by high fidelity PCR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from corresponding expressed sequence tags and cloned into pcDNA3 expression vectors containing N-terminal Myc epitope tag. The authenticity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of DNA was normalized in all transfection experiments with pcDNA3. Expression of proteins was verified by Western blotting or immunoprecipitation.Generation of Stable Bcl-2 Transfectant—Stable transfectant of Bcl-2 was generated by culturing H-460 cells in 60-mm dishes until they reached 80% confluence. 1 μg of cytomegalovirus-neo vector and 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 with 2 μg of Myc-tagged Bcl-2 plasmid were used to transfect the cells in the absence of serum. After 10 h, the medium was replaced with culture medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 36 h after transfection, the cells were digested with 0.03% trypsin and plated onto 75-ml culture flasks and cultured for 24-28 days with G418 selection medium (400 μg/ml). The stable transfectant was identified by Western blotting of Bcl-2 and was cultured in G418-free RPMI medium for at least two passages before each experiment.Caspase and Apoptosis Assays—Caspase activity was determined by fluorometric assay using the enzyme substrate IETDAMC for caspase-8 and LEHD-AMC for caspase-9, which are specifically cleaved by the respective enzymes at the Asp residue to release the fluorescent group, AMC. Cell extracts containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with 100 mm HEPES containing 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% 3-((3-cholamidiopropyl)-1) propane sulfonate, and 50 μm caspase substrate in a total reaction volume of 0.25 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and quantified fluorometrically at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Apoptosis was determined by incubating the cells with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain for 30 min at 37 °C and scoring the percentage of cells having intensely condensed chromatin and/or fragmented nuclei by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 100; Carl Zeiss) using Pixera software.NO Detection—Intracellular NO production was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy using NO-specific probe DAF-DA. For flow cytometric analysis, cells (1 × 106/ml) were incubated with the probe (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, after which they were washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and analyzed for DAF fluorescence intensity using a 488-nm excitation beam and a 538-nm bandpass filter (FACScalibur; BD Biosciences). For fluorescence microscopy, cells were incubated with the probe as described above and then examined for DAF fluorescence using Carl Zeiss Axiovert microscope.Also, NO production was confirmed by measuring its nitrite by-product using Griess assay. Cell supernatants (50 μl) were incubated with 50 μl of Griess reagent containing 0.1% N-1-naphthyl ethylenediamine dehydrochloride and 1% sulfanilamide for 10 min at room temperature. The optical density of the samples was measured using a microplate reader (model 550; Bio-Rad) at 550 nm. NO concentration was calculated from the standard curve produced during each assay by using NaNO2 dissolved in 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5.Western Blotting—After specific treatments, cells were incubated in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture for 20 min on ice. After insoluble debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and assayed for protein content using bicinchoninic acid method. An equal amount of proteins per sample (15 μg) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane. The transferred membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immune complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (Supersignal® West Pico; Pierce) and quantified by imaging densitometry using UN-SCAN-IT automated digitizing software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Mean densitometry data from independent experiments were normalized to the control. The data were presented as mean ± S.D. and analyzed by Student's t test.Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed after treatments with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected, and the protein content was determined as described. Cleared lysates were normalized, and 60 μg of proteins were incubated with 8 μl of anti-Myc-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted with 12 μl of protein A-agarose for 4 h at 4°C. The immune complexes were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The immune complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as described.Fluorometric Measurement of S-Nitrosylation—S-Nitrosylation of Bcl-2 was measured as previously described (28Park H.S. Huh S.H. Kim M.S. Lee S.H. Choi E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14382-14387Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 45Wink D.A. Kim S. Coffin D. Cook J.C. Vodovotz Y.

In brief, cells were treated, harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were rinsed four times with lysis buffer and twice with PBS. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS and incubated with HgCl2 (200 μm) and diaminonaphthalene (200 μm) for 0.5 h in dark at room temperature followed by the addition of 1 m NaOH. A fluorescent triazole generated from the reaction between diaminonaphthalene and NO released from S-nitrosylated Bcl-2 was quantified using a fluorometer (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Inc., Durham, NC) at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 375 and 450 nm, respectively.Site-directed Mutagenesis of Bcl-2—Mutant Bcl-2 plasmids were constructed using the above mentioned human Bcl-2 plasmid as template. Two sets of forward and reverse primers were constructed to introduce mutations at Cys158 and Cys229: C158A, CGGTGGGGTCATGGCTGTGGAGAGCGTCAACCG (forward) and CGGTTGACGCTCTCCACAGCCATGACCCCACCG (reverse); C229A, GGCCCTGGTGGGAGCTGCCATCACCCTGGGTGCC (forward) and GGCACCCAGGGTGATGGCAGCTCCCACCAGGGCC (reverse). Three mutant plasmids (C158A, C229A, and a plasmid with both mutations) were constructed using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenesis was confirmed by automated nucleotide sequencing.Proteasome Activity Assay—Proteasome activity was measured using an assay kit from CHEMICON (Temecula, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were washed after treatments with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and determined for protein content. Cleared lysates were normalized, and 20 μg of proteins were incubated with the proteasome substrate LLVY-AMC at 37 °C for 1 h. The fluorophore AMC obtained after cleavage from the labeled substrate was quantified at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively.RESULTSApoptosis and Caspase Activation Induced by Cr(VI)—Chromium (VI)-containing compounds are ubiquitous environmental carcinogens that induce apoptosis as the primary mode of cell death (37Carlisle D.L. Pritchard D.E. Singh J. Patierno S.R. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To study the role of NO and Bcl-2 in Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis, we first characterized the apoptosis response to Cr(VI) treatment in human lung epithelial H-460 cells. Cells were treated with different doses of Cr(VI) (0-100 μm), and apoptosis was determined after 12 h by a Hoechst 33342 assay. Figs. 1, A and B, show that Cr(VI) treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in cell apoptosis over control level, as indicated by increased nuclear fluorescence and chromatin condensation of the treated cells. Significant apoptosis was observed as early as 6 h and peaked at about 16 h post-treatment (data not shown). Caspase activity assays show that Cr(VI) was able to induce both caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation (Fig. 1C); however, the latter effect was much more pronounced. Since caspase-9 serves as the apical caspase of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) death pathway, whereas caspase-8 represents the apical caspase of the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway (46Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 47Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), the results of this study suggest that the mitochondrial pathway is the major apoptosis pathway induced by Cr(VI). Control studies using specific caspase-8 inhibitor (IETD-CHO) and caspase-9 inhibitor (LEHD-CHO) indicate the specificity of caspase activation under the test conditions (Fig. 1C).NO Inhibits Cr(VI)-induced Apoptosis—To investigate the potential role of NO in the regulation of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis, cells were treated with Cr(VI) in the presence or absence of various NO inhibitors and donors, and apoptosis was determined by Hoechst assay. Fig. 2, A and B, show that NO inhibitors AG and PTIO effectively increased apoptotic cell death induced by Cr(VI), whereas NO donors SNP and DPTA NONOate inhibited this effect in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase activity assays similarly showed that the NO inhibitor AG and the NO donor SNP, respectively, increased and decreased the effect of Cr(VI) on capase-9 activation (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that NO plays an antiapoptotic role in Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis.FIGURE 2Effect of NO modulators on Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis and caspase activation. A, subconfluent (90%) monolayers of H-460 cells were pretreated with the NO donor SNP (500 μg/ml) or DPTA NONOate (400 μm) or with the NO inhibitor AG (300 μm) or PTIO (300 μm) for 1 h. The cells were then either left untreated or treated with Cr(VI) (20 μm) for 12 h and analyzed for apoptosis by Hoechst assay. B, dose effect of NO modulators on Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. Cells were treated with Cr(VI) (20 μm) for 12 h after pretreatment with SNP (250, 500, and 750 μg/ml), DPTA NONOate (200, 400, and 600 μm), AG (100, 300, and 500 μm), or PTIO (100, 300, and 500 μm) for 1 h. C, cells were similarly treated with Cr(VI) with or without NO modulators, and caspase-9 activity was determined by fluorometric analysis. Plots are mean ± S.D.

Fig. 3, A and B, show that the NO inhibitors AG and PTIO significantly inhibited cellular NO production induced by Cr(VI), whereas the NO donors SNP and DPTA NONOate promoted this effect. Fig. 3C shows fluorescence micrographs of cells treated with Cr(VI) in the presence or absence of NO modulators. Since Cr(VI) exposure is known to produce reactive oxygen species (39Ye J. Wang S.

https://openalex.org/W2079851211,"Recent gene ablation studies in mice have shown that matriptase, a type II transmembrane serine protease, and prostasin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane serine protease, are both required for processing of the epidermis-specific polyprotein, profilaggrin, stratum corneum formation, and acquisition of epidermal barrier function. Here we present evidence that matriptase acts upstream of prostasin in a zymogen activation cascade that regulates terminal epidermal differentiation and is required for prostasin zymogen activation. Enzymatic gene trapping of matriptase combined with prostasin immunohistochemistry revealed that matriptase was co-localized with prostasin in transitional layer cells of the epidermis and that the developmental onset of expression of the two membrane proteases was coordinated and correlated with acquisition of epidermal barrier function. Purified soluble matriptase efficiently converted soluble prostasin zymogen to an active two-chain form that formed SDS-stable complexes with the serpin protease nexin-1. Whereas two forms of prostasin with molecular weights corresponding to the prostasin zymogen and active prostasin were present in wild type epidermis, prostasin was exclusively found in the zymogen form in matriptase-deficient epidermis. These data suggest that matriptase, an autoactivating protease, acts upstream from prostasin to initiate a zymogen cascade that is essential for epidermal differentiation.

The serine proteases constitute one of the largest classes of proteolytic enzymes and have evolved to perform specialized functions. Trypsin-like serine proteases typically are synthesized as inactive zymogens that are activated by a single endoproteolytic cleavage. This group of enzymes often acts in either single or complex, highly regulated zymogen cascades to control important biological processes such as coagulation, fibrinolysis, blood pressure, and digestion (1Davie E.W.

The stratum corneum is the outermost, terminally differentiated layer of the epidermis that provides a physical barrier protecting the body from fluid loss, as well as from mechanical, chemical, and microbial insults. The stratum corneum is a two-compartment structure consisting of a lipid-enriched extracellular matrix in which an interlocking meshwork of flattened dead keratinocytes (corneocytes) are embedded (5Nemes Z.

Our previous studies have shown that the targeted deletion of the type II transmembrane trypsin-like serine protease, matriptase, leads to loss of inwards and outwards epidermal barrier function due to incomplete corneocyte differentiation and abnormal intercorneocyte lipid extrusion correlating at the molecular level with defective proteolytic processing of profilaggrin (8List K.

Moreover, both protease-deficient transgenic mouse strains displayed identical hair follicle defects and thymic abnormalities (Table 1).TABLE 1Phenotypic comparison of matriptase and prostasin-deficient miceParameterMatriptase-/-Prostasin-/-SurvivalPostnatal lethalityPostnatal lethalityBody weight and body lengthReducedReducedExternal appearance of skinReddish and wrinkledReddish and wrinkledHair folliclesImmatureImmatureThymusHypoplasticHypoplasticInwards epidermal barrier functionImpairedImpairedOutwards epidermal barrier functionImpairedImpairedCorneocytesEnlargedEnlargedEpidermal lipid compositionAbnormalAbnormalFilaggrinAbsentAbsentProfilaggrin processingImpairedImpairedEpidermal differentiation markers besides profilaggrin/filaggrinNormalNormal Open table in a new tab The identical phenotypes of matriptase- and prostasin-deficient mice suggested that the two membrane serine proteases either could be components of two distinct zymogen cascades that each are critical to terminal epidermal differentiation or, alternatively, could be components of the same proteolytic cascade.

Pathol. 2006; 168: 1513-1525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that carries one wild type matriptase allele and one allele where the exons encoding the serine protease domain of matriptase have been replaced by a β-galactosidase marker gene (matriptase+/E16β-gal mice). This mouse strain synthesizes a matriptase-β-galactosidase fusion protein under transcriptional control of the endogenous matriptase gene and can be used as a sensitive marker for matriptase expression using X-gal staining. The co-localization of matriptase with prostasin was analyzed by immunohistochemistry of serial sections or, when staining intensity permitted, by immunohistochemical staining of X-gal-stained sections with prostasin antibodies to simultaneously visualize the two proteases. As described recently (11List K. Szabo R. Molinolo A. Nielsen B.S. Bugge T.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 1513-1525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), X-gal staining of the skin of matriptase+/E16β-gal mice showed that matriptase expression was confined to the uppermost living layer of the interfollicular epidermis of 7-day-old mouse pups (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, immunohistochemical staining of interfollicular epidermis revealed a similar localization of prostasin (Fig. 1B). Combined X-gal staining for matriptase and immunohistochemical staining for prostasin revealed overlapping expression in interfollicular epidermis at this age (Fig. 1C) as well as in newborn pups (Fig. 1E), demonstrating that the two membrane-associated proteases have the potential to physically interact in vivo. To determine the time of onset of expression of matriptase and prostasin in the developing epidermis, combined X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry of matriptase+/E16β-gal embryos at embryonic day (E) 14.5 to E16.5 was performed. At E14.5 and E15.5 no expression of either of the two serine proteases could be detected (Fig. 1, F and G). At E16.5, however, both matriptase and prostasin were expressed (Fig. 1H), temporally correlating with stratum corneum formation and the onset of acquisition of the epidermal barrier (15Hardman M.J. Sisi P. Banbury D.N. Byrne C. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1541-1552PubMed Google Scholar). X-gal staining combined with immunohistochemical staining for the marker of basal keratinocytes, cytokeratin-14, demonstrated the clear suprabasal expression of the two proteases at this developmental stage (Fig. 1I). Matriptase Activates the Prostasin Zymogen in a Cell-free System—Previous studies have shown that the matriptase zymogen undergoes autoactivation during synthesis (16Oberst M.D. Chen L.Y. Kiyomiya K. Williams C.A. Lee M.S. Johnson M.D. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C462-C470Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Oberst M.D. Williams C.A. Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26773-26779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, the prostasin zymogen is unable to undergo autoactivation and a physiological activator of prostasin has not been identified (18Shipway A. Danahay H. Williams J.A. Tully D.C. Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Activation of the prostasin zymogen occurs by endoproteolytic cleavage after Arg12 within the amino acid sequence QPR12-ITG, a cleavage reaction that could be mediated by matriptase, based on studies of matriptase specificity (19Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that matriptase would act upstream of prostasin if the two proteases were part of the same zymogen cascade. To test this, we expressed prostasin in HEK-293T cells. The recombinant prostasin was released from the cell surface with PI-PLC to generate a soluble form of prostasin that presented as a dominant 40-kDa species and two minor species with slightly higher and lower electrophoretic mobility when analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under reducing conditions (Fig. 2, lane 1). Prostasin generated this way appeared to be predominantly in the zymogen form, as it did not form complexes with the cognate serpin PN-1, which forms SDS-stable complexes with active prostasin (13Chen L. Wang C. Chen M. Marcello M.R. Chao J. Chao L. Chai K.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F567-F577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but not with the prostasin zymogen (Fig. 2, compare lane 2 with lanes 4 and 6). This suggested that the faint higher and lower molecular weight species both could represent glycosylation variants of the zymogen (13Chen L. Wang C. Chen M. Marcello M.R. Chao J. Chao L. Chai K.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F567-F577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activation of the prostasin zymogen leads to the formation of active two-chain prostasin, which can be distinguished from the prostasin zymogen by a small increase in electrophoretic mobility in high-percentage SDS-PAGE gels after reduction of the single disulfide bridge that links the two chains (13Chen L. Wang C. Chen M. Marcello M.R. Chao J. Chao L. Chai K.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F567-F577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Exposure of soluble prostasin zymogen to either 1 or 10 nm active matriptase protease domain led to the formation of a prominent immunoreactive band with the mobility expected for active prostasin (Fig. 2, compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 5). The percentage of prostasin zymogen converted to this higher mobility species by matriptase varied between prostasin preparations and was never complete, even with very high matriptase concentrations (data not shown). This suggested that not all recombinant prostasin released from HEK-293T cells by PI-PLC was in a conformational state that permitted the activation by matriptase. To confirm that the cleavage of the prostasin zymogen by matriptase leads to the formation of active prostasin, we incubated untreated and matriptase-treated prostasin with PN-1 and detected prostasin-PN-1 complexes by Western blotting using anti-prostasin antibodies. In the absence of preincubation with matriptase, no prostasin-PN-1 complex was observed (Fig. 2, lane 2). However, when prostasin zymogen was first exposed to matriptase and then incubated with PN-1, a prominent 85-kDa molecular mass complex that was immunoreactive with anti-prostasin antibodies was observed (Fig. 2, compare lane 2 with lanes 4 and 6). Taken together, these data show that the matriptase catalytic domain is capable of converting the zymogen of prostasin to active, serpin-reactive prostasin in a cell-free system. Lack of Proteolytically Processed Prostasin Zymogen and Prostasin Zymogen Accumulation in Matriptase-ablated Epidermis—The striking phenotypic similarities between matriptase- and prostasin-deficient mice (Table 1), when combined with our data presented above, strongly suggested that matriptase could be a physiological activator of the prostasin zymogen during terminal epidermal differentiation and predicted the existence of a matriptase-prostasin zymogen cascade in epidermal differentiation. To definitively test this, we determined the state of activation of epidermal prostasin in the presence and absence of matriptase. Protein lysates were prepared from the epidermis of newborn wild type mice and their matriptase-deficient littermates (8List K. Haudenschild C.C. Szabo R. Chen W. Wahl S.M. Swaim W. Engelholm L.H. Behrendt N. Bugge T.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3765-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and prostasin processing was analyzed by the separation of the protein lysates by reducing SDS/PAGE on high percentage gradient gels, followed by Western blotting using prostasin antibodies (Fig. 3A). In wild type epidermis, prostasin was found in two forms: a 39-kDa form, compatible with the apparent molecular mass of the prostasin zymogen, and a 37-kDa form, compatible with activated prostasin (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5). In contrast, in matriptase-ablated epidermis, prostasin was exclusively found in the higher molecular mass 39-kDa zymogen form. Furthermore, the 39-kDa form of prostasin was frequently more abundant in matriptase-deficient epidermis (Fig. 3, lanes 6–8, and data not shown). This increase in prostasin zymogen did not appear to be caused by a corresponding increase in the steady state level of prostasin mRNA as judged by real-time PCR analysis (data not shown), suggesting that the accumulation was caused by loss of zymogen activation by matriptase. To quantitatively assess the formation of active prostasin in matriptase-sufficient and -deficient epidermis, protein extracts from the epidermis of five matriptase-sufficient and five matriptase-deficient littermates were analyzed by Western blot. The fraction of total prostasin presenting as active prostasin was determined by densitometric scanning of the blot (Fig. 3B). In matriptase-sufficient epidermis, 40–51% of prostasin was in the active two-chain form, while the amount of active prostasin in matriptase-deficient epidermis was below the level of detection. Taken together, these data provide definitive evidence that matriptase is essential for the proteolytic processing of prostasin in the epidermis. The coordinated expression and co-localization of matriptase and prostasin in the epidermis and the activation of prostasin zymogen by matriptase in vitro and in vivo, when combined with the identical phenotype of matriptase and prostasin-deficient mice, provides compelling evidence for the existence of a matriptase-prostasin zymogen activation cascade regulating terminal epidermal differentiation. This suggests that loss of profilaggrin processing, defective corneocyte maturation, and abnormal intercorneocyte lipid extrusion in matriptase-deficient epidermis may all be secondary to loss of prostasin zymogen activation. Increasing evidence indicates that terminal epidermal differentiation is regulated by a sophisticated cascade of serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors that all become expressed in transitional layer cells during stratum corneum formation and undergo sequential activation during stratum corneum maturation and shedding (8List K.

The serine proteases currently proposed to be critical for stratum corneum formation include matriptase, prostasin, stratum corneum tryptic enzyme, stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme, furin, and profilaggrin processing endopeptidase1. Additionally, serine protease inhibitors, including the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1, and the Kazal-type, multidomain serine protease inhibitor, SPINK5, could have key roles in regulating the activity of one or several of these proteases in both human and mouse epidermis. Pertubations causing increased or decreased serine protease activity in the upper epidermis have serious pathophysiological consequences. Thus, ablation of matriptase or prostasin prevents acquisition of the epidermal barrier by blocking terminal epidermal differentiation (9List K. Szabo R. Wertz P.W. Segre J. Haudenschild C.C.

It remains to be determined whether a single proteolytic cascade or multiple independent proteolytic cascades are operational during terminal epidermal differentiation. Previously, stratum corneum tryptic enzyme has been proposed to act upstream of stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme during the desquamation of stratum corneum (25Brattsand M. Stefansson K. Lundh C. Haasum Y. Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 198-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and our results now show that matriptase acts upstream of prostasin during terminal epidermal differentiation. In addition to loss of epidermal barrier formation, matriptase deficiency also severely impairs stratum corneum desquamation (9List K. Szabo R. Wertz P.W. Segre J. Haudenschild C.C. Kim S.Y. Bugge T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the intriguing hypothesis that the four serine proteases and SPINK5 could be part of a single zymogen cascade with a complexity reminiscent of other serine protease zymogen cascades, such as those involved in blood coagulation or digestion.

https://openalex.org/W2161360348,"Patch-clamp recordings revealed that distal processes of starburst amacrine cells (SACs) received largely excitatory synaptic input from the receptive field center and nearly purely inhibitory inputs from the surround during both stationary and moving light stimulations. The direct surround inhibition was mediated mainly by reciprocal GABAA synapses between opposing SACs, which provided leading and prolonged inhibition during centripetal stimulus motion. Simultaneous Ca2+ imaging and current-clamp recording during apparent-motion stimulation further demonstrated the contributions of both centrifugal excitation and GABAA/C-receptor-mediated centripetal inhibition to the direction-selective Ca2+ responses in SAC distal processes. Thus, by placing GABA release sites in electrotonically semi-isolated distal processes and endowing these sites with reciprocal GABAA synapses, SACs use a radial-symmetric center-surround receptive field structure to build a polar-asymmetric circuitry. This circuitry may integrate at least three levels of interactions—center excitation, surround inhibition, and reciprocal inhibitions that amplify the center-surround antagonism—to generate robust direction selectivity in the distal processes."

https://openalex.org/W2152066243,"Songbird auditory neurons must encode the dynamics of natural sounds at many volumes. We investigated how neural coding depends on the distribution of stimulus intensities. Using reverse-correlation, we modeled responses to amplitude-modulated sounds as the output of a linear filter and a nonlinear gain function, then asked how filters and nonlinearities depend on the stimulus mean and variance. Filter shape depended strongly on mean amplitude (volume): at low mean, most neurons integrated sound over many milliseconds, while at high mean, neurons responded more to local changes in amplitude. Increasing the variance (contrast) of amplitude modulations had less effect on filter shape but decreased the gain of firing in most cells. Both filter and gain changes occurred rapidly after a change in statistics, suggesting that they represent nonlinearities in processing. These changes may permit neurons to signal effectively over a wider dynamic range and are reminiscent of findings in other sensory systems."

How are all these plasticity mechanisms used for memory storage? A common assumption is that brain structures like the cerebellum store memories via stereotyped usage of their plasticity mechanisms (Albus, 1971Albus J. A theory of cerebellar function.Math. Biosci. 1971; 10: 25-61Crossref Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, Marr, 1969Marr D. A theory of cerebellar cortex.J. Physiol. 1969; 202: 437-470PubMed Google Scholar). The search for a universal mechanism (or set of mechanisms) for memory storage has been particularly intense in the case of the cerebellum due to its simple, almost crystalline anatomy. However, another possibility is that different experiences or paradigms can engage distinct, combinatorial subsets of the plasticity mechanisms available in the cerebellar circuitry. Combinatorial usage of plasticity mechanisms could allow for more flexibility in memory encoding than is possible with a stereotyped usage of a set of mechanisms. Testing these opposing hypotheses calls for an experimental system that not only stores memories in a form accessible to behavioral and electrophysiological analysis, but also allows molecular manipulation of candidate plasticity mechanisms. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is well-suited for this purpose. During head movement, the VOR stabilizes images on the retina by producing eye movements in the direction opposite to the head, thus preventing blurred vision. Cerebellum-dependent motor learning keeps the VOR calibrated by adaptively altering the amplitude (gain) of the reflex (Ito et al., 1974Ito M. Shiida T. Yagi N. Yamamoto M.

The formation and storage of motor memories can be assessed in the laboratory using combinations of visual and vestibular stimuli that increase or decrease VOR gain. The VOR has been a key testing ground for the leading model of cerebellum-dependent memory, which goes back more than three decades to the classical work of Ito, 1972Ito M.

This model invokes a universal, indeed unitary, plasticity mechanism, long-term depression of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses (“cerebellar LTD”) as playing the central role in motor learning. We conducted a rigorous test of the idea of a universally applicable memory mechanism or set of mechanisms for motor memory storage in the cerebellum by measuring retention of multiple memories in a mutant mouse in which long-term plasticity was targeted. In particular, we used knockout mice lacking Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) (Ho et al., 2000Ho N. Liauw J.A. Blaeser F. Wei F. Hanissian S. Muglia L.M. Wozniak D.F. Nardi A.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mice offer an advantage in that they undergo successful induction of cerebellar LTD but cannot enduringly maintain it (Ahn et al., 1999Ahn S. Ginty D.D. Linden D.J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One can therefore expect the mutant mice to display normal acquisition of learning, importantly confirming that all processes necessary for the acquisition of learning and expression of the learned response are intact; then, the memories that depend on LTD will be forgotten, whereas LTD-independent memories will be retained. Using these mice, we found that neural plasticity mechanisms such as cerebellar LTD can be selectively engaged according to the specific parameters of training, even within a narrow class of learning tasks. This provides critical evidence against the prevailing hypothesis that plasticity mechanisms within a brain structure are used in a universal, stereotyped fashion for memory storage. We first clarified the anatomical distribution of the expression of molecules in the CaMKIV cascade. Although cultured Purkinje cells require CaMKIV for the persistence of LTD (Ahn et al., 1999Ahn S.

Fisher R.S. Olin J.K. Sahyoun N. Acquisition and loss of a neuronal Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase during neuronal differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our own immunostaining confirmed that this was the case in adult cerebellar vermis (Figure 1A), the region of focus in the earlier immunocytochemical studies. Importantly, however, we found prominent immunoreactivity to CaMKIV in adult Purkinje cells in cerebellar regions essential for motor learning in the VOR (flocculus, Figure 1A). We quantified the CaMKIV fluorescence in the Purkinje cell nucleus, normalizing this value to the mean fluorescence of the molecular layer to facilitate between-animal comparisons. CaMKIV levels, thus measured, were 4.8-fold higher in floccular Purkinje cells than in vermal Purkinje cells (p < 10−4, unpaired t test; n = 24 flocculus Purkinje cells, 20 vermis Purkinje cells, from three wild-type mice; Figure 1A, right). To pursue this further, we used cDNA microarrays to probe for transcripts for CaMKIV and related signaling molecules. mRNAs were isolated, using laser capture microdissection, from neurons in the cerebellar region known to contribute to the horizontal VOR (Balaban et al., 2000Balaban C.D.

We obtained samples of the Purkinje cell (Pk) and granule cell (gc) layers of the cerebellar flocculus (Figure 1B). This procedure preserved the transcriptional identity of adjacently located cell types, as reflected by enrichment of well-known granule cell- and Purkinje cell-specific mRNAs in their respective samples (Figure 1C). Transcripts for CaMKIV were as abundant in the floccular Purkinje cell population as in the granule cell population, which is known to express CaMKIV at high levels (Figure 1D). This was also true for other members of the CaMKIV signaling pathway (Anderson et al., 2004Anderson K.A. Noeldner P.K. Reece K. Wadzinski B.E. Means A.R.

Thus, the molecular components required for CaMKIV-dependent signaling and plasticity were well-represented in adult Purkinje cells in cerebellar regions that support motor learning in the VOR. This result supports the idea that CaMKIV plays a similar role in adult plasticity in certain regions of the cerebellum, as it does in the cultured Purkinje cell preparation that has provided a method for studying the molecular mechanisms of late phase cerebellar LTD (Ho et al., 2000Ho N. Liauw J.A. Blaeser F. Wei F. Hanissian S. Muglia L.M. Wozniak D.F. Nardi A. Arvin K.L. Holtzman D.M. et al.Impaired synaptic plasticity and cAMP response element-binding protein activation in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV/Gr-deficient mice.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We induced motor learning in the VOR by pairing head rotation with rotation of a striped optokinetic drum. Moving the drum in the opposite direction from the head (gain-up stimulus; Figure 2A) caused the VOR gain to increase adaptively, whereas moving the drum in the same direction as the head (gain-down stimulus; Figure 2B) caused the VOR gain to decrease. After 30 min of training, the change in VOR gain was measured, and mice were then placed in darkness for 24 hr to prevent further adaptive changes. In mice lacking CaMKIV, learned increases and decreases in VOR gain were acquired no differently than in wild-type mice (Figures 2C and 2D; p > 0.80 for increases, p > 0.85 for decreases, unpaired t test). This fulfills the expectation that these mutant mice would have normal learning, and indicates that any memory impairment is not due to disruption of the neural processing underlying the acquisition of learning or the ability to perform the learned response. In contrast to the normal acquisition of motor learning, memory for the increase in VOR gain was impaired in the CaMKIV knockout mice. When the VOR was remeasured 24 hr later, the learned increase in VOR gain had declined significantly in the knockout mice relative to wild-type (“+24 hours” in Figure 2C; p < 0.01). In striking contrast, memory for a learned decrease in VOR gain was intact in the knockout (“+24 hours” in Figure 2D; p > 0.95), as was memory for the change in VOR timing associated with the decrease in gain (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data). The specific forgetting of the effects of gain-up training but not gain-down training indicates a differential use of cerebellar LTD or some other CaMKIV-dependent mechanism for memories induced by two closely related, cerebellum-dependent learning paradigms. We performed control experiments to check whether the observed behavioral deficits were specifically related to learning or merely resulted from sensory or motor deficits that impaired task performance. In a detailed examination of baseline parameters critical for learning, no difference was found between CaMKIV knockout and wild-type mice in baseline VOR gain (Figure 2E; p > 0.45), suggesting normal vestibular function. Furthermore, knockout and wild-type mice were not significantly different in the gain of the optokinetic reflex (OKR) (Figure 2F; p > 0.60), suggesting normal visual function. In addition, tracking of the visual stimulus during training, and therefore any error signals provided by the movement of the visual stimulus relative to the eye (retinal slip), was normal for CaMKIV knockout mice for both learning tasks (Figure 2G; p > 0.85 for gain-up, p > 0.55 for gain-down). The normal magnitudes of VOR, OKR, and tracking of the visual stimulus during training indicate normal oculomotor function as well. Along with the magnitude of each of these measures, their time dynamics were also similar in knockout and wild-type mice (see phase measurements in the Supplemental Data). Thus, the normal sensorimotor performance of CaMKIV knockout mice suggests that the observed difference in retention of increases and decreases in VOR gain reflects a true memory impairment. In this respect, the measurements of baseline VOR, OKR, and retinal slip buttress the central observation that CaMKIV knockout mice acquired increases and decreases in VOR gain no differently than wild-type mice (Figures 2C and 2D). From multiple perspectives, knockout mice were not deficient in the signal processing required for the acquisition or expression of learning. This leads to the conclusion that the clear differences in the retention of the motor memories must arise from differences in the plasticity mechanisms used for storing the motor memories. The memory for an increase in VOR gain, although clearly impaired, was not completely abolished in the CaMKIV knockout when remeasured after 24 hr (Figure 2C; p < 0.0001, paired t test comparing retained VOR to pretraining VOR gain), indicating a CaMKIV-independent component of the memory for an increase in gain. We examined whether this component could compensate for the loss of the CaMKIV-dependent component of an increase in gain with the help of additional training sessions. In CREB mutant mice, repeated training has been shown to restore spatial memory retention to normal levels, despite impairments in memory after limited training or training with brief intertrial intervals (Kogan et al., 1997Kogan J.H. Frankland P.W. Blendy J.A. Coblentz J. Marowitz Z. Schutz G. Silva A.J. Spaced training induces normal long-term memory in CREB mutant mice.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study suggests that cerebellum-dependent adaptation of the OKR is less dependent on plasticity in the cerebellar cortex and more dependent on changes in the vestibular nucleus after multiple days of training as compared with a single training session (Shutoh et al., 2006Shutoh F. Ohki M. Kitazawa H. Itohara S. Nagao S. Memory trace of motor learning shifts transsynaptically from cerebellar cortex to nuclei for consolidation.Neuroscience. 2006; 139: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we exposed mice to additional training sessions with the gain-up stimulus. After three gain-up training sessions separated by 24 hr intervals, memory for an increase in gain was still impaired in the CaMKIV knockout mice compared to wild-type mice (Figure 3; p < 0.05 after both the second and third retention periods, unpaired t test). The knockout mice repeatedly reacquired an increased VOR gain during successive training periods, only to lose the increase over the next 24 hr retention interval. Despite the significant forgetting after each 24 hr interval, the gains observed at the 24 hr retention time points were still significantly higher than baseline VOR gain (p < 0.05 for all genotypes/time points, paired t test). This spared component suggests that a CaMKIV-independent mechanism contributes to the increase in gain. However, the fact that the spared component of motor memory was still significantly smaller in the knockout mouse than in the wild-type mouse, even after multiple days of training, suggests that CaMKIV makes an essential contribution to the persistent memory for an increased VOR gain. Although multiple training sessions with the same stimulus could not rescue the impairment of increases in VOR gain, we found that increases in gain could be made CaMKIV-independent by reducing the rotational frequency of the training stimulus used to induce learning (Figure 4). This experiment was prompted by previous behavioral and electrophysiological observations in monkeys suggesting that the mechanism of VOR memory storage may vary with training stimulus frequency (Raymond and Lisberger, 1996Raymond J.L. Lisberger S.G. Behavioral analysis of signals that guide learned changes in the amplitude and dynamics of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7791-7802PubMed Google Scholar, Raymond and Lisberger, 1998Raymond J.L. Lisberger S.G. Neural learning rules for the vestibulo-ocular reflex.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9112-9129PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the 1 Hz sinusoidal head and image rotation used in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, we tested both higher (2 Hz) and lower (0.5 Hz, 0.66 Hz) frequencies. As observed at 1 Hz, CaMKIV knockout mice displayed normal acquisition of motor learning after 30 min of gain-up training at the other stimulus frequencies, which was not significantly different from their wild-type counterparts (Figure 4A; p > 0.25 for 0.5 Hz, p > 0.65 for 0.66 Hz, p > 0.05 for 2 Hz). However, a clear frequency-dependence of memory emerged when the learned increases in VOR gain were remeasured 24 hr later (Figure 4B). With 2 Hz stimuli, similar to the 1 Hz case described above, there was partial sparing of the memory for the increase in VOR gain (p < 0.0001; paired t test comparing retained VOR to pretraining VOR gain); however, VOR gain declined significantly in knockout mice relative to wild-type mice (Figure 4B; p < 0.0125). In contrast, for the lower training frequencies (0.5 Hz, 0.66 Hz), the learned increase in VOR gain was intact in the knockout 24 hr after training (Figure 4B; p > 0.45 knockout versus wild-type for 0.5 Hz, p > 0.65 for 0.66 Hz). We also found no difference between wild-type and knockout mice for gain-down learning or memory at any of these four stimulus frequencies (Figure S2). The selective retention of increased VOR gain at 0.5 Hz and 0.66 Hz indicates that the reliance on CaMKIV is not universal even for all forms of gain-up training, but is restricted according to the training stimulus frequency. None of the sensory or motor performance parameters were significantly different between knockout and wild-type mice, including baseline VOR gain (Figure 5A; p > 0.15 for 0.5 Hz, p > 0.60 for 0.66 Hz, p > 0.35 for 2 Hz), OKR gain (Figure 5B; p > 0.85 for 0.5 Hz, no data for 0.66 Hz, p > 0.80 for 2 Hz), or retinal slip (Figure 5C, p > 0.50 for 0.5 Hz, p > 0.50 for 0.66 Hz, p > 0.85 for 2 Hz) during gain-up training. Accordingly, the frequency-dependence of the effect of CaMKIV deletion cannot be attributed to a difference in baseline sensory or motor performance or available error signals. We noted, however, that in both wild-type and knockout mice, VOR gains were, on average, lower immediately after the end of 0.5-Hz gain-up training than 24 hr later (Figures 4A and 4B). This suggested that 0.5 Hz rotation could be inducing VOR habituation, as had been reported to result from low-frequency rotation in earlier work (Dow and Anastasio, 1996Dow E.R. Anastasio T.J. Violation of superposition by the vestibulo-ocular reflex of the goldfish.Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, Jager and Henn, 1981Jager J. Henn V.

Eye movements of the murine P/Q calcium channel mutant rocker, and the impact of aging.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 2066-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). VOR habituation is thought to depend on the vermis (Torte et al., 1994Torte M.P. Courjon J.H. Flandrin J.M. Magnin M. Magenes G. Anatomical segregation of different adaptative processes within the vestibulocerebellum of the cat.Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 99: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), where CaMKIV expression is low in the Purkinje cells but high in the granule cells. If this habituation were different between CaMKIV knockout and wild-type mice, such a difference could potentially mask or masquerade as a difference in the adaptive changes induced by paired visual and vestibular stimuli. Accordingly, we tested whether 30 min of head rotation in the absence of a visual stimulus had any transient and/or prolonged effect on VOR gain. We found that 30 min of head rotation in the dark at 0.5 Hz did indeed induce habituation of the VOR, but this habituation did not differ between wild-type and knockout mice (p > 0.95, Figure 6A). In addition, there was no long-term retention of the habituation; 24 hr later; both wild-type and knockout mice had recovered to their baseline VOR gain (p > 0.30 for both, paired t test comparing retained VOR to pretraining VOR gain), and there was no difference between wild-type and knockout mice (p > 0.25, unpaired t test). Thus, no genotypic difference in habituation at 0.5 Hz could mask a difference between knockout and wild-type mice in adaptive learning. A smaller degree of habituation was observed with 30 min of 1 Hz rotation in the dark (Figure 6B), consistent with earlier reports that VOR habituation is reduced at higher frequencies (Dow and Anastasio, 1996Dow E.R. Anastasio T.J. Violation of superposition by the vestibulo-ocular reflex of the goldfish.Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, Jager and Henn, 1981Jager J. Henn V. Habituation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in the monkey during sinusoidal rotation in the dark.Exp. Brain Res. 1981; 41: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 24 hr later, this habituation recovered to baseline levels (p > 0.10 for wild-type, p > 0.20 for knockout, paired t test). Once again, neither the habituation observed at 30 min nor its retention differed between wild-type and knockout mice (p > 0.85 for habituation measured at 30 min, p > 0.65 for the habituation measured 24 hr later, unpaired t test). Therefore, habituation of the VOR is CaMKIV-independe"

XyG is thought to link via hydrogen bonds to the surfaces of adjacent cellulose microfibrils, thereby forming three-dimensional cellulose-XyG networks that function as the principal load-bearing structure of the primary cell wall (1Somerville C. Bauer S. Brininstool G. Facette M. Hamann T. Milne J. Osborne E. Paredez A. Persson S. Raab T. Vorwerk S. Youngs H. Science. 2004; 306: 2206-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). XyG is composed of a backbone of 1,4-linked β-d-Glcp residues that are substituted in a regular pattern at O-6 with an α-d-Xylp residue (where “Xyl” is xylose) to form repeating subunits with specific xylosylation patterns that are highly conserved (2Hayashi T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 139-168Crossref Google Scholar). Most plants have XyG with an XXXG-type repeating subunit (where “G” denotes an unsubstituted glucosyl residue, and “X” denotes a glucosyl residue substituted at O-6 with an α-d-Xylp residue; see Ref. 3Fry S.C.

However, plants in Poaceae and Solanaceae have an XXGG-type repeating subunit and perhaps also an XXGGG-type repeating subunit (for reviews, see Refs. 4Vincken J.P. York W.S. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.

Further sugar substitution occurs primarily at specific xylosyl residues within the repeating subunit. These xylosyl residues are substituted at O-2 with a variety of glycosyl moieties, with the most common being β-d-Galp (represented by “L” and found in many plant species), α-l-Araf (where “Ara” is arabinose; represented by “S” and found only in Poaceae and Solanaceae), and the disaccharide α-l-Fucp-(1,2)-β-d-Galp (where “Fuc” is fucose; represented by “F”). Although the structure of the XyG repeating subunit is generally highly conserved within a plant species, the frequency and distribution of further carbohydrate substitutions may vary significantly. For example, endoglucanase digestion of Arabidopsis XyG produces a diverse array of oligosaccharides, including XXXG, XXLG, XXFG, XLFG, XLLG, and XLXG, all containing XXXG as the core XyG repeating subunit (7Madson M. Dunand C. Li X.L. Vanzin G.F. Caplan J. Shoue D.A. Carpita N. Reiter W.-D. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of XyG requires α-fucosyltransferase, β-galactosyltransferase, α-xylosyltransferase (XT), and β-(1,4)-glucan synthase activities. Recently, much progress has been made in the identification and characterization of the genes and proteins involved in XyG biosynthesis. An XyG α-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) was purified from pea epicotyls using traditional biochemical purification techniques (8Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence was used to identify XyG fucosyltransferase genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFUT1) (8Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and Pisum sativum (PsFUT1) (9Faik A. Bar-Peled M. DeRocher A.E. Zeng W. Perrin R.M. Wilkerson C. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15082-15089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a genetic strategy was used to identify one of the XyG galactosyltransferases. A screen of ethylmethane sulfonate-mutagenized Arabidopsis plants identified a mutant line (mur3) with a reduction in cell wall fucose content (10Reiter W.-D. Chapple C. Somerville C.R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); further investigation determined that MUR3 encodes an XyG galactosyltransferase (7Madson M. Dunand C. Li X.L. Vanzin G.F. Caplan J. Shoue D.A. Carpita N. Reiter W.-D. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, Faik et al. (11Faik A. Price N.J. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) identified seven putative XyG XT genes that are related to the previously characterized fenugreek galactomannan galactosyltransferase (GMGT) (12Edwards M.E. Dickson C.A. Chengappa S. Sidebottom C. Gidley M.J. Reid J.S.G. Plant J. 1999; 19: 691-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that belong to CAZy family GT34 (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/) (13Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1515-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The results of heterologous expression of the seven candidate XT genes in Pichia pastoris indicate that AtXT1 (At3g62720) encodes a protein with XT activity when cellopentaose is the acceptor substrate (11Faik A. Price N.J. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, attempts to express other members of this gene family in Pichia cells did not result in detectable XT activity, so the functions of the AtGT2-7 glycosyltransferases remain to be determined. The lack of activity was particularly surprising for At4g02500 because it has high sequence similarity (83% identical and 91% similar at the amino acid level) to AtXT1. Therefore, we revisited the heterologous expression of AtXT1 and At4g02500 in insect cells. In this study, we further characterized AtXT1 activity and present evidence that At4g02500 (henceforth referred to as AtXT2) encodes a protein with XT activity. Furthermore, through product characterization, we show that both proteins can add multiple xylosyl residues to cellohexaose. Clones, Chemicals, and Enzymes—The cDNA clones for At3g62720 (AtXT1; U14458) and At4g02500 (AtXT2; U25215) were from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/pcmb/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase, Gateway cloning and expression vectors, LR Clonase, Escherichia coli TOP10 competent cells, and the Drosophila expression system, and the Bac-to-Bac baculoviral expression system were from Invitrogen. The GENECLEAN SPIN kit was from Qbiogene, Inc. (Irvine, CA). The SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence system was from Pierce. Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). UDP-[14C]xylose (264 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. UDP-xylose was purchased from CarboSource Services (www.ccrc.uga.edu/~carbosource/CSS_home.html). The acceptor substrates glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose; Dowex 1-X8 Cl- ion-exchange matrix (200-400 mesh); and Driselase were from Sigma. Cellohexaose was from Seikagaku America (East Falmouth, MA). Oligoxyloglucan, Aspergillus niger β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), and Trichoderma longibrachiatum endoglucanase II (EGII; EC 3.2.1.4) were from Megazyme International Ireland Ltd. (Bray, Ireland). Complete mini protease inhibitor tablets lacking EDTA were from Roche Applied Science. Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns and the protein assay kit were from Bio-Rad. Cloning of AtXT1 and AtXT2—AtXT1 (At3g62720) and AtXT2 (At4g02500) were PCR-amplified from full-length cDNA clones with gene-specific primers containing a CACC adapter on the 5′-end of the forward primer, which is required for directional cloning using the pENTR/D-TOPO vector. The primer sequences are as follows: AtXT1, CACCATGATAGAGAAGTCTATAGGAGCGCA (forward) and CGCAAAATTAAAAGATACAAAACAA (reverse); and AtXT2, CACCATGATTGAGAGGTGTTTAGGAGCTTA (forward) and CCTAAACGCAAAACCGATTC (reverse). PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the DNA corresponding to the size of the expected PCR product was purified using the GENECLEAN SPIN kit, directionally cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO donor vector, and transformed into E. coli TOP10 competent cells. Proper donor constructs were identified from isolated plasmids that had been sequenced to ensure that no mutations had been introduced. Expression of AtXT1 and AtXT2—The Drosophila expression system and the Bac-to-Bac baculoviral expression system were used for heterologous expression of AtXT1 and AtXT2. Constructs of AtXT1 and AtXT2 in pENTR/D-TOPO donor vectors were recombined into pMT-DEST48 and pDEST8 destination vectors via 18-h Clonase reactions. Drosophila S2 (Schneider 2) cells were cotransfected with the pCoBlast vector and pMT-DEST48 containing either the full-length AtXT1 or AtXT2 cDNA sequence. Selection of cell lines stably expressing AtXT1 and AtXT2 was done with blasticidin following the supplier's instructions (Invitrogen). Expression of AtXT1 and AtXT2 was induced by the addition of copper sulfate (500 μm) to the cell cultures 24 h prior to cell harvest. Control S2 cell lines that were not transfected were cultured following the supplier's instructions. S2 cell cultures (20-30 ml each) were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min; the supernatant was removed; and the cells were solubilized with extraction buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MnCl2, and one protease inhibitor tablet/20 ml). The pDEST8-AtXT1 and pDEST8-AtXT2 constructs were electroporated into E. coli DH10Bac cells for transposition of the respective XT gene into Autographa californica bacmids, which were subsequently isolated from positive clones, and the inserts were sequenced. Positive recombinant bacmids were transfected into Sf21 (Spodoptera frugiperda 21) cells following the supplier's instructions (Invitrogen). The Sf21 cell cultures were divided, placed into 50-ml conical tubes, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the pelleted Sf21 cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. The S2 or Sf21 pellets were suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer. The cells were suspended with a pipette and disrupted by 3 × 15 s sonication with a 45-s pause, with storage on ice between sonication treatments. Cell disruption was verified by microscopy. Protein assays were conducted, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 6.25 mg/ml with extraction buffer. The cell extracts were either placed on ice for immediate use in enzyme assays or frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell extracts (either 40 μg of S2 extract total protein or 20 μg of Sf21 extract total protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (15Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with a 5% solution of milk proteins and probed with a polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) raised in rabbits against a fragment of AtXT1 (amino acids 45-195). This antibody was a gift of Ahmed Faik, and the details of its preparation and characterization will be reported elsewhere. 3T. Konishi, A. Faik, and K. Keegstra, manuscript in preparation. Membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies and developed using the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence system. Membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure uniform protein loading and transfer. XT Assay—The XT assay was based upon conditions described previously (11Faik A. Price N.J. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cell extracts from S2 and Sf21 cells expressing AtXT1 and AtXT2 were initially surveyed for XT activity with 0.4 mm UDP-xylose, 44,400 dpm UDP-[14C]xylose, and 4.0 mm acceptor substrate (0.1:1.0 substrate ratio); all other XT reactions were conducted in the presence of either 1.0 mm UDP-xylose, 44,400 dpm UDP-[14C]xylose, and 1.0 mm acceptor substrate (1.0:1.0 substrate ratio) or 2.5 mm UDP-xylose, 111,000 dpm UDP-[14C]xylose, and 1.0 mm acceptor substrate (2.5:1.0 substrate ratio). For each XT assay, 40 μl of cell extract was mixed with 10 μl of substrate solution containing the appropriate amounts of UDP-xylose, UDP-[14C]xylose, and acceptor substrate dissolved in extraction buffer. XT reactions were incubated at 25 °C for either 1 or 18 h and terminated by the addition of 450 μl of Dowex 1-X8 ion-exchange resin suspended in water (1:2 resin/water). Each reaction slurry was loaded onto a Micro Bio-Spin chromatography column and spun in a microcentrifuge at 1300 × g for 2 min. The column effluent (either 50 or 300 μl) was mixed with 2.0 ml of scintillation counting fluid; radioactivity was then measured on a Beckman Coulter LS-5000 scintillation counter. XT reactions that were destined to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-offlight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) did not contain UDP-[14C]xylose and were carried out in parallel with XT reactions containing UDP-[14C]xylose. XT Product Characterization Strategy—To structurally characterize XT products, we developed a strategy that used a combination of high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of XT products sequentially digested with β-glucosidase and EGII. The structural characterization strategy consisted of three major steps, each of which involved the parallel analysis of radiolabeled and unlabeled products generated by enzymes with a combination of HPAEC and MALDI-TOF-MS. Radiolabeled reaction products were partitioned by HPAEC and fractionated into 250-μl aliquots. The radioactivity of each fraction was determined and plotted against time to generate a radioactivity profile that was used to monitor the distribution and amount of radioactivity before and after each enzyme treatment. Unlabeled reaction products were partitioned by HPAEC, desalted, and fractionated into 500-μl aliquots. Each fraction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS to determine the presence and proportion of each reaction species present at a specific elution time interva. In the first step, five XT reactions, with or without radiolabel, were pooled (total volume of ∼1.25 ml), dried down, and suspended in 100 μl of water; 25 μl of each sample was then analyzed by either HPAEC or HPAEC followed by MALDI-TOF-MS. In the second step, 75-μl aliquots of radioactive or nonradioactive XT products were spiked with 10 μmol of cellohexaose, dried down, suspended in 75 μl of hydrolytic enzyme buffer (25 mm sodium acetate and 0.002% thimerosal (pH 5.0)) containing 50.0 milliunits of β-glucosidase, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cellohexaose was added as an internal control to verify complete β-glucosidase digestion. Reactions were terminated by heating at 100 °C for 10 min, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and a 25-μl aliquot was analyzed by HPAEC followed by either liquid scintillation counting or MALDI-TOF-MS. In the third step, 10 μmol of cellohexaose and XXXG were added to the remaining 50-μl aliquot of radioactive products as an internal control to verify complete EGII digestion and as an internal standard for the purpose of calculating the RF value of each radioactive peak, respectively. For the remaining 50 μl of nonradioactive products, 10 μmol of cellohexaose was added as an internal standard to verify complete EGII digestion. Each aliquot was dried down and suspended in 50 μl of hydrolytic enzyme buffer containing 5.0 milliunits of EGII and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by heating at 100 °C for 10 min, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and a 25-μl aliquot was analyzed by HPAEC followed by either liquid scintillation counting or MALDI-TOF-MS. High pH Anion-exchange Chromatography Instrumentation and Conditions—The XT reaction products were analyzed using a Dionex DX300 carbohydrate analysis system equipped with a CarboPac PA10 column (4 × 250 mm) and an ED50 for pulsed amperometric detection following methods that were adapted from previously published studies (16Hardy M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Marry M. Cavalier D.M. Schnurr J.K. Netland J. Yang Z. Pezeshk V. York W.S. Pauly M. White A.R. Carbohydr. Polym. 2003; 51: 347-356Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reaction products (25 μl/injection) were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient of 50 mm sodium acetate and 100 mm sodium hydroxide (0 min) to 100 mm sodium acetate and 100 mm sodium hydroxide (20 min). The column was washed with 300 mm sodium hydroxide (15 min) and re-equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate and 100 mm sodium hydroxide (15 min) after each injection. For HPAEC analysis of radiolabeled XT products, each injection was fractionated into 250-μl aliquots and mixed with 2.0 ml of scintillation counting fluid, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Non-radiolabeled XT reaction products destined for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis were partitioned by HPAEC, desalted with a Dionex in-line desalting module following the manufacturer's instructions, fractionated into 500-μl aliquots, and dried down. MALDI-TOF-MS—XT reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS based upon previously published methods (18Lerouxel O. Choo T.S. Seveno M. Usadel B. Faye L. Lerouge P. Pauly M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, desalted fractions from the HPAEC-partitioned reaction products were dried down, suspended in 2 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in acetonitrile (10 mg/ml), loaded onto the MALDI-TOF-MS plate, and allowed to crystallize. XT reaction products were analyzed with a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in reflector mode with a 100-ns extraction time and a 20-kV accelerating voltage. Each spectrum consisted of data accumulated over 50 laser shots. Heterologous Expression of AtXT1 and AtXT2—AtXT1 and AtXT2 were expressed in two insect cell lines (Drosophila S2 and Sf21) as an alternative to heterologous expression in P. pastoris. The expression of AtXT1 or AtXT2 was verified by immunoblot analyses of S2 and Sf21 cell extracts with an antibody raised against a peptide fragment of AtXT1 (Fig. 1). Because immunoblot analysis verified the presence of AtXT1 and AtXT2 proteins in both expression systems, detergent-solubilized extracts were assayed for XT activity. In the presence of either cellopentaose or cellohexaose as the acceptor substrate, detergent-solubilized extracts from both S2 and Sf21 cells expressing either AtXT1 or AtXT2 showed significant levels of XT activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Although both enzymes utilized either cellopentaose or cellohexaose as an acceptor, the activities of both enzymes were 4-fold higher with cellohexaose as the acceptor compared with cellopentaose. Therefore, further biochemical studies on AtXT1 and AtXT2 activities were conducted using cellohexaose as the acceptor substrate. Furthermore, because we wanted large quantities of material for biochemical characterization of XT activity, we utilized Sf21 cells expressing either AtXT1 or AtXT2 for the experiments described below. Preliminary Characterization of AtXT1 and AtXT2 Enzymatic Activities Produced in Sf21 Cells—In initial studies, we used an XT assay with a 1:10 donor/acceptor substrate ratio (0.4 mm UDP-xylose and 4.0 mm cellopentaose or cellohexaose). However, HPAEC analysis of AtXT1 and AtXT2 products conducted at these substrate ratios showed that a significant amount of cellohexaose was not xylosylated (data not shown). Experiments to increase the amount of xylose incorporated into products demonstrated that a 1:1 substrate ratio (1.0 mm UDP-xylose and 1.0 mm cellohexaose) increased the amount of xylose incorporated and decreased the amount of cellohexaose remaining after 1 h compared with the previously published assay conditions (11Faik A. Price N.J. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Because we were more interested in defining the products of these enzymes than in analyzing the kinetic parameters of each enzyme, the latter reaction conditions were adopted as the standard XT assay conditions and used for further characterization of AtXT1 and AtXT2 substrate specificities and the products generated. The specificity of AtXT1 and AtXT2 was investigated using various sugar nucleotide donors and oligosaccharide acceptors. AtXT1 and AtXT2 are specific for cello-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of >4 (Fig. 3, A and B). Cello-oligosaccharides longer than cellohexaose were not tested as acceptor substrates because they are only partially soluble in aqueous buffers. Like AtXT1 (11Faik A. Price N.J. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), AtXT2 is specific for UDP-xylose as the donor substrate because it does not catalyze the incorporation of [14C]galactose into products when assayed under either XT or GMGT assay conditions (12Edwards M.E. Dickson C.A. Chengappa S. Sidebottom C. Gidley M.J. Reid J.S.G. Plant J. 1999; 19: 691-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Edwards M.E. Marshall E. Gidley M.J. Reid J.S.G. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with UDP-galactose as the donor and either cellohexaose or mannohexaose as the acceptor substrate (data not shown). An additional series of experiments was conducted to characterize the enzymatic properties of both AtXT1 and AtXT2. Many glycosyltransferases are stimulated by the presence of divalent cations. Previous work has shown that XyG biosynthesis is stimulated by Mn2+ but not Mg2+ (20Ray P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Hayashi T.

However, the previous studies were done with enzyme preparations in which both XyG β-glucan synthase and XT activities were present, so it was unclear whether the β-glucan synthase, XT, or both required Mn2+. Using AtXT1 and AtXT2 produced in Sf21 cells, we determined that AtXT1 and AtXT2 activities required Mn2+ (supplemental Fig. S1A); the maximum amount of xylose incorporation was achieved over a broad concentration range of 3-15 mm Mn2+ (supplemental Fig. S1B). Finally, like many glycosyltransferases, both AtXT1 and AtXT2 activities were inhibited by UDP (supplemental Fig. S2). We further investigated the effects of varying the time of incubation and substrate ratio on xylose incorporation. Although the amount of xylose incorporated into products was nearly linear during a 1-h assay at a 1:1 substrate ratio (data not shown), time course experiments demonstrated that xylose incorporation increased between 2- and 3-fold after 18 h (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S3). Xylose incorporation was affected not only by reaction time, but also by an increase in the substrate ratio from 1:1 to 2.5:1 (2.5 mm UDP-xylose and 1.0 mm cellohexaose) (Table 1). Because incubation time and substrate ratio had significant effects on xylose incorporation, we sought to determine whether the variation of these conditions had an affect on the structure of the products generated.TABLE 1Xylose incorporation by AtXT1 and AtXT2EnzymeXyl incorporationpmolAtXT11.0 mm UDP-Xyl1 h20,626 ± 79318 h35,523 ± 11652.5 mm UDP-Xyl1 h24,656 ± 109718 h50,809 ± 1300AtXT21.0 mm UDP-Xyl1 h14,668 ± 59818 h33,056 ± 18202.5 mm UDP-Xyl1 h18,515 ± 60218 h40,243 ± 2928 Open table in a new tab Biochemical Characterization of AtXT1 and AtXT2 Reaction Products—Previous work utilized a combination of carbohydrate-specific hydrolases and size-exclusion chromatography to show that AtXT1 catalyzes the addition of a xylosyl residue to cellopentaose to produce primarily GXGGG (11Faik A. Price N.J. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study, we used HPAEC and MALDI-TOF-MS in conjunction with the substrate specificities of β-glucosidase and EGII to determine 1) the structure of the XT products generated when cellohexaose was used as the acceptor and 2) whether the product structure varied when the substrate ratio and reaction time were varied. Although product characterization is shown for only one of the two enzymes (AtXT1 in Figs. 4 and 6, 7, 8 and AtXT2 in Fig. 5), all analyses were performed on products generated with both enzymes, and similar results were obtained regardless of which enzyme was used.FIGURE 6HPAEC analyses of AtXT1 products after treatment with β-glucosidase and EGII.

Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 423-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The immune response to bacteria in the subepithelium produces the inflammation and purulent discharge characteristic of gonorrhea (4Edwards J.L. Apicella M.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 17: 965-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Holmes K.K. Counts G.W. Beaty H.N. Ann. Intern. Med. 1971; 74: 979-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). On occasion, GC establish a carrier state in which an asymptomatic individual harbors culturable and transmissible bacteria. These carriers are key to the spread of gonococcal disease, as humans are the only known reservoir for GC (6Turner C.F. Rogers S.M. Miller H.G. Miller W.C. Gribble J.N. Chromy J.R. Leone P.A. Cooley P.C. Quinn T.C. Zenilman J.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which GC maintains this persistent state are unknown. One hypothesis is that the organism resides within the epithelial cells instead of crossing into the subepithelium, thus evading the host immune response. The gene product(s) that affect GC intracellular growth and transcytosis are therefore important for the maintenance of gonococci in the human population.The fitAB operon was identified in a screen for GC mutants with a fast intracellular trafficking phenotype across polarized epithelial monolayers (3Hopper S. Wilbur J.S. Vasquez B.L. Larson J. Clary S. Mehr I.J. Seifert H.S. So M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 896-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A GC mutant that lacks fitAB grows normally extracellularly, but has an accelerated rate of intracellular replication with a concomitant increase in the rate at which this mutant traverses a monolayer of polarized epithelial cells. Thus, either FitA or FitB, or their complex, is hypothesized to slow intracellular replication and intracellular trafficking of GC.FitA is an 8.4-kDa protein with a predicted N-terminal ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) DNA binding motif (7Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8Wilbur J.S. Chivers P.T. Mattison K. Potter L. Brennan R.G. So M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12515-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). FitB is a 15.3-kDa protein with a predicted PIN (PilT-N terminus) domain according to the BLAST search tool (9Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar). The function of the PIN domain is unknown; however many proteins that contain a PIN domain are thought to perform roles in nucleic acid metabolism including synthesis and remodeling. In genome studies on Archaea and thermophilic bacteria, sequences predicted to encode PIN domain-containing proteins are found in regions predicted to encode DNA polymerases, helicases, and nucleases (10Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Rogozin I.B. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, the Dis3p exonucleases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans are predicted to have PIN domains (11Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R888-R890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Grishin N.V. Tatusov R.L. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Genome. Res. 1999; 9: 608-628PubMed Google Scholar). Bicistronic operons where an RHH DNA-binding protein is juxtaposed with a PIN domain have been proposed to form one family of toxin/antitoxin systems (13Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The PIN domain containing protein is thus predicted to act as a toxin; this is in agreement with the role of FitB in slowing GC replication when the bacteria are within epithelial cells (3Hopper S. Wilbur J.S. Vasquez B.L. Larson J. Clary S. Mehr I.J. Seifert H.S. So M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 896-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).FitA and FitB form a heterodimer, and copurify after overexpression in Escherichia coli. The FitAB complex binds DNA from the fitAB upstream region with high affinity (8Wilbur J.S. Chivers P.T. Mattison K. Potter L. Brennan R.G. So M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12515-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In our current model the FitAB complex binds to the fitAB promoter when GC are in an extracellular environment. This results in both sequestration of FitAB and repression of fitAB transcription. Upon invasion, FitAB may be released from the DNA and subsequently dissociate to slow both GC replication and transcytosis by an as yet undefined mechanism.To understand the structural basis of the DNA binding specificity and possible nuclease function of the FitAB complex, the x-ray crystallographic structure of a FitAB complex bound to a high affinity 36-base pair DNA fragment from the fitAB upstream region was determined. Four FitA and four FitB proteins form a unique tetramer of heterodimers structure that explains the ability of FitAB to bind DNA with higher affinity than FitA alone (8Wilbur J.S. Chivers P.T. Mattison K. Potter L. Brennan R.G. So M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12515-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structure suggests that FitB could slow intracellular GC replication by acting as a “toxin” when the FitA (“the antitoxin”)-mediated inhibition of FitB nuclease activity is relieved upon complex dissociation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation, Crystallization, and X-ray Intensity Data Collection—FitA and FitB were overexpressed in E. coli using a pET28b vector (Invitrogen) that encodes the intact FitAB operon (8Wilbur J.S. Chivers P.T. Mattison K. Potter L. Brennan R.G. So M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12515-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This vector incorporates a T7 promoter at the 5′-end of fitA and sequences encoding six histidine residues at the 3′-end of fitB. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of FitB was also slightly altered by the addition of an XhoI restriction site, changing from... NPWHD to... NPWHLEHHHHHH. The overexpressed FitAB complex was purified using nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Purified FitAB complex was concentrated to 5 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole.The intact FitAB complex did not crystallize despite numerous attempts. Therefore, limited proteolysis was done on the FitAB complex in order to generate a stabile core that might be more amenable to crystallization. Using 0.1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) the complex was digested for 30 min at 22 °C before crystallization trials. Trypsin inhibitor cross-linked to agarose beads (Sigma) was used to remove trypsin from the FitAB solution after digestion. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that this treatment removed the ribbon-helix-helix motif of FitA and the resulting complex, termed FitcAB, does not bind DNA (data not shown). Crystallization was carried out using hanging drop-vapor diffusion where FitcAB was mixed 1:1 (v:v) with a reservoir solution of 0.26 m sodium phosphate/citrate pH 4.7 and 2.0 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals appeared overnight and grew to final dimensions of 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.02 mm in ∼3 days.To generate selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted FitcAB complex, the expression vector described above was used as a template for standard PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) of FitB, which contains no methionines, to yield a construct encoding FitAB where residues Leu43, Leu63, and Leu116 of FitB were substituted with methionines (FitAB3(LxM)). The FitAB3(LxM) protein was purified as described above. DNA binding assays confirmed that the FitAB3(LxM) complex has the same affinity for DNA as wild-type FitAB (data not shown). For overexpression of SeMet-substituted FitAB3(LxM), E. coli harboring the expression vector were grown in minimal medium lacking methionine with added SeMet as described (14Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Using nickel affinity column chromatography, SeMet-containing FitA and FitB3(LxM) copurify as do the wild-type proteins. The SeMet-containing heterodimer was concentrated and trypsinized as described for wild-type FitAB. Crystallization of the SeMet-FitcAB3(LxM) complex employed 0.26 m sodium citrate pH 5.6 and 2.0 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals with dimensions 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm were obtained after 4 weeks.To crystallize the FitAB-DNA complex, 5 mg/ml of purified native FitAB3(LxM) was mixed in a 4:1 molar ratio with IR36 DNA (8Wilbur J.S. Chivers P.T. Mattison K. Potter L. Brennan R.G. So M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12515-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), where two of the thymine bases were replaced with 5-iodouracil (I) (top strand, 5′-AGATTGCTATCATTTTTTTTATTTTGATAGCATITG; bottom strand, 5′-CAAATGCTATCAAAAIAAAAAAAATGATAGCAATCT). The protein-DNA complex was then mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a reservoir solution of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.27 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 7.2% PEG 20,000, 7.2% PEG monomethyl ether 550. Crystals with dimensions 0.02 × 0.1 × 0.5 mm were obtained after 1 week.Cryoprotection conditions for crystals of both native and SeMet-substituted FitcAB were established by soaking crystals in 20% glycerol, 0.26 m sodium phosphate/citrate, pH 4.7, and 2.2 m ammonium sulfate for ∼30 s. Cryoprotection was achieved for FitAB-IR36 crystals by soaking the crystals in 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.27 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 7.2% PEG 20,000, 7.2% PEG monomethyl ether 550 for 30 s. All crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. x-ray intensity data were collected at the Advanced Light Source beamline 8.2.1 (Berkeley, CA) and processed using MOSFLM (15Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) as implemented in the CCP4 suite (16Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar).Structure Determinations and Refinements—The structure of SeMet-FitcAB3(LxM) was solved by multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) methods using the SeMet-FitcAB3(LxM) data collected at three wavelengths (Table 1). Seven selenium sites were located and initial phases were calculated with SOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) using data from 20.0 to 3.0 Å resolution and improved by solvent flipping (with 45% solvent content) as implemented in the crystallography and NMR system (CNS) (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). The handedness was determined by inspection of electron density maps where the initial phases were derived either from the selenium atom sites found by SOLVE or sites with the coordinates inverted. Electron density maps for the entire resolution range (58.0-2.0 Å) were then calculated using CNS. FitB and amino acid residues 46-65 of FitA were built into the map using O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar), and the location of the selenomethionine residues as reference points. 66 water molecules were added to the model and simulated annealing (SA), positional, and thermal parameter refinement using CNS were performed, followed by rebuilding of the model in O. When the Rwork and Rfree were 28.2 and 29.7%, respectively, the coordinates were used to solve the structure of the wild-type, native FitcAB molecule by molecular replacement using MOLREP (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Multiple rounds of positional and thermal parameter refinement in CNS followed by model rebuilding in O were done using the native data to the limiting resolution of 1.8 Å until the Rfree converged to 22.4%.TABLE 1Selected crystallographic statisticsSeMet-FitcAB3(L×M)Native FitcAB wild typeNative FitAB - IR36 DNASpace groupP212121P21Cell constants (Å)a = 49.1a = 70.0a = 75.0b = 68.5b = 50.7b = 82.4c = 104.5c = 48.3c = 135.5β = 118.5°β = 94.2°Wavelength (Å)0.97960.96860.97941.00001.0332Resolution (Å)57.74-2.0057.74-2.0057.74-2.0042.26-1.8081.65-3.00Overall Rsym (%)aRsym = ∑/∑|Ihkl-Ihkl(j)|/∑Ihkl, where Ihkl(j) is observed intensity and Ikhl is the final average value of intensity.9.0 (32.5)bValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell, 1.80 Å-1.99 Å for FitcAB, 3.00-3.14 Å for FitAB-IR36.9.5 (33.2)9.8 (33.5)5.5 (22.2)17.8 (44.0)Overall I/σ(I)3.7 (2.3)3.4 (2.2)3.1 (2.2)9.7 (3.1)3.1 (1.5)Total reflections (#)1968431979091970723100233243Unique reflections (#)2453924542245371334016708Completeness (%)96.5 (95.3)99.9 (99.9)Phasing resolution (Å)20.00-3.00Selenium sites (#)7Overall Figure of MeritcFigure of Merit = 〈|∑P(α)eiα/∑P(α)| 〉, where α is the phase and P(α) is the phase probability distribution.0.720RefinementRwork/Rfree (%)dRwork = ∑||Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑Fobs| and Rfree = ∑|Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs|; where all reflections belong to a test set of 10% randomly selected data.19.1/22.421.2/26.9RmsdBond angles (°)1.281.27Bond lengths (Å)0.0070.008B values (Å2)1.901.60Average B-values (Å2)Overall2541Protein2538DNAn/aen/a, not applicable.51A-tractn/a42Ramachandran analysisMost favored (%/#)94.2/12988.5/655Additional allowed (%/#)5.8/811.2/83Generously allowed (%/#)0/00.3/2Disallowed (%/#)0/00/0a Rsym = ∑/∑|Ihkl-Ihkl(j)|/∑Ihkl, where Ihkl(j) is observed intensity and Ikhl is the final average value of intensity.b Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell, 1.80 Å-1.99 Å for FitcAB, 3.00-3.14 Å for FitAB-IR36.c Figure of Merit = 〈|∑P(α)eiα/∑P(α)| 〉, where α is the phase and P(α) is the phase probability distribution.d Rwork = ∑||Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑Fobs| and Rfree = ∑|Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs|; where all reflections belong to a test set of 10% randomly selected data.e n/a, not applicable.

The final model was verified by inspection of 2Fo - Fc simulated annealing-composite omit maps.The high resolution FitcAB structure was used as a model to solve the structure of the FitAB-IR36 complex by molecular replacement using MOLREP (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The remainder of the FitA sequence and the DNA was built into the map using O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr.

After simulated annealing (SA) and extensive positional and thermal parameter refinement using CNS followed by model rebuilding in O, the Rwork and Rfree converged to 21.2% and 26.9%, respectively, at 3.0 Å resolution. The model was verified by inspection of the 2Fo - Fc simulated annealing-composite omit maps. The final model contains four molecules of FitA (residues 2-69, 2-65, 2-68, 2-64), four molecules of FitB (residues 1-143, 1-140, 1-143, 1-140), the complete 36 base pair double-stranded IR36 DNA fragment and 54 water molecules. Figures were made using Swiss-PDB Viewer (21Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9472) Google Scholar) and POV-Ray.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure of the FitAB Heterodimer—The structure of the FitB protein complexed with a C-terminal fragment of FitA (FitcAB) was determined to 1.8 Å resolution by multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction using selenomethionine substituted proteins (“Experimental Procedures” and Table 1). This structure was used as a model to solve the structure of the full-length FitAB complex bound to a 36-bp DNA molecule to 3.0 Å resolution by molecular replacement (“Experimental Procedures” and Table 1).The FitA monomer has an extended structure, with the topology β1 (residues 4-7), α1 (residues 11-23), α2 (residues 28-43), α3 (residues 48-59) (Fig. 1a). Electron density is visible for the intact N terminus of FitA, beginning at Ala2. Met1 is not present in our preparation, as determined by N-terminal sequencing of the protein (data not shown). At the C-terminal end, variable electron density is seen for the four molecules of the asymmetric unit, the final 9-14 residues are not visible (depending upon the monomer). The first 45 residues of this protein (β1-α1-α2) are highly homologous to the RHH class of DNA-binding proteins, which includes the bacteriophage P22 proteins Mnt and Arc (Fig. 1b) (7Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8Wilbur J.S. Chivers P.T. Mattison K. Potter L. Brennan R.G. So M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15036-15045Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An overlay of the FitA and Arc repressor structures results in a root mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of 1.1 Å over the first 45 residues (23Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). An arginine found in β1 of the RHH proteins is conserved in FitA (Fig. 1b, highlighted in blue).FitB forms a compact domain with an α/β/α-fold (Fig. 1a). This protein consists of a central 5-stranded parallel β-sheet with four α-helices packed on one side of the sheet and three α helices on its other side. The topology is β1 (residues 1-5), α1 (residues 7-12), α2 (residues 19-26), β2 (residues 32-36), α3 (residues 38-48), α4 (residues 55-65), β3 (residues 74-76), α5 (residues 80-94), α6 (residues 102-112), β4 (residues 117-120), α7 (residues 124-128), β5 (residues 132-134) (Fig. 1a). Electron density for the entire FitB protein is visible, with only engineered histidine residues at the C terminus not observed in the structure (missing 3/6 His in 2 monomers and 6/6 His in 2 monomers). Searches, using both the DALI server (23Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) and the protein structure comparison service SSM (24Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar) at the European Bioinformatics Institute, found structural homologues of FitB in PIN-domain containing proteins. Using the BLAST server, none of these PIN domain-containing proteins were found to have significant similarity at the primary structure level to FitB (9Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar). The archetypical PIN domain is found in the PilT N terminus, and the closest FitB structural homologue is PAE2754 from Pyrobaculum aerophilim (Fig. 1b) (25Arcus V.L. Backbro K. Roos A. Daniel E.L. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16471-16478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Wall D. Kaiser D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this domain is unknown. However, the PIN domain is found in a wide variety of systems, from bacterial FitB-like genes that are thought to be involved in plasmid maintenance, to the yeast Dis3p exonucleases (11Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R888-R890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Freiberg C. Fellay R. Bairoch A. Broughton W.J. Rosenthal A. Perret X. Nature. 1997; 387: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 28Hanekamp T. Kobayashi D. Hayes S. Stayton M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Despite a lack of sequence similarity, the four acidic residues absolutely conserved among PIN domains are present in FitB (Fig. 1b, highlighted in red).In addition to the RHH and PIN domain-containing proteins, there is a group of prokaryotic proteins with a high level of sequence homology to FitAB (Fig. 1b). These typically consist of both a FitA and a FitB homologue in a conserved operon organization and little is understood about their biochemical function, although they are known to play a general role in plasmid stability and/or partition (27Freiberg C. Fellay R. Bairoch A. Broughton W.J. Rosenthal A. Perret X. Nature. 1997; 387: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 31Pullinger G.D. Lax A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1631-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These have been proposed to act as toxin/antitoxin pairs, with the RHH protein acting as the antitoxin, repressing the toxic activity of the PIN domain-containing protein (32Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome. Biol. 2003; 4: R81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the FitAB complex is likely to predict the structures of these toxin/antitoxin proteins. The biochemical function of this group of proteins within prokaryotic cells is likely to be similar as that performed by FitAB. Sequence alignments of FitA and FitB with two examples of such systems (Y4jJ/K and StbCB) are shown in Fig. 1b.The FitA-FitB Interface—The FitA and FitB proteins form a tightly associated dimer and the FitAB structure reveals the heterodimerization interface, which is formed predominantly by contacts between α3 and the C-terminal extended coil region of FitA and helices α1, α2, and α4 of FitB (Fig. 1, a and c). The interface buries 1900 Å2 accessible surface area in which the FitA helix fills a large exposed hydrophobic groove on FitB resulting in a globular heterodimeric domain (Fig. 1, a and c). Much of the interface is hydrophobic. For example, the nonpolar side chain of residue Leu52 of the FitA helix sits between Ile9 and Pro12 of FitB α1 (Fig. 1c). At the C terminus of FitA, outside of the helical region, the side chains of residue Ile59 contacts the side chains of residues Val58 and Leu59 from α4 of FitB (Fig. 1c). Other residues of the α4 and α4-β3 turn of FitB that are important components of the dimer interface are Ile67, Leu70, and Phe71, which contact Leu 48, Met51, and Ile55 of FitA (Fig. 1c).FitA helix α3 binding to FitB is also stabilized by four ionic interactions, which serve to orient and buttress the two molecules, thereby facilitating a tight association between the complementary hydrophobic surfaces (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, two of these electrostatic interactions are analogous to the charge clamp described in structures of the human nuclear receptors bound to helices of coactivators (33Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 34Watkins R.E. Maglich J.M. Moore L.B. Wisely G.B. Noble S.M. Davis-Searles P.R. Lambert M.H. Kliewer S.A. Redinbo M.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the charge clamp, charged residues engage in favorable electrostatic interactions with the oppositely charged dipole of the helical termini. The guanidinium group of FitA residue Arg47 interacts with the backbone carbonyl of residue Asp26 at the C-terminal end of the FitB α2-helix. The Nζ atom of FitB residue Lys55 interacts with a backbone carbonyl oxygens of residues Glu60 and Glu61 at the C-terminal end of the FitA helix. Other stabilizing electrostatic interactions occur between the side chains of FitA Glu58 and FitB Arg62 and FitA Glu63 and FitB Arg14 (Fig. 1c).Structure of the FitAB-IR36 Complex—Four FitAB heterodimers form a unique tetramer structure that binds to one 36-base pair DNA fragment (Fig. 2). The FitA subunits from complexes I and IV form a tightly associated domain that binds to one of the inverted repeat half-sites while the corresponding FitA portions of complexes II and III bind to the other inverted repeat (Fig. 2a). By contrast, the FitB-FitB dimer interfaces are formed between subunits from complexes I and II and complexes III and IV (Fig. 2a). Such mixing and matching of dimer interfaces is novel for the RHH family and results in the formation of the tetramer of heterodimers. Other toxin-antitoxin pairs have also been shown to form various higher order structures. For example, the MazE-MazF complex forms an extended heterohexamer (MazF2-MazE2-MazF2), and the RelE-RelB complex is a single globular domain that assembles into a heterotetramer (RelE2-RelB2) (35Takagi H.

https://openalex.org/W2043300905,"Interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) is a critical component of the IL-10·IL-10R1·IL-10R2 complex which regulates IL-10-mediated immunomodulatory responses. The ternary IL-10 signaling complex is assembled in a sequential order with the IL-10·IL-10R1 interaction occurring first followed by engagement of the IL-10R2 chain. In this study we map the IL-10R2 binding site on IL-10 using surface plasmon resonance and cell-based assays. Critical IL-10R2 binding residues are located in helix A adjacent to the previously identified IL-10R1 recognition surface. Interestingly, IL-10R2 binding residues located in the N-terminal end of helix A exhibit large structural differences between unbound cIL-10 and cIL-10·IL-10R1 crystal structures. This suggests IL-10R1-induced conformational changes regulate IL-10R2 binding and assembly of the ternary IL-10·IL-10R1·IL-10R2 complex. The basic mechanistic features of the assembly process are likely shared by six additional class-2 cytokines (viral IL-10s, IL-22, IL-26, IL-28A, IL28B, and IL-29) to promote IL-10R2 binding to six additional receptor complexes.

IL-10 dampens inflammatory responses by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as major histocompatibility complex and B7 on a variety of cell types (2de Waal Malefyt R.

However, IL-10 also exhibits immunostimulatory properties that include the proliferation and differentiation of thymocytes, mast cells, and B cells (4Rousset F. Garcia E. Defrance T. Peronne C.

Preliminary clinical data suggest antagonists that block IL-10 immunostimulatory properties may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of lupus and other inflammatory diseases (7Beebe A.M. Cua D.J. de Waal Malefyt R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). cIL-10 biological activities are mediated by receptor engagement and assembly of the cIL-10·IL-10R1·IL-10R2 complex, which activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (8Kotenko S.V.

Based on a variety of cell surface and solution binding studies, the ternary signaling complex is assembled in a sequential manner, with IL-10R1 binding to cIL-10 first with high affinity (∼1 × 10-10 m) followed by low affinity interactions between IL-10R2 and the cIL-10·IL-10R1 binary complex (Fig. 1). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies show IL-10R2 exhibits at least a 10-fold increase in affinity for the cIL-10·IL-10R1 binary complex (Kd = 234 μm) compared with IL-10 alone (Kd ∼ 2 mm (10Logsdon N.J.

Structure (Camb). 2005; 13: 551-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)). The cooperative binding mechanism by which IL-10R2 recognition is modulated by IL-10R1 has not been determined. Furthermore, the data suggest cIL-10 antagonists that bind tightly to IL-10R1 but do not engage the low affinity IL-10R2 chain could be designed if the mechanisms governing IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 binding are identified. Several herpes viruses express cIL-10 mimics that aid viruses in establishing persistent infections in their hosts (12Redpath S. Ghazal P. Gascoigne N.R. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 86-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In particular, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus encode biologically functional IL-10 homologues cmvIL-10 and ebvIL-10, respectively (13Lockridge K.M. Zhou S.S. Kravitz R.H. Johnson J.L. Sawai E.T. Blewett E.L. Barry P.A. Virology. 2000; 268: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Kotenko S.V. Saccani S. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

With sequence identities of 83% (ebvIL-10) and 27% (cmvIL-10), both viral IL-10s bind and signal through the IL-10 receptor complex inducing overlapping biological activities with cIL-10 (15Liu Y. de Waal Malefyt R. Briere F. Parham C. Bridon J.M. Banchereau J. Moore K.W. Xu J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 604-613PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence identity is not correlated with IL-10R1 or IL-10R2 affinity, suggesting the mechanisms governing receptor recognition and assembly are more complex than simple amino acid changes on a common ligand scaffold. In addition to the importance of IL-10R2 in modulating cIL-10 signaling, the IL-10R2 chain also participates in a broad array of protein-protein interactions with at least five additional class-2 cytokines (IL-22, IL-26, IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29) that share ∼10-20% sequence identity with cIL-10 and exhibit a diverse array of biological activities (16Walter M.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 68: 171-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Pestka S. Krause C.D. Sarkar D. Walter M.R. Shi Y. Fisher P.B. Annu. Rev.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recently, alanine scanning mutagenesis identified five hotspot residues on helices A and D of IL-22 that are important for IL-10R2 binding (19Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Allman J.C. Izotova L. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Walter M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, because helices A and D in cIL-10 and IL-22 exhibit extensive structural and sequence diversity, it is unclear if each molecule shares a common structural or energetic IL-10R2 binding site (19Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Allman J.C. Izotova L. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Walter M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Analysis of IL-10R2 binding to a series of overlapping 15-mer peptides, derived from cIL-10 and IL-22, provides initial evidence the sites are quite different (20Wolk K. Witte E. Reineke U. Witte K. Friedrich M. Sterry W. Asadullah K. Volk H.D. Sabat R. Genes Immun. 2005; 6: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify the IL-10R2 binding site on cIL-10 and show that cIL-10·IL-10R2 interactions are dependent on IL-10R1-mediated conformational changes in cIL-10. Residues important for IL-10R2 binding are located at the N- and C-terminal ends of helix A and form two distinct interaction surfaces (site 2a and 2b) located adjacent to the previously identified site 1a and site 1b IL-10R1 binding sites (21Josephson K. Logsdon N.J. Walter M.R. Immunity. 2001; 15: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The overall location of the IL-10R2 binding sites on cIL-10 and IL-22 are conserved. However, the most important residues for IL-10R2 binding are located in site 2b for cIL-10 and site 2a for IL-22. The importance of structure in IL-10R2 recognition is emphasized by the lack of sequence conservation across the IL-10R2 binding cytokines. However, each molecule conserves key structural features, including an N-terminal disulfide bond and a hydrophobic sequence after the AB loop, which allow the proteins to access significant conformational changes required for their biological function. These studies further define the molecular mechanisms governing IL-10R2 receptor sharing and provide insights into the design of cIL-10 antagonists that might be useful in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Mutagenesis—Mutations to generate sIL-10R1T213C, and all variants of cIL-10 were carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of cIL-10 Variants and IL-10 Receptors—Wild-type and variant cIL-10 proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain, refolded, and purified as previously described (22Josephson K. DiGiacomo R. Indelicato S.R. Iyo A.H. Nagabhushan T.L. Parker M.H. Walter M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13552-13557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of IL-10R1 (sIL-10R1), sIL-10R1T213C, and IL-10R2 (sIL-10R2) were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells and purified by using affinity chromatography as previously described (10Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Josephson K. Cook J. Walter M.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 1099-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Josephson K. Logsdon N.J. Walter M.R.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1908-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Purified sIL-10R1T213C was reduced with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 200 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA. β-Mercaptoethanol was removed by a desalting column (GE Healthcare) and biotinylated (sIL-10R1T213C-Bt) with 1 μm PEO-maleimide activated biotin (Pierce) followed by exhaustive dialysis against 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0). SPR Experiments—All SPR experiments were performed on a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore) at 20 °C using HBS running buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% Surfactant P20). Immobilization of all proteins on the chip surfaces was performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/ml. Surfaces were regenerated by injecting 2 m MgCl2 (pH 7.4) for 1 min followed by HBS running buffer containing 20 mm EDTA for 1 min at the flow rate of 50 μl/min. Streptavidin (Pierce) in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was immobilized at the level of 1900-3600RU by amine-coupling chemistry on CM5 chips (BIAcore) that had been activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m n-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.1 m 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-N-ethylcarbondiimide. Surfaces were blocked by the injection of 1 m ethanolamine for 7 min. sIL-10R1T213C-Bt in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) was captured on streptavidin surfaces at final densities of 80-240 RU for CM5 chips. Control surfaces of free streptavidin or streptavidin containing the biotinylated extracellular domain of IL-22R1 were used and gave identical results. Kinetic interaction experiments were performed by injecting serially diluted monomeric cIL-10s (cIL-10M1s) over sIL-10R1T213C-Bt surfaces in random order at 50 μl/min. The data were prepared by the method of double referencing as described by Rich and Myszka (24Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Using BIAevaluation software version 3.2 (BIAcore), the response curves were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. For cIL-10·sIL-10R1 interactions, cIL-10 was amine coupled to CM5 chips. Amine coupled IFN-τ4 was used as the control surface. sIL-10R1 was serially diluted and injected over the amine-coupled cIL-10 surfaces in random order at 50 μl/min. IL-10R2 binding was evaluated using cIL-10 or cIL-10 alanine mutants amine coupled to CM-5 chips at high levels (1020-1230 RU). The binary cIL-10·sIL-10R1 complex was formed by injecting 500 nm of sIL-10R1 to saturate the cIL-10 surface. This was followed by a second injection of 700 μm sIL-10R2 and 500 nm sIL-10R1. The contribution of sIL-10R2 to the binding response was calculated by normalizing sensorgrams with the responses of the first injection and then by subtracting a base-line response obtained by the injection of 500 nm sIL-10R1 only. Equilibrium responses were obtained by averaging the responses obtained in the final 10 s of the latter injection. Structure Comparisons of Unbound cIL-10 and cIL-10·sIL-10R1 Complexes—To ensure the structures used to interpret the mutagenesis data were of the highest quality possible, we completed the refinement of unbound cIL-10, 1INR, to give a final structure with PDB code 2H24. In addition, crystals of the cIL-10·sIL-10R1 complex that diffract to 2.5Å resolution, compared with 2.9 Å for the previous 1J7V structure, were used to refine the cIL-10·sIL-10R1 model (1Y6K) for the analysis. No significant changes were observed in the new structures, and the interpretation of the data is the same regardless of the structure used. Details of the structure refinements are described in the supplemental material. Structures used in the analyses were cIL-10 (2H24, 2ILK), ebvIL-10 (1VLK), cIL-10·sIL-10R1 (1Y6K), ebvIL-10·sIL-10R1 (1Y6M), cmvIL-10·sIL-10R1 (1LQS), and IL-22 (1M4R, 1YKB). Figs. 4 and 5 were generated using Ribbons (25Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Comparison of sIL-10R2 binding sites.

Viable cell density was assayed using alamar blue. Fluorescence intensity was measured at room temperature using a POLARstar plate reader (BMG Lab Technologies, Inc.) at wavelengths of 544-nm excitation and 590-nm emission. STAT3 Activation Assays—Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by elutriation in a Beckman JE-6B centrifugal elutriator as described previously (26Dickensheets H.L. Venkataraman C. Schindler U. Donnelly R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10800-10805Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Monocytes were incubated with wild-type cIL-10 or cIL-10 mutants for 30 min at 37 °C. After cytokine treatment, whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) antibodies. Statistical Methods—The Kolmogorov-Smirnov method was used to confirm the receptor binding, and biological activity datasets were normally distributed. Analysis of variance was performed to confirm each dataset contained significant overall differences (p < 0.05). A 2-sided Dunnett's test, which controls the type I experiment-wise error, was utilized to determine significant differences (p < 0.05) between cIL-10M1 or cIL-10 and their respective mutants. Experimental Strategy to Identify the IL-10R2 Binding Site— The dissociation constant of the soluble IL-10R2 chain for the soluble cIL-10·sIL-10R1 binary complex is approximately ∼230 μm (11Yoon S.I. Jones B.C. Logsdon N.J. Walter M.R. Structure (Camb). 2005; 13: 551-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study we sought to define specific cIL-10 residues that mediate IL-10R2 binding and signal transduction. Regions of cIL-10 targeted for mutagenesis were identified based on previous studies that defined the IL-10R2 binding site on IL-22, a structural homolog of cIL-10 (19Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Allman J.C. Izotova L. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Walter M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To map the IL-10R2 binding site, cIL-10 mutants were initially screened for IL-10R1 affinity using SPR, and their ability to induce the proliferation of human TF-1 cells transfected with the IL-10R1 chain (Fig. 1). Mutation of cIL-10 residues that bind IL-10R2 are expected to display essentially wild-type affinity for sIL-10R1 but exhibit a reduced capacity to induce TF-1/cIL-10R1 cell proliferation. IL-10·IL-10R1 SPR Assay—A new SPR assay was developed to accurately evaluate the binding kinetics of cIL-10 alanine mutants for IL-10R1 (Fig. 1B). Threonine-213 in sIL-10R1 was mutated to a cysteine (sIL-10R1T213C) and biotinylated (sIL-10R1T213C-Bt) with maleimide biotin for oriented and homogeneous capture on streptavidin CM5 chips. The T213C mutation was made in the stalk region of sIL-10R1 just before where IL-10R1 enters the membrane to simulate its orientation on the cell surface (Fig. 1B). Attempts to accurately fit sensorgram data collected by injecting dimeric cIL-10 over the sIL-10R1T213C-Bt surface were not successful because cIL-10 dimers formed mixtures of 1:1 and 1:2 cIL-10 dimer-sIL-10R1T213C-Bt complexes (data not shown). This mixture occurs because streptavidin-labeled sIL-10R1T213C-Bt molecules do not form 2-fold-related receptor pairs on the sensorgram surfaces as required for bivalent IL-10R1 binding (11Yoon S.I. Jones B.C. Logsdon N.J. Walter M.R. Structure (Camb). 2005; 13: 551-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Josephson K. Logsdon N.J. Walter M.R. Immunity. 2001; 15: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast to SPR studies with cIL-10, injecting a monomeric form of cIL-10 (cIL-10M1) over the sIL-10R1T213C-Bt surface resulted in sensorgrams that could be globally fit to a simple 1:1 Langmuir interaction model (Fig. 1C). As previously described, cIL-10M1 is biologically active, and its structure is identical to one subunit of the cIL-10 dimer (10Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Josephson K. Cook J. Walter M.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 1099-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Josephson K. DiGiacomo R. Indelicato S.R. Iyo A.H. Nagabhushan T.L. Parker M.H. Walter M.R. J. Biol.

Structure. 2002; 10: 981-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, cIL-10M1 provides an important tool for determining accurate binding parameters for the cIL-10·IL-10R1 site 1 interface and for mapping the IL-10R2 binding site. Based on the global fit of the data, the association (k1) and dissociation rates (k-1) are 5.7 × 105 m-1 s-1 and 2.6 × 10-4 s-1, respectively. Using these kinetic constants, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd = k-1/k1) for the interaction between cIL-10M1 and sIL-10R1T213C-Bt is 0.47 nm. The kinetic and equilibrium parameters are in good agreement with those from previous SPR analysis using cIL-10M1-immobilized surfaces and isothermal titration calorimetry data (10Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Josephson K. Cook J. Walter M.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 1099-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Yoon S.I. Jones B.C. Logsdon N.J. Walter M.R. Structure (Camb). 2005; 13: 551-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Identification of the IL-10R2 Binding Site on cIL-10M1—A total of 13 cIL-10M1 mutants, located on α-helices A and D, were evaluated for IL-10R1 binding on sIL-10R1T213C-Bt surfaces, biological activity in TF-1/cIL-10R1 cell proliferation assays, and STAT3 activation in human monocytes (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table I). Twelve of the 13 cIL-10M1 mutants exhibited sIL-10R1 binding affinities similar to cIL-10M1 (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table I). In contrast, cIL-10M1R24A displayed a 10-fold lower affinity for sIL-10R1T213C-Bt (Kd = 4.7 nm). Thus, with the exception of cIL-10M1R24A, mutants that exhibit reduced biological activity in the proliferation and STAT3 assays are likely involved in IL-10R2 binding. To quantify the potency of each mutant in the proliferation assay, dose-response curves (Fig. 1D) were generated for each cIL-10M1 mutant, and the concentration required to induce 50% maximal proliferation (EC50) was plotted in Fig. 2A along with the IL-10R1 affinity of each mutant (supplemental Table 1). These experiments identified two cIL-10M1 mutants (M22A and R24A) that displayed substantially higher EC50 values than cIL-10M1. cIL-10M1M22A exhibited the largest increase in EC50 (EC50 = 23 ng/ml) and could only reach 80% of the maximal cIL-10M1 activity at concentrations as high as 100 μg/ml (Fig. 1D). This was the only mutant that could not achieve maximal proliferation by increasing its concentration in the assay. cIL-10M1R24A exhibited a similar increase in EC50 value as cIL-10M1M22A (EC50 = 14 ng/ml). After cIL-10M1M22A and cIL-10M1R24A, cIL-10M1N21A and cIL-10M1R32A exhibited the next highest EC50 values (EC50 ∼ 1 ng/ml), although they were not statistically different from cIL-10M1 (p < 0.05). Because the TF-1/cIL-10R1 cell line used in the proliferation assay is an artificial cell line transfected with the IL-10R1 chain (15Liu Y. de Waal Malefyt R. Briere F. Parham C. Bridon J.M. Banchereau J. Moore K.W. Xu J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 604-613PubMed Google Scholar), we also evaluated the ability of each cIL-10M1 mutant to activate STAT3 in primary human monocytes, which express endogenous IL-10 receptor levels (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the results obtained using the TF-1/cIL-10R1 proliferation assay, cIL-10M1M22A and cIL-10M1R24A were completely inactive in the STAT3 activation assay. In addition, cIL-10M1N21A and cIL-10M1R32A also exhibited essentially no detectable STAT3 phosphorylation activity on monocytes. Furthermore, the S31A and S93A mutants showed reductions in STAT3 activation. In summary, STAT3 activation studies using human monocytes indicated cIL-10M1 residues Asn-21, Met-22, and Arg-32 are most critical for the cIL-10M1·IL-10R2 interaction, and Ser-31 and Ser-93 may play a minor role in IL-10R2 engagement. The Arg-24 mutant is clearly important for biological activity, but its role in IL-10R2 binding, rather than IL-10R1 binding, remains to be determined. Characterization of cIL-10 Dimer Mutants—Because the initial alanine scan was performed with monomeric cIL-10 rather than dimeric cIL-10, putative IL-10R2 binding residues (Asn-21, Met-22, Arg-24, and Arg-32) as well as His-90 and Ser-93 were mutated in the cIL-10 dimer and characterized for IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 binding and the ability to activate STAT3 in primary human monocytes. To characterize the cIL-10·sIL-10R1 interactions, cIL-10 and cIL-10 mutants were amine-coupled to CM-5 chips, and multiple concentrations of sIL-10R1 were injected over the cIL-10 surfaces (Fig. 3A). The Kd values obtained between amine-coupled cIL-10 or cIL-10 mutants and sIL-10R1 were slightly higher than when specific coupling of sIL-10R1T213C-Bt to the chip surface was used (supplemental Table I). Nonetheless, the results of the cIL-10·sIL-10R1 binding studies were consistent with the cIL-10M1·sIL-10R1T213C-Bt SPR analysis. Specifically, cIL-10M1R24A exhibited the greatest decrease in sIL-10R1 affinity (5.4-fold), whereas the other cIL-10 mutants exhibited less than 2-fold changes in affinity for sIL-10R1. IL-10R2 Binding Assay— cIL-10 residues implicated in IL-10R2 binding were further evaluated in a direct IL-10R2 binding assay (Fig. 3B). For this assay, cIL-10 mutants (N21A, M22A, R24A, R32A, and H90A) were amine-coupled at high surface densities (∼1000 RU) onto CM-5 sensor chips. The ability of sIL-10R2 to bind amine-coupled cIL-10 mutant-sIL-10R1 binary complexes was evaluated because of the extremely weak affinity of sIL-10R2 for cIL-10 alone (Kd ∼2 mm (10Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Josephson K. Cook J. Walter M.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 1099-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). Because of the large quantity of protein required to characterize IL-10R2 binding, only selected mutants were evaluated at a single sIL-10R2 concentration of 700 μm. In this way, a relative sIL-10R2 binding strength could be assigned for each cIL-10 mutant. Consistent with its low biological activity, the cIL-10M22A mutant exhibited the poorest binding to IL-10R2 (35% of cIL-10), whereas cIL-10R24A and cIL-10R32A exhibited intermediate IL-10R2 binding levels (65% of cIL-10). Thus, cIL-10 Arg-24 contributes to IL-10R2 as well as IL-10R1 binding. Alanine mutations of Asn-21 and His-90 marginally impaired IL-10R2 binding (80-85% of cIL-10). Next, we evaluated the ability of the cIL-10 dimer mutants to induce STAT3 in primary human monocytes (Fig. 3C). Once again, these studies confirm the critical importance of cIL-10 residues Met-22, Arg-24, and Arg-32 in mediating cIL-10-induced signaling. Additional concentration-dependent STAT3 activation studies showed mutation of Met-22, followed closely by Arg-32, disrupt IL-10R2 signaling the greatest on monocytes (supplemental Fig. S1). They also show cIL-10 mutants N21A, H90A, and S93A have a minimal impact on the induction of cIL-10 biological activity. cIL-10M1N21A/M22A/D25K/R32K Is a cIL-10 Antagonist—Three additional cIL-10M1 mutants were evaluated to determine whether it is possible to design a cIL-10 antagonist that binds with high affinity to IL-10R1 but cannot form a productive interaction with IL-10R2 to initiate cIL-10-mediated biological activities. To accomplish this, the cIL-10M1N21A/R32E double mutant was constructed to disrupt possible Arg-32 charge-charge interactions with IL-10R2. Consistent with the importance of Arg-32, the EC50 of cIL-10M1N21A/R32E increased by about 9-fold (8.5 ng/ml) over the EC50 values reported for the individual alanine mutants (0.95 and 1.0 ng/ml). In addition to disrupting IL-10R2 affinity by the N21A and R32E mutations, a D25K mutation was introduced into cIL-10M1N21A/R32E to enhance IL-10R1 affinity (Fig. 2A). As predicted, the cIL-10M1N21A/R32E/D25K triple mutant exhibited the highest IL-10R1 affinity of any molecule tested (Kd = 0.11 nm), although the increase was not statistically different from cIL-10M1 at the 0.05 significance level. Although the increase in affinity for IL-10R1 was not statistically significant, its EC50 value in the proliferation assay increased to 38 ng/ml. In addition, cIL-10M1N21A/D25"

It is not clear, however, whether the opposing kinds of reinforcers are processed by specific or common neural mechanisms. To investigate this issue, we studied macaque monkeys that performed a memory-guided saccade task for three different outcomes, namely delivery of liquid reward, avoidance of air puff, and feedback sound only. Animals performed the task best in rewarded trials, intermediately in aversive trials, and worst in sound-only trials. Most task-related activity in lateral prefrontal cortex was differentially influenced by the reinforcers. Aversive avoidance had clear effects on some prefrontal neurons, although the effects of rewards were more common. We also observed neurons modulated by both positive and negative reinforcers, reflecting reinforcement or attentional processes. Our results demonstrate that information about positive and negative reinforcers is processed differentially in prefrontal cortex, which could contribute to the role of this structure in goal-directed behavior.

Obtaining food and avoiding damage are essential abilities for animals to survive in the wild. In experimental settings, such abilities can be tested with well-controlled appetitive and aversive events. Animals will increase the probability of making a specific response if the response is contingently followed by a reward such as juice (positive reinforcement). The probability of making a specific response will also increase if an aversive event such as an air puff can be contingently avoided by the response (negative reinforcement). However, our knowledge of how neurons distinguish the valence of stimuli and how information is used to approach appetitive events and to avoid aversive events is still incomplete.

Brain Res. 1983; 49: 93-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar reported that neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex discriminate visual stimuli associated with appetitive (fruit juice) and aversive (hypertonic saline) stimuli in a visual discrimination go/no-go task with reversal.

A large proportion of cue-responsive neurons showed differential responses to sucrose-associated and quinine-associated cues, the responses being usually greater for the sucrose cues. Some functional imaging studies mapped brain areas dissociating valence and intensity of gustatory stimuli (Small et al., 2003Small D.M. Gregory M.D. Mak Y.E. Gitelman D. Mesulam M.M. Parrish T.

For instance, there was a double dissociation between the amygdala, which responded to intensity irrespective of valence, and the orbitofrontal cortex, which responded to affective valence irrespective of intensity. The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is known to be involved in reward processing (Watanabe, 1996Watanabe M.

Since the LPFC also plays a crucial role in working memory, it is of particular interest to investigate how reward information influences LPFC activity in working memory tasks. Monkey single-unit studies showed that the LPFC processes information regarding reward quality (e.g., raisin and cabbage; Watanabe, 1996Watanabe M.

However, these experiments investigated only reward as behavioral outcome, and it remains unknown to what extent LPFC neurons are influenced by aversive events, which constitute another major class of reinforcers, that determine goal-directed behavior. We aimed to study the extent to which punishers might have an influence on prefrontal function and distinguish reinforcement-related processes by valence. We recorded the activity of single prefrontal neurons while two monkeys performed a memory-guided saccade task with three trial types involving a liquid reward, the active avoidance of an aversive air puff, and a simple feedback sound (Figures 1A and 1B). Rates of correct performance differed depending on behavioral outcomes in both monkeys (Figure 1C; one-way ANOVA, p < 0.01). Correct performance rate was highest in rewarded trials, intermediate in aversive trials, and lowest in sound-only trials (p < 0.01 for all comparisons, post hoc Scheffé test). The behavioral indices quantifying performance increases in rewarded and aversive over sound-only trials were mostly positive and larger for rewarded than aversive trials (Figure 1D). The result indicates stronger reinforcing effects of liquid reward compared with air puff. Animals committed fixation break errors during the cue period (monkey A, 27.4%; monkey B, 20.3%; percentage of the whole errors of each animal), target period (monkey A, 3.9%; monkey B, 31.1%), and delay period (monkey A, 47.7%; monkey B, 44.3%). They made incorrect saccades at different rates (monkey A, 20.0%; monkey B, 4.4%). Fixation break and saccade errors during cue and saccade periods were most frequent in sound-only trials, intermediate in aversive trials, and least frequent in rewarded trials in both monkeys (p < 0.01, Scheffé test). Peak velocity of saccades in correct trials also differed depending on behavioral outcomes (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA). Post hoc analysis revealed that saccadic velocity was significantly faster in rewarded trials (monkey A, 416.7°/s ± 7.0°/s; monkey B, 538.3 ± 4.4; mean ± SE), compared to the other two trial types (aversive: monkey A, 351.6°/s ± 5.4°/s; monkey B, 473.6°/s ± 4.2°/s; sound only: monkey A, 365.1°/s ± 6.5°/s; monkey B, 500.0°/s ± 4.0°/s) (p < 0.01, Scheffé test). Saccade latency did not vary depending on behavioral outcomes in either monkey and ranged from 204 to 228 ms in means (p > 0.05; one-way ANOVA). We recorded the activity of 214 neurons from three hemispheres of two monkeys (monkey A, 119 neurons; monkey B, 95 neurons). We analyzed neuronal activity separately in cue, target, delay, and saccade periods. Activity was classified with one-way ANOVA (p < 0.01) and post hoc Scheffé tests (p < 0.05) (Table 1; see Experimental Procedures for classification criterion). Hereafter, we use the term “response” to refer to the average activity of one neuron in one time window in a specific trial type.Table 1Number of Neurons that Were Modulated by Behavioral Outcomes in Each Task PeriodDirection of ModulationCueTargetDelaySaccadeTotalReward preferentialincrease4 [0]12 [3]13 [1]15 [4]}52 (24.3%)decrease3 [1]10 [0]12 [3]8 [2]Aversive preferentialincrease1 [1]4 [1]5 [2]4 [0]}12 (5.6%)decrease1 [1]1 [0]1 [0]0 [0]Valence-independentboth increase3 [0]2 [0]2 [0]3 [0]}23 (10.7%)both decrease3 [0]5 [0]5 [0]5 [0]Bivalent1 [0]3 [0]1 [0]0 [0]5 (2.3%)Numbers in brackets indicate the number of neurons whose activity was explained by both behavioral outcomes and saccade metrics (valence + motor coding) by a regression analysis (see main text and Experimental Procedures).

Open table in a new tab Numbers in brackets indicate the number of neurons whose activity was explained by both behavioral outcomes and saccade metrics (valence + motor coding) by a regression analysis (see main text and Experimental Procedures). The rightmost column indicates the number of neurons for which activity is classified to each type in at least one time window. Behavioral outcomes influenced the activity of LPFC neurons in various ways. The majority of neurons changed activity only in rewarded trials. An example is shown in Figure 2A. The activity of this neuron built up after presentation of the cue on the left and was maintained during the delay period. Delay activity was significantly higher in rewarded trials compared to the other two types of trials [reinforcer: F(2,53) = 7.47, p < 0.01; target position: F(1,53) = 31.85, p < 0.001]. In some neurons, the modulation by expected reward consisted of a decrease rather than increase in activity, as shown in Figure 2B. This neuron showed a sustained decrease in activity during the delay in rewarded trials. Activity was similar in aversive and sound-only trials [reinforcer: F(2,40) = 11.2, p < 0.001]. Some neurons changed activity only when the monkey performed saccades to avoid the air puff. A typical example is shown in Figure 3. This neuron showed significant sustained activity during the delay period only in aversive trials to the left, but not in rewarded and sound-only trials (Figure 3A) [reinforcer: F(2,43) = 22.13, p < 0.001; target position: F(1,43) = 2.72, p = 0.10; interaction: F(2,43) = 2.79, p = 0.07]. A similar result was obtained with a second set of visual cues (Figure 3B), suggesting that the differential activity was due to the different outcomes rather than the visual properties of the cue. The examples in Figure 2, Figure 3 suggest that appetitive and aversive outcomes influenced separate groups of neurons. Among the 214 neurons investigated, 52 neurons (24.3%) showed activity preferentially modulated in rewarded trials (p < 0.05, Scheffé test; Table 1). Responses of these neurons either increased (Figure 4A) or decreased (Figure 4B) in rewarded trials as compared with the other two types of trials. Among 52 reward-preferential neurons, 18 (34.6%) showed spatial preference to the target position (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA reinforcer × target position). In analogy to behavioral performance changes, we used neuronal indices to quantify the changes in neuronal activity, both for rewarded and aversive trials compared to sound-only trials. Preferential changes in rewarded trials produced positive or negative appetitive indices (average 0.37 ± 0.16 for increases and −0.46 ± 0.20 for decreases) without deviations from zero in aversive indices (Figure 4C). To distinguish between reward association and visual cue properties, we tested 22 of 52 reward-preferential neurons with alternative cue sets in separate trial blocks. Reward preferential modulation was generally reproduced with alternative cue sets, with similar neuronal indices (average appetitive indices were 0.31 ± 0.30 for increases and −0.36 ± 0.28 for decreases; see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The result indicates that these neurons were selective for reward outcome, not visual properties of the cues. Although we used physically identical reinforcers in every trial, correct performance rate fluctuated across blocks of trials (Figure 1D). This indicates that the behavioral impact of reinforcer was different in each block. We investigated whether reward-preferential activity changed depending on the impact of the reward on correct performance rate but found no significant correlation between them: how much neuronal activity changed, as measured by neuronal indices, did not depend on how much correct performance rate improved, as measured by behavioral indices, in either rewarded or aversive trials (see Figures S1B and S1C and Table S1). We also found that different behavioral outcomes after correct and incorrect behavioral responses did not influence the activity of reward-preferential neurons: pooled activity of reward-preferential neurons (30 for increases and 22 for decreases) did not change significantly between correct and incorrect trials in aversive and sound-only trials during cue, target, and delay periods (p > 0.05, Student's t test; see Figure S2). The result indicates that whether monkeys made correct or incorrect responses could not be predicted by neuronal activity of reward-preferential neurons. We found only a few prefrontal neurons whose activity showed preferential changes in aversive trials (12/214 neurons, 5.6%; Table 1). Their responses either increased (Figure 4D) or decreased (Figure 4E) in aversive trials as compared with the other two trial types. Preferential changes in aversive trials produced positive or negative aversive indices (Figure 4F; average 0.41 ± 0.26 for increases for increases and −0.44 ± 0.14 for decreases). It is possible that preferential activations in aversive trials were less common than in appetitive trials because the effect of the air puff on behavior might have been weaker than the effect of liquid reward (Figures 1C and 1D). However, we found that the preferential modulations in aversive trials were still much less common than preferential modulations in rewarded trials in 94 trial blocks in which the effects of appetitive and aversive outcomes on behavior were not different (p > 0.05, chi-square test; Table S1). This result confirms the relative insensitivity of prefrontal neurons to aversive outcomes as compared to reward. Very few neurons showed opposite changes between appetitive and aversive outcomes (5/214 neurons, 2.3%; bivalent type in Table 1). Neuronal responses increased in appetitive trials and decreased in aversive trials as compared with sound-only trials, or vice versa (see Figure S1D). In some neurons, responses changed in the same direction for appetitive and aversive outcomes. In the neuron shown in Figure 5, the cue response was higher in both rewarded and aversive trials compared to sound-only trials [reinforcer: F(2,57) = 8.07, p < 0.001]. Furthermore, the activity of this neuron appeared to correlate with the monkey's behavior, as correct performance rate and cue response were highest in rewarded trials (mean discharge rate, 55.5 impulses/s; correct rate, 95.5%), intermediate in aversive trials (46.9 impulses/s; 68.4%), and lowest in sound-only trials (33.2 impulses/s; 47.8%). In total, 23 out of 214 task-related neurons (10.7%) changed responses in both rewarded and aversive trials in the same direction at least in one task period (Table 1). The change consisted of either significant increase (Figure 6A) or decrease (Figure 6B) in both rewarded and aversive trials, as compared to sound-only trials. Most of these neurons did not change responses by target position (main effect of target position p > 0.01 in 22/23 neurons; interaction between reinforcer and target position p > 0.01 in 20/23 neurons). The scatter plot in Figure 6C indicates that responses of valence-independent neurons were modulated more strongly in rewarded than aversive trials (appetitive indices larger than aversive indices; p < 0.001, paired Student's t test). We further examined the influence of behavioral performance on valence-independent activity. Block-by-block variations of correct performance rate were quantified for each reinforcer by using behavioral indices. Changes of neuronal activity in each reinforcer condition were quantified by neuronal indices. If behavioral performance was related to valence-independent activity, behavioral and neuronal indices might show correlation. Figure 6D shows the relationship between behavioral and neuronal indices of valence-independent responses (filled symbols, appetitive indices; open symbols, aversive indices; since these responses were modulated independent of outcome valence, both appetitive and aversive indices are collapsed). We found that neuronal indices tended to be larger when behavioral indices were larger (correlation coefficient: 0.30, p = 0.02, Pearson's correlation test). The result indicates that the better monkeys performed rewarded and aversive trials as compared with sound-only trials, the more the activity of valence-independent neurons changed. The influence of behavioral performance on neuronal activity was also confirmed by comparing activity between correct and incorrect trials (Figure S3). When monkeys performed the task correctly, population activity of valence-independent neurons was graded in rewarded, aversive, and sound-only trials in this order (n = 10; Figure S3A) or in the reversed order (n = 13; Figure S3C) during target and delay periods (p < 0.05, Scheffé test). When monkeys performed the task incorrectly, however, valence-independent activity did not change significantly between aversive and sound-only trials in any task period (p > 0.05, Scheffé test). In sum, valence-independent neurons changed activity depending on block-by-block variations of correct performance rate and whether monkeys performed each trial correctly or not. The results suggest that these neurons were sensitive to the impact of reinforcer on behavior independent of its valence. As saccadic velocity varied between the different reinforcers (see above), the question arose whether the observed neuronal differences might simply reflect the saccadic differences. We performed multiple linear regressions and correlated neuronal responses with behavioral outcomes (valence coding), saccade kinematics (motor coding), and valence and saccade kinematics combined (valence + motor coding) (nested F test, p < 0.05). We found that most responses correlated with valence. Only a small number of responses correlated significantly with saccade kinematics and values combined, and only insignificant correlations were seen with saccade kinematics (Table 1). Recording positions were confirmed by in vivo MRI and postmortem histology. The four types of responses, namely reward-preferential, aversive-preferential, valence-independent, and bivalent types, were observed widely in the LPFC, both ventral and dorsal to the principal sulcus, and no clear topographical segregation was observed within the LPFC (see Figure S4). This study shows that a sizeable fraction of prefrontal neurons distinguish between rewarding and aversive outcomes during the performance of a typical prefrontal spatial delayed response task. Most valence-discriminating neurons were sensitive to rewards, whereas only a small fraction of neurons were preferentially modulated in aversive avoidance trials. A subpopulation of prefrontal neurons showed similar influences of appetitive and aversive outcomes that correlated with changes in behavioral performance, indicating a close relationship to behavior rather than outcome valence per se. Taken together, the data suggest that dorsolateral prefrontal neurons are more sensitive to rewarding than aversive outcomes, and that only parts of this differential sensitivity are due to the direct effects of the reinforcers on behavior. Performance rates of both monkeys differed in the three reinforcer conditions, which suggested that they discriminated the visual instruction cues (Figure 1C). Furthermore, significantly better performance in rewarded compared to sound-only trials indicates a positive motivational effect of liquid reward. Monkeys also performed aversive trials significantly better than sound-only trials. This is important because behavioral outcomes in aversive trials and sound-only trials were physically identical when the trials were performed correctly, namely a high-pitched sound. The result indicates that the cues in aversive trials had a stronger motivational effect than the cues in sound-only trials. The most common observation was a change in neuronal responses in rewarded trials, whereas much fewer neurons changed responses preferentially in aversive trials (Table 1). It is not likely that these changes were induced by the physical properties of the instruction cue, as similar changes occurred when the outcome was indicated by the alternative cue set (Figure 3 and Figure S1A). Neither could the changes be explained by kinematic aspects of the saccades; although the peak velocity of the saccade changed systematically depending on the outcome, the saccade kinematic, which varied in every trial, rarely accounted for trial-by-trial variations in neuronal responses (Table 1). Therefore, this type of neuronal responses appears to reflect the valence of behavioral outcomes, rather than the visual instruction cue or the planned action. The fraction of reward-preferential responses in our study (24.3% of task-related activity) is consistent with previous studies on the same area (Kobayashi et al., 2002Kobayashi S. Lauwereyns J.

Neurons in anterior cingulate cortex are differentially activated in lever pressing for reward or shock avoidance (Nishijo et al., 1997Nishijo H. Yamamoto Y. Ono T. Uwano T. Yamashita J. Yamashita T.

Studies in rodents suggested an involvement of the amygdala in learning associations between stimuli and aversive outcomes: rats with amygdala lesions show impairments in aversive association learning, but no effect of lesions on appetitive association learning (Cahill and McGaugh, 1990Cahill L. McGaugh J.L. Amygdaloid complex lesions differentially affect retention of tasks using appetitive and aversive reinforcement.Behav.

Chiba A.A. Gallagher M. Orbitofrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala encode expected outcomes during learning.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Amygdala neurons in monkeys respond to both positive and negative reinforcing stimuli (Paton et al., 2006Paton J.J. Belova M.A. Morrison S.E. Salzman C.D. The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning.Nature. 2006; 439: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that reward takes stronger precedence over aversive processes in LPFC compared to these other structures. It should be noted, however, that several interpretations are possible for the asymmetric influences of appetitive and aversive outcomes in the LPFC. We might explain the asymmetry by different impacts of appetitive and aversive outcomes on behavior: in general, reward improved behavioral performance more than the aversive outcome. Thus, the less common processing of aversive information in the LPFC might be due to a weaker impact of the air puff on behavior. However, we found the effects of reinforcers on reward-preferential responses to be independent of the effects on correct performance (Figures S1B and S1C; and Table S1). Also, previous studies reported that a substantial fraction of striatal TANs was even modulated by air puffs (103 kPa, 100 ms, Ravel et al., 2003Ravel S. Legallet E. Apicella P.

In this study, we have investigated the proximal events in TNF-α-induced RhoA activation. TNFR1 is localized to both lipid raft and nonraft regions of the plasma membrane in primary human airway smooth muscle cells. TNF-α engagement of TNFR1 recruited the adaptor proteins TRADD, TRAF-2, and RIP into lipid rafts and activated RhoA, NF-κB, and MAPK pathways. Depletion of cholesterol from rafts with methyl-β-cyclodextrin caused a redistribution of TNFR1 to nonraft plasma membrane and prevented ligand-induced RhoA activation. By contrast, TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and MAPKs was unaffected by methyl-β-cyclodextrin indicating that, in airway smooth muscle cells, activation of these pathways occurred independently of lipid rafts. Targeted knockdown of caveolin-1 completely abrogated TNF-α-induced RhoA activation, identifying this raft-resident protein as a positive regulator of the activation process. The signaling adaptors TRADD and RIP were also found to be necessary for ligand-induced RhoA activation. Taken together, our results suggest that in airway smooth muscle cells, spatial compartmentalization of TNFR1 provides a mechanism for generating distinct signaling outcomes in response to ligand engagement and define a mechanistic role for lipid rafts and caveolin-1 in TNF-α-induced activation of RhoA.

The increased contractility following relatively short incubations (1 h) with TNF-α is the result of an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of MLC20 phosphorylation (1Parris J.R.M. Cobban H.J. Littlejohn A.F. MacEwan D.J. Nixon G.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 561-569Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle, activation of the small GTPase RhoA, predominantly via 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, is directly associated with increased Ca2+ sensitization of MLC20 phosphorylation (6Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Although TNF-α acts through two distinct cell surface receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2, which are not G-protein-coupled receptors, we have recently delineated a molecular mechanism by which TNF-α, acting specifically through TNFR1, leads to an increase in MLC20 phosphorylation by activation of RhoA/Rho kinase (7Hunter I. Cobban H.J. Vandenabeele P. MacEwan D.J. Nixon G.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular signaling pathway whereby TNFR1 engagement leads to RhoA activation remains to be elucidated. Upon TNF-α binding, the death domain adaptor protein TRADD is rapidly recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of TNFR1, where it acts as an assembly platform for additional signaling adaptors (8Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the interaction of TRAF-2 and RIP with TRADD occurs at the cell membrane (9Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar), and the resulting complex, through recruitment of the IKK “signalosome” (8Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), transduces signals that activate NF-κB and promote cell survival (9Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). TRADD-mediated recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to TNFR1 can initiate the apoptotic cell death pathway (8Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). This requires receptor internalization (10Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S.

Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). There is now compelling evidence for the cellular compartmentalization of signaling pathways (11Hoeller D. Volarevic S. Dikic I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and recent data indicate that lipid rafts are important sites for the modulation of signaling cascades initiated by members of the TNFR superfamily (12Muppidi J.R. Tschopp J. Siegal R.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are specialized membrane microdomains, rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, which, by sequestering specific sets of proteins, are thought to act as organizing centers for processes such as membrane trafficking and signal transduction (13Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M. Cell. 2001; 106: 404-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 14Pike L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). TNFR1 has been shown recently to be constitutively or inducibly associated with lipid rafts in a number of cell types. In U937 cells, the exclusive localization of TNFR1 in caveolae, a subset of lipid rafts, has been reported to be essential for TNF-α-dependent apoptosis (15Ko Y.-G. Lee J.-S. Kang Y.-S. Ahn J.-H. Seo J.-S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7217-7223PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in an endothelial cell line, caveolae-associated TNFR1 mediated ligand-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, an indicator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (16D'Alessio A. Al-Lamki R.S. Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 1273-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Stimulation of human skin fibroblasts with TNF-α recruited TNFR1 to caveolae, where it was proposed to release neutral sphingomyelinase, leading to enzyme activation in noncaveolar fractions (17Veldman R.J. Maestre N. Aduib O.M. Medin J.A. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent recruitment of TNFR1 to lipid rafts has been reported to be essential for the activation of NF-κB in human fibrosarcoma cells (18Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.-A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and for the activation of p42/44 MAPK but not NF-κB in mouse macrophages (19Doan J.E.S. Windmiller D.A. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7654-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, despite clear evidence for the importance of lipid rafts in TNFR1-dependent signaling, the outcomes of raft-dependent TNFR1 activation vary substantially depending on cell type. Several members of the RhoGTPase family have also been localized to lipid rafts in a variety of cell types (20Michaely P.A. Mineo C. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.A.W. J. Biol.

Rho family proteins exist in two states as follows: an inactive GDP-bound state, found in the cytoplasm complexed with Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI), which inhibits the exchange of GDP for GTP, and an active, membrane-associated GTP-bound state. The opposing effects of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which exchange GDP for GTP and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which increase the intrinsic rate of bound GTP hydrolysis, control the extent of RhoGTPase activation (26Kjoller L.

Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in lipid rafts is consistent with a role for these membrane domains in the modulation of Rho GTPase activity. The ability of both TNFR1 and RhoA to localize to lipid rafts and the activation of diverse signaling pathways by raft-associated TNFR1 led us to hypothesize that these specialized membrane microdomains may play a role in the TNFR1-mediated activation of RhoA, previously observed in airway smooth muscle cells (7Hunter I. Cobban H.J. Vandenabeele P. MacEwan D.J. Nixon G.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that both TNFR1 and RhoA co-localize in lipid rafts in human airway smooth muscle cells. We further show that disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-β-cyclodextrin completely abrogates TNF-α-induced RhoA activation, whereas the activation of NF-κB and the p38 and p42/44 MAPKs is unaffected. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the raft-resident protein caveolin-1 was also found to abolish TNF-α-dependent RhoA activation, implicating caveolin-1 as a positive regulator of the activation process. Reagents—Recombinant human TNF-α, biotin-TNF-α, biotin-soybean trypsin inhibitor, polyclonal goat anti-human TNF-α blocking antibody, and PDGFBB were purchased from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Cholera toxin B subunit (CTxB) conjugated to Alexa 488 was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and TRITC-avidin was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against TNFR1 and the transferrin receptor and polyclonal antibodies against caveolin-1, flotillin-1, IκB, IKKα, IKKβ, RhoA, RhoGDI, and TRADD were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against p38, phospho-p38, p42/44, phospho-p42/44, Akt, and phospho-Akt and phospho-IKKα/β were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), HRP-conjugated cholera toxin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and all other chemicals were from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture—Human bronchial smooth muscle cells, purchased from Clonetics (Wokingham, UK), were maintained in modified molecular cellular developmental biology 131 medium (Clonetics) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 μg/liter epidermal growth factor, 5 mg/liter insulin, 2 μg/liter fibroblast growth factor, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, and 50 mg/liter amphotericin. Routinely, cells were used between passages 4 and 8. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Confocal Microscopy—Cell surface TNFRs were detected using a recently described protocol (10Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J.

Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated with biotin-TNF-α (1 μg/ml), together with CTxB-Alexa 488 (10 μg/ml), for 1 h at 4 °C. TRITC-avidin was added, and after incubation at 4 °C for a further 30 min, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min and analyzed using a 1024 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). The absence of staining when cells were incubated with biotin-TNF-α pretreated with blocking antibody (1.3 mg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature or with soybean trypsin inhibitor, biotinylated to the same extent as TNF-α, confirmed the specificity of biotin-TNF-α labeling. Preparation of Lipid Rafts—Triton X-100-resistant lipid rafts were prepared by methods published previously (33Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

In brief, human bronchial smooth muscle cells (∼2 × 107) were washed with ice-cold PBS and suspended in 1 ml of MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mm NaVO4, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm PMSF and incubated on ice for 30 min. Extracts were subjected to 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and adjusted to 40% sucrose in MES-buffered saline. Brij 98-resistant rafts were prepared by published methods (35Drevot P. Langlet C.

Cells suspended in MES-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors were sonicated (five times with 5-s bursts; 50% power) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 4 min; Brij 98 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and cells were extracted for a further 5 min at 37 °C. Extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MES-buffered saline, pre-warmed to 37 °C, and then chilled on ice for 1 h. To prepare rafts in the absence of detergent, cells were suspended in 1 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11 (36Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). After homogenization with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and sonication (three times with 20-s bursts; 50% power) on ice, the cell extract was adjusted to 40% sucrose in MES-buffered saline. Cell extracts in 40% sucrose were overlaid with 7.0 ml of 35% sucrose and 3.0 ml of 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline and centrifuged at 175,000 × g (Beckman SW41 rotor) for 21 h at 4 °C. Twelve fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient. For time course experiments, cells treated with TNF-α for 1, 5, and 15 min at 37 °C were lysed with MES-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice, as described above. After homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The high speed supernatant, containing cytosolic and Triton X-100-soluble membrane proteins, was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 extraction buffer, containing 60 mm β-octyl glucoside for 30 min on ice. After a further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C,the supernatant containing Triton X-100-insoluble, octyl glucoside-soluble lipid rafts was collected. Equal volume aliquots of sucrose gradient fractions or Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer, containing 600 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation studies, equal amounts of protein from raft and nonraft fractions were treated with 60 mm β-octyl glucoside for 1 h on ice and incubated with rabbit polyclonal TNFR1 or normal rabbit control antibody, overnight at 4 °C, with constant mixing. Antibody complexes were collected by addition of protein A/G-coupled agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C, and washed three times with MES-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 60 mm β-octyl glucoside. Proteins were eluted from agarose beads with SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min and collected by centrifugation. Protein samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were incubated with primary antibody followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. To detect the raft-associated glycosphingolipid, GM1, blots were incubated with CTxB-HRP. Bound antibody or CTxB was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Cholesterol Depletion—To deplete cellular cholesterol, cells were transferred to serum-free medium for 24 h, prior to treatment with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) for 30-60 min at 37 °C. RhoA Activation Assay—RhoA activity was measured using a pulldown assay, based on the binding of active, GTP-bound RhoA to the Rho binding domain of rhotekin (37Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells, grown to 80% confluence in 10-cm2 dishes, were transferred to serum-free medium for 48 h prior to treatment with TNF-α (200 ng/ml), PDGFBB (50 ng/ml), or S1P (1 μm) for the indicated times. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and extracted with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF. Cell extracts were incubated with 20 μg of rhotekin (Rho) binding domain-coupled agarose beads for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using a RhoA-specific polyclonal antibody. RhoA activity was determined as the amount of rhotekin-bound RhoA (GTP-RhoA) compared with the total amount of RhoA in cell lysates. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Confluent cells were washed twice with PBS and surface-biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in PBS for 30 min on ice. After removal of biotin, cells were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm glycine for 10 min on ice, scraped into RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal TNFR1 or normal rabbit control antibody as described above. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE fractionation, and biotinylated TNFR1 was detected with HRP-streptavidin. Transfection of siRNA—A synthetic siRNA duplex corresponding to the caveolin-1 mRNA sequence 5′-CUAAACACCUCAACGAGAUU-3′ was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). A functional, nontargeting siRNA sequence 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-3′, containing at least four mismatches to any human, mouse, or rat gene (Dharmacon), was used as a negative control. In addition, a second siRNA targeting a different sequence in caveolin-1 was purchased from Qiagen (catalogue number S102654617). To knock down the expression of signaling adaptor proteins, synthetic siRNA duplexes targeting TRADD (sc-36709), TRAF-2 (sc-29509) and RIP (sc-36426) and a control nontargeting siRNA (sc-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Primary human bronchial smooth muscle cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, transferred to serum-free medium, and incubated for a further 48 h prior to treatment. TNFRs Co-localize with Lipid Rafts in Human Airway Smooth Muscle Cells—As several members of the TNFR superfamily have been reported to be present in lipid rafts (12Muppidi J.R. Tschopp J. Siegal R.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether TNFRs were also localized to lipid rafts in human airway smooth muscle cells. Using confocal microscopy, lipid rafts, identified by their expression of the glycosphingolipid GM1, were abundantly expressed on the surface of airway smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1A), where they had a patched distribution. Using a recently described protocol (10Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwander M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schutze S. Immunity. 2004; 21: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), TNFRs were labeled using a biotin conjugate of their cognate ligand, TNF-α, to which they bind with high affinity and detected with TRITC-avidin (Fig. 1B). The considerable co-localization of TNFRs with GM1 (Fig. 1, C and D) is consistent with the expression of these receptors within lipid rafts in airway smooth muscle cells. The same pattern of staining was obtained using an anti-TNFR1 antibody (data not shown), indicating that binding of biotin-TNF-α does not alter the distribution of TNFRs. TNFR1 Is Constitutively Associated with Lipid Rafts—We have demonstrated recently that TNF-α-mediated activation of RhoA in airway smooth muscle cells occurs by a TNFR1-dependent mechanism (7Hunter I. Cobban H.J. Vandenabeele P. MacEwan D.J. Nixon G.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Several reports, indicating that TNFR1 is localized to lipid rafts/caveolae in a number of cell types (15Ko Y.-G. Lee J.-S. Kang Y.-S. Ahn J.-H. Seo J.-S. J.

Classically, lipid rafts were identified by their insolubility in cold Triton X-100 and separated from bulk membrane by fractionation on sucrose gradients (33Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). More recently, a number of other detergent and detergent-free methods have been developed, including the isolation of rafts at physiological temperature (39Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292C"
https://openalex.org/W2116122989,"The proton-pumping H+-ATPase, Pma1p, is an abundant and very long lived polytopic protein of the yeast plasma membrane. Pma1p constitutes a major cargo of the secretory pathway and thus serves as a model to study plasma membrane biogenesis. Pma1p associates with detergent-resistant membrane domains (lipid “rafts”) already in the ER, and a lack of raft association correlates with mistargeting of the protein to the vacuole, where it is degraded. We are analyzing the role of specific lipids in membrane domain formation and have previously shown that surface transport of Pma1p is independent of newly synthesized sterols but that sphingolipids with C26 very long chain fatty acid are crucial for raft association and surface transport of Pma1p (Gaigg, B., Timischl, B., Corbino, L., and Schneiter, R. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 22515-22522). We now describe a more detailed analysis of the function that sphingolipids play in this process. Using a yeast strain in which the essential function of sphingolipids is substituted by glycerophospholipids containing C26 very long chain fatty acids, we find that sphingolipids per se are dispensable for raft association and surface delivery of Pma1p but that the C26 fatty acid is crucial. We thus conclude that the essential function of sphingolipids for membrane domain formation and stable surface delivery of Pma1p is provided by the C26 fatty acid that forms part of the yeast ceramide.

Integral membrane proteins enter the membrane environment in the ER 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PHS, phytosphingosine; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and are then transported along a vesicular pathway to their final subcellular destination (1Behnia R. Munro S. Nature. 2005; 438: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Although much attention has been paid to uncovering the role of protein-encoded signals in determining sorting of the membrane-bound cargo to its final destination, comparatively little is known about how the lipid-protein interface itself affects protein sorting. The integrity of this interface is probably surveilled by components of the protein quality control system to ensure that only functional proteins are delivered to the cell surface when needed. Co-delivery of integral membrane proteins together with their surrounding membrane domain to the cell surface may, in principle, ensure balanced expansion of the plasma membrane itself. The proton-pumping H+-ATPase, Pma1p, is biosynthetically inserted into the ER membrane, where it homo-oligomerizes to form a 1.8-MDa complex that resists detergent extraction (2Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This complex is then packaged into a larger subclass of COPII transport vesicles that contain Lst1p in addition to Sec24p (3Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and is transported to the cell surface by a branch of the secretory pathway that does not intersect with endosomes (4Harsay E. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Gurunathan S. David D. Gerst J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Once at surface, Pma1p becomes stabilized and occupies domains that are distinct from those occupied by the arginine/H+ symporter Can1p (6Malinska K. Malinsky J. Opekarova M. Tanner W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4427-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A relationship between Pma1p biogenesis and lipid synthesis is indicated by the observations that long-chain base or ceramide synthesis is required for oligomerization and raft association of Pma1p in the ER (2Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of Pma1p, however, is not required for ER export or surface delivery but might be important for stabilization of the protein at the cell surface (2Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Raft association of Pma1p, on the other hand, is required for surface delivery and subsequent stabilization of the protein (7Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Gong X. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9104-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We previously observed that newly synthesized Pma1p is mistargeted to the vacuole in an elo3Δ mutant that affects acyl chain elongation and hence the synthesis of the ceramide-bound C26 very long-chain fatty acid (10Eisenkolb M. Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the role of lipids in Pma1p biogenesis revealed that neither sterols nor the head group modifications on the sphingolipids are important for raft association and surface transport of Pma1p (11Gaigg B. Timischl B. Corbino L. Schneiter R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22515-22522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Instead, the results suggested that ceramide levels and/or their substitution with saturated very long-chain fatty acids are crucial for the biogenesis of Pma1p. These results also indicated that the lipid requirement of Pma1p to form membrane microdomains is distinct from the classical sterol and sphingolipid-rich domains that are normally referred to as detergent-resistant membranes/lipid rafts (12Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 13Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 14Simons K. Vaz W.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to discriminate between the role of ceramide and that of the very long-chain fatty acid in Pma1p sorting. Such discrimination is made possible by the use of a mutant that bypasses the essential requirement for sphingolipids by producing unusual inositol-containing glycerophospholipids carrying a C26 fatty acid in the sn-2 position (15Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Pma1p is raft-associated and stably transported to the cell surface if sphingolipids are replaced by C26-containing glycerophospholipids. Reduction of the length of the acyl chain on the suppressor lipids, however, impairs the essential function of these lipids and results in conditional degradation of Pma1p, strongly indicating that lipids with a C26 fatty acid either bound to a glycerophospholipid or to ceramide are crucial for the vital function of sphingolipids and for surface delivery and stability of Pma1p. These observations are discussed in the context of a possible hydrophobic match between the length of a protein transmembrane domain and the thickness of its surrounding lipid membrane as a parameter that may affect Pma1p sorting to or retention at the plasma membrane of yeast. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains bearing single deletions of nonessential genes were obtained from EUROSCARF (available on the World Wide Web at www.rz.uni-frankfurt.de/FB/fb16/mikro/euroscarf/index.html) (16Winzeler E.A.

Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Strains were cultivated at 24, 30, or 37 °C in YPD-rich medium (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone (USBiological, Swampscott, MA), 2% glucose) or in minimal medium. Cells lacking sphingolipids were cultivated in complete synthetic medium or complete complex medium as described (17Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine (PHS) was supplemented in 0.5% Tergitol at a concentration of 25 μm. The presence of the kanMX marker was selected for by growing the cells on medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. Aureobasidin A was obtained from Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan); myriocin and fumonisin B1 were from Alexis Corp.

To generate double mutants with pep4Δ, a pep4::LEU2 disruption cassette (pTS17; Tom Stevens, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR) was cut with BamHI and used for transformation. PEP4 disruption was confirmed by PCR and a plate assay for carboxypeptidase Y activity. The plasmid containing a GFP-tagged version of Pma1p was kindly provided by A. Breton (Institut de Biochimie et Genetique Cellulaires, Bordeaux, France) (18Balguerie A. Bagnat M. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Breton A.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The URA3 marker on this plasmid was switched to LEU2 using the marker swap plasmid pUL9 (19Cross F.R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Isolation of Detergent-insoluble Membrane Domains—Detergent-insoluble membrane domains were isolated after flotation on Optiprep gradients (Axis-Shield, Huntingdon, UK) as previously described (10Eisenkolb M. Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10%), dissolved in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using rabbit antibodies against Pma1p (1:10,000), Gas1p (1:2000; a kind gift from A. Conzelmann, University Fribourg, Switzerland), and Wbp1p (1:1000; a kind gift from C. Jakob and M. Aebi, ETH Zurich, Switzerland). Pulse-Chase Analysis—For pulse-chase analysis, cells were grown to A600 nm ∼1 in minimal medium lacking cysteine and methionine, unless otherwise noted, and the culture was then split and preincubated at either 24 or 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were pulsed with 100 μCi/ml EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (∼1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 min. Chase was initiated by the addition of chase solution (100×; 0.3% cysteine, 0.3% methionine, 300 mm ammonium sulfate). At each time point, cells were removed (1 A600 nm unit), placed on ice, and arrested with 20 mm NaN3/NaF. Cells were centrifuged; resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin A, 10 μg/ml pepstatin; and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. SDS was added to 1%, and the lysate was incubated at 45 °C for 10 min. The lysate was diluted by the addition of 800 μl of TNET (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-Pma1p antibody and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, visualized with a PhosphorImager, and quantified using Quantify One software (Bio-Rad). Detergent resistance of newly synthesized Pma1p was examined as previously described (9Gong X. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lysates of labeled cells (3-4 A600 nm equivalents) were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were resuspended in 1% SDS. Detergent concentrations in aliquots of total, supernatant, and pellet samples were adjusted for immunoprecipitation. Fluorescence Microscopy—in vivo localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Pma1p was performed by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with an AxioCam CCD camera and AxioVision 3.1 software. Lucifer yellow uptake was examined as described (21Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Lipid Analysis—For sphingolipid analysis, 10 A600 nm units of cells (1 × 108 cells) grown in SC-inositol were harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of fresh SC-inositol, and labeled by the addition of 40 μCi of [3H]inositol (1 mCi/ml; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO). Cells were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C, diluted with prewarmed fresh medium, and incubated for another 80 min. Labeling was terminated by adding NaF and NaN3 to a final concentration of 20 mm. Cells were harvested and broken with glass beads, and lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1; v/v). Phospholipids were deacylated by treatment with mild base, and sphingolipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates (Merck) using chloroform, methanol, 0.25% KCl (55:45:5; v/v/v) as the solvent system. Radioactivity was detected and quantified by two-dimensional radioscanning on a Berthold Tracemaster 40, and plates were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). For lipid analysis by mass spectrometry, 40,000 × g microsomal membranes were extracted three times with ethanol/water/diethylether/pyridine/NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.018; v/v/v/v/v) at 60 °C, for 15 min each. Lipids were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (1:1; v/v) and analyzed in the negative ion mode on a Bruker Esquire HCT ion trap mass spectrometer (ESI) with a flow rate of 120 μl/h and a capillary tension of -250 V. Ion fragmentation was induced with argon as collision gas at a pressure of 8 millibars. Characterization of the SLC1-1 Suppressor Strain—Sphingolipids or intermediates of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway are essential lipids in yeast, as indicated by the fact that long-chain base synthesis mediated by serine palmitoyltransferase (LCB1,2) is vital (22Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1583: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, the essential requirement for long-chain base synthesis is bypassed in a suppressor strain that produces novel C26 fatty acid-containing inositol glycerophospholipids that structurally mimic sphingolipids (Fig. 1) (15Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The semidominant SLC1-1 mutation results in a Q44L substitution in Slc1p, an 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (24Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The semidominant mutation is thus thought to confer altered substrate specificity to Slc1-1p, enabling the transfer of C26 to the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids (24Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the relative fitness of the SLC1-1 suppressor strain, we first analyzed its growth and viability in the presence or absence of exogenous phytosphingosine (PHS) as a longchain base that restores sphingolipid synthesis in this strain (Fig. 2, A and B). This analysis revealed that the SLC1-1 strain grew more slowly than a corresponding wild-type strain but that the strain remained fully viable even in the absence of PHS. PHS itself did not appear to significantly improve growth of the suppressor strain but inhibited growth of both SLC1-1 and wild-type cells. Labeling of cells with [3H]inositol confirmed the absence of sphingolipids, since there were no detectable mild base-resistant lipids present in SLC1-1 when grown without PHS. The addition of PHS, however, restored sphingolipid synthesis in the suppressor strain (Fig. 2C). The presence of C26-containing inositol gylcerophospholipids in SLC1-1 was furthermore confirmed by mass spectrometry, which revealed two major C26-containing inositol glycerophospholipid species in SLC1-1 that were not detectable in wild-type cells (Fig. 2D). Presence of the C26 fatty acid in these two lipid species was confirmed by collision induced fragmentation, which yielded an ion of m/z 395, characteristic for C26 (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results indicate that the SLC1-1 strain is viable in the absence of sphingolipids and that the strain synthesizes C26-containing inositol glycerophospholipids, consistent with the original characterization of the lipids made by the suppressor strain (15Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association of Pma1p and Gas1p with Detergent-resistant Membranes in the Absence of Sphingolipids—We next examined whether the association of plasma membrane proteins with detergent-resistant membranes was affected by the absence of sphingolipids in SLC1-1. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Gas1p and the polytopic proton-pumping ATPase Pma1p are two yeast plasma membrane proteins that associate with detergent-resistant membranes (20Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Steadystate association of these two proteins with detergent-resistant membranes depends on sphingolipids and sterols (20Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). To examine raft association of Gas1p and Pma1p in cells lacking sphingolipids, membranes were prepared from wild-type and SLC1-1 cells that were grown in the presence or absence of PHS. These membranes were then extracted with detergent and floated in an Optiprep density gradient to separate detergent-resistant membranes in the top fractions of the gradient from the solubilized material. This analysis revealed that Pma1p and Gas1p were both enriched in the detergent-resistant membrane fraction even in cells lacking sphingolipids but making suppressor lipids (Fig. 3A). The ER membrane protein and component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, Wbp1p, on the other hand, was solubilized upon detergent treatment and stayed in the bottom fractions of the gradient. Depletion of sphingolipids by using a temperature-sensitive mutant in long-chain base synthesis, lcb1-100 (end8-1), impaired the association of Pma1p and Gas1p with detergent-resistant membranes at the nonpermissive temperature, as has been observed before (20Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 25Sutterlin C. Horvath A. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. Wang Y. Dreyfuss M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6374-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). These results thus indicate that the function of sphingolipids in the formation of detergent-resistant membrane domains at the plasma membrane can be substituted by C26-containing inositol gylcerophospholipids made in the SLC1-1 suppressor strain. This substitution, however, appears to be slightly compromised, as indicated by the fact that the flotation behavior of both Pma1p and Gas1p when isolated from the SLC1-1 suppressor strain differs slightly from that of wild-type cells. When isolated from the suppressor strain, Pma1p and Gas1p displayed a trailing population of protein that did not exclusively fractionate in the top fraction, as was the case in wild type. Similarly, the addition of PHS to wild-type cells induced the appearance of a population of Gas1p that was detergent-soluble. PHS addition has previously been shown to induce ubiquitin-dependent internalization and down-regulation of the uracil permease Fur4p (26Chung N. Jenkins G. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it is conceivable that PHS also induces down-regulation of Gas1p and that this down-regulation is accompanied by the exclusion of Gas1p from detergentresistant membranes. Suppressor Lipids Functionally Substitute Sphingolipids in Surface Transport of Newly Synthesized Pma1p—Sphingolipid synthesis is required for the association of newly synthesized Pma1p with detergent-resistant membranes already in the ER and for proper routing of Pma1p to the cell surface (2Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the absence of sphingolipids, newly synthesized Pma1p is rapidly degraded in the vacuole. Given that C26-containing suppressor lipids can substitute for sphingolipids in raft association of steady-state levels of Pma1p at the plasma membrane, we examined whether these lipids also protected newly synthesized Pma1p from missorting to the vacuole. Therefore, the stability of newly synthesized Pma1p in the SLC1-1 suppressor strain grown in the presence or absence of PHS was examined by pulse-chase analysis and immunoprecipitation. These experiments revealed that newly synthesized Pma1p was stable in the SLC1-1 suppressor strain independent of whether suppressor lipids or sphingolipids were synthesized (Fig. 4A). This result would thus indicate that suppressor lipids functionally substitute for sphingolipids also in surface transport of newly synthesized Pma1p. Moreover, the suppressor lipids appeared to provide full functionality as indicated by the fact that Pma1p was stable even when synthesized at 37 °C. The stability of Pma1p at 37 °C allows for discrimination between fully functional sphingolipids with a mature C26 fatty acid and those that are conditionally impaired in function due to the presence of a C22 fatty acid, as is the case in acyl chain elongase mutant cells, elo3Δ (10Eisenkolb M. Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Gaigg B. Timischl B. Corbino L. Schneiter R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Given that suppressor lipids can substitute for sphingolipids in surface transport of Pma1p, one would expect that Pma1p biogenesis in the suppressor strain becomes resistant against degradation induced by drugs that inhibit sphingolipid biosynthesis. To test this prediction, we compared the stability of newly synthesized Pma1p in the SLC1-1 strain with that of wild-type cells upon treatment with three different inhibitors of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Myriocin (20 μg/ml) was used to block long-chain base synthesis by serine palmitoyltransferase, fumonisin B1 (72 μg/ml) to block ceramide synthase, and aureobasidin A (2 μg/ml) to inhibit the conversion of ceramide to inositolphosphorylceramide (28Horvath A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that Pma1p was rapidly turned over in drug-treated wild-type cells but that Pma1p was stable in the SLC1-1 suppressor strain (Fig. 4B). This observation is thus consistent with the notion that the C26-containing suppressor lipids functionally substitute for sphingolipids in surface transport of newly synthesized Pma1p. In addition, these data indicate that surface transport of Pma1p is one of the essential pathways that is blocked by these three inhibitors of the sphingolipid pathway in wild-type cells. To confirm that Pma1p reaches the cell surface in the absence of sphingolipids rather than stably accumulating within an intracellular compartment, we examined the steadystate distribution of a GFP-tagged version of Pma1p by fluorescent microscopy. In cells lacking sphingolipids, Pma1p-GFP displayed a characteristic ringlike staining at the cell periphery, consistent with surface transport of Pma1p in the absence of sphingolipids. No fluorescence was observed to accumulate in the vacuole, even in SLC1-1 cells that were shifted to 37 °C, indicating that Pma1p is stable at the cell surface in the absence of sphingolipids (Fig. 5). Drug-induced inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis resulted in vacuolar localization of Pma1p-GFP in wild-type cells but not in the SLC1-1 suppressor strain (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results indicate that the C26-containing suppressor lipids that are synthesized in the semidominant 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase mutant SCL1-1 strain fully substitute for sphingolipids in surface transport and stabilization of Pma1p. Long-chain Base Synthesis Is Dispensable for Endocytosis in the Suppressor Strain—Long-chain base synthesis is required for the internalization step of endocytosis and for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (31Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the accelerated turnover of Pma1p in an elo3Δ mutant at 37 °C can be rescued by preventing endocytosis, indicating that turnover of Pma1p in elo3Δ occurs after the protein has reached the cell surface (10Eisenkolb M. Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To examine whether the apparent stability of newly synthesized Pma1p in the suppressor strain was due to a block in endocytosis in this strain, we examined whether the suppr"

This channel contains three types of subunits, the principal CNGA2 subunit and two modulatory subunits (CNGA4 and CNGB1b). Here, we have analyzed the functional relevance of CNGB1 for olfaction by gene targeting in mice. Electro-olfactogram responses of CNGB1-deficient (CNGB1-/-) mice displayed a reduced maximal amplitude and decelerated onset and recovery kinetics compared with wild-type mice. In a behavioral test, CNGB1-/- mice exhibited a profoundly decreased olfactory performance. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that ORNs of CNGB1-/- mice weakly expressed a CNG current with decreased cAMP sensitivity, very rapid flicker-gating behavior and no fast modulation by Ca2+-calmodulin. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of a CNGA2/CNGA4 channel in the olfactory epithelium of CNGB1-/- mice. This CNGA2/CNGA4 channel was targeted to the plasma membrane of olfactory knobs, but failed to be trafficked into olfactory cilia. Interestingly, we observed a similar trafficking defect in mice deficient for the CNGA4 subunit. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that CNGB1 has a dual function in vivo. First, it endows the olfactory CNG channel with a variety of biophysical properties tailored to the specific requirements of olfactory transduction.

The channels play a key role in visual and olfactory transductions. The CNG channel involved in olfaction is expressed at high density in the sensory cilia of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) where it is activated by an odorant-induced rise of cAMP. When open, the channel conducts mainly Ca2+ and Na+ (1Nakamura T. Tsuru K. Miyamoto S. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 171: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2Frings S. Seifert R. Godde M. Kaupp U.B. Neuron. 1995; 15: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The subsequent rise in internal Ca2+, in turn, opens a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel, which confers an inward current and acts as an efficient amplifier of the primary CNG current (3Kurahashi T. Yau K.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 4Kleene S.J. Gesteland R.C. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3624-3629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lowe G. Gold G.H. Nature. 1993; 366: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The combined CNG and Cl- currents depolarize the ORN, initiating action potentials. Ca2+ entering the cell through CNG channels also serves as negative feedback modulator of signal transduction (6Matthews H.R. Reisert J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ca2+ reduces the cAMP sensitivity of the olfactory CNG channel through interaction with calmodulin (CaM) bound to the channel (7Kurahashi T. Menini A. Nature. 1997; 385: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 8Bradley J. Bönigk W. Yau K.W. Frings S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The olfactory CNG channel is a heterotetramer composed of three homologous subunits, CNGA2, CNGA4, and CNGB1b that are assembled in a 2:1:1 stoichiometry (9Zheng J. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 2004; 42: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Whereas the CNGA2 subunit can form functional homomeric channels when expressed heterologously, the CNGA4 and CNGB1b subunits only produce functional channels as heteromers with CNGA2. However, when expressed together with CNGA2, CNGA4 and CNGB1b confer a number of channel properties such as single channel flickering, increase in cAMP sensitivity and rapid Ca2+-CaM modulation (10Finn J.T.

CNGB1a, a splice variant expressed in the retina, assembles with CNGA1 to form the functional CNG channel of rod photoreceptors (19Weitz D. Ficek N. Kremmer E. Bauer P.J. Kaupp U.B.

Nature. 2002; 420: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that mice deficient in the CNGB1 gene (CNGB1-/-) suffer from a primary loss of rod photoreceptor function and develop a progressive retinal degeneration resembling human retinitis pigmentosa. This severe phenotype results from the fact that rod photoreceptors fail to produce substantial levels of homomeric CNGA1 channels and/or are incapable of targeting such channels to the outer segment plasma membrane in the absence of CNGB1 (22Hüttl S. Michalakis S. Seeliger M. Luo D.-G. Acar N. Geiger H. Hudl K. Mader R. Haverkamp S. Moser M. Pfeifer A. Gerstner A. Yau K.-W. Biel M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to investigate the physiological role of CNGB1 in olfaction. We find that in the absence of CNGB1, ORNs express a heteromeric CNGA2/CNGA4 channel with biophysical properties that are significantly different from those of wild-type channels. Moreover, this channel is sensitive to proteasome-mediated degradation and is not substantially targeted to the cilia. As a consequence, CNGB1-deficient mice reveal a severely impaired olfactory performance. We also find that CNG channels deficient for the second “modulatory” subunit, CNGA4, fail to be targeted to the ciliary membrane. Thus, olfactory neurons possess a quality control system that ensures that only correctly assembled CNG channels are used for sensory transduction. Animals—The generation of CNGB1-/- mice has been described (22Hüttl S. Michalakis S. Seeliger M. Luo D.-G. Acar N. Geiger H. Hudl K. Mader R. Haverkamp S. Moser M. Pfeifer A. Gerstner A. Yau K.-W. Biel M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For all experiments, age-matched CNGB1+/+, CNGB1-/-, and CNGB1-/- mice on a hybrid 129Sv and C57BL/6N background were used. CNGA3-/-/CNGB1-/- double knock-out mice were generated by cross-breeding of CNGB1-/- with CNGA3-/- mice (23Biel M. Seeliger M. Pfeifer A. Kohler K. Gerstner A. Ludwig A. Jaissle G. Fauser S. Zrenner E. Hofmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7553-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The animals were treated in accordance to both German legislation and the United States National Institutes of Health guidelines on the protection of animals. Generation of Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies directed against a sequence in the C terminus of the murine CNGA2 or the murine CNGA4 protein (C-AbmCNGA2: KQNHEDDY-LSDGINTPE; C-AbmCNGA4: REWPMPDDMGEADDEAE) were generated by standard techniques in rabbit and guinea pig, respectively (Gramsch Laboratories). C-AbmCNGA2 and C-AbmCNGA4 specifically detected the respective CNG channel subunit and showed no cross-reactivity to the other CNG channel subunits. Histology—Adult mice were deeply anesthetized with ether and subsequently perfusion fixed (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffered saline (PBS)). Olfactory turbinates were dissected, immersion-fixed for additional 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, subsequently embedded in tissue-freezing medium (OCT, Sakura Finetek, Japan) and sectioned by cryostat. 12-μm thick coronal sections were thaw-mounted on glass slides (Superfrost Plus, Roth, Germany), air-dried and stored at -30 °C until used. Semithin sections of Epon-embedded olfactory turbinates (Epon 812, Fluka, Switzerland) were stained with toluidine blue (Fluka) and examined using light microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop 2 with HMRc-camera). We quantified the epithelial thickness using digital images taken (at ×400 magnification) from coronal sections through the olfactory epithelia of litter-matched wild-type and knock-out mice (n = 3-4 for each genotype). Measurements were performed on both sides of the nasal cavity at two positions (A left/A right and P left/P right). Position A was just adjacent to the posterior end of the vomeronasal organ, P was localized 400 μm posterior to A. The thickness of the epithelium was measured from the epithelial surface to the basal lamina using the Axiovision software measurement tool (Zeiss). For each position three consecutive slices were analyzed and averaged. Immunohistochemistry—The sections were hydrated in PBS, post-fixed for 15 min (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS), and blocked for 3-4 h at room temperature (10% normal goat (NGS) or normal chicken serum (NCS), 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS), followed by incubation overnight (16 h) at room temperature with primary antibodies in 5% NGS (or NCS), 0.25% Triton-X in PBS. After washing in 2% NGS (or NCS) in PBS sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies in washing solution, then washed and mounted with aqueous mounting medium (Permaflour, Beckman-Coulter). Primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-adenylyl cyclase III (sc-588, 1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), rabbit anti-CNGA3 (1:1000; (23Biel M. Seeliger M. Pfeifer A. Kohler K. Gerstner A.

For detection of CNGA2 we used C-AbmCNGA2 (1:300). The same results were obtained with goat anti-CNGA2 (sc-13700, 1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) (not shown). Secondary detection: donkey FITC or Cy2 anti-rabbit IgG or anti-chicken, donkey TexasRed anti-guinea pig IgG and donkey biotin anti-goat IgG (all Jackson Immunoresearch Europe, UK), DY-547 streptavidin (Dyomics, Germany). Direct fluorescence microscopy was carried out using primary antibodies labeled with DY-547-NHS ester or DY-631-NHS ester (Dyomics). Sections were analyzed with a LSM 510 Meta confocal laser microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were transfected with CNG channel cDNAs (8Bradley J. Bönigk W. Yau K.W. Frings S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Sautter A. Zong X. Hofmann F. Biel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or a cDNA of rat CNGB1b that lacks all exons downstream of exon 25, and membrane proteins were isolated as previously described (25Much B.

Membranes from murine olfactory epithelia were prepared using the mechanical agitation method described by Washburn et al. (26Washburn K.B. Turner T.J. Talamo B.R. Chem. Senses. 2002; 27: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were separated using 7-10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis according to standard procedures. The antibodies were used in the following dilutions: anti-adenylyl cylase III (sc-588, 1:400), C-AbmC-NGA2 (1:1000), C-AbmCNGA4 (1:500), FPc21K (1:2500; gift from Dr. U. B. Kaupp, FZJ-IBI-1 Jülich, Germany), anti-tubulin (1:400; Dianova, Germany). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (27Zong X. Eckert C. Yuan H. Wahl-Schott C. Abicht H. Fang L.

For immunoprecipitation 210 μg of olfactory membranes were incubated with 10 μg of C-AbmCNGA2 or 10 μg of anti-PAK (control antibody; sc-882, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The immunoblot was probed with C-AbmCNGA4 (1:500). Electrophysiology—Tissue was dissociated as described in Reisert et al. (28Reisert J. Bauer P.J. Yau K.W. Frings S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, following euthanasia of the animal by methods approved by Johns Hopkins University, olfactory turbinates were removed from the nasal cavity, transferred to extracellular solution and stored at 4 °C until use. To aid dissociation, the olfactory epithelium was peeled off its supporting cartilage, incubated in extracellular solution containing 0.2 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C and thereafter transferred to a solution containing 0.4 mg/ml DNase I (Roche Applied Science), 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2. After gentle trituration, 700 μl of cell suspension were transferred to a recording chamber mounted on an inverted microscope and allowed to settle for 30 min. Inside-out patches were excised from the dendritic knobs of ORNs. Often cilia were visible and could be sucked into the recording pipette before sealing. Recordings were performed as described previously (29Reisert J. Lai J. Yau K.W. Bradley J. Neuron. 2005; 45: 553-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recording from heterologously expressed CNG channels was performed as described (8Bradley J. Bönigk W. Yau K.W. Frings S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Sautter A. Zong X. Hofmann F. Biel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Pipettes were pulled from standard wall borosilicate glass (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and fire-polished to give an open-pipette resistance of 7 mΩ or 13-15 mΩ for single channel recordings. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch-1D amplifier, a Digidata interface and pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). All data were sampled at 500 Hz and low-pass-filtered at 100 Hz (8-pole Bessel). Only for the single channel recordings was the sampling rate 5 kHz, and currents were filtered at 0-1 kHz. The holding potential was -40 mV, except for the single channel recordings where a holding potential of -60 mV was used. All solutions contained 10 mm HEPES, the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with NMDG. Most experiments were performed in 140 mm symmetrical NaCl solution, with 10 mm HEPES and 10 mm HEDTA. Adding 9.98 mm CaCl2 yielded a free Ca2+ concentration of 67 μm. The inhibition of the CNG channel by Ca-CaM was investigated in a solution where 130 mm NaCl were replaced equimolarly by sodium methanesulfonate to minimize the Ca2+-activated Cl- current. Extracellular solution contained (in mm): NaCl 125, KCl 5, EGTA 10. Solution exchanges were applied by transferring the tip of the patch pipette across the interface of neighboring streams of solution using the Perfusion Fast-Step SF-77B solution changer (Warner Instrument Corp.). EOG Recordings—The recordings were performed as described (30Spehr M. Wetzel C.H. Hatt H. Ache B.W. Neuron. 2002; 33: 731-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In brief, the septal bone and the associated epithelium were placed in a recording chamber. Unipolar recording was achieved by placing an active electrode consisting of a Ringer's/agarose-filled teflon tube on the epithelium and connecting it with a silver/silver chloride wire to a DC amplifier (P18C, Grass Instrument Co.) referenced to an identical electrode grounding the bath. Odorants were delivered in the vapor phase using a custom-made olfactometer. 100 μl of a complex 100-component odorant mixture (Henkel 100; gift from Dr. T. Gerke, Henkel KGaA, Germany) (30Spehr M. Wetzel C.H. Hatt H. Ache B.W. Neuron. 2002; 33: 731-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Wetzel C.H. Oles M. Wellerdieck C. Kuczkowiak M. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7426-7433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were diluted in bidistilled water in a 50-ml syringe, continuously streamed with air. This odorant was injected into a constant stream of humidified air that continuously superfused the epithelium. Signals were recorded on a chart recorder. Strip chart recordings were scanned and digitized using the measurement tool of the Zeiss Axiovision software (Zeiss). Response kinetics were analyzed according to the time between the onset of a response and its peak amplitude (time to peak). Additionally, recovery kinetics was analyzed using a double exponential fit. Calcium Imaging—Calcium imaging was performed as described (30Spehr M. Wetzel C.H. Hatt H. Ache B.W. Neuron. 2002; 33: 731-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, intracellular Ca2+ was monitored using fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) dissolved in a stock solution (1 mm) consisting of Me2SO and 20% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes). Freshly dissociated ORNs were dye-loaded for 45 min (room temperature), washed with extracellular solution, and monitored on a Zeiss inverted microscope (×40 objective) equipped for ratiometric imaging (TillPhotonics, Germany). Fluorescence intensities after sequential illumination (340 nm and 380 nm; 75-ms pulses; 2-Hz cycle time) were captured by a cooled CCD camera (TillPhotonics). Knobs of individual ORNs were marked as regions of interest (ROI; Tillvision software) and the average pixel intensity within each ROI was digitized and stored on a PC. Only cells morphologically identified as ORNs (dendrite with knob and cilia) were included into analysis. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence signal was expressed as the f340/f380 ratio and viewed as a function of time. ORNs were focally stimulated by forskolin/odorants (5-s pulses; interstimulus intervals of 80-150 s) using a custom-build six capillary tube application system (integrated suction; switching time essentially instantaneous; flow rates of 5 μl/s). Stimulus concentration refers to the concentration in each tube. Control experiments showed minimized background accumulation of stimuli and no “on/off” artifacts. Response kinetics were analyzed according to the time between the onset (f340/f380 ≥ 15% of base level) of a response and its peak amplitude. Recovery kinetics were analyzed using a single exponential fit and calculating its time constant (τ). Statistical analysis used two sample equal variance t tests. Olfactory Performance Test—Single housed mice were food-deprived for 18 h. After a food pellet (V1534, 25 × 10 mm, Ssniff, Germany) was buried in the home cage (3 cm under the bedding), the mouse was allowed to search for the pellet. The time needed to localize the food pellet was measured. The test was terminated after the successful localization of the pellet or after 10 min of unsuccessful searching. Open Field Test—Locomotor activity was measured in an infrared beam operated open field (25 × 25 × 25 cm, ActiMot-System, TSE, Bad Homburg, Germany). Each mouse was placed in the middle of the open field and monitored for 10 min. Total distance traveled (m), number of rearings, and speed (cm/s) were determined. Odor Exposure for Fos Experiments—Mice were placed in a sealed housing cage (IVC, Techniplast, Germany). The cage was ventilated with fresh air continuously flowing at 3 liters/min for 30 min. Thereafter, mice were exposed to Henkel 100 equilibrated air (delivered at 3 liters/min to the cage). Odorant exposure occurred intermittently to minimize adaptation effects. Odors were presented seven times for 2 min with 3 min intervening fresh air intervals. Control mice received the same treatment, but with fresh air only. Two hours after exposure mice were anesthetized and perfusion-fixed as described above. 12-μm olfactory bulb sections were processed for Fos immunohistochemistry using a rabbit anti-Fos antibody (1:10000; Calbiochem). Immunoreactivity was visualized using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector) and Ni-DAB Substrate Kit (Vector). Proteasome Inhibition—4-week-old CNGB1-/- mice were intraperitonealy injected (10 μg/g of body-weight) with the specific and cell permeable proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG-132; Calbiochem, Germany). After in incubation time of 20 h, the mice were anesthetized, perfusion-fixed, and the olfactory turbinates were isolated as described above. Another group of mice received two consecutive doses of MG-132 (10 μg/g of body weight; 24 h between the two applications), and again, after 20 h of incubation time the olfactory turbinates were removed as described above. Statistics—All data are presented as means ± S.E. If not specified otherwise, data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test. Statistical significance was accepted if p < 0.05. Reduced Olfactory Performance in CNGB1-/- Mice— CNGB1-/- mice of both genders showed a delayed postnatal body weight increase compared with their CNGB1+/- and CNGB1-/+ littermates (Fig. 1A). Even in the fourth postnatal week, a time point at which mice can be considered adult, the body weight of CNGB1-/- mice was about 30% lower than that of littermate control mice (p < 0.0001; CNGB1-/-: 11.3 ± 0.5 g, (n = 34); CNGB1+/-: 15.3 ± 0.3 g, (n = 68); CNGB1+/+: 16.4 ± 0.5 g, (n = 21)). To test whether CNGB1-/- mice are impaired in olfaction we conducted an olfactory performance test. We found that CNGB1-/- mice were able to locate a hidden food pellet but needed about three times as long for this task as wild-type littermates (CNGB1-/-: CNGB1-/+: 438.4 ± 36.3 s, (n = 28); CNGB1+/+ 148.4 ± 23.4 s, (n = 17); p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1B). Double knock-out mice deficient in CNGB1 and also CNGA3, a subunit expressed in a small subset of ORNs that appear to employ a cGMP-based transduction cascade (32Meyer M.R. Angele A. Kremmer E. Kaupp U.B. Muller F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10595-10600Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), showed the same performance as CNGB1-/- mice (n.s.; 423.9 ± 78.8 s, (n = 9)) (Fig. 1B). This finding suggests that the ability of CNGB1-/- mice to smell was not conferred by CNGA3-expressing ORNs. More probably, it reflected the reduced activity of the primary, cAMP-mediated olfactory system. To exclude that the knock-out mice had an impaired exploratory activity we performed an open field test. Overall, CNGB1-/- mice had normal activity as measured by the total distance traveled (CNGB1-/-: 6.6 m ± 0.5 m (n = 9); CNGB1+/+: 5.5 m ± 0.4 m (n = 8); p = 0.09), the speed (CNGB1-/-: 11.0 cm/s ± 0.8 cm/s (n = 9); CNGB1+/+: 9.1 cm/s ± 0.7 cm/s (n = 8); p = 0.09) and the number of rearings (CNGB1-/-: 268.6 ± 40.8 (n = 9); CNGB1+/+: 245.8 ± 33.1 (n = 8); p = 0.68). We next asked whether the morphology of the olfactory system was altered in the knock-out mice. The principal structure of the olfactory epithelium was unaffected by the deletion of CNGB1 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the expression pattern of OMP, a marker protein for mature ORNs (33Keller A. Margolis F.L. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), was comparable in the olfactory epithelium of CNGB1-/- and wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). However, the olfactory epithelium of knock-out mice was consistently thinner (15 to 20%) than that of wild-type mice (thickness in 4-week-old mice: anterior position: CNGB1-/-: 70.7 ± 0.3 μm(n = 3); CNGB1+/+: 83.7 ± 1.3 μm; (n = 3), p < 0.0001; posterior position: CNGB1-/-: 72.1 ± 2.6 μm (n = 3); CNGB1+/+: 89.9 ± 2.5 μm; (n = 3); p < 0.001). Compared with litter-matched wild types there was also an obvious decrease in the size of the olfactory bulb in CNGB1- mice (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the gross morphology of the olfactory bulb was not compromised, since all CNGB1-deficient mice analyzed showed the six well-known olfactory bulb layers (not shown). Moreover, tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the periglomerular cells was comparable in knock-out and control mice, indicating that olfactory bulbs of CNGB1-/- mice received afferent inputs from ORNs (Fig. 3B). To investigate the functionality of the olfactory system, we determined odorevoked Fos activity in periglomerular neurons of the olfactory bulb. Fos is an immediate early gene product that is up-regulated in odor-activated periglomerular neurons in response to odorants (34Guthrie K.M. Anderson A.J. Leon M. Gall C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3329-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As expected, Fos protein expression detected by an anti-Fos antibody was enhanced in a number of olfactory glomeruli after exposure to a complex 100-component odorant mixture (Henkel 100, Ref. 31Wetzel C.H. Oles M. Wellerdieck C. Kuczkowiak M. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7426-7433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). Up-regulation of Fos was also observed in CNGB1-/- mice, however the number of Fos-stained glomeruli per slice (Fos+) was smaller than in control mice (CNGB1-/-: 22.7 ± 2.7 (n = 3); CNGB1+/+: 31.3 ± 1.3 (n = 3), p < 0.05; Fig. 3D). This difference was probably attributable to the fact that the total number of glomeruli was also significantly reduced in CNGB1-deficient mice (CNGB1-/-: 89.7 ± 1.6 (n = 3); CNGB1+/+: 104.0 ± 4.0 (n = 3) glomeruli per slice; p < 0.05). Thus, the relative fraction of Fos+ glomeruli (%Fos+) was not statistically different between both genotypes (p = 0.25; CNGB1-/-: 25.2% ± 2.9% (n = 3); CNGB1+/+: 30.3% ± 2.4% (n = 3) (Fig. 3D). Odor Responses of ORNs in CNGB1-deficient Mice—To directly assess ORN function, we recorded odorant-evoked electro-olfactograms (EOGs). Fig. 4A shows representative EOG responses evoked by a 1-s pulse of Henkel 100 (1:1000, see “Experimental Procedures”) in adult litter-matched CNGB1-/- and CNGB1+/+ mice. Both genotypes responded to the odorant mixture; however, the amplitude of the response was significantly smaller in the knock-out than in the control mice (CNGB1-/-: 1.99 ± 0.56 mV; (n = 15); CNGB1+/-: 5.31 ± 0.76 mV; (n = 10); p < 0.005) (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, the onset and offset of the response was profoundly slower in CNGB1-/- than in wild-type mice (Fig. 4A and Table 1). Ca2+-imaging experiments on isolated ORNs confirmed this finding. After stimulation with forskolin, an activator of the adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 4C), or with Henkel 100 (not shown), ORNs of CNGB1"
https://openalex.org/W2061766973,"The serine anti-protease elafin is expressed by monocytes, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and at mucosal surfaces and possesses antimicrobial activity. It is also known to reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced neutrophil influx into murine alveoli as well as to abrogate lipopolysaccharide-induced production of matrix metalloprotease 9, macrophage inhibitory protein 2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by as-yet unidentified mechanisms. In this report we have shown that elafin inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in monocytes by inhibiting AP-1 and NF-kappaB activation. Elafin prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation of AP-1, c-Jun, and JNK but had no effect on phosphorylation of p38. The lipopolysaccharide-induced degradation of IL-1R-associated kinase 1, IkappaBalpha, and IkappaBbeta was inhibited by elafin but phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha was unaffected. Polyubiquitinated protein including polyubiquitinated IkappaBalpha was shown to accumulate in the presence of elafin. These results suggest that inhibition by elafin of lipopolysaccharide-induced AP-1 and NF-kappaB activation occurs via an effect on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2071078242,"NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) from bovine heart mitochondria is a highly complicated, membrane-bound enzyme. It is central to energy transduction, an important source of cellular reactive oxygen species, and its dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative and muscular diseases and in aging. Here, we describe the effects of Zn2+ on complex I to define whether complex I may contribute to mediating the pathological effects of zinc in states such as ischemia and to determine how Zn2+ can be used to probe the mechanism of complex I. Zn2+ inhibits complex I more strongly than Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+ to Cu2+ or Cd2+. It does not inhibit NADH oxidation or intramolecular electron transfer, so it probably inhibits either proton transfer to bound quinone or proton translocation. Thus, zinc represents a new class of complex I inhibitor clearly distinct from the many ubiquinone site inhibitors. No evidence for increased superoxide production by zinc-inhibited complex I was detected. Zinc binding to complex I is mechanistically complicated. During catalysis, zinc binds slowly and progressively, but it binds rapidly and tightly to the resting state(s) of the enzyme. Reactivation of the inhibited enzyme upon the addition of EDTA is slow, and inhibition is only partially reversible. The IC50 value for the Zn2+ inhibition of complex I is high (10–50 μm, depending on the enzyme state); therefore, complex I is unlikely to be a major site for zinc inhibition of the electron transport chain. However, the slow response of complex I to a change in Zn2+ concentration may enhance any physiological consequences.

A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), but a second reactive site, perhaps a bound semiquinone, has been proposed to make a significant contribution to reactive oxygen species production under certain conditions (29Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The strategy developed here is to use highly pure and catalytically active isolated complex I (30Sharpley M.S. Shannon R.J. Draghi F. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) as a simple experimental system that allows precise measurements of the effects of zinc on both the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity and on the production of superoxide (28Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The aims of this work are thus 2-fold: first, to define the limits and possibilities for the role of complex I in zinc-mediated pathologies by determining the timescale and potency of zinc inhibition; and second, to define the molecular mechanism of zinc inhibition to further investigate the catalytic mechanism of complex I. In particular, zinc binding has proven valuable in localizing and elucidating the mechanisms of proton transfer in the cytochrome bc1 complex (17Link T.A. von Jagow G. J. Biol.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas the mechanism of proton transfer in complex I remains undetermined. Preparation of Complex I from Bovine Heart Mitochondria—Complex I was prepared from bovine heart mitochondria as described previously (30Sharpley M.S. Shannon R.J. Draghi F. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), however, with minor modifications. EDTA was omitted from all buffers, and HEPES was used instead of Tris-HCl to minimize the chelation of divalent metal cations (M2+). 2The abbreviations used are: M2+, divalent metal cation; Q, ubiquinone; SOD, superoxide dismutase; HAR, hexaammineruthenium; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid. Catalytic Activity Assays—The NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of complex I was determined in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and 0.5 mg ml–1 asolectin at 32 °C, unless stated otherwise. 100 μm NADH (Sigma, from a 10 mm stock solution) and 200 μm decylubiquinone (Sigma, from a 35 mm stock solution) were used as substrates. The high decylubiquinone concentration helps to avoid limitations from substrate availability as the assays progress. Typically, 5 μg of complex I were used. The reaction was monitored via the NADH concentration (340–380 nm; ϵ = 4.81 mm–1 cm–1), and initial rates are specific activities reported per milligram of complex I (determined using the FMN concentration). For complex I, 1 mg is equal to 1 nmol, as the molecular mass is ∼1 MDa (24Hirst J. Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). When complex I was incubated at 32 °C prior to initiation of catalysis, it was incubated at its final concentration in the assay buffer with phospholipids but in the absence of substrates. Then, 200 μm decylubiquinone was added, the absorbance was allowed to stabilize, and 100 μm NADH was added to initiate turnover. When required, superoxide dismutase (SOD; Cu, Zn-SOD from bovine erythrocytes, Sigma) was added to 10 units ml–1. The NADH:hexaammineruthenium (HAR) oxidoreductase activity was determined in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) using 1.6 μg of complex I, 1.4 mm HAR, and 140 μm NADH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH and monitored by the decrease in NADH concentration (340 nm; ϵ = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1). H2O2 was quantified using the horseradish peroxidase (MP Biomedicals; 2 units ml–1)-dependent oxidation of Amplex Red at a concentration of 10 μm (Invitrogen) to resorufin (ϵ557–620 = 51.6 ± 2.5 mm–1 cm–1 at pH 7.5) (28Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX X-band spectrometer using an ER 4119HS high sensitivity cavity maintained at low temperature by an ESR900 continuous flow liquid helium cryostat (Oxford Instruments); the sample temperature was measured by a calibrated Cernox resistor (Lake Shore Cryotronics, Inc.). The Effect of Divalent Cations on the NADH:Decylubiquinone Oxidoreductase Activity of Complex I—Fig. 2 presents the effects of a range of divalent metal cations (M2+) on the catalytic activity of complex I purified from bovine heart mitochondria. The activities reported are initial rate measurements, and they are all sensitive to inhibition by rotenone, confirming that ubiquinone reduction is occurring at the physiological (energy-transducing) binding site. The specific activity in the absence of M2+, ∼8 μmol e– min–1 mg–1, is equal to that of complex I in the inner mitochondrial membrane (30Sharpley M.S. Shannon R.J. Draghi F. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Clearly, the different cations inhibit to varying extents; M2+ from Group 2 (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+) exert little effect on the initial rate, whereas the inhibitory potency of M2+ from the first row transition elements follows approximately the order across the row from Mn2+ to Zn2+. The trend probably reflects increased electrostatic interactions modulated by ligand field effects. Clearly, Zn2+ is the most potent inhibitor, although Cd2+, below Zn2+ in Group 12, is also effective. A similar trend was reported previously for modulation of the catalytic activity of cytochrome c oxidase by divalent cations (33Mills D.A. Schmidt B. Hiser C. Westley E. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14894-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence of the Zn2+ inhibition is described below. Finally, the Zn2+ inhibition of complex I was confirmed in experiments using mitochondrial membrane preparations also. All results described here for isolated complex I have been confirmed qualitatively using membrane preparations. The Mechanistic Point of Inhibition of Complex I by Zn2+—Fig. 1 depicts the mechanism of energy transduction in complex I and identifies four points at which it may be inhibited by Zn2+: (i) the binding or oxidation of NADH, (ii) intramolecular electron transfer from the FMN to bound quinone, (iii) ubiquinone binding or reduction, and (iv) proton translocation. Note that all of the processes are tightly coupled, so that simple inhibition at any point should prevent NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreductase catalysis completely; inhibiting proton transfer should prevent NADH oxidation just as effectively as inhibiting NADH binding. First, HAR is an artificial electron acceptor that accepts electrons from complex I “upstream” of the physiological ubiquinone binding site, decoupling NADH oxidation from ubiquinone reduction and proton translocation. Fig. 3A shows that the NADH:HAR oxidoreductase activity of complex I is not compromised by Zn2+, even if the enzyme is preincubated with Zn2+ for 30 min before the assay is initiated. Therefore, Zn2+ does not inhibit the binding or oxidation of NADH. Second, complex I was incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+. Then, it was reduced anaerobically using 5 mm NADH, frozen immediately, and evaluated by EPR spectroscopy. The spectra (not shown) demonstrate clearly that cluster N2, the final cluster in the chain between the FMN and the ubiquinone binding site, is fully reduced. They are essentially identical to spectra from a control sample and also to previously described spectra from bovine complex I (25Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), showing that none of the other EPR-detectable clusters are affected either. Thus, it is unlikely that Zn2+ inhibits electron transfer from the FMN to cluster N2 or that a Zn2+ derivative of one of the iron-sulfur clusters has been formed (36Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Breton J. George S.J. Thomson A.J. Hatchikian C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6663-6670Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that a decrease in the rate of electron transfer, which if severe enough could impact on the rate of catalysis, may remain undetected by this “end point” experiment. Third, to investigate whether Zn2+ binding competes with or affects ubiquinone binding, the NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreductase activity was determined over a range of decylubiquinone concentrations in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 3B). The reduction of decylubiquinone is rotenone-sensitive (∼97%) (30Sharpley M.S. Shannon R.J. Draghi F. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 37Degli Esposti M. Ngo A. McMullen G.L. Ghelli A. Sparla F. Benelli B. Ratta M. Linnane A.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and coupled to proton translocation (37Degli Esposti M. Ngo A. McMullen G.L. Ghelli A. Sparla F. Benelli B. Ratta M. Linnane A.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); therefore, these assays address ubiquinone binding at the physiologically relevant site. Increasing the decylubiquinone concentration does not relieve Zn2+ inhibition, and although Zn2+ inhibition is not readily reversible (see below), Zn2+ affects the apparent kcat and not the apparent Km for decylubiquinone reduction. Therefore, Zn2+ binding does not interfere with ubiquinone binding to complex I. Fourth, Fig. 3C shows that inhibition by Zn2+ is strongly pH-dependent. Although a single pK value cannot be derived from the data, Fig. 3C suggests that Zn2+ competes with H+ for one or more protonatable ligands. Zn2+ binding may disrupt many different components of the mechanism, including proton transfer to bound quinone, gated proton transfer across a hydrophobic barrier, proton transfer through a channel, or a conformational change. Unfortunately, no reproducible method for reconstituting isolated bovine complex I into proteoliposomes exists, precluding direct investigation of the effects of the proton motive force at present. In summary, Zn2+ does not inhibit complex I by inhibiting NADH oxidation, by impeding electron transfer along the chain of iron sulfur clusters, or by interfering with decylubiquinone binding. Therefore, it is likely to inhibit either ubiquinone reduction or proton translocation (Fig. 1). The Progressive Increase in Zn2+ Inhibition of Complex I during Turnover—Fig. 4 shows extended assay traces recorded following the initiation of the NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreductase reaction by the addition of complex I in the presence of Zn2+. The traces are significantly curved showing that inhibition increases gradually during turnover. The most obvious explanation is that Zn2+ binds to complex I slowly. However, Fig. 5A compares initial rates of catalysis as a function of [Zn2+] when the reaction is initiated by the addition of complex I and when complex I is incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of Zn2+ and the reaction is initiated by the addition of the substrates. Although preincubation causes the IC50 value to decrease from ∼55 to ∼10 μm Zn2+, separate experiments exclude the simple interpretation that Zn2+ binding is slow; the same level of inhibition is observed when complex I is incubated for 30 min in the absence of Zn2+ and then Zn2+ is added immediately before turnover is initiated (Fig. 5B). These observations suggest that, during incubation at 30 °C, the enzyme slowly converts to a form that is able to coordinate Zn2+ more rapidly or more tightly.FIGURE 5The effect of preincubating Zn2+ with complex I on the initial NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreductase activity. A, the reaction was initiated by 6μg of complex I (□), or complex I and Zn2+ were incubated together for 30 min at 32 °C; decylubiquinone was added, and the absorbance was allowed to stabilize (90 s), and then the reaction was initiated by NADH (♦). B, complex I was incubated at 32 °C in an assay medium containing 15 μm Zn2+, and the reaction was initiated by NADH (♦) or complex I was incubated in the absence of Zn2+, and then 15 μm Zn2+ was added immediately before initiation by NADH (○). The assay medium comprised 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 μm NADH, 200 μm decylubiquinone (DQ), 0.5 mg ml–1 asolectin, and reactions were monitored via the NADH concentration (ϵ = 4.8 mm–1 cm–1 at 340–380 nm). Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, a slow conversion between two states over 30 min cannot explain the progressive inhibition observed during catalysis. Short preincubations with Zn2+ did not achieve the same degree of inhibition as an equivalent time of exposure to Zn2+ during turnover. Furthermore, the reactivation of Zn2+-bound complex I upon the addition of EDTA is slow, and full reactivation, once the enzyme has catalyzed substrate conversion in the presence of Zn2+, cannot be achieved on a viable experimental timescale. As expected, the effects of Zn2+ binding are reversed more effectively, following preincubation of complex I and Zn2+, when EDTA is added 15 min before initiation (EDTA alone does not affect the catalytic activity). Importantly, the limited reversibility is not because of enzyme precipitation (Zn2+ binding does not affect the NADH:HAR oxidoreductase activity) (Fig. 3A) or delipidation (Zn2+ inhibition is not alleviated by additional phospholipids). We propose two possible explanations explored further below, which are consistent with our observations. (i) Following initial weak association of Zn2+ and complex I, conversion to a “tight binding” state occurs slowly (zinc-induced isomerization); during turnover the conversion is promoted by a catalytic step (38Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5788-5799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sculley M.J. Morrison J.F. Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). (ii) Catalysis by Zn2+-bound complex I is a form of “suicide inactivation.” Possibilities include Zn2+ being “pumped” irreversibly into a proton channel and the increased production of reactive oxygen species, which damage the enzyme and initiate a vicious cycle. The Relationship between Cation Binding and Enzyme State—Although the effects of Zn2+ on isolated complex I have not been described, the interactions of complex I with other divalent cations, particularly Ca2+, have been studied previously (41Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Complex I has been proposed to exist in two distinct forms, “active” and “deactive” (42Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 43Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 44Grivennikova V.G. Kapustin A.N. Vinogradov A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The enzyme deactivates slowly in the absence of turnover and is reactivated slowly when catalysis is initiated by the addition of substrates. The active enzyme was proposed to be insensitive to divalent cations (Ca2+, Ni2+, Co2+, La3+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Ba2+), whereas they bind to and trap the deactive state. Fig. 6 illustrates the fact that the effects of Zn2+ and Ca2+ on complex I are qualitatively very similar but that their relative binding affinities are very different. In Fig. 6, a comparison of sets of assay traces recorded following a 30-min incubation indicates that the complex is ∼200-fold more sensitive to inhibition by Zn2+ than Ca2+, consistent with the high (mm) binding constants reported previously for Ca2+ binding to the deactive state (41Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and with the lack of observable effect from Ca2+ on the active enzyme. Thus, models in which M2+ bind exclusively to the deactive state reflect the heightened susceptibility of this state but are not consistent with the direct effects of Zn2+ during turnover, and they do not account for the progressive increase in inhibition observed. Although the clear similarity between the effects of Zn2+, as described above, and Ca2+, as described previously, suggests that a common mechanism may be applied to both cations, we refer here to the “resting” rather than to the deactive state to differentiate the interpretations of our study from those of previous studies. The Effects of Zn2+ on Superoxide Production by Complex I—Zinc binding may affect the production of superoxide by complex I, but as proposed previously for Ca2+ (45Sadek H.A. Szweda P.A. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8494-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it may also exacerbate the damage that superoxide causes to the enzyme. First, no increase in H2O2 production by complex I upon Zn2+ binding could be detected by the Amplex Red assay, either in the presence of NADH only or during NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreduction (data not shown). Therefore, Zn2+ binding does not increase the production of superoxide from the reduced flavin in complex I (28Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Second, the addition of SOD had no effect on inhibition of the NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreductase activity by Zn2+, and identical results were obtained in aerobic and anaerobic (O2 ∼2 parts/million) environments, suggesting that the progressive increase in inhibition observed here is not because of oxidative damage. Is Complex I Inhibition Relevant to Zn2+-mediated Pathologies?—Complex I is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Zn2+; however, because inhibition is slow, irreversible (on the experimental timescale), and complicated by changes in the enzyme that occur independently during preincubation, a thermodynamic binding constant cannot be determined. Instead, apparent IC50 values of 50 μm (no preincubation) and 10 μm (30-min preincubation) are reported (Fig. 5A); the IC50 value depends on the preincubation time and decreases as it is extended (Fig. 5B). Thus, it is clear that Zn2+ binding will not occur under normal conditions when free Zn2+ levels are tightly controlled and very low (if not zero) (46Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) and that a significant effect is only possible, if at all, when Zn2+ concentrations are elevated during pathological situations such as ischemia (4Koh J.-Y.

Interestingly, the sensitivity of complex I to zinc probably increases under these conditions, when the enzyme is not fully catalytically active. Note that the existence of the dea"

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4922-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite intense study, the cellular functions of α-actinin 4 remain unclear. α-Actinin 4 has been shown to bind F actin to modulate cytoskeleton organization and cell motility (4Honda K. Yamada T.

In addition, another report suggested that α-actinin 4 participates in apoptosis (5Liu Q.Y. Lei J.X. LeBlanc J. Sodja C. Ly D. Charlebois C. Walker P.R. Yamada T. Hirohashi S. Sikorska M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although α-actinin 4 has been shown to associate with transcription factors, there is no functional data suggesting that it is involved in transcriptional regulation (6Babakov V.N. Bobkov D.E.

These observations suggest that α-actinin 4 plays a role in regulating multiple cellular processes and animal development. Although predominately localized in the cytoskeleton, α-actinin 4 is also found in the nucleus of certain cell types (4Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) or translocates into the nucleus in response to extracellular stimuli. For example, treatment with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors or actin depolymerization can lead to nuclear accumulation of α-actinin 4 (4Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which α-actinin 4 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm remains unclear, and the functional significance of nuclear α-actinin 4 has not been demonstrated. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are well known for their function as epigenetic regulators of the transcription machinery. In mammals, 18 different HDACs have been identified and grouped into three distinct classes based on sequence homology, subcellular localization, and the chemistry of their enzymatic activity. Class II HDACs can be subdivided into class IIa that includes HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9 (will be referred as class II hereafter) and class IIb, HDAC6 and -10 (10Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Class II HDACs play a pivotal role in cell differentiation and animal development, partly due to their association with MEF2 transcription factors (10Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 11Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Class II HDACs are unique in their ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Consequently, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of class II HDACs is an important regulatory mechanism that controls the activity of MEF2 (10Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 11Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). During muscle differentiation and thymocyte development, class II HDACs are sequestered in the cytoplasm (12McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 13Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As a result, transcriptional repression by HDACs is relieved, leading to up-regulation of MEF2 target genes, such as muscle creatine kinase and Nur77 and subsequent muscle differentiation and thymocyte development, respectively. Thus far, the mechanism accounting for de-repression of MEF2 activity (by class II HDACs) has been largely attributed to the activity of calmodulin kinase and chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) proteins that promote cytoplasmic retention of class II HDACs. In this study we have identified α-actinin 1 and 4 as HDAC7-interacting proteins and defined their novel function. We also isolated a novel splice variant of α-actinin 4. We demonstrate that α-actinin 4 is capable of interacting with class II HDACs and potentiates transcription activity by MEF2. Taken together, our data support a model in which α-actinin 4 potentiates transcriptional activity of MEF2 in part by antagonizing HDAC7 activity. Construction of HeLa Yeast Two-hybrid Library—HeLa cell cDNAs were generated by RT-PCR according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). cDNAs sized above 1 kilobase were isolated from gels and purified. EcoRI linker was added to both ends of the cDNAs, and the resulting cDNAs were ligated with EcoRI-digested pGAD vector (Stratagene). Ligation reactions were transformed into Escherichia coli (Stratagene). More than 1 × 106 independent clones were obtained. Yeast Two-hybrid Screens—Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens were carried out using the standard lithium acetate method. HeLa Y2H library and pGBT9-HDAC7 (2-533, S178E/S344E/S479E) were co-transformed into yeast strain Y190. Approximately 3 × 106 yeast transformants were screened and selected on yeast minimal medium -Leu-Trp-His plates containing 40 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma). After 7 days, colonies were picked and confirmed by β-galactosidase assays. For confirmation, plasmids were recovered from yeast and retransformed into yeast along with the bait construct. Positive clones were then subjected to sequencing. In addition to clones encoding α-actinin 1 and 4, we also isolated several cDNA clones encoding C-terminal binding proteins (CtBP) proteins, consistent with previous reports (14Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Lu J.R. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Standard Y2H assays were carried out according our published protocol (15Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR—RNA isolation from MCF7, HeLa, and HEK293 cells was performed using the RNeasy Mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNase I digestion was performed on the RNeasy column following the manufacturer's suggestions using RNase- and DNase-free DNase I (Qiagen). The isolated RNA was used in a semi-quantitative RT-PCR reaction using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 200 ng of RNA template was used in each reaction. PCR amplification was repeated for 45 cycles. The final primer concentration in each reaction was 0.2 μm. The primers used are as follows: 5′-GCATGGTGCAACTCCCACCTG-3′ (forward), 5′-CCCCCGCTCTGGCTTAGG-3′ (reverse, full-length-specific), 5′-GATATGACCACCAGGAGCAG-3′ (reverse, isoform-specific), and 5′-GGGTGTTGACATTGTGGGAGTCG-3′ (reverse, both full-length and isoform). Plasmid Construction—Full-length cDNA of actinin α4 was generated by PCR using a ZAP-expressed phage vector (a generous gift from Dr. Hirohashi) as a template. α-Actinin 4 (isoform) cDNA was PCR-amplified using Y2H clone as a template. Truncated and deleted α-actinin 4 cDNAs were PCR-amplified using full-length α-actinin 4 or its isoform as a template. The cDNAs were cloned into pCMX-PL1-HA or CMX-PL1-FLAG vectors (16Li X. Song S. Liu Y. Ko S.H. Kao H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34201-34208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) digested with EcoR1 and NheI site. For the glutathione S-transferase (GST) constructs, α-actinin 4 was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pGEX4T vector. MEF2 expression plasmids and MEF2 reporter construct have been previously described (17Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HDAC7 point mutation and deletions were generated by PCR reactions. TAF55 reporter constructs were gifts from Dr. Cheng-Ming Chiang (18Zhou T. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25503-25511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Antibodies—α-Actinin 4 antiserum was generated using GST-α-actinin 4 (isoform) fusion proteins. Antibodies were purified by sequential purification through GST and GST-α-actinin 4 affinity columns. Anti-HA, anti-MEF2, and anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz and Sigma. HDAC7 antibodies were generated with peptide encompassing amino acids 115-129 of mouse HDAC7. HDAC7 antibodies were purified from peptide affinity chromatography (Affinity BioReagents). Anti-HDAC7 antibodies did not cross-react with HDAC4 or HDAC5 (data not shown). GST Pulldown Assays—GST fusion proteins GST-α-actinin 4 and GST-HDAC7 were expressed in E. coli DH5α strain, affinity-purified, and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. GST pulldown assays were carried out with purified, immobilized GST fusion proteins incubated with whole cell extracts expressing FLAG- or HA-tagged proteins. Binding reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 1 h with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) followed by extensive washes. The bound fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies. For pulldown assays, 10% of the input is shown. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown on 10-cm plates and transfected with appropriate plasmid (10 μg of total DNA) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were washed in 1× PBS and resuspended in NETN buffer with protease inhibitors. After incubating on ice for 2 h, the lysed cells were centrifuged at 4 °C at 10,000 RPM for 10 min; supernatant was collected and kept at -80 °C. These lysates were incubated with appropriate antibody for 4 h at 4 °C, and then protein A/G beads were incubated with pre-clear whole cell extracts for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunopellets were washed 3-4 times followed by Western blots probed with the appropriate antibody. Ten percent of the input is shown on Western analyses. Confocal Microscopy—Transfected cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized in PBS with the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum for 10 min. The cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated in a PBS, goat serum (10%) plus 0.1% Tween 20 solution (ABB) for 60 min. Incubation with primary antibodies was carried out for 120 min in ABB. The cells were washed 3 times in PBS, and the secondary antibodies were added for 30-60 min in the dark at room temperature in ABB. Coverslips were mounted to slides using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; H-1200, Vector Laboratories, Inc.). All confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser-scanning confocal microscope. A 63× numerical aperture of 1.4 oil immersion planapochromat objective was used for all experiments. For endogenous and transiently transfected α-actinin 4, images of Alexa Fluor 594 were collected using a 633-nm excitation light from a He/Ne2 laser, a 633-nm dichroic mirror, and 650-nm long pass filter. For endogenous HDAC7, images of Alexa Fluor 488 were collected using a 488-nm excitation light from an argon laser, a 488-nm dichroic mirror, and 500-550-nm band pass barrier filter. All 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclear images were collected using a Coherent Mira-F-V5-XW-220 (Verdi 5W) Ti-Sapphire laser tuned at 750-nm, a 700-nm dichroic mirror, and a 390-465-nm band pass barrier filter. The primary antibodies used were purified α-HDAC7 rabbit polyclonal (Affinity BioReagents) and α-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). The secondary antibodies used were from Molecular Probes (α-mouse or α-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, α-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, and mouse Alexa Fluor 594). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transient transfections and luciferase assays were performed in 48-well culture plates. HeLa and CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg of streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with a muscle creatine kinase promoter-containing reporter construct (17Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and CMX-β-gal expression plasmids. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as a transfection reagent. The amount of DNA was kept constant by the addition of pCMX vector. After 5 h the medium was replaced, and the cells were harvested after 48 h of transfection and luciferase assay, and β-galactosidase activity was measured by using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Each reaction was performed in triplicate. Results shown indicate luciferase activity normalized to β-galactosidase levels. Transient transfection assays for TAF55 were carried out using as reporter constructs as described (18Zhou T. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25503-25511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). siRNA Transfection and RT-PCR— α-Actinin 4 and control siRNA Smart Pool was purchased from Dharmacon and dissolved in 1× siRNA buffer to a final concentration of siRNA 20 pmol/μl. The siRNA sequences are: target 1, 5′-CACCACAGCUGAUUGAGUA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UACUCAAUCAGCUCUGGUC-3′ (antisense); target 2, 5′-UCGAAGUGGCUGAGAAAUA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAUUUUCUCAGCCACUUCGA-3′ (antisense); target 3, 5′-GAGACGGGCUCAAGCUCAU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AUGAGCUUGAGCCCGUCUC-3′ (antisense); target 4, 5′-AACCAUAGCGGCCUUGUGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UCACAAGGCCGUAUGGUU-3′ (antisense). For transfection, siRNA (200 pmol/well) and a 5-μl mixture of Lipofectamine 2000 and Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen) were re-suspended in Opti-MEM and transfected to HeLa cells (6-well plate, 70% confluent) for 24 h. Transfection medium was then replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (without penicillin/streptomycin). The cells were collected 48 h post-transfection respect. Total RNA extraction was prepared using the RNeasy commercial kit (Qiagen). Semi quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript One step RT-PCR kit with Platinum Taq. 500 ng of RNA was used for each reaction. The primers used for RT-PCR to examine the effects of α-actinin 4 siRNA are: TAF55, 5′-GAAGGGCAGTACAGTCTGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATACAAGCATCTGACA-3′ (reverse); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TGGTCACCAGGGCTGCTT-3′ (forward), 5′-AGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCCTT-3′ (reverse). The primers to detect expression of the full-length and isoform of α-actinin 4 are described above. The intensity of the signals was quantified using the VERSADOC 3000 (Bio-Rad). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assay was carried out as described with modifications (29Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Chromatin was sheared by sonication, and the extracts were precleared by protein A-coupled beads (Repligen). Immunoprecipitation was performed using HDAC7, α-actinin 4, and MEF2 antibodies. The MEF2 antibody cross-reacts with all MEF2 family members (Santa Cruz). For PCR, 2 μl of DNA was mixed with Hot start IT Taq master mix (USB Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The products were resolved in 2% agarose gel. The primers used for ChIP assays are: 5′-CGTAAAAGTGCTGGCTTAGCG-3′ (forward), 5′-CAGCTAGCGCAGGCGCAATAG-3′ (reverse), 5′-GATGTGGCAGAGGCCTTAGGCC-3′ (control, forward), and 5′-GGGAGGAGAATTGCTTGAACC-3′ (control reverse). To identify proteins interacting with HDAC7, we generated an HDAC7 mutant (S178E/S344E/S479E) fused with the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain for use in a yeast two-hybrid screen. HDAC7 (S178E/S344E/S479E) has been shown to lose its ability to interact with 14-3-3 proteins (19Gao C. Gao C. Li X. Lam M. Liu Y. Chakraborty S. Kao H.Y. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5096-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), so we anticipated no cDNA coding 14-3-3 proteins would be isolated. The resulting construct, pGBT9-HDAC7 (1-533, S178E/S344E/S479E), was co-transformed with a yeast two-hybrid library to isolate interacting clones. Of 20 clones sequenced, 3 clones encoded human α-actinin 1, and 3 clones encoded human α-actinin 4. Interestingly, one of the α-actinin 4 clones encoded an α-actinin 4 variant containing an internal deletion from nt 263-1433 from the translation initiation codon (accession number NM_004924). This deletion resulted in the loss of amino acids 89-478 of α-actinin 4 that contains part of calponin homology 1 (CH1), all of the CH2 domains, and spectrin homology repeats 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A). To verify that the cloned α-actinin 4 (isoform) cDNA was generated from mRNA, we carried out RT-PCR to examine the presence of this spliced isoform. Human α-actinin 4 is predicted to consist of 21 exons. Based on the isolated cDNA sequence, exons 3-12 are spliced out in the isoform. Primers that anneal to full-length α-actinin 4 mRNA (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or its isoform (lanes 2, 4, and 6) were used for RT-PCR using RNA prepared from MCF-7 (lanes 1 and 2), HeLa (lanes 3 and 4), or HEK293 (lanes 5 and 6) cells as templates (Fig. 1B). We found that MCF-7, HeLa, and HEK293 cells express both full-length α-actinin 4 and the spliced isoform. Using a pair of primers capable of annealing to both full-length α-actinin 4 and the spliced mRNA variant, we were able to detect the presence of both the full-length α-actinin 4 and its splice variant (lanes 7-9). Sequence analyses of the eluted, purified PCR product also indicated that the sequence of the PCR product matched that of the isolated α-actinin 4 (isoform) cDNA (data not shown). These data verified the presence of the novel isoform of α-actinin 4 in MCF-7, HeLa, and HEK293 cells. We further tested whether the spliced mRNA variant is indeed translated. A full-length or isoform HA-α-actinin 4 expression plasmid was transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Whole cell lysates were prepared followed by Western blotting with anti-α-actinin 4 or anti-HA antibodies. Fig. 1C demonstrates that in the absence of transfected plasmid, in addition to the full-length α-actinin 4, anti-α-actinin 4 antibodies detected another minor protein species, which migrated faster than full-length α-actinin4(lanes 1 marked with an asterisk). In cell lysates expressing HA-α-actinin 4 isoform or full-length, we detected both endogenous and transfected isoform (lane 2) and full-length proteins (lane 3). As expected, Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies detected α-actinin 4 isoform (lane 5) and the full-length protein (lane 6). These data indicate that the cloned α-actinin 4 (isoform) comigrates with the endogenous α-actinin 4 (lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the isoform is endogenously expressed in HeLa cells. Furthermore, the low expression of α-actinin 4 (isoform) protein observed is consistent with our RT-PCR data, demonstrating that full-length α-actinin 4 protein is expressed in excess to the isoform in HeLa cells. Because HDAC7 (S178E/S344E/S479E) was used as bait to screen for HDAC7-interacting proteins, we tested whether α-actinin 4 is capable of interacting with wild-type HDAC7 by Y2H assays. We found that wild-type and mutant HDAC7 (S178E/S344E/S479E) interacted equally well with α-actinin 4 (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether endogenous α-actinin 4 associates with HDAC7, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation with extracts prepared from HeLa and CV-1 cells and found that endogenous HDAC7 and α-actinin 4 associate in these cells (Fig. 2B). We then tested the interaction of other α-actinins and HDAC7 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HA-HDAC7 expression plasmid was co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding FLAG-α-actinin 1, FLAG-α-actinin 4, or FLAG-α-actinin 4 (isoform) into HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2C, HA-HDAC7 was immunoprecipitated in the presence of α-actinin 1 and α-actinin 4. Furthermore, both full-length and α-actinin 4 (isoform) were co-precipitated. These data indicate that HDAC7 is capable of interacting with both α-actinin 1 and 4 in mammalian cells. To understand the molecular basis of the interaction between HDAC7 and α-actinin 4, we mapped the interaction domains by yeast two-hybrid and GST pulldown assays. Deletion and truncation fragments of HDAC7 fused with yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (pGBT9-HDAC7) were co-transformed into yeast with yeast Gal4 activation domain fused with α-actinin 4 (pGAD-α-actinin 4). β-Galactosidase assays were carried out to examine the interaction. We found that HDAC7 fragments containing amino acids 2-172 and 72-254 were sufficient to interact with α-actinin 4, suggesting a minimal interaction domain localized within amino acids 72-172 of HDAC7 (Fig. 3A). The observation that both α-actinin 4 and its isoform interact with HDAC7 suggests that amino acids 644-911 are sufficient for the association with HDAC7 (Fig. 1A). To further map the interaction, we generated deletion and truncation constructs from amino acids 644 of full-length α-actinin 4. Fig. 3B shows that amino acids 832-911 of α-actinin 4 were sufficient to interact with HDAC7. GST-α-actinin 4 (isoform) and GST-HDAC7 (72-172) fusion protein expression plasmids were generated and transformed into bacteria for protein expression. Immobilized GST-α-actinin 4 fusion proteins were incubated with whole cell extracts containing expressed FLAG-HDAC7. Retained fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Fig. 3C demonstrates that, consistent with the results from yeast two-hybrid assays, amino acids 832-911 of α-actinin 4 were capable of binding HDAC7. In reverse assays, immobilized GST-HDAC7 deletion and truncation proteins were incubated with extracts containing HA-α-actinin 4 followed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. We found that amino acids 72-172 of HDAC7 bound α-actinin 4 in GST pulldown assays (Fig. 3D). To test whether region 832-911 was the only HDAC7 interaction domain, we generated expression plasmids HA-α-actinin 4 (2-839) and HA-α-actinin 4 (2-449, isoform), both of which lack the mapped HDAC7 interaction domain (Fig. 3B). We found that amino acids 2-839 did not interact with HDAC7 (72-172) (Fig. 3E). Similarly, GST-HDAC7 (72-172) failed to bind amino acids (2-449) of α-actinin 4 (isoform) (Fig. 3F). In summary, in vitro pulldown data were consistent with those of Y2H assays. Our data further indicate that amino acids 832-911 of α-actinin 4 are sufficient for HDAC7 binding and that amino acids 72-172 are the minimal HDAC7-interacting domain. Amino acids 72-172 of HDAC7 share extensive sequence homology with other members of the class II HDACs, indicating that α-actinin 4 likely associates with other members of class IIa HDACs. To test this possibility, we carried out GST pulldown assays with the class II HDACs. Immobilized GST-α-actinin 4 (isoform) fusion protein was incubated with whole cell extracts expressing HA-tagged HDAC1, -4, -5, and -7 and Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. Fig. 3G shows that α-actinin 4 interacts with HDAC4 and HDAC5 but not HDAC1. These data indicate that α-actinin 4 interacts specifically with class II HDACs both in vivo and in vitro. α-Actinin 4 has been detected in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane depending on the cell type and culture conditions (4Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The identification of the α-actinin 4 (isoform) raised the possibility that this isoform has a distinct subcellular localization from full-length α-actinin 4. Therefore, confocal microscopy experiments were carried out to examine the subcellular distribution of α-actinin 4 (isoform) in HeLa cells. A FLAG-tagged full-length α-actinin 4 expression plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells, and immunostaining was carried out using anti-FLAG and anti-HDAC7 antibodies to probe transfected α-actinin 4 and endogenous HDAC7, respectively. Fig. 4A shows that full-length α-actinin 4 was distributed throughout the whole cell including the plasma membrane and colocalized with α-actinin 4 (panels a, d, and e). In untransfected HeLa cells HDAC7 was primarily localized in the nucleus (panels c, e, and f). In transfected cells, how"
https://openalex.org/W2091470046,"MukBEF is a bacterial SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) complex required for faithful chromosome segregation in Escherichia coli. The SMC subunit of the complex, MukB, promotes DNA condensation in vitro and in vivo; however, all three subunits are required for the function of MukBEF. We report here that MukEF disrupts MukB·DNA complex. Preassembled MukBEF was inert in DNA binding or reshaping. Similarly, the association of MukEF with DNA-bound MukB served to displace MukB from DNA. When purified from cells, MukBEF existed as a mixture of MukEF-saturated and unsaturated complexes. The holoenzyme was unstable and could only bind DNA upon dissociation of MukEF. The DNA reshaping properties of unsaturated MukBEF were identical to those of MukB. Furthermore, the unsaturated MukBEF was stable and proficient in DNA binding. These results support the view that kleisins are not directly involved in DNA binding but rather bridge distant DNA-bound MukBs.

SMCs are ubiquitous highly conserved proteins that have been implicated in virtually every aspect of higher order chromatin dynamics. Eukaryotic cells contain at least six different SMC complexes with functions in chromosome condensation and segregation, recombination, and repair (1Swedlow J.R. Hirano T. Mol.

They consist of two globular domains connected by a long coil-hinge-coil motif. In solution, SMCs dimerize to form an idiosyncratic V-shaped structure with two globular head domains connected at the hinge via two long coiled coils (8Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G.

Among the non-SMC subunits, a conserved family of kleisins was identified (17Soppa J. Kobayashi K. Noirot-Gros M.F. Oesterhelt D. Ehrlich S.D. Dervyn E. Ogasawara N. Moriya S. Mol.

In a reaction coupled to type-2 DNA topoisomerases, condensins promote formation of DNA knots of specific topology (22Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Stray J.E. Crisona N.J. Belotserkovskii B.P. Lindsley J.E. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This property is highly conserved among condensins and indicates intramolecular DNA condensation. In contrast, cohesins promote DNA catenation, indicating predominantly intermolecular DNA interactions (25Losada A. Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). How the structurally similar condensins and cohesins distinguish between their substrates remains unclear. The mechanism of SMCs is under debate. Divergent models were proposed to explain the mechanism of DNA reshaping (1Swedlow J.R. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 557-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 23Stray J.E. Crisona N.J. Belotserkovskii B.P. Lindsley J.E. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The ring model proposed for cohesins postulates that the proteins hold DNA segments via a purely topological link (1Swedlow J.R. Hirano T. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). At least for condensins, this model is at odds with the efficient binding of the proteins to linear DNA and the chirality of generated knots (22Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Stray J.E. Crisona N.J. Belotserkovskii B.P. Lindsley J.E. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A key unanswered question in the mechanistic enzymology of SMCs is about the role of kleisins in DNA reshaping. The original experiments with 13 S condensin from frogs established that the non-SMC subunits and ATP are required for DNA compaction but not for DNA binding (26Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11972-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This agrees well with genetic data, which indicate similar phenotypes for mutations in SMC and non-SMC components of the complex, and the finding that the proteolytic cleavage of kleisins leads to dissolution of cohesion between sister chromosomes (20Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In contrast, the yeast SMC2/4 complex and the E. coli MukB protein promote efficient DNA knotting in the absence of ATP and the cognate accessory subunits (23Stray J.E. Crisona N.J. Belotserkovskii B.P. Lindsley J.E. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34723-34734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Reconstitution studies with the Bacillus subtilis SMC complex indicated that the accessory subunits modulate the association of the protein with DNA (14Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2664-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, if the assembly of the holoenzyme alters the DNA reshaping properties of the protein. Here, we assessed the role of the non-SMC subunits in DNA reshaping by bacterial condensin MukB (27Niki H. Imamura R. Kitaoka M. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5101-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In complex with MukEF, MukB plays the central role in organizing the chromosome of E. coli (5Hiraga S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 21-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutational inactivation of MukBEF results in the loss of cell viability above 30 °C, chromosome decondensation and cutting, and a high frequency of anucleate cells (28Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar). The overproduction of MukBEF leads to the opposite effect; that is, a marked decrease in the size of the nucleoid (29Wang Q. Mordukhova E.A. Edwards A.L. Rybenkov V.V. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4431-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the primary function of MukBEF appears to be chromosome condensation. Accordingly, mukB phenotype is suppressed by mutations that increase DNA supercoiling (30Sawitzke J.A. Austin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Weitao T. Nordstrom K. Dasgupta S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), presumably due to the more compact structure of highly supercoiled chromosomes (32Holmes V.F. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1322-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 33Rybenkov V.V. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Within MukBEF, MukF serves as a linker between MukB and MukE (34Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). MukF readily dimerizes via its N-terminal domain and can also associate with MukB or MukE (34Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A structural analysis indicated that MukF is a kleisin (35Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Accordingly, MukBEF, but not MukB, was found to form multimolecular rosette-like and fiber-like structures in the absence of ATP or DNA (36Matoba K. Yamazoe M. Mayanagi K. Morikawa K. Hiraga S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified MukB binds linear and circular DNA with similar affinities, about 30 nm MukB (24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and can bind ATP and GTP in the presence of Zn2+ (27Niki H. Imamura R. Kitaoka M. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5101-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The ATPase rate of MukB is the slowest reported so far for the SMC proteins and is not stimulated by single- or double-stranded DNA (24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The protein, however, supports efficient DNA supercoiling even in the absence of ATP or magnesium and promotes formation of right-handed three-noded knots, the signature activity of condensins (24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the overproduced MukB efficiently condensed chromosomes but failed to restore the viability of MukEF-deficient cells (29Wang Q. Mordukhova E.A. Edwards A.L. Rybenkov V.V. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4431-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the accessory subunits of MukBEF appear to be dispensable for DNA compaction per se but are required for other aspects of chromosome condensation. We report here that MukEF has only negative effects on MukB-catalyzed DNA reshaping. Preassembled MukBEF was unable to bind or reshape DNA; conversely, DNA binding interfered with the assembly of the holoenzyme. The interaction of MukEF with DNA-bound MukB served to displace MukB from DNA. Thus, MukEF and DNA compete for binding to MukB. We found, however, that only 50% of reconstituted MukBEFs were stable; the remaining complexes were short-lived even in the presence of stabilizing magnesium. Thus, MukBEF is likely to act inside the cell as an asymmetric, half-saturated unit. We indeed found that the half-saturated MukBEF efficiently supported DNA reshaping. Furthermore, a stable MukEF·MukB·DNA complex could be formed at substoichiometric levels of MukEF. We found similar properties for MukBEF that was purified from overproducing cells. Purified MukBEF existed as a mixture of two complexes, one of which was unsaturated with MukEF. The MukEF-saturated MukBEF was unstable and acquired the DNA binding activity after dissociation of MukEF. The MukEF-unsaturated MukBEF was indistinguishable from MukB in its DNA binding and reshaping. These data support the view that DNA binding and reshaping is accomplished by the SMC subunit of the complex, whereas kleisins are responsible for other aspects of chromosome rearrangement. Proteins—DNA topoisomerases were previously described (24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). MukB10, MukE9F, and MukB10EF, which include C-terminal His-tagged MukB or MukE, were purified from DH5α cells harboring plasmids pBB10, pBB08, or pBB03, respectively (29Wang Q. Mordukhova E.A. Edwards A.L. Rybenkov V.V. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4431-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The functionality of all Muk proteins on these plasmids has been previously verified (29Wang Q. Mordukhova E.A. Edwards A.L. Rybenkov V.V. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4431-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MukB10 and MukB10EF were purified using nickel-chelate chromatography followed by separation on a HiTrap heparin column (GE Healthcare) as described previously for MukB (24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Only the active, high salt fraction of MukB was analyzed here. MukE9F was purified by nickel-chelate chromatography followed by gel filtration through Sephacryl S300. No contaminating proteins were found in purified MukEF or BEF-HS. BEF-LS, the inactive low salt fraction of MukBEF, contained about 1% of acyl carrier protein. Similar to MukB (24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), acyl carrier protein did not co-elute with DNA reshaping activities during chromatography on the Heparin II column. To obtain MukE and MukF, purified MukEF was denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochlorate, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7 and applied to the nickel column. MukF was eluted with 6 m guanidine hydrochlorate, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 20 mm imidazole. MukE was then eluted with 20-400 mm imidazole gradient in the same buffer, and the proteins were refolded by dialysis against 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. MukBEF was reconstituted by mixing MukEF and MukB on ice in reconstitution buffer (20 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) followed by 20 min of incubation. Protein concentrations were measured using Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNA Reactions—DNA knotting and supercoiling assays were done in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 40 mm NaCl, 7% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgATP, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as previously described (24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). DNA binding was carried out in reaction buffer containing either 2 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm EDTA as indicated under “Results.” The reactions were chilled on ice and analyzed by electrophoresis (4.5 h at 4 V/cm at 4 °C) through 0.7% agarose in TB buffer (90 mm Tris borate (TB), pH 8.3) or TB buffer plus 2 mm MgCl2 (see figure legends for details). DNA was visualized by staining with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes). Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—30 μg of MukBEF was mixed with 30 μg each of thyroglobulin (19.2 S, 8.6 nm), catalase (11.2 S, 5.3 nm), apoferritin (17.6 S, 6.2 nm), alcohol dehydrogenase (7.3 S, 4.6 nm), bovine serum albumin (4.3 S, 3.6 nm), and carbonic anhydrase (2.8 S, 2.0 nm) in reconstitution buffer. The protein mixture was layered on top of 10-40% sucrose gradient in the same buffer (except that glycerol concentration was 10%) and centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 12 h at 4 °C in TLS 55 rotor (Beckman). The proteins in collected fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by Coomassie staining, and quantified using densitometry. Light Scattering (LS) 2The abbreviations used are: LS, light scattering; RI, refractive index. /Size Exclusion Chromatography—MukEF was resolved by gel filtration through a YMC-Pack Diol-300 column, and the light scattering and refraction index (RI) of eluted proteins was measured using PD2010 light scattering detector (Precision Detectors, MA) and Waters 2414 detector, respectively. The molecular mass of the proteins was calculated from LS and RI data using Discovery software (Precision Detectors, MA). The method makes use of the fact that for a given weight concentration of a protein, RI is inversely proportional and LS is directly proportional to the molecular weight of the solute (37Folta-Stogniew E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 328: 97-112PubMed Google Scholar). MukEF Is an Elongated Complex with the Stoichiometry E4F2—MukEF was purified from cells that overproduced MukE and MukF using the C-terminal nine-histidine tag on MukE. MukEF migrated as a single peak during sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration (see below). In agreement with previous data (34Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the sedimentation coefficient of MukEF was found to be 7.5 S. The Stokes radius of MukEF, as determined by gel filtration chromatography, varied depending on temperature: 5.7 nm at 4 °C and 6.5 nm at 23 °C. This variation indicates conformational flexibility in MukEF and precludes the unambiguous determination of its molecular weight. It is clear, however, that MukEF is an asymmetric, most likely elongated protein. Even using the lower value for the Stokes radius, the Form factor of MukEF can be estimated as 1.4, which translates into the axial ratio of 7 (38Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1980: 549-565Google Scholar). When analyzed using LS/size exclusion chromatography (37Folta-Stogniew E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 328: 97-112PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mass of MukEF was found to be 230 ± 10 kDa (Fig. 1A). This value is consistent with two possible complexes, E4F2 and E3F3. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the stoichiometry of MukEF using two approaches. First, MukEF was electrophoresed next to the calibration mixture composed of individually purified MukB, MukF, and MukE. The amount of MukF and MukE was then measured by comparing the intensities of appropriate bands on Coomassie-stained gels (Fig. 1B). Averaged from five independent experiments, the ratio of MukE to MukF was found to be 2.1 ± 0.25. Secondly, the individually purified MukE and MukF were mixed in various proportions and resolved by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Only at a MukE-to-MukF ratio of 2.0 did we find a single band on the gel (Fig. 1C). We conclude that the composition of MukEF is E4F2. The dimeric organization of MukEF indicates that the protein can indeed interact with two separate head domains of MukB, which is consistent with its putative role of a kleisin. Bimodal Association of MukB and MukEF—Reconstitution of MukBEF was carried out by incubating purified MukB and MukEF in the buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA. To evaluate the success of reconstitution, mixtures of MukB and MukEF were subjected to gel filtration through Sephacryl S300. MukB and MukBEF migrate close to the excluded volume on this column, well separated from MukEF (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, we found that only 50% of MukEF comigrated with MukB when the equimolar mixture of MukB and MukEF was resolved by gel filtration in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. This was not because of a poor reconstitution protocol, since all MukEF formed a complex with MukB when the proteins were mixed at the E2F-to-B ratio of 0.5 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the assembled MukBEF was sufficiently stable to survive sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2B). Finally, we found equimolar retention of MukEF by MukB when protein mixtures were subjected to gel filtration in the presence of 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, our standard reaction buffer (Fig. 2A). Only stoichiometric amounts of MukEF comigrated with MukB when higher levels of MukEF were used in reconstitution (Fig. 2A), indicating that the comigration of the proteins is due to complex formation rather than protein aggregation. The combination of magnesium and the low salt conditions was required for complete binding of MukB to MukEF. Only about 70% of MukB bound MukEF at 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (Fig. 2A, bottom panel), and magnesium had no effect on stability of MukBEF at 200 mm NaCl (data not shown). Thus, two types of complexes are formed after reconstitution; half of the resulting MukBEF was stable, whereas the other half was stabilized by magnesium and low salt. Saturated MukBEF Is a Multimer—In general, kleisins could link together the head domains from the same or different V-shaped dimers of MukB. Either separate, ring-like molecules or multimeric assemblies would be produced in these two cases. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed reconstituted MukBEF by gel filtration through the resin with larger pores, Sephacryl S400. Both MukB and MukBEF eluted as distinct peaks when the column was equilibrated in the EDTA-containing buffer (Fig. 2C). The Stokes radii of the proteins (8.6 nm for MukB and 9.5 nm for MukBEF) are consistent with the previous data (24Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and indicate the dimeric MukB at the core of MukBEF. The situation was dramatically different in the presence of magnesium. In this case MukB alone eluted in or close to the void volume of the column, indicating the oligomeric state of the protein (Fig. 2D, top panel). In contrast, MukBEF migrated in the included volume of the column (Fig. 2D, middle panels). Thus, the interaction with MukEF served to disrupt MukB oligomers. Unexpectedly, MukB and MukEF did not co-migrate in the presence of the equimolar level of the kleisin. This result is in apparent contradiction with our finding of the one-to-one association between MukB and MukEF (Fig. 2A, third panel). The two experiments differ only in the resin used for gel filtration. The smaller pores of Sephacryl S300, which was used in Fig. 2A, could conceivably stabilize MukBEF via cage effects (39Cann J.R. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In agreement with this interpretation, the unliganded MukEF in reconstitution mixture migrated faster through the column than the free MukEF (Fig. 2D). This suggests that Muk-BEF could indeed be falling apart during chromatography through Sephacryl S400. And indeed, both MukB and MukEF eluted closer to the void volume of the column when we performed chromatography at a 5-fold greater flow rate (Fig. 2D). To summarize, our reconstitution studies revealed an unexpectedly rich pattern of interactions between MukB and MukEF. The ratio of MukE to MukF did not change during association with MukB and remained constant throughout elution profiles (Fig. 2, B-D). Thus, the composition of MukEF-saturated MukBEF is B2(E2F)2. This notation acknowledges the previous conclusion that MukB interacts with MukEF via MukF (34Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At this stoichiometry, however, reconstituted MukBEF exists as a multimer rather than a holoenzyme. The multimeric MukBEF appears to be a true complex rather than an aggregate since it includes equimolar amounts of MukB and MukEF even when MukEF is used in excess during reconstitution (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the multimeric MukBEF is short-lived even under stabilizing conditions, in the presence of magnesium and low salt concentration. At higher salt, only the half-saturated, stable MukBEF can be detected. The half-saturated MukBEF migrates as a single peak during gel filtration and sucrose gradient centrifugation and does not appear to contain free MukB (Fig. 2, B and C). Based on these data, the composition of the half-saturated MukBEF is B2(E2F)1. Apparently, the dimeric MukEF, (E2F)2, dissociates into two E2F units upon formation of the half-saturated MukBEF. Preassembled MukBEF Does Not Bind or Reshape DNA—MukB was previously shown to form a stable complex with DNA and promote DNA knotting and supercoiling in the ATP- and magnesium-independent manner (24Petrushenko Z.M.

MukB was reconstituted with increasing amounts of MukEF, and the resultant mixture was tested in DNA gel shift, knotting, and supercoiling assays, as described before for MukB (24Petrushenko Z.M.

Instead, the assembly of MukBEF abolished all interactions of MukB with DNA"
https://openalex.org/W2084104780,"Biogenesis of the mammalian peroxisomal membrane requires the action of Pex3p and Pex16p, two proteins present in the organelle membrane, and Pex19p, a protein that displays a dual subcellular distribution (peroxisomal and cytosolic). Pex19p interacts with most peroxisomal intrinsic membrane proteins, but whether this property reflects its role as an import receptor for this class of proteins or a chaperone-like function in the assembly/disassembly of peroxisomal membrane proteins has been the subject of much controversy. Here, we describe an in vitro system particularly suited to address this issue. It is shown that insertion of a reporter protein into the peroxisomal membrane is a Pex3p-dependent process that does not require ATP/GTP hydrolysis. The system can be programmed with recombinant versions of Pex19p, allowing us to demonstrate that Pex19p-cargo protein complexes formed in the absence of peroxisomes are the substrates for the peroxisomal docking/insertion machinery. Data suggesting that cargo-loaded Pex19p displays a much higher affinity for Pex3p than Pex19p alone are also provided. These results suggest that soluble Pex19p participates in the targeting of newly synthesized peroxisomal membrane proteins to the organelle membrane and support the existence of a cargo-induced peroxisomal targeting mechanism for Pex19p.

Most peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in cytosolic ribosomes and post-translationally imported into the organelle (1Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Specific sorting of these proteins into the peroxisome requires a complex machinery comprising about 20 different peroxins (proteins involved in peroxisomal maintenance and inheritance) (2Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G. Fujiki Y. Goodman J.M. Just W.W. Kiel J.A. Kunau W.H. Lazarow P.B. Mannaerts G.P. Moser H.W. Osumi T. Rachubinski R.A. Roscher A.

The vast majority of these peroxins is involved in the targeting and import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. Mutations in the corresponding genes result in the retention of peroxisomal matrix proteins in the cytosol (reviewed in Refs. 2Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G.

Interestingly, these cells still contain peroxisomal membrane remnants (the so-called peroxisomal “ghosts”) (6Santos M.J. Imanaka T. Shio H. Small G.M. Lazarow P.B. Science. 1988; 239: 1536-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) harboring much of the protein repertoire normally found in this membrane system. A different cell phenotype is observed in mutant cell lines lacking functional Pex3p, Pex16p, or Pex19p. In these cases, not only are peroxisomal matrix proteins retained in the cytosol, but also peroxisomal ghosts are no longer detectable (6Santos M.J. Imanaka T. Shio H. Small G.M. Lazarow P.B.

These findings suggest that Pex3p, Pex16p, and Pex19p are involved in the biogenesis of the peroxisomal membrane. During recent years, a large amount of data has been collected regarding the biological properties of Pex19p and Pex3p. Pex19p is an acidic largely disordered protein displaying a dual subcellular localization (cytosolic and peroxisomal) with the ability to interact with most peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) 4The abbreviations used are: PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). both in vitro and in vivo (13Hadden D.A.

The Pex19p domain involved in these interactions resides in the C-terminal two-thirds of the peroxin (16Fransen M. Vastiau I. Brees C. Brys V. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1275-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Mayerhofer P.U. Kattenfeld T. Roscher A.A. Muntau A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 2006; 23: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pex19p also interacts with Pex3p, another intrinsic protein of the peroxisomal membrane. In this case, however, the binding interface in Pex19p is more complex. Indeed, there are two Pex3p-binding domains in Pex19p. The first one resides in the 50 N-terminal amino acid residues of Pex19p and interacts strongly with Pex3p; the second one overlaps with the PMP-binding domain and binds Pex3p with a lower affinity (16Fransen M. Vastiau I. Brees C. Brys V. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1275-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Mayerhofer P.U. Kattenfeld T. Roscher A.A. Muntau A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This different mode of binding is illustrated by the observation that trimeric complexes comprising Pex19p, Pex3p, and a PMP can be obtained in vitro (19Matsuzono Y. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Shibata H. Kashiwayama Y. Imanaka T. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38486-38494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and is related to the fact that the Pex19p-Pex3p interaction serves a different purpose. Indeed, it has been shown that the intracellular localization of Pex19p is largely dictated by the localization of Pex3p (21Fang Y. Morrell J.C. Jones J.M. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Muntau A.C. Roscher A.A. Kunau W.H. Dodt G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For instance, when Pex3p is artificially missorted to mitochondria, Pex19p is also found in this compartment (21Fang Y. Morrell J.C. Jones J.M. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since these two proteins are required for the biogenesis of PMPs, these results indicate that Pex19p and Pex3p constitute, at least transiently, a functional/structural unit. Our knowledge on the mechanistic role of Pex16p in the biogenesis of the peroxisomal membrane is still scarce. However, increasing evidence points to a potential role for this peroxin in the very early steps of this process (7Honsho M. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1622-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Kim P.K. Mullen R.T. Schumann U. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). What is exactly the role of Pex19p? Presently, there are no doubts that Pex19p can bind newly synthesized PMPs. In one study, overexpression of a Pex19p version containing a nuclear localization signal in mammalian cells resulted in the nuclear localization of several newly synthesized PMPs (10Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In another work, using an in vitro translation system, it was shown that Pex19p interacts with newly synthesized PMPs (20Shibata H. Kashiwayama Y. Imanaka T. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38486-38494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, Pex19p has the capacity to bind unfolded peroxisomal membrane proteins. However, the following question remains regarding the subcellular localization of the Pex19p-PMP interaction. Under physiological conditions, does this interaction occur in the cytosol or at the peroxisomal membrane? This uncertainty is at the basis of the two different models regarding the role of Pex19p in peroxisomal biogenesis. According to some authors, Pex19p interacts with newly synthesized PMPs in the cytosol and, acting both as a chaperone and as a mobile receptor, delivers these proteins to the peroxisomal membrane via Pex3p (10Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 19Matsuzono Y. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

Others have proposed that Pex19p acts as membrane chaperone promoting the assembly/disassembly of PMPs at the peroxisomal membrane (25Fransen M. Vastiau I. Brees C. Brys V. Mannaerts G.P.

Understanding the mechanism of any biological process requires a kinetic perspective and is highly facilitated if an open experimental system can be applied to its characterization. In vitro import systems offer these two advantages, because experimental time windows of minutes can be used and components can be added or even removed/neutralized in an easy way. Such a strategy was in fact applied to the study of the biogenesis of peroxisomal intrinsic membrane proteins several years ago. Specific insertion of PMP22 and PMP70 into the peroxisomal membrane was demonstrated (30Diestelkotter P. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The process was shown to occur post-translationally, to be ATP-independent, and to require cytosolic components. However, at that time, the identities of the components involved in the targeting and insertion of this class of proteins into the organelle membrane were unknown. Presently, most, if not all, peroxins involved in this process are already known, allowing us to use many more tools (e.g. recombinant proteins and antibodies) to dissect its mechanism. Here, using a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) from rat liver, we show that a fusion protein containing a fragment of PMP24, a peroxisomal intrinsic membrane protein (33Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M. Eckerskorn C. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), is specifically inserted into the peroxisomal membrane despite the presence of all of the other cellular organelles in the import reactions. The involvement of Pex19p and Pex3p in this process was addressed. Our results indicate that the import competence of the PMP24 reporter protein is predetermined by Pex19p during or immediately after the translation step. Data suggesting the existence of a cargo-induced peroxisomal targeting mechanism for Pex19p are also provided. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured as described (26Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). After transfer to coverslips, the cells were transiently transfected by employing the Magnetofection transfection technology (OZ Biosciences) or Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) and processed for immunofluorescence as described (34Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The peroxisomal localization of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins was assessed by co-localization studies with Pex14p. Fluorescence was observed under a Leica DMR microscope equipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate/RSGFP/Bodipy/Fluo3/DIO and Texas Red filters. The membrane topologies of the GFP fusion proteins containing a c-Myc epitope were determined by indirect immunofluorescence analysis using anti-GFP or anti-c-Myc antibodies in the presence of streptolysin O or Triton X-100, as described (35Wendland M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Vitro Import Experiments—Rat liver PNS were prepared as described before (36Gouveia A.M. Guimaraes C.P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in SEM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.4, 2 μg/ml N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide). Import reactions containing 450 μg (protein) of rat liver PNS were performed at 37 °C (unless indicated otherwise) in 100 μl of import buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (w/v) lipid-free bovine serum albumin, 80 μm methionine, 2 μg/ml N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide) using 0.15-0.25 μl of a reticulocyte lysate containing the 35S-labeled reporter protein. Where indicated, nucleotides were added to 5 mm (ATP or ATPγS) or 0.5 mm (GTP and GTPγS) final concentrations. Treatment of reticulocyte lysates and PNS fractions with apyrase (20 units/ml; grade VII; Sigma) was performed in import buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. Control reactions with heat-inactivated apyrase (10 min at 95 °C) were treated in the same way. In antibody inhibition experiments, purified IgGs (8 μg) in SEM buffer were added to PNS fractions in import buffer and incubated for 20 min on ice before starting the import reaction with the 35S-labeled reporter protein. Proteinase K treatment (400 μg/ml final concentration) of import reactions in the absence or presence of detergents (1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate), sedimentation of organelles by centrifugation, treatment of organelle pellets with Na2CO3, pH 11.5 (37Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), or with solutions of high and low ionic strengths, protein precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and SDS-PAGE analysis were done exactly as described before (38Gouveia A.M.

Routinely, the gels were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, exposed to an x-ray film, and afterward probed with several antibodies. In the density gradient centrifugation analysis of import reactions, a 4-fold scale-up of the standard import reaction was used. After proteinase K treatment, the complete import mixture was diluted to 1.5 ml with SEM and applied onto the top of step Nycodenz gradients (1.5 ml of 45% (w/v), 6 ml of 30% (w/v), 2 ml of 25% (w/v), and 2 ml of 20% (w/v) Nycodenz in 5 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.2). The tubes were centrifuged in a vertical rotor (STEPSAVER™ 65V13; Sorvall®) at 48,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. Fourteen equal fractions (∼920 μl) were collected from the bottom of the gradient, and a 250-μl aliquot of each fraction was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and SDS-PAGE. All of the in vitro import experiments reported in this work were performed at least five times. Construction of Plasmids Encoding the Reporter Peroxisomal Membrane Protein—To construct an expression plasmid encoding a fusion protein comprising (from the N to the C terminus) GFP, a linker of 12 amino acids (SGLRSRAQASNS), amino acid residues 1-175 of human PMP24 (33Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M. Eckerskorn C. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Biochim. Biophys.

The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and BglII and inserted into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), yielding pMP13. This plasmid was digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated to a DNA fragment obtained by annealing the primers 5′-GATCATGGGACAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTGGAGCAGAAACTCATCTCTGAAGAAGATCTGGAACAAAAGTTGATTTCAGAAGAAGATCTG-3′ and 5′-TCGACAGATCTTCTTCTGAAATCAACTTTTGTTCCAGATCTTCTTCAGAGATGAGTTTCTGCTCCAGGTCCTCCTCTGAGATCAGCTTCTGTCCCAT-3′ (encoding the c-Myc epitopes). This plasmid (pMP15), encoding the desired PMP24-fusion protein, was used in the transfection experiments. In order to obtain a pGEM-4-based plasmid capable of expressing this reporter protein upon in vitro transcription/translation reactions, pMP15 was subjected to PCR using the forward primer 5′-GCGCGCGTCGACCACCATGGTGAGCAAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCCCCCCGGGCTACAGATCTTCTTCTGAAATC-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with SalI and XmaI and subcloned into the SalI/XmaI-digested pGEM-4 vector (Promega), originating pMP17. This plasmid was also used in a PCR with the primers 5′-AGTCAGTGAGCGAGGAAGCGGAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CGCCACGCCTAAGAATTCGAAGCTTGAG-3′ in order to produce a DNA fragment encoding GFP plus the linker of 12 amino acids (see above) preceded by the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The plasmids encoding His6-HsPex19p (pMF119) and His6-HsPex19p-(31-299) (pTW151) are described elsewhere (26Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To generate a bacterial expression construct coding for His6-HsPex19p-(1-124) (pMF956), the corresponding cDNA was amplified by PCR (template pMF119; forward primer, 5′-GCATGCCATGGCCTGGGGAATGGCCGCCGCTGAGGAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAGAGGGCGGCCGCTCATTCTTGTTGGGAGGTCAT-3′), digested with NcoI and NotI, and cloned into the NcoI/NotI-digested pETM11 vector (kindly provided by Dr. G. Stier, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). His6-HsPex19p, His6-HsPex19p-(1-124), and His6-HsPex19p-(31-299) were expressed in the M15, BL21 (DE3), and TOP10 strains of Escherichia coli, respectively. One hundred-ml cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (for His6-HsPex19p and His6-HsPex19p-(1-124)) or 2% (w/v) l-arabinose (for His6-HsPex19p-(31-299)) for 3 h at 37 °C. Pelleted cells were cooled on ice and lysed by sonication in 1.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:500 (v/v) mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 10,000 × g), and the clarified supernatant was incubated with 100 μl (bed volume) of HIS-Select™ nickel affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Thegel was washed three times with 1.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and the His6-tagged proteins were eluted by washing the beads three times with 200 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were concentrated to ∼100 μl using a Vivaspin 10,000 molecular weight cut-off PES concentrator (Vivascience), diluted to 600 μl with SEM, 1 mm DTT, and concentrated again. This procedure was repeated three times. The recombinant proteins were further purified by anionic exchange chromatography using 1-ml Econo-Pac® high capacity ion exchange cartridges (Bio-Rad) and a linear gradient of 25-500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the purified proteins were pooled and subjected to five cycles of concentration/dilution with SEM supplemented with 1 mm DTT using the Vivaspin columns. The proteins (5-10 mg/ml) were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -70 °C. To generate a bacterial expression construct coding for His6-TEV-HsPex3p-(34-373) (pMF1259), the corresponding cDNA was amplified by PCR using pMF158 (26Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P.

The DNA fragment was digested with NcoI and KpnI and cloned into the NcoI/KpnI-digested pETM11 vector. Expression of His6-TEV-HsPex3p-(34-373) was done in the BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain as described (20Shibata H. Kashiwayama Y. Imanaka T. Kato H. J. Biol.

The 1.1-kilobase pair cDNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The recombinant plasmid was digested with EcoRI and SalI, and the insert was cloned into the expression vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). The human Pex3p fused to the maltose-binding protein was expressed in the TB1 strain of E. coli and obtained as inclusion bodies. The same strategy was used to obtain a cDNA encoding human Pex16p (12South S.T. Gould S.J. J.

The human Pex16p fused to the glutathione S-transferase was expressed in the XL1 strain of E. coli and obtained as inclusion bodies. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—The recombinant proteins were incubated in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature. After the addition of 2 μl of 0.17% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50% (w/v) sucrose, the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min and loaded onto Tris nondenaturating discontinuous 9 or 10% polyacrylamide gels (40Gallager S.R.

The goal of the present study was to determine whether forkhead (FKHR) also plays a positive role in agonist-mediated gene induction. Human coronary artery ECs were transduced with adenovirus overexpressing constitutively active phosphorylation-resistant triple mutant FKHR or transfected with small interference RNA (siRNA) against FKHR. The cells were then treated in the absence or presence of VEGF and assayed for gene expression using quantitative real-time PCR and Northern blots analyses. The data revealed a novel set of VEGF-responsive genes that require FKHR activity for optimal expression in ECs, including bone morphogenic protein 2, cbp/p300-interacting transactivator 2, decay accelerating factor (DAF), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), manganese superoxide dismutase, endothelial-specific molecule-1, RING1 and YY1-binding protein, and matrix metalloproteinase-10. Consistent with a positive role for FKHR in mediating VEGF induction of DAF and VCAM-1 mRNA, siRNA against FKHR attenuated the effect of VEGF on complement-mediated EC lysis and monocyte adhesion, respectively. VEGF induction of the forkhead-dependent genes was down-regulated by the NF-κB inhibitor, constitutively active Ad-IκB, and in some cases by the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) inhibitor, cyclosporin. Together, these findings suggest that the VEGF-forkhead signaling axis plays an important functional role in ECs beyond the regulation of cell survival/apoptosis and cell cycle.

The mammalian members of the winged helix, or forkhead, transcription factors include FKHR (Foxo1), FKHRL1 (Foxo3a), and AFX (Foxo4). Forkhead transcriptional activity is coupled to three principal functions: growth inhibition, apoptosis, and regulation of metabolism. In non-endothelial cells, forkhead-mediated effects on cell growth and survival have been shown to be governed by cell type-specific induction of cell-cycle arrest and/or pro-apoptotic genes, including kinase inhibitor protein p27 (p27kip1), growth arrest and DNA damage 45A (GADD45A), B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1), Fas ligand, and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 interacting member (20Brunet A.

According to this model, growth factor-mediated inactivation of forkhead and secondary inhibition of the forkhead-responsive genes is a prerequisite for cell proliferation and metabolism. Consistent with this paradigm, we have recently demonstrated that VEGF signaling in ECs results in PI3K-Akt-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of forkhead transcription factors, with subsequent down-regulation of the forkhead target gene, p27kip1, increased cell proliferation, and decreased apoptosis (19Abid M.R.

In contrast to non-ECs, where insulin suppresses Mn-SOD levels via a PI3K-Akt-forkhead-dependent signaling pathway (27Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), VEGF was shown to induce expression of Mn-SOD in ECs (37Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A positive role for forkhead in this pathway was evidenced by the observation that VEGF-mediated induction of Mn-SOD was enhanced by inhibition of PI3K or Akt or by overexpression of TM-FKHRL1 (38Abid M.R.

According to the classic view of forkhead as a pro-apoptotic and cell-cycle arrest gene, its deletion in mice might predict for increased cell survival and growth. However, mice that are null for FKHR demonstrate impaired vascular development and embryonic lethality (39Hosaka T. Biggs W.H. Tieu 3rd, D. Boyer A.D. Varki N.M. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl.

Moreover, ECs derived from FKHR-/- embryonic stem cells demonstrated an abnormal morphological response to VEGF (40Furuyama T. Kitayama K. Shimoda Y. Ogawa M. Sone K. Yoshida-Araki K. Hisatsune H.

Finally, siRNA-mediated inhibition of FKHR in serum-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in altered expression of angiogenesis-related genes (41Potente M. Urbich C. Sasaki K.I.

Together with our findings that forkhead proteins are involved in mediating VEGF induction of the antioxidant Mn-SOD (38Abid M.R. Schoots I.G. Spokes K.C. Wu S.Q. Mawhinney C. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44030-44038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the VEGF-forkhead signaling axis plays an important role in vascular biology, over and above its ability to inhibit pro-apoptotic/cell-cycle arrest genes. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of a subset of VEGF-responsive genes whose expression is both dependent on and modulated by forkhead activity in ECs. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human coronary artery ECs (HCAECs) were from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and grown in endothelial growth medium-2-MV (EGM-2) BulletKit (Clonetics) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. ECs from passage 3 to 6 were used for all experiments. Cells were serum-starved in 0.5% fetal bovine serum prior to treatment with 50 ng/ml human VEGF165 (Pepro Tech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Where indicated, cells were preincubated for 30 min with 50 μl LY294002 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The anti-endoglin (CD105) monoclonal antibody (IgG2a) was from Covance (Berkley, CA). Cyclosporin A was from Calbiochem. Adenoviruses—HCAECs were transduced with replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding the cDNAs of β-galactosidase (Adv), wild-type (WT)-FKHR, and triple mutant (TM)-FKHR as previously described (42Bilbao G. Contreras J.L. Zhang H.G. Pike M.J. Overturf K. Mikheeva G. Krasnykh V. Curiel D.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6992-7000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The triple mutant version of FKHR contains T24A, S256A, and S319A and is resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation. Adenovirus expressing constitutively active IκB was a generous gift from Chritiane Ferran of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. siRNA-mediated Inhibition of Endogenous FKHR—HCAECs were grown to 70-80% confluency in 6-cm plates and transfected with siRNA against one of the following FKHR target sequences: siFKHR1, ATG GAG GTA TGA GTC AGT ATA, and siFKHR2, CAG CGC CGA CTT CAT GAG CAA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in Opti-MEM containing Lipofectin (10 μg/ml) for 4 h. The cells were then incubated in EGM-2 medium for 24 h and serum-starved in 0.5% serum for 12-16 h before VEGF treatment for the times indicated. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit with DNaseI treatment following the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). To generate cDNA, total RNA (100 ng) from each of triplicate samples was mixed and converted into cDNA using random primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). All cDNA samples were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Primers were designed using the Primer Express oligonucleotide design software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). All primer sets were subjected to rigorous data base searches to identify potential conflicting transcript matches to pseudogenes or homologous domains within related genes. Amplicons generated from the primer set were analyzed for melting point temperatures using the first derivative primer melting curve software supplied by Applied Biosystems. The sequences of the real-time PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. The SYBR Green I assay and the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System were used for detecting real-time PCR products from the reverse-transcribed cDNA samples, as previously described (43Shih S.C. Robinson G.S. Perruzzi C.A. Calvo A. Desai K. Green J.E. Ali I.U. Smith L.E. Senger D.R. Am. J.

The phosphospecific antibodies against Ser-256 FKHR and Ser-473 Akt were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and anti-β-actin was from Sigma. Anti-Akt and anti-FKHR antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. Anti-HA antibody was from BD Biosciences. RNA extraction and Northern blot assays were performed as described previously (37Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization Studies—These studies were carried out in HCAECs grown onto four-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Christchurch, New Zealand) and treated with or without VEGF for the times indicated. Subcellular localization of FKHR was determined using a primary anti-FKHR antibody and a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (19Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C. Walsh K. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses were carried out by counting 200 cells per time point. Complement-mediated Cell Lysis Assay—HCAECs were plated in 24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h prior to adenoviral transduction or 24 h prior to siRNA transfection. The cells were serum-starved overnight and incubated with or without VEGF for 24 h. Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (7 μl, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) were added to HCAECs monolayer for 30 min. Following washing with serum-starvation medium containing 1% BSA, 250 μl of monoclonal anti-endoglin (CD105) antibody (IgG2a) was added to opsonize HCAECs for 30 min. HCAECs were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% BSA and 250 μl of 5% to 20% baby rabbit complement (Serotec, Oxford, UK) was added. HCAECs were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatant from each well was transferred to a 96-well micro-titer plate. The remaining HCAECs in the 24-well plate were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 1% BSA, and the calcein remaining in the cells was released by incubation with 250 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). The lysate was then transferred to another 96-well plate, the calcein was released by complement, and detergent was estimated using a fluorescence plate reader (model 680, Bio-Rad). Percent specific lysis in triplicate wells was calculated as [(complement-mediated release - spontaneous release)/(maximal release - spontaneous release)] × 100%, where maximal release equals complement-mediated release plus detergent-mediated release. Monocyte Adhesion Assay—HCAECs transduced with adenovirus (m.o.i. = 5) or transfected with 75 nm siRNAs were seeded on 24-well tissue culture plate. After grown to confluence, HCAECs were serum-starved in EBM-2 containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h, and treated with 50 ng/ml VEGF for 6 h. U937 cells were labeled with red fluorescent dye using PKH-26 staining kit (Sigma), which were added to the HCAECs-seeded 24-well plate with 3 × 105 cells/well. 90 min later, cells were washed twice with Hank's buffered saline (Invitrogen), and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The adhesion intensities were measured with MetaMorph (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) and cell image analyzer (Kurabo, Tokyo, Japan). Modulation of Intracellular Levels of FKHR in Primary ECs by Adenovirus and siRNA—To determine the role of forkhead in mediating VEGF signaling in ECs, HCAECs were transduced with adenoviruses (Ad) overexpressing β-galactosidase (Adv), wild-type (WT)-FKHR, or constitutively active, phosphorylation-resistant triple mutant (T24A,S256A,S315A) TM-FKHR. Alternatively, HCAECs were transfected with siRNA against FKHR to reduce endogenous FKHR levels. As shown in Fig. 1A, WT-FKHR but not TM-FKHR resulted in a significant increase in phospho-FKHR in untreated HCAECs. Both TM-FKHR and WT-FKHR (each of which carries an HA tag) resulted in detectable HA protein levels after 24 and 48 h of adenoviral transduction. On the contrary, FKHR siRNA resulted in significant reduction of FKHR protein expression in HCAECs, with siFKHR2 demonstrating the greatest effect (>85% reduction) (Fig. 1B). Thus, Ad and siRNA are effective in increasing and decreasing intracellular FKHR levels in ECs, respectively. Forkhead Differentially Modulates VEGF-responsive Genes in Primary ECs—We initially employed DNA microarrays to assay for the effect of PI3K inhibition and/or TM-FKHRL1 on VEGF-mediated gene expression in HCAECs. We used these data as a guide to identify two classes of genes: 1) classic VEGF-repressible, forkhead-responsive transcripts, and 2) novel VEGF-inducible, forkhead-responsive genes. Recognizing the primary importance of FKHR in ECs (39Hosaka T. Biggs W.H. Tieu 3rd, D. Boyer A.D. Varki N.M. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HCAECs were transduced with Adv- or TM-FKHR, or transfected with FKHR siRNA, treated in the absence or presence of VEGF and then assayed for candidate genes by reverse transcription-PCR. Table 1 shows the list of the primers used for the genes that were tested by reverse transcription-PCR. In keeping with the results of our DNA microarray studies, two distinct patterns of response were noted (Table 2). One group of genes, including BTG-1, GADD45A, and p27kip1, demonstrated the usual forkhead response pattern observed in non-ECs, namely agonist (VEGF)-mediated inhibition of expression, TM-FKHR-mediated induction of mRNA, and FKHR siRNA-mediated repression of basal mRNA levels.TABLE 2Induction (-fold) or reduction of the genes in endothelial cells by RT-PCR analysesVEGFTM-FKTM-FK+VEsiFKsiFK+VEFKHREaNumber of FKHR consensus elements (FKHREs) in upstream promoter.FunctionClass 1BTG-10.7 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.20.65 ± 0.10.73 ± 0.084Cell cycleGADD45A0.6 ± 0.062 ± 0.032.6 ± 0.050.5 ± 0.090.6 ± 0.071Cell cycleP27kip10.7 ± 0.082 ± 0.062.7 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.12Cell cycleClass IIBMP23.2 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.6bp < 0.01 relative to TM-FK.0.6 ± 0.1cp < 0.001 relative to basal level.0.8 ± 0.051AngiogenesisDAF2 ± 0.14.6 ± 0.35.9 ± 0.9dp < 0.05 relative to TM-FK.0.6 ± 0.2cp < 0.001 relative to basal level.1 ± 0.32Complement inhibitionCITED22.4 ± 0.32.8 ± 0.45.2 ± 0.05bp < 0.01 relative to TM-FK.0.8 ± 0.02ep < 0.05 relative to uninduced/basal level.1.2 ± 0.11Cardiac developmentESM-12.2 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.24 ± 0.4bp < 0.01 relative to TM-FK.0.15 ± 0.06cp < 0.001 relative to basal level.0.4 ± 0.09fp < 0.05 relative to siFK.2AngiogenesisMnSOD2.1 ± 0.62.4 ± 0.674.2 ± 0.9bp < 0.01 relative to TM-FK.0.7 ± 0.2bp < 0.01 relative to TM-FK.1 ± 0.061Redox regulationMGC56182 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.64.1 ± 0.7bp < 0.01 relative to TM-FK.0.6 ± 0.08cp < 0.001 relative to basal level.0.8 ± 0.91UnknownMMP102.8 ± 0.0417.3 ± 0.922.9 ± 1.5dp < 0.05 relative to TM-FK.1.2 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.21Matrix remodelingVCAM-116.3 ± 0.26.7 ± 0.319 ± 0.8bp < 0.01 relative to TM-FK.1.3 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.2fp < 0.05 relative to siFK.2Cell adhesionRYBP2 ± 0.041.2 ± 0.032.8 ± 0.09dp < 0.05 relative to TM-FK.1 ± 0.11 ± 0.051Neural developmenta Number of FKHR consensus elements (FKHREs) in upstream promoter.b p < 0.01 relative to TM-FK.c p < 0.001 relative to basal level.d p < 0.05 relative to TM-FK.e p < 0.05 relative to uninduced/basal level.f p < 0.05 relative to siFK. Open table in a new tab A second group of genes was induced both by VEGF and TM-FKHR and super-induced by VEGF plus TM-FKHR (Table 2). VEGF-mediated induction of this novel group was blocked by FKHR siRNA, suggesting that VEGF requires FKHR for their optimal expression. These genes include bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), cbp/p300-interacting transactivator 2 (CITED2), decay accelerating factor (DAF), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), endothelial specific molecule-1 (ESM-1, also known as endocan), RING1 and YY1 binding protein, matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10), and MGC5618. For purposes of discussion, we will refer to the first (classic) group as Class I, and the second (novel) group as Class II. VEGF Inhibits Expression of Class I Genes in Primary ECs via an FKHR-dependent Mechanism—To further characterize the Class I genes, we focused on the expression patterns of GADD45A and BTG1 in ECs. HCAECs were pretreated in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, or transduced with adenovirus overexpressing β-galactosidase (Adv), constitutively active phosphorylation-resistant triple mutant FKHR (TM-FKHR) or wild-type FKHR, and then treated with VEGF or vehicle for varying time points. Cells were harvested for RNA and assayed for gene expression using Northern blot analyses. VEGF resulted in a decrease in the expression of GADD45A and BTG1 (Fig. 2, A and B). We have previousl"
https://openalex.org/W2023040861,"Inactivation of presynaptic Ca(V)2.2 channels may play a role in regulating short-term synaptic plasticity. Here, we report a direct modulation of Ca(V)2.2 channel inactivation properties by 14-3-3, a family of signaling proteins involved in a wide range of biological processes. The structural elements critical for 14-3-3 binding and channel modulation lie in the carboxyl tail of the pore-forming alpha(1B) subunit, where we have identified two putative 14-3-3 interaction sites, including a phosphoserine-containing motif that directly binds to 14-3-3 and a second region near the EF hand and IQ domain. In transfected tsA 201 cells, 14-3-3 coexpression dramatically slows open-state inactivation and reduces cumulative inactivation of Ca(V)2.2 channels. In hippocampal neurons, interference with 14-3-3 binding accelerates Ca(V)2.2 channel inactivation and enhances short-term synaptic depression. These results demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins are important regulators of Ca(V)2.2 channel activities and through this mechanism may contribute to their regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1965453347,"Vertebrate oocytes awaiting fertilization are arrested at metaphase of meiosis II by cytostatic factor (CSF). This arrest is due to inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, in part by a newly identified protein, Emi2 (xErp1). Emi2 is required for maintenance of CSF arrest in egg extracts, but its function in CSF establishment in oocytes and the normal embryonic cell cycle is unknown. Here we show that during oocyte maturation, Emi2 appears only after metaphase I, and its level peaks at CSF arrest (metaphase II). In M phase, Emi2 undergoes a phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic shift. Microinjection of antisense oligonucleotides against Emi2 into stage VI oocytes blocks progression through meiosis II and the establishment of CSF arrest. Recombinant Emi2 rescues CSF arrest in these oocytes and also causes CSF arrest in egg extracts and in blastomeres of two-cell embryos. Fertilization triggers rapid, complete degradation of Emi2, but it is resynthesized in the first embryonic cell cycle to reach levels 5-fold lower than during CSF arrest. However, depletion of the protein from cycling egg extracts does not prevent mitotic cell cycle progression. Thus, Emi2 plays an essential role in meiotic but not mitotic cell cycles.

Fully grown, immature vertebrate oocytes progress from the G2/M border of meiosis I to a fertilizable gamete arrested at metaphase of meiosis II (M II). 3The abbreviations used are: M II, meiosis II; oligo, oligonucleotide; CSF, cytostatic factor; APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; PG, progesterone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MI, metaphase of meiosis I. This process is called oocyte maturation, and in Xenopus, its molecular mechanism has been under study for over 30 years. Masui and Markert (1Masui Y. Markert C.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar) microinjected cytoplasm from a mature oocyte (unfertilized egg) into embryonic blastomeres and found that injected blastomeres underwent cleavage arrest at the next mitosis; this was later shown to be cytologically equivalent to M II. They hypothesized that a specific factor from the cytoplasm was responsible for the inhibition of mitosis and cleavage and named this cytoplasmic activity “cytostatic factor” (CSF). This activity is presumed to be responsible for M II arrest in the mature oocyte, and the arrest of eggs at M II has been accordingly termed CSF arrest. Recent studies have suggested that CSF arrest is due to the inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) composed of at least nine subunits. It promotes the 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation of M phase regulators by ubiquitinating target proteins in cooperation with a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) (2Peters J.M.

APC/C activity is evident only in M phase, and the inhibition of its activity through several pathways, including the Mos-MAPK pathway, the cyclin E/Cdk2 pathway, and the Emi2 pathway, seems to contribute to CSF arrest (5Schmidt A. Rauh N.R. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Tunquist B.J. Maller J.L.

These pathways can be studied independently of each other, but whether there is interaction between the pathways is currently unknown. Although the exact mechanism remains elusive, studies have shown that the inhibition of APC/C activity by the Mos-MAPK pathway during CSF arrest requires the spindle checkpoint proteins Bub1, Mad1, and Mad2 (reviewed in Refs. 5Schmidt A. Rauh N.R. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 6Tunquist B.J. Maller J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 683-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Less is known about the mechanism of cyclin E/Cdk2-mediated APC/C inhibition during CSF arrest. Cyclin E/Cdk2 is present at a very low level in resting oocytes but increases dramatically in meiosis II (10Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the APC/C by cyclin E/Cdk2 appears to involve the spindle checkpoint kinase Mps1, whose accumulation is promoted by cyclin E/Cdk2 (11Grimison B. Liu J. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1968-1973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Inactivation of cyclin E/Cdk2 is required for release of CSF arrest, but in the absence of the Mos-MAPK pathway, active cyclin E/Cdk2 is unable to maintain M phase through the meiosis I-meiosis II transition. In vivo, antisense ablation of cyclin E does not block progression to M II, and thus, this complex may not be required for CSF arrest (11Grimison B. Liu J. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The third known pathway of CSF arrest involves the early mitotic inhibitor (Emi) family of proteins. Emi1 is an F-box protein previously proposed as an APC/C inhibitor able to bind Cdc20 and inhibit the activity of the APC/C to cause a CSF-like arrest (13Reimann J.D. Freed E. Hsu J.Y. Kramer E.R. Peters J.M. Jackson P.K. Cell. 2001; 105: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of Emi1 was reported to cause spontaneous CSF release (13Reimann J.D. Freed E. Hsu J.Y. Kramer E.R. Peters J.M. Jackson P.K.

In addition, M phase arrest mediated by Emi1 is not affected by calcium, making it an unlikely APC/C regulator during CSF arrest. Antibodies to Emi1 used in early studies were later shown to cross-react with a related protein, termed xErp1 or Emi2 (22Tung J.J. Hansen D.V. Ban K.H. Loktev A.V. Summers M.K. Adler III, J.R. Jackson P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Emi2 is a F-Box protein identified in a two-hybrid screen for interaction with the polo-like kinase Plx1 (23Schmidt A. Duncan P.I. Rauh N.R. Sauer G. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Emi2 has been shown to be required to maintain CSF arrest once it has been established, and immunodepletion of this protein from CSF-arrested Xenopus egg extracts causes spontaneous CSF release (23Schmidt A. Duncan P.I. Rauh N.R. Sauer G. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); suppression of the mammalian homolog also leads to meiotic exit in maturing mouse oocytes (24Shoji S. Yoshida N. Amanai M. Ohgishi M. Fukui T. Fujimoto S. Nakano Y. Kajikawa E. Perry A.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 834-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The maintenance of CSF arrest thus requires Emi2-mediated APC/C inhibition, and several laboratories have recently delineated a signal transduction pathway at fertilization that leads to the degradation of Emi2 and exit from M II arrest (7Liu J. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1458-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Rauh N.R. Schmidt A. Bormann J. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U.

A. 2006; 103: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It was found in CSF-arrested egg extracts that the addition of calcium, which simulates the transient increase in calcium level at fertilization, activates CaMK II, which then phosphorylates Emi2 at a specific site to generate a docking site for the polo-like kinase Plx1, which in turn phosphorylates Emi2 at sites that promote its degradation by the SCF ubiquitination pathway. These studies have unraveled the mechanism of calcium-dependent release of APC/C inhibition by Emi2, but how arrest is initially established remains unknown. Since Emi2 itself is necessary to inhibit the APC/C activity and maintain arrest, what role does it play in the establishment of CSF arrest? These roles might well be different based on the precedent with Mos, a MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase kinase (MEKK) required to establish CSF arrest (5Schmidt A. Rauh N.R. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Tunquist B.J. Maller J.L.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1027-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The traditional criteria for identification of a CSF component include that it should appear in M II, cause cleavage arrest when expressed in blastomeres, and be limited to regulation of meiosis versus mitosis. This study focused on Emi2 and found that it first appears in M II and is required for the meiosis I-II transition and CSF establishment but that the lower levels evident in early embryonic mitotic cell cycles are not required for cell cycle progression. Constructs, Protein Purification, Antibodies, and Antisense Oligos—Xenopus Emi2 was cloned, expressed, and purified, and anti-Emi2 antibody was prepared as described previously (7Liu J. Maller J.L.

The Emi2 antisense oligo was made by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA), targeting the Emi2 coding sequence 1428–1446, and the control oligo was made by scrambling the sequence with the same content of A, C, G, and T. Oocyte Maturation and Microinjection—Oocytes were obtained by manual dissection of ovarian fragments as described previously (26Frank-Vaillant M. Jessus C. Ozon R. Maller J.L. Haccard O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected at germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) with either control or antisense oligos (40 nl of oligos/oocyte, 0.25 mm), and for rescue experiments, antisense oligos were co-injected with recombinant Emi2 (0.8 μg/ml) and incubated at 22 °C. Progesterone (PG) was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and oocytes were collected as indicated. Metaphase II oocytes were activated by the addition of calcium ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem) to the culture medium at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Fertilization of eggs in vitro was conducted as described previously (27Hartley R.S. Rempel R.E. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Preparation and Manipulation of Xenopus Cycling Extracts, Sperm Nuclear Morphology, and Immunoblotting—Samples of 1 μl were taken at the indicated times and mixed with 4 μl of fixation/stain buffer (48% glycerol, 11% formaldehyde, 1× MMR (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)), and 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and sperm nuclei morphology was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. One microliter of sample at each time point was mixed with 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and boiled for 5 min. For immunoblotting, 10 μl of each sample, equivalent to 0.5 μl of extract, was used. Proteins were detected with the antibodies described above and visualized by a Super-Signal West Dura detection kit (Pierce). Accumulation of Emi2 in Meiotic and Mitotic Cell Cycles—In Xenopus metaphase egg extracts, Emi2 is rapidly degraded upon the addition of calcium, which triggers release of CSF arrest (7Liu J. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1458-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Rauh N.R. Schmidt A. Bormann J. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U.

A. 2006; 103: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here we utilized Xenopus oocytes to study the expression of Emi2 before and after CSF arrest. G2-arrested Xenopus oocytes were cultured with PG to stimulate maturation. Once the oocytes reached M II (CSF arrest), the calcium ionophore A23187 was added to the medium to trigger activation and CSF release. As indicated morphologically by GVBD (data not shown) and the accumulation of cyclin B1 (Fig. 1A), the oocytes reached metaphase of meiosis I by 250 min and M II by 340 min after PG addition, with both cyclin B1 and cyclin B2, but not cyclin A1, present at a high level (Fig. 1A). The addition of calcium ionophore at 440 min triggered the oocytes to rapidly exit M II arrest, as evidenced by the degradation of cyclins, and all cyclins subsequently reaccumulated before the first mitosis of the activated eggs. An antibody was generated against an N-terminal fragment of Emi2, which has no sequence similarity with Emi1 and which did not recognize recombinant Emi1 (data not shown). Emi2 has been reported to be present at a low level in M I during oocyte maturation (23Schmidt A. Duncan P.I. Rauh N.R. Sauer G. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, in four independent experiments, we found that only a trace amount of Emi2 could be detected at early stages (in G2-arrested oocytes and before M I); significant accumulation started early in M II (340 min), and a maximal level was maintained until CSF release at 440 min (Fig. 1A). At M II, its electrophoretic mobility changes to a slower migrating, hyperphosphorylated form (Fig. 1). This result suggests an important role for Emi2 in CSF establishment. Upon the addition of calcium ionophore, Emi2 was rapidly degraded to an undetectable level, consistent with previous reports that Emi2 degradation is needed for anaphase and exit from CSF arrest (7Liu J. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1458-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Rauh N.R. Schmidt A. Bormann J. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U.

A. 2006; 103: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, Western blotting showed that Emi2 was resynthesized within 40 min in the first mitotic cell cycle. It is evident that at mitosis of the first embryonic cell cycle (500 min), Emi2 accumulates to a level only about 20% of that at CSF arrest (M II). Consistent with previous reports (7Liu J. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1458-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Rauh N.R. Schmidt A. Bormann J. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Nature. 2005; 437: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), Emi2 appeared in two forms: a faster migrating interphase form and a slower migrating mitotic form (Fig. 1), reflecting altered phosphorylation as judged by reversal of the shift by phosphatase treatment in vitro (data not shown). To further verify our findings in maturing oocytes, Xenopus eggs arrested at M II were fertilized to exit CSF arrest and initiate embryonic cell cycles, and changes in the level of cyclin B2 and Emi2 were monitored. As shown in Fig. 1B by cyclin B2 blotting, the embryos exited CSF arrest by 30 min after sperm addition and entered the first embryonic mitosis by 50 min; they cycled once every 40 min thereafter. Correspondingly, Emi2 was completely degraded by 30 min after sperm addition, resynthesized for the first embryonic mitosis at 50 min, and remained stable throughout subsequent cycles. It was evident that at each interphase (70 and 110 min), a significant fraction of Emi2 was dephosphorylated and down-shifted, a result consistent with Fig. 1A. Most interestingly, the level of Emi2 in embryonic cell cycles (Fig. 1B) is only about 20% of that in CSF-arrested eggs, as observed with ionophore-activated eggs in Fig. 1A. Emi2 Is Not Required for Mitotic Cell Cycles—Since the maintenance of CSF arrest requires Emi2-mediated APC/C inhibition (7Liu J. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1458-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Rauh N.R. Schmidt A. Bormann J. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Nature. 2005; 437: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and since Emi2 is resynthesized prior to the next embryonic mitosis after degradation upon CSF release (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that Emi2 might function as a mitotic APC/C inhibitor to allow cyclin accumulation and might therefore also be required for mitotic entry in embryonic cell cycles. To investigate this possibility, we immunodepleted endogenous Emi2 from Xenopus cycling egg extracts prepared 45 min after egg activation by calcium ionophore. These extracts are initially in interphase, and upon warming, can carry out multiple rounds of DNA synthesis and mitosis in vitro as monitored by nuclear morphology and cyclin synthesis and degradation. As shown in Fig. 2A, Emi2 was undetectable after immunodepletion and was not resynthesized in subsequent mitotic cell cycles within the time frame of the experiment (up to 165 min) (Fig. 2C, lower panel). However, it was noted in other experiments that small amounts of Emi2 are sometimes resynthesized after 165 min (data not shown). Emi2-depleted extracts accumulated somewhat lower levels of cyclins A1 and B2, and mitosis was slightly delayed when compared with mock-depleted extracts, but the cyclin B level was still sufficient to drive three extract cell cycles, as indicated by periodic synthesis and degradation of cyclins and changes in nuclear morphology (Fig. 2, B and C). Moreover, the largely normal synthesis and degradation of cyclin A1 in Emi2-depleted extracts suggests that unlike Emi1, a homolog of the Rca1 gene controlling cycling A levels in Drosophila, Emi2 has no primary function in regulating cyclin A. Another surprising finding was that Emi2 is not degraded in each mitotic cell cycle. The protein level produced in the first mitotic cycle remained constant throughout subsequent cell cycles; only its electrophoretic mobility changed from a fast migrating interphase form into a slower, more highly phosphorylated mitotic form (Fig. 2C, lower panel). This result suggests that the mitotic cell cycle does not require Emi2-mediated APC/C inhibition to achieve mitotic cyclin accumulation, and Emi2 appears dispensable for cell cycle progression. In contrast, depletion of Emi2 from a CSF extract is sufficient to cause CSF release in the absence of calcium, as reported previously (Fig. 2, D and E) (23Schmidt A. Duncan P.I. Rauh N.R. Sauer G. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These results support the hypothesis that regulation of the level of Emi2 in meiosis II plays a key role in the appearance of CSF activity. We determined the amount of endogenous Emi2 in 1 μl (equivalent to one egg) of either cycling or CSF extracts by comparison with serial dilutions of recombinant GST-Emi2 in Western blots. The concentration of Emi2 is about 2 and 10 ng/μl in cycling and CSF extracts, respectively (data not shown). We therefore predicted that increasing the amount of Emi2 in cycling extracts should cause arrest in mitosis. To investigate this possibility, we systematically increased the amount of recombinant GST-Emi2 added to cycling egg extracts and found that at a final concentration of 20 ng/μl, full-length recombinant Emi2 was able to cause metaphase arrest as judged by cyclin B levels and nuclear morphology (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas lower concentrations of full-length recombinant Emi2 (5, 10, and 15 ng/μl) did not have any effect on cycling (data not shown). These data strongly support the hypothesis that the elevation of Emi2 in meiosis II is a critical factor for ability to inhibit APC/C activity and contribute to CSF arrest. This concept is also supported by the observation that microinjection of this level of recombinant Emi2 into one blastomere of a two-cell Xenopus embryo causes cleavage arrest similar to that seen with Mos (Fig. 3C). At M I, Mos has already accumulated to high levels, MAPK is fully activated (28Roy L.M. Haccard O. Izumi T. Lattes B.G. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2203-2211PubMed Google Scholar), and the APC/C is partially inhibited by the Mos-MAPK pathway. This raises the question of whether continued APC/C inhibition by the Mos pathway is sufficient to support the M I-II transition and CSF arrest in the absence of Emi2. To examine this point, we microinjected antisense oligonucleotides against Emi2 into Xenopus oocytes at GVBD when neither cyclin E (10Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) nor Emi2 accumulation has begun (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 4, both buffer-injected and control oligo-injected oocytes showed normal morphology and normal cyclin B2 levels 4 h after the injection, whereas the antisense oligoinjected oocytes displayed a highly dispersed white spot, and all cyclin B had been degraded, indicating that the oocytes had exited meiotic M phase (28Roy L.M. Haccard O. Izumi T. Lattes B.G. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2203-2211PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Blotting of Emi2 showed that in both buffer-injected and control oligo-injected oocytes, Emi2 accumulated normally, whereas in antisense oligo-injected oocytes, Emi2 was not detectable (Fig. 4A, middle panel). To verify that the antisense oligos affected only Emi2, antisense oligos and recombinant Emi2 were co-injected into the oocytes shortly after GVBD. The oocytes co-injected with GST-Emi2 maintained normal morphology (Fig. 4A) and exhibited slightly elevated M phase cyclin B2 levels, confirming that the effects of the antisense oligos on cyclin B levels were specifically due to the absence of Emi2. Although partial cyclin degradation at the M I-II transition was blocked by GST-Emi2, the oocytes still progressed into meiosis II as judged by cyclin E synthesis, which only begins in meiosis II (Fig. 4, A and B) (10Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Taieb F.E. Gross S.D. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 508-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate a requirement for Emi2 for CSF arrest establishment in Xenopus oocytes. Similar results were obtained when the antisense oligos were injected before PG addition. In the current model of CSF arrest, there are at least two important issues that remained to be addressed. First, in meiosis I oocytes, the Mos-MEK1-MAPK-Rsk-Mad/Bub spindle checkpoint proteins, all known components of CSF activity, are present and active, yet metaphase arrest does not occur at this stage. Second, during the M I to II transition, the APC/C is able to degrade about 50–80% of the metaphase level of cyclin B in the presence of an active Mos/MAPK pathway (Fig. 4A) (21Tunquist B.J. Schwab M.S. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1027-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Roy L.M. Haccard O. Izumi T. Lattes B.G. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2203-2211PubMed Google Scholar). This reduced level of cyclin B is sufficient to suppress S-phase after anaphase I, but in meiosis II, cyclin B reaccumulates to metaphase levels due to both increased synthesis and decreased degradation (26Frank-Vaillant M. Jessus C. Ozon R. Maller J.L. Haccard O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Taieb F.E. Gross S.D. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 508-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A logical hypothesis is that an APC/C inhibitory activity, independent of the Mos/MAPK pathway, appears upon entry into M II and is required for full, persistent, APC/C inhibition to achieve the high cyclin B levels characteristic of CSF arrest. Previously, cyclin E/Cdk2 was thought to be a good candidate for this additional activity as its level increases dramatically prior to M II (10Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Furuno N. Ogawa Y. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and constitutively active cyclin E/Cdk2 exhibits APC/C inhibitory activity and blocks CSF release (11Grimison B. Liu J. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1968-1973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Tunquist B.J. Schwab M.S. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1221-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, other studies showed that ablation of cyclin E or Cdk2 did not block establishment of CSF arrest in vivo, and activated cyclin E/Cdk2 in the absence of Emi2 and the Mos-MAPK pathway was not sufficient to establish arrest (11Grimison B. Liu J. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1968-1973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Furuno N. Ogawa Y. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, another activity must be required for full APC/C inhibition, and based on our data, Emi2 appears to be a likely candidate for this activity. Like cyclin E/Cdk2, its level increases markedly in M II and remains high during the M II arrest (Fig. 1). Antisense oligos suppressed the synthesis of Emi2 and inhibited CSF establishment in oocytes (Fig. 4). Furthermore, injection of the Emi2 protein at GVBD blocked the effect of antisense oligos and also greatly reduced the partial degradation of cyclin B in the M I-II transition in the oocytes. Despite blocking partial APC/C activation after meiosis I, Emi2 antisense oligo-injected oocytes rescued by GST-Emi2 appear to progress into meiosis II as judged by synthesis of cyclin E, a specific marker of meiosis II (10Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with studies in which APC/C inactivation at GVBD by antisense ablation of Cdc20 did not block progression to meiosis II (30Taieb F.E. Gross S.D. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 508-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31Peter M. Castro A. Lorca T. Le Peuch C. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The results in this study support the hypothesis that the Mos/MAPK pathway and the cyclin E/Cdk2 pathway, together with Emi2, all contribute to full APC/C inhibition during CSF arrest (Fig. 5). Experimentally, APC/C inhibition by each of these three pathways can be studied under conditions where only one of the pathways is active. However, possible interactions or cross-talk between these APC/C inhibitory pathways remains an important area for future investigation. In contrast to its central role in meiosis II, Emi2 was not required for accumulation of sufficient cyclin B to drive entry into mitosis in egg extracts (Fig. 2). The unique nature of CSF arrest with up-regulation of Emi2 levels that are sensitive to calcium-induced degradation (7Liu J. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1458-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Rauh N.R. Schmidt A. Bormann J. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Nature. 2005; 437: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) suggests that Emi2 is of key importance only in meiotic cell cycles."

We have analyzed the underlying biochemical mechanism by carrying out alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the PKR activation domain of PACT. Among the indispensable residues identified were two serine residues, whose phosphorylation was essential for the cellular actions of PACT. Two-dimensional gel analysis, Western analysis using phosphoamino acid-specific antiserum, and in vivo 32P labeling of PACT demonstrated that constitutive phosphorylation of one of the two residues, Ser246, was required for stress-induced phosphorylation of the other, Ser287. Substitution of either of them by threonine or aspartic acid, but not alanine, was tolerated. Substitution of both residues with the phosphoserine mimetic, aspartic acid, produced a mutant PACT that, unlike the wild-type protein, caused PKR activation and apoptosis, even in unstressed cells. These results indicate that phosphorylation of specific serine residues in the activation domain of PACT is the major mode of transmission of cellular stress response to PKR.

PKR enzymatic activity is latent, and it needs to be activated by autophosphorylation. The classical activator of PKR is double-stranded (ds) RNA, a replicative intermediate for many viruses. The most studied cellular target of PKR is the translation initiation factor, eIF2α, whose phosphorylation results in an inhibition of protein synthesis. Although its antiviral activities are the most well known, PKR has been implicated in the transcriptional signal transduction pathways activated by specific cytokines, growth factors, dsRNA, and extracellular stresses (4Williams, B.

Optimal activation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), proteins known as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), as well as transcription factors such as NF-κB, IRF-1, p53, STAT1, ATF, STAT3, and AP-1, have each been shown to require PKR (5Chu W.M.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). dsRNA binding to PKR takes place at two dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBM) present at the N terminus of the protein (12Green S.R.

The same domain of PKR can also mediate dsRNA-independent protein-protein interactions with proteins containing similar domains (17Patel R.C. Stanton P. McMillan N.M. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8283-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One such protein is PACT, whose binding to PKR leads to the activation of PKR in the absence of dsRNA (18D'Acquisto, F., Ghosh, S., (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/89/re1Google Scholar, 19Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, PACT is a protein activator of PKR. PACT contains three identifiable domains of which domains 1 and 2 bind tightly to the N-terminal dimerization domain (DD) of PKR. On the other hand, domain 3, which, in vitro, can activate PKR by itself, binds, with low affinity, to a specific region in the kinase domain of PKR (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have recently identified the PACT binding motif (PBM) in this region of PKR (21Li S. Peters G.A. Ding K. Zhang X. Qin J. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10005-10010Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated intramolecular interaction between PBM and dsRBM2 of PKR. This interaction, as mediated by specific residues of the two partners, keeps PKR locked in the inactive conformation; its activation requires disruption of the interaction as a result of the binding of dsRNA to dsRBM2 or PACT domain 3 to PBM. As anticipated, point mutations of the residues of PKR, that mediate the intramolecular interaction, caused constitutive activation of the protein. In addition to its ability to activate PKR, PACT has other important physiological functions as well. This was most strikingly demonstrated by the developmental defects of Pact-/- mice that are not present in Pkr-/- mice (22Rowe T.M. Rizzi M. Hirose K. Peters G.A. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5823-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In cells, PACT-mediated activation of PKR leads to phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 and cellular apoptosis. In order for PACT to activate PKR in vivo, it requires in addition to its domain 3, either of the other two domains (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The function of the latter domain(s) is to either anchor the protein strongly to PKR or mediate PACT dimerization, so that the activation process can occur efficiently. In vivo, PKR is not activated by PACT, unless the cells are stressed. When cells are exposed to a variety of stresses such as, withdrawal of growth factors or treatment with a low dose of actinomycin D, arsenite, thapsigargin, or peroxide (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol.

For this purpose, we have used an experimental system of expressing a variety of PACT mutants in human HT1080 cells, which express little endogenous PACT. They undergo apoptosis, when functional exogenous PACT is expressed and extracellular stress is applied to them. We identified two serine residues in PACT domain 3, whose phosphorylation was essential for the cellular actions of PACT. Our results indicate that constitutive phosphorylation of one of these residues was required for stress-induced phosphorylation of the other, leading to strong association of PACT with PKR and its activation. Reagents, Cells, and Antibodies—Actinomycin D was obtained from Sigma. HT1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were done with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 antibody was from Sigma, anti-PKR monoclonal antibody was from Ribogene, anti-phospho-PKR (Thr451), anti-eIF2α, and anti-phospho-eIF2α were from Cell Signaling, anti-histidine antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-phosphothreonine antibody was from Biodesign International. PACT anti-domain 3 peptide antibody (770) (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Peters G.A. Khoo D. Mohr I. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11054-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was custom produced by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. Construction of PACT Mutants—The generation of PACT mammalian expression constructs was described previously (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Overlap extension PCR was used to construct all PACT mutants (27Pogulis R.J. Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Trower M.K. In Vitro Mutagenesis Protocols. 57. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 167-176Google Scholar). PACTΔ1 was used as a template to construct each mutant used for mammalian transfection, with the exception of S18A, S18D, S246A, and S287A, which used full-length PACT as the template. PCR fragments containing the desired PACT mutant were ligated into restriction enzyme-digested pcDNA3. A FLAG epitope tag was added at the N-terminal coding end of all PACT constructs. Apoptosis Assays—TUNEL: HT1080 cells growing on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes were cotransfected with pcDNA3-FLAG PACT or pcDNA3-FLAG PACT mutant. At 6 h after transfection, the cells were stressed by treatment with 40 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 and 50 ng/ml actinomycin D. Cells were fixed in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde 24 h after transfection. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the Dead End Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega) was performed using the manufacturer's protocol. After washing, cells were stained with primary anti-FLAG antibody and secondary anti-mouse IgG Texas Red conjugate (Molecular Probes) as described (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cells were mounted on glass slides in Vectashield with DAPI (4′-6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories), and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Quantitative Cell Survival Assay: HT1080 cells were cotransfected in 100-mm culture dishes with pcDNA3 vector or pcDNA3-PACT, and pEGFP-C1 in a 8:1 ratio using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). At 6 h after transfection, the cells were stressed and allowed to undergo cell killing. At 48 h after transfection, the medium containing dead cells was removed, and the plate washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The population of cells remaining was collected, and 20,000 cells were monitored for GFP expression using a flow cytometer. The nonspecific background was 4-7% from the loss of stressed GFP-expressing cells transfected with vector, and has been subtracted from all values presented in the figures and tables. Each value presented is an average of three independent experiments. Western Blotting for Phosphorylated and Unphosphorylated PACT, PKR, and eIF2α—HT1080 cells were transfected with FLAG-PACT or its mutants using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. At 23 h after transfection, cells were stressed for 1 h where indicated. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 20% glycerol) on ice. The cell extract was used in Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody as described before (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the detection of phosphothreonine residues, the extract was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-PACT or its mutant with anti-FLAG (M2) agarose. The agarose beads were washed six times with RIPA buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG or with a mixture of three monoclonal anti-phosphothreonine antibodies as described by the manufacturer (Biodesign International). For the detection of phosphorylated PKR or phosphorylated eIF2α, at 47 h after transfection with PACT or mutant, cells were stressed for 1 h with 50 ng/ml actinomycin D when indicated. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer and extracts Western-blotted with anti-phospho-PKR, anti-PKR, anti-phospho-eIF2α, anti-eIF2α, or anti-FLAG (M2) antibody. Two-dimensional Gel Analysis—HT1080 cells were transfected with 5 μg of expression vector containing FLAG-PACT or its mutant using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). At 6-h post-transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline once and incubated with fresh complete medium for an additional 18 h. The cells were lysed with 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton 100, 1 mm EDTA, 100 units of aprotinin per ml, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate), and PACT-immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. FLAG-PACT was eluted from the gel by adding 125 μl of rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% IPG buffer 3/10). IPG strips (7 cm, pH 3-10; Amersham Biosciences) were rehydrated with rehydration buffer containing FLAG-PACT for 12 h before running isoelectric focusing (IEF). The IEF electrophoresis was performed with an IPGphor™ Isoelectric Focusing System (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instruction manual. The focusing time was 40,000 vhr. After focusing, the strips were laid on top of SDS-polyacrylamide gels for second-dimension separation. FLAG-PACT was examined by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. For alkaline phosphatase (calf intestine) (CIP, Invitrogen) treatment, after washing four times with cell lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitate was washed once with 1× phosphatase buffer, divided into two 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and incubated in 100 μl of phosphatase buffer with or without 10 units of CIP at 37 °C for 1 h. After the CIP treatment, the immunoprecipitate was washed twice with cell lysis buffer and subjected to IEF electrophoresis as indicated above. In Vivo Phosphate Labeling—HT1080 cells were transfected in 100-mm culture dishes with 5 μg of FLAG-tagged PACT or PACT mutant DNA. At 24 h after transfection, cells were passaged at a 1:10 dilution into fresh growth medium. At 48 h after transfection, media was replaced with complete medium containing 800 μg/ml G418, and selection pressure applied for a minimum of 3 weeks. A pool of PACT-expressing cells was metabolically labeled with 1000 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2.5 h in phosphate-free medium. Cells were stressed for the last 30 min where indicated. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen, and cell extracts prepared using modified RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X 100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). For the detection of phosphorylated PACT, the extract was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-PACT or its mutant with anti-FLAG (M2) agarose. The agarose beads were washed six times with RIPA buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—HT1080 cells were transfected in 100-mm culture dishes with 10 μg of total DNA (5 μg of PKR (K296R) DNA and 5 μg of FLAG-PACT or mutant DNA) using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). At 23 h after transfection, cells were stressed. At 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 2 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol). The cell extract was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-PACT with anti-FLAG (M2) agarose as described (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), washing the beads six times with IP buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PKR polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) (26Peters G.A. Khoo D. Mohr I. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11054-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Essential Residues in PACT Domain 3—Our previous study (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) has established that domain 3 of PACT is essential for activating PKR (Fig. 1A). For exerting its action in vivo, this domain needs to be attached to another domain of PACT or a heterologous domain that interacts with PKR strongly. We wanted to identify the residues within domain 3 that are required for PACT activity. For this purpose, progressive deletions of ten residues were introduced from the N terminus or the C terminus of domain 3 (Fig. 1B). PACT proteins carrying these mutations were expressed in cells that were stressed by treatment with a low dose of actinomycin D, and apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assays. PACT expression and TUNEL positivity of each cell was determined by double immunofluorescence assay as described before (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Peters G.A. Khoo D. Mohr I. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11054-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Deletion of ten residues from the C terminus of domain 3 (mutant C1) was tolerated, but removal of another ten residues (mutant C2) destroyed the activity. In contrast, even the first ten residues from the N terminus (mutant N1) could not be removed without losing activity (Fig. 1C). The wild-type and the mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1D). Thus, residues 240-295 of domain 3 were necessary for the apoptotic activity of PACT. To identify the essential residues within the above region, we carried out alanine scanning mutagenesis using a quantitative cell survival assay. In this assay, a GFP expression vector was co-transfected with PACT or its mutants so that the transfected cells could be identified by GFP expression. After stressing by a very low dose of actinomycin D treatment, the wild-type PACT-expressing cells started undergoing apoptosis and massive cell death was obvious as dead cells floated off the monolayers. For quantifying the survival index of transfected cells expressing GFP and different PACT proteins, cells still attached to the plate were removed from each plate, and the same number of cells analyzed by FACS for GFP expression. In this quantitative assay, almost no GFP-expressing stressed cells survived when wild-type PACT was co-expressed (Fig. 2A). The point mutants carrying substitution of a single residue with alanine had different properties: most of them were as active as the wild-type protein, whereas ten mutants lost their activity almost completely. The inactive mutants were Q243A, S246A, D260A, D262A, S265A, Q271A, S279A, S287A, G288A, and C291A. In addition, a few mutants had intermediate activities; these residues were located very close to the essential residues. The ten inactive mutant proteins were expressed at the same level as the wild type or an active mutant (244) protein (Fig. 2B). We confirmed that the active PACT mutant protein-expressing cells were undergoing apoptosis by performing TUNEL assays with selected mutants. Cells expressing the active L244A mutant protein were TUNEL-positive, whereas those expressing the S246A or the S287A proteins were TUNEL-negative (Fig. 2C). Because we are interested in the mechanism of PACT activation by its stress-induced phosphorylation, we focused our attention to those residues in domain 3 that can potentially be phosphorylated and whose replacement by Ala produced inactive PACT mutants. There were four such mutants: Ser246, Ser265, Ser279, and Ser287 (Fig. 2A). In an in vitro binding assay for domain 3/PKR interaction, among the four mutants, mutant 287 bound PKR most strongly and mutant 246 did not bind at all (data not shown). We chose those two mutants for further studies, because they represented two different mechanistic classes. Like wild-type PACT, neither mutant caused PKR activation, as measured by its autophosphorylation, when expressed in HT1080 cells (Fig. 3). However, as expected, upon application of stress, there was strong phosphorylation of PKR in cells expressing wild type, but not mutant, PACT. Stress-activated Phosphorylation of PACT and Its Mutants—To investigate further the role of Ser246 and Ser287 in PACT function, we wondered whether these two residues are the targets of phosphorylation by cellular protein kinases. This notion was supported by the properties of two other mutants, S246T and S287T (Table 1). Although Ala was not tolerated in these sites, Thr was tolerated, partially for 246 and completely for 287, suggesting that Thr, another phosphorylatable residue, can substitute for Ser at these sites. Further support came from the observation that substitution of either Ser residue with the phosphoserine mimetic Asp was fully tolerated (Table 1).TABLE 1Survival of stressed cells expressing PACT mutants A quantitative cell survival assay was used to measure the survival of PACT or PACT mutant-transfected HT1080 cells by cotransfecting with a GFP expression vector (8:1) so that the transfected cells could be identified by GFP expression. After stressing, PACT/mutant-expressing cells that underwent apoptosis floated off the monolayers. Cells still attached to the plate were removed from each plate, and the same number of cells analyzed by FACS for GFP expression as a measure of cell survival. Each PACT mutant contained the strong PKR binding domain 2 and PKR activation domain 3, which are necessary for PKR activation in vivo.Mutations% Cell survivalWild type2Vector100S246A100S246T42S246D2S287A88S287T1S287D2S18A2 Open table in a new tab Evidence for phosphorylation of PACT on these two Ser residues was provided by biochemical analyses of wild-type PACT and mutant proteins purified from cell extracts. Two dimensional gel analyses followed by Western blotting showed that bulk of the wild-type protein (Spot 1, Fig. 4A) had a higher isoelectric point than that of the minor spot (Spot 2). Applying cellular stress caused the appearance of a new spot (Spot 3) with the lowest isoelectric point, suggesting that Spot 2 and Spot 3 could be a partially and the fully phosphorylated forms of PACT respectively. As expected, treatment with protein phosphatase caused Spots 2 and 3 to collapse into Spot 1 (Fig. 4B). The S246A mutant protein did not produce any phosphorylated species either before or after stress (Fig. 4C), whereas the S287A mutant protein contained Spot 2, but not Spot 3 even after stress (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that Ser246 is a target of phosphorylation even in unstressed cells whereas Ser287 gets phosphorylated after the cells are stressed. Moreover, it appears that Ser287 cannot be phosphorylated without Ser246 phosphorylation. Neither the constitutive nor the stress-induced phosphorylation of PACT was mediated by PKR, because both phosphorylations were observed in Pkr-/- MEF cells (Fig. 4E). Phosphorylation of residues 246 and 287 was tested by a different approach in the experiment shown in Fig. 5; we used the S246T and the S287T mutants and a phosphothreonine-specific antibody for this purpose. Because these two mutants were functionally active in our cell survival assay (Table 1), we anticipated that the introduced threonine residues would be phosphorylated in vivo. As expected, the wild type protein was not phosphorylated in Thr residues even after stressing the cells (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). The S287T mutant was Thr-phosphorylated only after stressing (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5) whereas the S246T mutant was constituitively Thr-phosphorylated before and after stressing (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). We ensured that the transfected PACT proteins were expressed to similar levels (lower panel, Fig. 5). Finally, stress-induced PACT phosphorylation was confirmed by its in vivo labeling with 32P. Cell lines expressing wild type or mutant PACT were generated; wild-type and the S287A mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels whereas the S246A mutant protein was expressed more highly, probably because the latter mutant protein was constitutively inert, and cells could tolerate its higher expression (bottom panel, Fig. 6). There was no detectable labeling of wild-type PACT or its mutants in cells that had not been stressed (top panel, Fig. 6), indicating that we could detect only stress-inducible phosphorylation under our labeling conditions. When stress was applied, strong labeling of PACT was observed only in cells expressing the wild-type protein, not the mutants (middle panel, Fig. 6). Thus, both Ser246 and Ser287 were required for stress-inducible phosphorylation of PACT. From the above observations, we concluded that phosphorylation of both Ser246 and Ser287 of PACT, one constitutive and the other stress-inducible, is necessary for its ability to activate PKR in vivo. Moreover, constitutive phosphorylation of Ser246 was a prerequisite for inducible phosphorylation of Ser287. Properties of Asp Substitution Mutants—To further solidify the above conclusions, we generated several PACT mutants, in which Ser246 and Ser287 were replaced with Ala (AA) or the phosphoserine mimetic Asp (DD). As expected, the AA mutant was completely inactive, whereas the DD mutant was as active as wild-type PACT in stressed cells (Table 2). The AD mutant was also inactive, indicating the absolute need for phosphorylation of the 246 residue. Finally, the DD mutant, unlike the wild-type protein, was highly active even in unstressed cells causing death of 86% of cells expressing it. These results were confirmed by TUNEL assay as well (Fig. 7 and data not shown).TABLE 2Survival of cells expressing PACT mutants, with and without stress A quantitative cell survival assay was used to measure the survival of full-length PACT- or PACT mutant-transfected HT1080 cells by cotransfecting with a GFP expression vector (8:1) so that the transfected cells could be identified by GFP expression. Where indicated, cells were stressed. PACT/mutant-expressing cells that underwent apoptosis floated off the monolayers. Cells still attached to the plate were removed from each plate, and the same number of cells analyzed by FACS for GFP expression as a measure of cell survival.Mutations% Cell survivalStressNo stressWild type292Vector100100S246D/S287D714S246A/S287A98100S246A/S287D100100 Open table in a new tab To probe the cause of the observed apoptosis in cells expressing the DD mutant, we examined the extent of PKR activation by measuring the levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α, a substrate of PKR. PKR activation in vivo, as measured by eIF2α phosphorylation, was equally strong, before and after stress, in cells expressing the DD mutant (lanes 6 and 7, Fig. 8A). There was little eIF2α phosphorylation in cells expressing the AA mutant even after the application of stress (lanes 4 and 5, Fig. 8A), and the wild-type protein caused eIF2α phosphorylation only after the cells were stressed (lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 8A). To seek the reason behind the above observations, we wondered whether the enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation was caused by a stronger association between PACT and PKR. Indeed, more PKR coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type PACT after the cells were stressed (lanes 3 and 4, Fig. 8B). In contrast, when the AA mutant of PACT was expressed, only a small amount of PKR was coimmunoprecipitated even after stress (lanes 5 and 6, Fig. 8B). Strikingly, the DD mutant of PACT coimmunoprecipitated PKR more efficiently, even without stress (lanes 7 and 8, Fig. 8B). These results demonstrated that phosphorylated wild-type PACT bound PKR more strongly in vivo, as did the DD mutant. We have used a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments to explore the mechanism by which various extracellular stresses use PACT to activate PKR and cause apoptosis (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37993-37998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We used a human cell line that did not express detectable PACT and consequently was a good recipient for testing various mutant PACT proteins in vivo expressed by transfection. Because the cell survival assay was convenient and quantitative, it was used for screening mutants of domain 3. This assay was in perfect concordance with the apoptosis assay (Fig. 2). Out of the fifty-six residues needed for activity (Fig. 1), replacement of any of ten specific residues with alanine almost completely destroyed the activity. Further structural studies will be needed for understanding why alanine substitution of these ten residues disrupted the function of domain 3. It is conceivable that the mutated Asp and Gln residues form salt bridges to stabilize its structure and Cys291 may be involved in a disulfide linkage. In contrast, the four serine residues may be structurally required or be the targets of phosphorylation. We explored the latter possibility because of the information in the literature that PACT gets phosphorylated in stressed cells. Our results indicate that Ser246 and Ser287 are indeed the targets of phosphorylation. While our work was in progress, Bennett et al. (28Bennett R.L. Blalock W.L. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42687-42693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that the S18A mutant of RAX (murine homolog of PACT) was inactive in their assay system of PKR activation in vivo. Moreover, the mutant protein could interact with PKR as effectively as the wild-type protein and functioned as a dominant negative inhibitor of the latter protein. Most importantly, because the mutant protein was not labeled with 32P in stressed cells, the authors concluded that Ser18 was the essential target of phosphorylation for the activation of RAX, although more direct evidence for the conclusion was not provided. We examined whether similar conclusions were true for PACT and found no evidence for either the necessity of Ser18 or its phosphorylation. The S18A mutant killed cells as effectively as the wild-type protein in stressed cells (Table 1) and the S18D mutant did not cause apoptosis in unstressed cells (Fig. 7). Moreover, the S246A mutant was completely unphosphorylated, even in stressed cells, as revealed by no change in its isoelectric point (Fig. 4C). Similarly, neither S246A nor the S287A mutant was 32P-labeled in stressed cells, although both contained unmutated S18 (Fig. 6). These results clearly showed that, in our system, Ser18 was not essential for stress-induced phosphorylation of PACT and its resultant ability to activate PKR. The basis for the apparent discrepancy between the properties of PACT and RAX remains to be explored further. Our results indicate that Ser246 and Ser287 are the only two targets of PACT phosphorylation in vivo, because the S246A mutant protein migrated to the same place as dephosphorylated wild-type PACT (Spot 1, Fig. 4), indicating that the mutant protein isolated from stressed or unstressed cells was unphosphorylated. The two-dimensional gel analysis of wild-type and mutant PACT proteins present in stressed and unstressed cells revealed that Ser246 was partially phosphorylated even in unstressed cells, suggesting that a constitutively active kinase phosphorylates Ser246. In contrast, Ser287 was phosphorylated only after stress, suggesting that it is the target of a stress-activated protein kinase pathway. Phosphorylation of the S246T and the S287T mutants in threonine residues (Fig. 5) unequivocally proved that these two residues are indeed the targets of constitutive and induced phosphorylation respectively. In vivo radiolabeling of the stress-activated phosphoserine residue further confirmed the above conclusion (Fig. 6). The properties of the mutants uncovered a surprising aspect of phosphorylation of these two serine residues: not only was it sequential, but the order was also fixed. It appears that Ser287 phosphorylation required prior phosphorylation of Ser246, because the S246A mutant produced only unphosphorylated protein even after stress, whereas the S287A mutant produced a monophosphorylated species, before and after stress (Fig. 4). However, the 246A/287D mutant was as ineffective in cell killing as the 246A/287A mutant (Table 2) indicating that the phosphoserine at 246 was needed for another purpose in addition to allowing the phosphorylation of Ser287. Substitution of the two other essential Ser residues, Ser265 and Ser279 (Fig. 2A), with Asp did not produce constitutively active mutants (data not shown), indicating that their role is structural and they are not targets of phosphorylation. Until the structure of PACT, or at least its domain 3, is solved, we can only speculate about the reasons for the observed need of most of the ten essential residues in domain 3, as identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. However, the results presented here provide strong evidence for the roles of Ser246 and Ser287 as targets of necessary phosphorylation. Our observation that residues in domain 3, but not elsewhere, regulate PACT activation, is consistent with our earlier observation that domains 1 and 2 of PACT could be functionally substituted by the corresponding dimerization domains of PKR (20Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The fusion protein could induce apoptosis only in stressed cells, indicating that the stress-sensing residues were located in domain 3. Our data support a two-step phosphorylation model of PACT, one constitutive and the other stress-activated. Future biochemical analyses will be needed for identifying the respective protein kinases that mediate the phosphorylation of Ser246 and Ser287. Our results with various mutants, especially the DD mutant, strongly indicate that the phosphorylation of these two serine residues is both necessary and sufficient for PACT activation. Results in Fig. 8B presented a biochemical basis for understanding why phosphorylated PACT could activate PKR in vivo: it associated with PKR more efficiently. This observation is in line with that made by others using wild-type PACT (25Patel C.V. Handy I. Goldsmith T. Patel R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37993-37998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast, the S18A inactive mutant of RAX, associated with PKR as strongly as the wild-type protein (28Bennett R.L. Blalock W.L. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42687-42693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) indicating that it does not regulate PKR activation, a prediction supported by our experiments. However, it remains possible that different kinds of stresses can activate PACT through phosphorylation of different residues, a paradigm established for the activation of transcription factors such as NFκB, IRF-3, or p53.

Here we have shown that multiple interdomain interactions in the scaffold Discs Large (Dlg) regulate binding to the synaptic protein GukHolder (GukH). GukH binds the Src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase-like (GK) protein interaction domains of Dlg, whereas an intramolecular interaction between the two domains inhibits association with GukH. Regulation occurs through a PDZ domain adjacent to the SH3 that allows GukH to interact with the composite SH3-GK binding site, but PDZ ligands inhibit GukH binding such that Dlg forms mutually exclusive PDZ ligand and GukH cellular complexes. The PDZ-SH3-GK module is a common feature of membrane associate guanylate kinase scaffolds such as Dlg, and these results indicate that its supramodular architecture leads to regulation of Dlg complexes.

Communication and adhesion between cells is mediated by specialized regions of the plasma membrane. For example, in excitatory synapses in the brain, the postsynaptic membrane contains an actin-rich cytoskeletal region known as the postsynaptic density (1Sheng M. Pak D.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 755-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Analogous structures are present at sites of cell-cell contact, including the junctions between epithelial cells, which are important for signaling and the formation of physical barriers (2Tepass U. Tanentzapf G. Ward R. Fehon R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 747-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 3Matter K. Balda M.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The establishment and function of these important structures is regulated by a large number of proteins that serve to organize receptors and downstream signaling proteins and to anchor signaling complexes at specific membrane locations. Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) 2The abbreviations used are: MAGUK, membrane associated guanylate kinase; GukH, GukHolder; GK, guanylate kinase; SH3, Src homology 3; Discs Large, ZO-1; Dlg, Discs Large; GKAP, GK-associated protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. are scaffolding proteins that regulate the formation and function of membrane specializations, such as synapses and tight junctions (3Matter K. Balda M.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 4Montgomery J.M. Zamorano P.L. Garner C.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 911-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MAGUKs have a unique domain architecture that is typified by one or three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, a variable HOOK sequence, and a region with homology to the enzyme guanylate kinase (GK) that lacks enzymatic activity but instead acts as a protein interaction domain. The SH3 and GK domains form an intramolecular interaction in the MAGUK PSD-95, which is thought to be a common feature of MAGUK proteins (5McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Shin H. Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the best studied MAGUK proteins is the Drosophila tumor suppressor Discs Large (Dlg). Dlg plays a role in the formation and function of diverse polarized cellular structures, including epithelial junctions (7Hough C.D. Woods D.F. Park S. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), stem cell cortical domains (8Peng C.Y. Manning L. Albertson R. Doe C.Q. Nature. 2000; 408: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Ohshiro T. Yagami T. Zhang C. Matsuzaki F. Nature. 2000; 408: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and neuronal synapses (10Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In the neuromuscular synapse, Dlg is present at high levels at both pre- and postsynaptic sites (11Lahey T. Gorczyca M. Jia X.X. Budnik V. Neuron. 1994; 13: 823-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Dlg is thought to function at these sites by clustering ion channels and organizing signal transduction pathways. The intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains is important for MAGUK function. All genetically identified mutations in the SH3 and GK regions of dlg and the related Caenorhabditis elegans lin-2 gene disrupt the intramolecular interaction (5McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of the intramolecular interaction in MAGUK function has remained obscure. The crystal structure of the PSD-95 SH3-GK revealed that the two domains interact through a unique mechanism in which a two-stranded β-sheet is composed of strands that emerge from the SH3-HOOK and GK domains (12McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The nature of this interaction is such that movements of the domains relative to one another could create functionally distinct conformations that result from hinge movements about the linking strands. However, how the distribution among these conformations might be modulated and what their functions are has remained unclear. One function of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction may be to regulate the assembly of MAGUK complexes. For example, GK-associated protein (GKAP) binds to a fragment of the MAGUK SAP-97 containing only the GK domain but fails to bind to the SH3-GK, indicating competition between the intra- and intermolecular interactions (14Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A secondary intramolecular event with an NH2-terminal L27 domain rescues the interaction with GKAP in the full-length protein. However, the mechanism by which this interaction may be regulated in the context of the full-length protein is unknown. Not all SH3-GK ligands compete against the intramolecular interaction, indicating that multiple binding surfaces are utilized by ligands of this unique domain. Here we have analyzed how binding of Dlg to the synaptic protein GukHolder (GukH) is regulated by complex interdomain interactions within Dlg that involve transitions in the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction. GukH was first identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner for the Dlg GK domain (15Mathew D. Gramates L.S. Packard M. Thomas U. Bilder D. Perrimon N. Gorczyca M. Budnik V. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and mammalian homologues have been identified (16Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 1033-1038PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sharma S. Ang S.L. Shaw M. Mackey D.A. Gecz J. McAvoy J.W. Craig J.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1972-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GukH colocalizes with Dlg at synaptic borders, and the interaction of the two proteins appears to be required for proper localization of the tumor suppressor Scribble. GukH also colocalizes with Dlg in neuroblasts, precursors of the Drosophila central nervous system (18Albertson R. Doe C.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The interaction of GukH with Dlg is mediated by an ∼300-residue region at the GukH COOH terminus that contains no known domains. We find that GukH binding to Dlg is actively regulated by the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction. GukH binds to a composite site formed by not only the GK domain but the SH3 domain as well. However, the intramolecular interaction between the two domains competes against GukH binding. Binding is rescued by a PDZ domain directly NH2-terminal to the SH3 domain, a common feature of MAGUK proteins. The complex interdomain interactions in Dlg cause GukH-Dlg- and PDZ-bound complexes to be mutually exclusive in a cellular context. These results have implications for the types of complexes that are formed by Dlg and therefore its role in regulating the formation and function of membrane specializations, such as epithelial junctions and synapses. Molecular Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—DNA encoding full-length Drosophila, the PE isoform of Dlg (which contains the “I3” exon), and the GukH Dlg binding domain fragment from the PA isoform (1494–1788) were cloned from an embryonic cDNA library. For the PDZ, PDZ-SH3, SH3, GK, HOOK-GK, SH3-GK, linker-SH3-GK, and PDZ-SH3-GK fragments of Dlg, amino acids 481–571, 481–691, 581–681, 764–960, 675–960, 598–960, 560–960, and 474–960 were used, respectively. The sequence of all inserts was verified by DNA sequencing. For expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions, cDNAs were ligated into pGEX 4T-1, whereas the pET-19b derivative pBH was used for hexahistidine tags. The pBH vector encodes for a tobacco etch virus protease site following the hexahistidine tag to allow for removal of the tag. All proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Hexahistidine fusion proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotri-acetic acid resin and standard protocols. Unless otherwise noted, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification was followed by incubation with tobacco etch virus protease to remove the histidine tag (after cleavage, the protein contains an extra glycine and serine residue on the NH2 terminus). Ion exchange chromatography was used to further purify proteins if necessary. Purity was established using SDS-PAGE and/or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Binding Assays—For yeast two hybrid, the vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT7 were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). GukH-(1494–1788) was cloned into the Gal4 activation domain vector pGADT7, whereas all of the DLG constructs were cloned into DNA binding domain vector pGBKT7. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae HF7c strain was transformed with pGADT7 and pGBKT7 plasmids and plated on SD medium (-Leu/-Trp/-His, +20 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT; Sigma)). Colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as substrate. For qualitative “pulldown” assays, E. coli cell lysates containing the GST fusion protein of interest were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads and washed with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100). Potential interacting proteins were added to a concentration of 10 μm and incubated with the beads at room temperature for 15 min. The reactions were washed three times with binding buffer to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer and analyzed by staining with Coomassie Blue and/or Western blotting using an anti-hexahistidine antibody (Qiagen). For quantitative binding measurements, a peptide with the sequence from the last ten residues of CRIPT and an NH2-terminal rhodamine was synthesized by Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis. A sulfonyl chloride rhodamine derivative (Molecular Probes L-20) was used after the addition of the final Fmoc amino acid. Following cleavage from the solid support, the peptide was purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and its sequence verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A series of solutions were prepared with increasing concentrations of the appropriate Dlg fragment and a concentration of 100 nm rhodamine-labeled peptide. The anisotropy of each solution was measured using an ISS PC1 fluorometer. The Kd of interactions was determined by nonlinear fitting of the data to a bimolecular binding equation. Cell Culture and Immunoprecipitation—We transiently transfected Drosophila S2 cells grown in Schneider's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with expression vectors for full-length Dlg and/or the GFP-CRIPT and hemagglutinin (HA)-GukH Dlg binding domains using 1 μg of total DNA, which resulted in an efficiency of ∼30%. We induced protein expression after 24 h using 0.5 mm copper sulfate and collected the cells after an additional 24 h of growth. To collect the cells, we centrifuged them for 5 min at 1000 × g and washed the resulting pellet with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice. For immunoprecipitation experiments, extracts were prepared by incubation with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysate was precleared by gently mixing with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 s. The proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating anti-HA, anti-GFP, or anti-His with precleared lysate at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The pellets were collected at 12,000 × g for 20 s and washed three times with lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline. The final pellets were suspended in protein loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by western. For immunostaining, Dlg localization was detected with an anti-Dlg antibody and Cy3-labeled secondary antibody (endogenous Dlg was below the level of detection for immunostaining). After labeling, the cells were imaged by confocal microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope with a Photometrics CoolSNAP fx CCD camera. Images were analyzed with the ImageJ software (NIH), and cells were binned into cortical or cytoplasmic localization based upon the pixel intensity distribution across the cell. Cells having cortical signal intensity 2× or greater than the cytoplasmic pool were scored as cortically localized. Results are reported from two independent experiments. The Third Dlg PDZ Domain Modulates the Interaction of Dlg with GukH—The interaction of Dlg with GukH has been shown to occur through the Dlg GK domain (15Mathew D. Gramates L.S. Packard M. Thomas U. Bilder D. Perrimon N. Gorczyca M. Budnik V. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). While analyzing fragments of Dlg for their ability to bind to GukH, we found that, although the GK is able to bind GukH, a fragment that also includes the SH3 domain does not bind (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that the intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains competes with GukH binding. However, elements NH2-terminal to the SH3-GK control the ability of Dlg to interact with GukH, as larger fragments of Dlg, including the full-length protein, are able to bind GukH. We analyzed several Dlg fragments to identify the minimal components necessary for regulation of the Dlg-GukH complex assembly using a GST fusion of the GukH Dlg binding domain (Fig. 1B). A fragment containing the third PDZ domain along with the short linker that connects it to the SH3-GK module are necessary and sufficient to allow GukH binding (Fig. 1, A and C). As shown in Fig. 1D, the PDZ-SH3-GK architecture is highly conserved among MAGUK proteins with the number of residues linking the PDZ and SH3 domains ranging from 5 to 40. The functional linkage between the Dlg PDZ and SH3-GK domains and the conserved architecture of these domains in MAGUK proteins suggests that the PDZ domain is an integral component of a larger PDZ-SH3-GK module. GukH Binds to a Composite Site on Dlg Formed by Both the SH3 and GK Domains—In experiments using purified components, we noticed that a proteolytic fragment of the PDZ-SH3-GK also interacts with GukH (Fig. 1C, starred band). This proteolytic fragment corresponds to a COOH-terminal truncation that lacks the GK domain (based on the molecular weight of the fragment and the presence of the NH2-terminal His tag), indicating that one or more additional GukH binding sites exist outside of the GK domain. We tested both the Dlg PDZ and SH3 domains for the ability to bind GukH. Consistent with a GukH binding site in Dlg outside of the GK domain, purified fragments of Dlg that lack the GK but contain the SH3 domain are able to bind GukH (Fig. 2A). However, the third PDZ domain is not required for GukH binding in this context. This interaction is qualitatively weaker than with the PDZ-SH3-GK (Fig. 2B), consistent with the SH3 domain being only one part of a larger interaction surface that includes the GK domain. As the region of GukH that binds to Dlg contains several proline-rich sequences (Fig. 2C) and SH3 domains bind to a consensus sequence of PXXP (19Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Science's STKE 2003. 2003; : RE8Google Scholar), we tested these sequences for their ability to bind the Dlg SH3 domain (using an SH3 domain that lacked the “HOOK” segment that links the SH3 and GK domains). Although MAGUK SH3s deviate from canonical SH3 domains (12McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we found that each of the GukH proline-rich segments is able to bind to the Dlg SH3 domain (Fig. 2D). Similar to the interaction of GukH with the Dlg GK domain, the binding site on the SH3 domain is obscured when the GK domain is present (Fig. 2E), presumably because of the intramolecular interaction between the two domains. Another similarity between the two binding sites is that GukH binding is rescued by the presence of the third PDZ domain (Fig. 2E). Binding of proline-rich sequences requires the presence of specific proline residues as mutation of the PXXP to AXXA completely disrupts binding (Fig. 2D). We therefore conclude that GukH binds to a composite binding site formed by the SH3 and GK domains and that this binding site is obscured by the intramolecular interaction between the two domains. The presence of three SH3 ligand sequences in GukH indicates that each GukH may bind multiple Dlg proteins. Modulation of GukH Binding by COOH-terminal PDZ Ligands—The interplay between the Dlg PDZ and SH3-GK modules appears to be a mechanism for communication between the PDZ and SH3-GK binding sites. PDZ domains are common protein interaction domains that bind short, COOH-terminal sequences present in target proteins (20Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although binding to internal motifs can also occur (21Penkert R.R. DiVittorio H.M. Prehoda K.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The third PDZ domain from Dlg or its mammalian homologues has been shown to bind two COOH-terminal sequences, one from CRIPT (cysteine-rich interactor of PDZ; sequence DTKNYKQTSV-COOH) and Drosophila neuroligin (sequence KRVHIQEISV-COOH) (22Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg T.M. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Lise M.F. El-Husseini A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1833-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). CRIPT binds to microtubules providing a link between MAGUK scaffolding proteins and the cytoskeleton (24Passafaro M. Sala C. Niethammer M. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas neuroligin is a membrane protein involved in synapse formation (23Lise M.F. El-Husseini A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1833-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We synthesized peptides containing the last ten residues of CRIPT and neuroligin and used these peptides to probe the coupling of PDZ and SH3-GK ligand binding activity. Although the PDZ-SH3-GK fragment is able to bind GukH, the addition of the CRIPT or neuroligin peptide lowers the affinity for GukH in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas an unrelated PDZ ligand peptide has no effect (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that PDZ ligand binding influences the GukH (SH3-GK) binding site. The communication between the Dlg PDZ and SH3-GK domains must have energetic consequences. To explore the coupling between the two, we measured the affinity of the CRIPT and neuroligin peptides for the isolated PDZ domain and the entire PDZ-SH3-GK fragment using the fluorescence anisotropy of NH2-terminal tetramethylrhodamine (Fig. 3B). Although the affinity of CRIPT for the isolated PDZ domain is 14 μm, which is typical for interactions of isolated PDZ domains with COOH-terminal ligands, the affinity of CRIPT for the PDZ-SH3-GK fragment is 0.8 μm, representing an ∼15-fold difference in affinity. No binding was observed to the SH3-GK (data not shown). The difference between PDZ-SH3-GK and PDZ binding is similar for neuroligin (Kd = 71.5 and ∼900 μm, respectively), although the affinities are significantly weaker. The difference between the affinity for the two fragments is consistent with the coupling of PDZ ligands and GukH binding sites. However, as the affinity for PDZ-SH3-GK is higher than for PDZ alone, the data excludes a simple model in which the PDZ ligands compete with an intramolecular interaction formed with the PDZ domain. Interdomain PDZ-SH3-GK Interactions Lead to Mutually Exclusive Cellular Complexes—How might the complex interdomain interactions in the Dlg PDZ-SH3-GK module affect the complexes that Dlg forms in a cellular context? The in vitro analysis of these proteins indicates that GukH-Dlg and PDZ ligand complexes are likely to exist as distinct complexes (Fig. 4A). To examine whether the CRIPT and GukH interactions affected the complexes that Dlg forms in a cellular context, we transfected Drosophila S2 cells with the Dlg binding domains from GukH and CRIPT. Immunoprecipitation of the Dlg ligands from extracts of these cells leads to coimmunoprecipitation of full-length Dlg (Fig. 4B). However, neither of the Dlg ligands is able to immunoprecipitate the other, consistent with a model in which GukH and PDZ ligands form mutually exclusive Dlg complexes. We also examined the effect of the GukH and CRIPT Dlg binding domains on Dlg localization in these cells. Immunofluorescence from an HA fusion of the GukH Dlg binding domain shows a large percentage of cells with cortical localization (Fig. 4C), whereas full-length Dlg is consistently found in the cytoplasm, excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 4D). Expression of GukH induces localization of Dlg at the cell cortex in a significant fraction of the transfected cells (Fig. 4E), indicating that GukH recruits Dlg to the cell cortex. Expression of a GFP fusion of the Dlg binding portion of CRIPT (which localizes to the cytoplasm) leads to a significant decrease in the fraction of cells with cortical Dlg localization (Fig. 4F), which we interpret as arising from competition between the CRIPT and GukH complexes of Dlg. Additionally, a Dlg mutant in which the PDZ domain no longer rescues the ability to bind GukH (DlgΔΔ; see below) is not significantly localized to the cortex by GukH. These results are also consistent with mutually exclusive PDZ ligand and GukH-Dlg complexes. Mechanism of PDZ-based Regulation of the SH3-GK Module—How does binding of COOH-terminal ligands to the PDZ domain alter the ability of SH3-GK to bind GukH? As the CRIPT and GukH binding sites are likely to be fairly distant from one another, competition through a direct steric mechanism is unlikely. One possible mechanism for PDZ regulation of the SH3-GK module is that the PDZ domain disrupts the intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains to expose the composite GukH binding site. In this model, the PDZ-SH3 would fail to interact with the GK. However, in an intermolecular assay, in which the PDZ-SH3 and HOOK-GK are separately expressed, we find that these two domains are able to bind one another and that this binding is not qualitatively altered by the presence of CRIPT peptide (Fig. 5A). This indicates that the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction is not qualitatively affected by the PDZ domain. The Dlg PDZ-SH3-GK module contains a conserved linker between the PDZ and SH3 domains (Fig. 5B). In the structure of the Dlg PDZ domain (25Morais Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), a portion of the sequence following the PDZ domain forms a short helix that packs against the PDZ domain. The conservation and structure of this ∼40-residue sequence prompted us to examine the role of the linker in functionally coupling the PDZ and SH3-GK modules. To test the contribution of this sequence to the coupling between CRIPT and GukH binding, we constructed a series of PDZ-SH3-GK fragments with short deletions in the sequence. When either half of the linker is removed (Δ1 and Δ2), the PDZ domain no longer efficiently rescues binding of GukH to the composite SH3-GK binding site (Fig. 5C). Combining both deletions (ΔΔ) results in an even more severe effect. In addition, we find that the PDZ domain is unable to relieve GukH inhibition in trans. 3Y. Qian and K. E. Prehoda, unpublished observations. To determine whether the sequence of the linker is important or, alternatively, whether the spacing provided by the linker is only required, we replaced the deleted residues with glycine-serine repeats (Fig. 5C, GS). As this flexible linker is unable to restore GukH binding activity, the linker does not function solely to provide proper spacing between the domains. These results indicate that the covalent attachment of the PDZ and SH3 domains through a conserved linker is necessary for the regulation of the composite GukH binding site and that this regulation does not occur by disruption of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction. We have demonstrated a set of interdomain interactions in the Drosophila tumor suppressor Dlg that leads to regulation of the ligand binding activity of these domains. The Dlg SH3-GK module, a defining feature of MAGUK proteins, forms a composite binding site for the synaptic protein GukH, but the intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains obscures this binding site. The third PDZ domain from Dlg relieves this inhibition, making use of the short linker that attaches it to the SH3 domain. Binding of CRIPT to the PDZ domain induces a change in the SH3-GK module that again obscures the GukH binding site, effectively leading to competition between CRIPT and GukH binding that influences the organization of Dlg-mediated protein complexes in a cellular context. The active scaffolding of Dlg complexes does not utilize disruption of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction but requires a conserved, structured linker that attaches the PDZ and SH3 domains. Active Scaffolding of MAGUK Complexes—Cellular signaling relies on the formation of specific protein complexes, and scaffolding proteins play a central role in this process (26Vondriska T.M. Pass J.M. Ping P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2004; 37: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although scaffolds are critical components of many signaling pathways, their exact function has remained unclear (27Ferrell Jr., J.E. Science's STKE 2000. 2000; : PE1Google Scholar). In particular, are scaffolds simple tethers that passively bind to their many ligands or is ligand binding actively regulated? The answers to these questions have significant implications for the types of scaffold-mediated complexes that are formed in cells. In the yeast mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase scaffold Ste5, heterologous protein interaction domains can functionally replace the native kinase recruitment modules, although at reduced levels (28Park S.H. Zarrinpar A. Lim W.A. Science. 2003; 299: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As the heterologous domains are unlikely to participate in interactions that would lead to regulated binding of scaffold ligands, this suggests that certain scaffolds may function in a passive manner. However, the fact that domain-swapped Ste5 scaffolds do not function at wild-type levels leaves open the possibility that this scaffold also has characteristics of an active scaffold. Clearly, in the case of Dlg, however, the complexes that it forms are regulated by dynamic interdomain interactions. We are currently assessing how these interactions affect the diversity of Dlg complexes that might be formed in different cellular contexts. PDZ-based Regulation of MAGUK Complex Formation—How might the third PDZ domain from Dlg expose the composite GukH binding site within the SH3-GK module? Our data exclude a simple model in which the PDZ domain directly competes against the interaction between the SH3 and GK domains as the PDZ-SH3 and GK domains bind to one another in an intermolecular assay (Fig. 5A). We propose that the PDZ domain stabilizes the linker that connects it to the SH3 domain and that this linker interacts with the SH3 domain to induce an SH3-GK conformation that allows for GukH binding. The structure of the PSD-95 SH3-GK indicates that the SH3 ligand binding site is obscured in the closed conformation. The PDZ must therefore alter the position of residues that occupy the PXXP binding site to allow for GukH binding. Although there is no direct structural information on the position of the PDZ domain, based on the NH2 terminus of the SH3 domain, we can infer that the approximate position of the PDZ domain is likely to be in close proximity to the PXXP binding site. Binding of CRIPT would then return the SH3-GK to its basal conformation, which binds GukH with low affinity. This would explain why the affinity of CRIPT for the PDZ-SH3-GK fragment is higher than that for the PDZ alone. Such a supramolecular interaction induced by a PDZ ligand has been observed in the PDZ-regulated protease DegS (29Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 30Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Cell. 2004; 117: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (see below). The PDZ domain of the MAGUK PSD-93 has also been shown to be involved in the regulation of its SH3-GK module, although in this case, the PDZ domain negatively regulates ligand binding to SH3-GK. A fragment of PSD-93 containing the SH3 and GK domains binds to microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A), but MAP1A fails to bind to full-length PSD-93 (31Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of MAP1A is restored by the presence of a COOH-terminal ligand for the third PSD-93 PDZ domain, although the other two PDZ domains appear to play a small role. In this system, the PDZ domain appears to repress binding to the SH3-GK and the PDZ ligand somehow restores binding. The distinct behavior of these two systems indicates that ligands can utilize the interdomain interactions in MAGUK proteins to achieve very different regulatory effects. Regulation of interactions that are modulated by the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction have also been shown to occur by PDZ-independent mechanisms. The GK domain from the Dlg homologue SAP97 binds to GKAP (32Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). GKAP binding is inhibited by the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction (14Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this case, binding is rescued by an L27 domain present at the very NH2 terminus of the protein. However, how GKAP binding might be modulated in the context of the full-length protein is unknown. PDZ domains have been utilized in the regulation of diverse functions including the enzymatic activity of proteases. In the DegS protease, which is responsible for initiation of the misfolded protein proteolytic cascade in the periplasm of bacteria, a NH2-terminal PDZ domain regulates the protease domain activity using a mechanism that may be similar to PDZ regulation of the Dlg SH3-GK module. In DegS, the PDZ domain does not directly repress the protease domain. Instead, the protease is normally found in an inactive conformation (30Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Cell. 2004; 117: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Activation occurs when a COOH-terminal ligand binds to the PDZ domain, which induces an interaction between a loop within the protease domain and PDZ ligand. This interaction causes a large change in the protease to an active conformation. Such an interaction with the ligand of the Dlg PDZ domain would be consistent with the higher affinity of the PDZ-SH3-GK module for this ligand. We thank C. Doe, A. McGee, and T.

https://openalex.org/W1988823592,"NtOSAK (Nicotiana tabacum osmotic stress-activated protein kinase), a member of the SnRK2 subfamily, is activated rapidly in response to hyperosmotic stress. Our previous results as well as data presented by others indicate that phosphorylation is involved in activation of SnRK2 kinases. Here, we have mapped the regulatory phosphorylation sites of NtOSAK by mass spectrometry with collision-induced peptide fragmentation. We show that active NtOSAK, isolated from NaCl-treated tobacco BY-2 cells, is phosphorylated on Ser-154 and Ser-158 in the kinase activation loop. Prediction of the NtOSAK three-dimensional structure indicates that phosphorylation of Ser-154 and Ser-158 triggers changes in enzyme conformation resulting in its activation. The involvement of Ser-154 and Ser-158 phosphorylation in regulation of NtOSAK activity was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of NtOSAK expressed in bacteria and in maize protoplasts. Our data reveal that phosphorylation of Ser-158 is essential for NtOSAK activation, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-154 most probably facilitates Ser-158 phosphorylation. The time course of NtOSAK phosphorylation on Ser-154 and Ser-158 in BY-2 cells subjected to osmotic stress correlates with NtOSAK activity, indicating that NtOSAK is regulated by reversible phosphorylation of these residues in vivo. Importantly, Ser-154 and Ser-158 are conserved in all SnRK2 subfamily members, suggesting that phosphorylation at these sites may be a general mechanism for SnRK2 activation.

Plants growing in natural conditions are challenged by various environmental stresses (e.g. drought, extreme temperatures, and high salinity), all of which cause osmotic stress in cells. To survive, plants induce various defense mechanisms. Perception of environmental stimuli and proper signal transduction are crucial for plant acclimatization and development. Protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases play a pivotal role in these processes. Therefore, the activity of these enzymes has to be regulated very strictly inside the cell. Several protein kinases involved in osmotic stress signal transduction in plants have been identified (for a review, see Ref. 1Boudsocq M. Lauriere C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Most of the available information concerns mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 3The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; ABA, abscisic acid; SnRK, Snf1-related protein kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. 3The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; ABA, abscisic acid; SnRK, Snf1-related protein kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. cascades, which in all eukaryotic organisms play a central role in stress signal transduction. All MAPKs, as well as MAPKKs, including plant enzymes, are activated by phosphorylation in their activation loops by specific upstream kinases, MAPKKs and MAPKK kinases, respectively (for a review, see Ref. 2Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 230-254Crossref Scopus (553) Google Scholar), and become inactivated by phosphoprotein phosphatases (for a review, see Ref. 3Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Besides the enzymes belonging to the MAPK cascades and several other protein kinases conserved in all eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast to human, plant genomes encode also plant-specific protein kinases, involved in the responses to harsh environmental conditions. Representative of such enzymes are some of the SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRKs). Plant SnRKs are classified into three subfamilies: SnRK1, SnRK2, and SnRK3 (for reviews, see Refs. 4Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Hrabak E.M. Chan C.W.M. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Choi J.H. Halford N. Kudla J. Luan S. Nimmo H.G.

Bull. 2003; 16: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymes belonging to the SnRK1 group structurally and functionally resemble the yeast and animal SNF1/AMPK kinases, which play a role in protecting cells against nutritional and environmental stresses (for reviews, see Refs. 4Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 7Hardie D.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 13-27PubMed Google Scholar, and 8Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The SnRK2 and SnRK3 subfamilies are specific to plants (for reviews, see Refs. 4Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 5Hrabak E.M. Chan C.W.M. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Choi J.H. Halford N. Kudla J. Luan S. Nimmo H.G. Sussman M.R. Thomas M. Walker-Simmons K. Zhu J.-K. Harmon A.C. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 666-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Amassing data suggest that these enzymes participate in environmental stress signaling. Members of the SnRK3 subfamily, especially those that interact with calcineurin B-like proteins, are relatively well characterized. They take part in the protection of plant cells against different abiotic stresses (1Boudsocq M. Lauriere C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Luan S.

These kinases are activated by interaction with calcineurin B-like proteins and most probably by phosphorylation, since in the case of several enzymes of this subfamily, substitution of a conserved threonine residue in the kinase activation loop with aspartic acid mimicking the phosphate group results in constitutively active enzymes (12Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhuo J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 13Gong D. Zhang C. Chen X. Gong Z. Zhu J.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42088-42096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of information concerning enzymes belonging to the SnRK2 subfamily also indicate their role in abiotic stress signaling in plants. It has been shown that in Ara-bidopsis thaliana and in Oryza sativa, there are 10 members of the SnRK2 family (14Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hattori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 15Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Lauriere C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41758-41766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). All of them, except SnRK2.9 from Arabidopsis, are activated by different osmolytes, such as sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, and NaCl, and some of them also by abscisic acid, suggesting that these kinases are involved in a general response to osmotic stress (14Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hattori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 15Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Lauriere C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41758-41766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The best known members of the SnRK2 group are wheat PKABA1 (protein kinase induced by abscisic acid), the expression of which is activated by ABA as well as by drought and salinity (16Anderberg R.J. Walker-Simmons M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10183-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Hollapa L.D. Walker-Simmons M.K. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); AAPK (ABA-activated protein kinase), activated by ABA in guard cells of fava bean (Vicia faba) in response to drought, involved in the regulation of stomatal closure and anion channels (18Li J. Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2359-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Li J. Wang X.-Q. Watson M.B. Assmann S.M. Science. 2000; 287: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar); and A. thaliana SRK2E/OST1/SnRK2.6 protein kinase, an enzyme related to AAPK, mediating the regulation of stomatal aperture by ABA and acting upstream of reactive oxygen species production (20Mustilli A.-C. Merlot S. Vavasseur A. Frenzi F. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The srk2e mutant cannot cope with a rapid decrease in humidity and has a wilty phenotype (21Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Arabidopsis SRK2C/OSKL4/SnRK2.8 kinase is involved in drought stress signaling (22Umezawa T. Yoshida R. Maruyama K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17306-17311Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The enzyme improves the drought tolerance of Arabidopsis plants by controlling stress-responsive gene expression. Also soybean SnRK2s involved in abiotic stress signal transduction have been described. Expression of genes encoding the SPK-3 and SPK-4 kinases from soybean, both members of the SnRK2 subfamily, is induced by dehydration and high salinity (23Yoon H.W. Kim M.C. Shin P.G. Kim J.S. Kim C.Y. Lee S.Y. Hwang I. Bahk J.D. Hong J.C. Han C. Cho M.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Two other soybean protein kinases, SPK-1 and SPK-2 from the same group, are able to phosphorylate Ssh1p (soybean unusual phosphatidylinositol transfer-like protein), upon exposure of plant tissues to hyperosmotic stress (24Monks D.E. Aghoram K. Courtney P.D. DeWald D.B. Dewey R.E. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1205-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that SnRK2s function in abiotic stress signaling in plants and are activated very rapidly in response to osmotic stress, there is still very little information concerning the mechanism of their activation. Our previous results concerning NtOSAK of the SnRK2 subfamily (25Mikol/ajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszyńska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178PubMed Google Scholar), the results obtained by the Hattori group on two rice SnRK2s (14Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hattori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and the very recent ones by Belin et al. (26Belin C. de Franco P.-O. Burbousse C. Chaignepain S. Schmitter J.-M. Vavasseur A. Giraudat J. Barbier-Brygoo H. Thomine S. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 1316-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) on Arabidopsis OST1 kinase suggested that these enzymes were activated by phosphorylation. Contrary to this, Hoyos and Zhang (27Hoyos M. Zhang S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) claimed that high osmolarity stress-activated kinase from tobacco, whose properties resemble those of NtOSAK, was activated by dephosphorylation. In order to clarify this controversy and to establish the mechanism of SnRK2 activation under osmotic stress conditions, systematic studies on NtOSAK activation were undertaken. The results presented here show that phosphorylation of serines 154 and 158 in the NtOSAK activation loop is involved in the kinase activation in response to hyperosmotic stress. The identified sites are conserved in all members of the SnRK2 family, which suggests that this can be a general mechanism of regulation of the activity of these kinases. Plant Material—BY-2 tobacco cells, kindly provided by Dr. Witold Filipowicz (Friedrich-Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland), were cultured as described by Nagata et al. (28Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Murashige and Skoog's medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter myo-inositol, 1 mg/liter thiamine HCl, 255 mg/liter KH2PO4, 0.2 mg/liter 2,4-dichloropenoxyacetic acid, and 3% sucrose. The cells were subcultured every 7 days. The cells were treated with NaCl (100 or 250 mm) or sorbitol (500 or 900 mm) for the indicated times, harvested by centrifugation, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until analyzed. Preparation of Protein Extracts—Protein extracts were prepared as previously described (25Mikol/ajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszyńska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kelner A. Pękala I. Kaczanowski S. Muszyńska G. Hardie D.G. Dobrowolska G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from untreated and stressor-treated BY-2 using TRI REAGENT (MRC, Cincinnati, OH) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the HSRT 100 kit (Sigma). Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed for 60 min at 47 °C in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 1 unit of enhanced avian reverse transcriptase, 500 μm each dNTP, 3.5 μm anchored oligo(dT) primer, 1 unit RNase inhibitor. One microliter of the reverse transcription reaction was used for PCR in 20 μl containing 0.4 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Fermentas UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania), 200 μm each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and a 625 nm concentration of the appropriate primers. Routine PCR conditions were as follows: 3 min, 94 °C (first cycle); 30 s, 94 °C; 30 s, 55 °C; 1 min, 72 °C (40 cycles); and 10 min, 72 °C (final cycle). The PCR products were separated on 0.8% agarose gels and visualized by EtBr staining. NtOSAK-specific primers were as follows: forward, 5′-CTTCATTCTTCCTTCTTCATTCTTCATTCCC-3′, based on NtOSAK untranslated region sequence; reverse, 5′-CATGATCTCCTCAACACTCTG-3′, based on NtOSAK coding sequence. As a control of the amount and quality of RNA, the level of actin transcript was monitored using the following primers: 5′-ATGGCAGACGGTGAGGATATTCA-3′ and 5′-GCCTTTGCAATCCACATCTGTTTG-3′. Immunoblotting—Western blot analysis was generally performed as described previously (29Kelner A. Pękala I. Kaczanowski S. Muszyńska G. Hardie D.G. Dobrowolska G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using polyclonal anti-NtOSAK antibodies raised against the C-terminal peptide (KQVQQAHESGEVRLT) of the kinase or phospho-specific polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit against the phosphopeptide (KpSTVGT; where pS represents phosphoserine) and purified by affinity chromatography (BioGenes, Berlin, Germany). The phospho-specific antibodies were designated as anti-Ser(P)-158. In the case of blots probed with anti-Ser(P)-158 antibodies, in order to block nonspecific binding, the membranes were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at room temperature and then for 2 h in the same solution with the antibodies at 1:500 dilution at room temperature. After incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the results were visualized by staining with p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt. Purification of NtOSAK—NtOSAK was purified from BY-2 cells treated for 5 min with 250 mm NaCl according to the method described previously (25Mikol/ajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszyńska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of GST-NtOSAK in Escherichia coli—Preparation of the pGEX-NtOSAK construct, expression of GST-NtOSAK, and purification of the recombinant protein were described previously by Kelner et al. (29Kelner A. Pękala I. Kaczanowski S. Muszyńska G. Hardie D.G. Dobrowolska G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Usually, expression was performed for 3 h at 30 °C and only when indicated overnight at 18 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of NtOSAK Mutated Forms—The pGEX-NtOSAK construct was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Eight individual constructs were generated with the following substitutions: GST-NtOSAK(K33A), GST-NtOSAK(S154A,S158A), GST-NtOSAK(S154E,S158E), GST-NtOSAK(S154E), GST-NtOSAK(S158E), GST-NtOSAK(S154A), GST-NtOSAK(S158A), and GST-NtOSAK(K33A,S154E). All constructs were sequenced to verify the introduced mutations and lack of unintended ones. The obtained constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified using glutathione-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously for wild type GST-NtOSAK (29Kelner A. Pękala I. Kaczanowski S. Muszyńska G. Hardie D.G. Dobrowolska G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (25Mikol/ajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszyńska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kelner A. Pękala I. Kaczanowski S. Muszyńska G. Hardie D.G. Dobrowolska G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with some minor changes. Proteins from crude extracts (4 mg) were incubated with anti-NtOSAK antibody (120 μg) in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C for 4 h on a rocker. An approximately 50-μl packed volume of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h. Agarose bead-protein complexes were pelleted by brief centrifugation and washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and two times with the following buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin). After washing, the immunocomplexes were divided into two pools in a ratio of 1:10. The smaller portion was used directly for immunocomplex kinase activity assay, whereas the major part was used for determination of phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). In parallel, cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Ser(P)-158 antibodies. Immunocomplex Kinase Activity Assay—Fifty microliters of sample buffer was added to the pelleted agarose bead-protein complex after immunoprecipitation, and the sample was heated at 95 °C for 3 min. After brief centrifugation, supernatant was analyzed by an in-gel kinase activity assay. Protein Kinase Activity Assays—In-gel, as well as in-solution, kinase activity assays were performed as described previously (25Mikol/ajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszyńska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178PubMed Google Scholar) using MBP (0.5 mg/ml) as a substrate. Staining of NtOSAK with Pro-Q Diamond—NtOSAK immunoprecipitated from BY-2 cells (untreated or treated with 250 mm NaCl for 5 min) was delipidated, desalted, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with Pro-Q Diamond stain (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the polyacrylamide gel was fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid overnight, washed with three changes of deionized water for 10-20 min/wash, and then incubated in Pro-Q Diamond stain for 90 min and destained with three washes in 20% acetonitrile in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, for 30 min each. Before imaging, the gel was rehydrated in deionized water for 30 min. The stained phosphorylated proteins were visualized using a laser scanner with 532-nm excitation and a 580-nm long pass emission filter. Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry with collisional fragmentation (LC-electrospray ionization-MS-MS/MS). Prior to analysis, the gel bands containing NtOSAK were excised, and proteins were reduced, alkylated when necessary, and digested with trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega, Madison, WI) following a standard protocol. An eluted peptide mixture was applied to a RP-18 precolumn (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the mobile phase and then transferred to a nano-HPLC RP-18 column of 75-μm inner diameter (LC Packings) using an acetonitrile gradient (0-50% acetonitrile in 30 min) in the presence of 0.05% formic acid at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The column outlet was directly coupled to the ion source of a Q-Tof (Micromass, Manchester, UK) or LTQ FTICR (Thermo, Waltham, MA) electrospray mass spectrometer working either in the regime of data-dependent MS to MS/MS switch (for peptide identification) or in the Mass Survey Scan regime (for signal quantitation). A blank run ensuring lack of cross-contamination from previous samples preceded each analysis. The output list of parent and daughter ions was used to search the data base using the MAS-COT (MatrixScience, London, UK) program. Peptide identification and the presence of covalent modifications were verified by inspection of parent mass fragmentation patterns using the programs MassLynx (Waters, Milford, MA), ProteinProspector, Excalibur (Thermo, Waltham, MA), and also in-house LC-MS data analysis software. Computer Modeling—Analysis of the amino acid sequence of NtOSAK revealed a number of structures that could be used as templates to build a homology model. The template structures were chosen from the Protein Data Bank according to the overall sequence homology to NtOSAK but also according to sequence similarities in the DFG-APE fragment of the activation loop. The model was based on five template structures taken from the Protein Data Bank, 1A06, 1CDK, 1IA8, 1JKS, and 1QL6, all of them having a serine/threonine kinase fold. The activation loop was modeled according to the 1QL6 and 1JKS templates, since these two structures have identical loop length and highest homology to the DFG-APE part of the NtOSAK loop. The MODELER module of INSIGHT2000 was used to convert the NtOSAK sequence into a three-dimensional structure. Five variants of the model were created and validated using the Profile3D module of INSIGHT2000 and the PROCHECK program. The final model was subjected to a minimization procedure using the DISCOVER3 module of INSIGHT2000 and a CVFF force field. The procedure consisted of the following two steps: 1) backbone atoms fixed, only side chains minimized and 2) no atoms fixed, the entire model minimized until the maximum derivative was less than 0.001 kcal/mol Å. Agrobacterium-mediated Transient Transformation—Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum LA Burley 21) were grown at 22 °C in a growth chamber programmed for a 14-h light cycle. Approximately 7-week-old plants were used for experiments. cDNA encoding NtOSAK or its mutated forms was inserted into the XhoI site of the steroid-inducible pTA7002 binary vector (kindly provided by N.-H. Chua, Rockefeller University, New York) (31Aoyama T. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium LBA4404 carrying different constructs were grown overnight in YM medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 μg/ml rifampicin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 100 μm acetosyringone. Cells were collected by centrifugation (4000 × g), resuspended to A600 = 0.8 in Murashige and Skoog's medium, pH 5.9, with 100 μm acetosyringone, and infiltrated into fully expanded leaves. Expression of the transgene was induced by infiltration of dexamethasone (30 μm) 24 h later. Samples for protein preparation were collected after 40 h and subjected to Western blotting and kinase activity analysis. Protoplast Transient Expression Assay—The preparation and electroporation of maize mesophyll protoplasts was performed according to the protocol described by Sheen (30Sheen J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3497-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding NtOSAK was inserted into the NcoI and NotI sites of the pRT100 plant expression vector under the control of the 35S promoter. The vector was kindly provided by Prof. H. Hirt (Vienna Biocenter). NtOSAK was fused at the C terminus with GFP. Constructs carrying mutated forms of NtOSAK were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the pRT100-NtOSAK-GFP construct as a template. In each electroporation, about 2 × 105 protoplasts were transfected with 50 μg of plasmid DNA and 50 μg of carrier DNA. The transfected protoplasts were incubated at 22 °C for 16 h, and then they were subjected to 500 mm NaCl treatment. In control experiments, the transfected protoplasts were treated with protoplast medium. The activity of expressed NtOSAK and its mutated forms was analyzed by an in-gel kinase activity assay. To understand the mechanism of NtOSAK activation in response to hyperosmotic stress, we analyzed the effect of osmotic stress on NtOSAK expression at the mRNA and protein levels and on NtOSAK phosphorylation in BY-2 tobacco cells subjected to osmotic stress. NtOSAK Expression Is Transiently Up-regulated by Osmotic Stress—The level of NtOSAK transcript was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR in BY-2 cells untreated and treated with 250 mm NaCl or 500 mm sorbitol for various times. The effect of both stressors was very similar. We observed an approximately 2-fold increase in the amount of the NtOSAK transcript in BY-2 cells exposed to either stressor for 15 min (Fig. 1, A and B). Longer treatment caused a decline of NtOSAK transcription to the control level observed in untreated BY-2 cells. Very similar results were obtained when the cells were exposed to 100 mm NaCl or 900 mm sorbitol (data not shown). Expression of NtOSAK was detected in every tobacco tissue tested: roots, stem, and leaves. The highest expression was observed in roots and the lowest in leaves (Fig. 1C). Effect of Hyperosmotic Stress on NtOSAK Protein Level—Protein extracts prepared from BY-2 cells (untreated and treated with 250 mm NaCl for the indicated times) were subjected to Western blotting analysis using specific anti-NtOSAK antibodies. The results showed that the level of NtOSAK did not change significantly upon NaCl treatment (Fig. 1D), indicating that the induction of NtOSAK expression observed at the mRNA level does not influence the amount of the kinase inside the cell, and the transient activation of NtOSAK upon osmotic shock, documented earlier (25Mikol/ajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszyńska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178PubMed Google Scholar), is not due to changes in NtOSAK synthesis or stability. Similar results were obtained with protein extracts from BY-2 cells exposed to sorbitol (data not shown). Mapping of Phosphorylation Sites of NtOSAK—Our previous results (25Mikol/ajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszyńska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the data presented by the Hattori group (14Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto S. Minami H. Kagaya Y. Hattori T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and Belin et al. (26Belin C. de Franco P.-O. Burbousse C. Chaignepain S. Schmitter J.-M. Vavasseur A.

In order to examine if the osmotic stress influences the phosphorylation level of NtOSAK, we immunoprecipitated th"

Soluble fibronectins are polymerized into insoluble extracellular matrix (ECM) fibrils via a cell-dependent process. Recent studies indicate that the interaction of cells with the ECM form of fibronectin promotes actin organization and cell contractility, increases cell growth and migration, and enhances the tensile strength of artificial tissue constructs; ligation of integrins alone is insufficient to trigger these responses. Evidence suggests that the effect of ECM fibronectin on cell function is mediated in part by a matricryptic heparin-binding site within the first III<sub>1</sub> repeat (FNIII<sub>1</sub>). In this study, we localized the heparin-binding activity of FNIII<sub>1</sub> to a cluster of basic amino acids, Arg<sup>613</sup>, Trp<sup>614</sup>, Arg<sup>615</sup>, and Lys<sup>617</sup>. Site-directed mutagenesis of a recombinant fibronectin construct engineered to mimic the ECM form of fibronectin demonstrates that these residues are also critical for stimulating cell spreading and increasing cell proliferation. Cell proliferation has been tightly correlated with cell area. Using integrin- and heparin-binding fibronectin mutants, we found a positive correlation between cell spreading and growth when cells were submaximally spread on ECM protein-coated surfaces at the time of treatment. However, cells maximally spread on vitronectin or fibronectin still responded to the fibronectin matrix mimetic with an increase in growth, indicating that an absolute change in cell area is not required for the increase in cell proliferation induced by the matricryptic site of FNIII<sub>1</sub>."
https://openalex.org/W1974636520,"Superantigens (SAgs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe invasive infections caused by Group A Streptococcus (GAS). We had shown earlier that the expression of streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB results in partial loss of the immune-stimulating activity of the native secreted GAS SAgs, namely the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins produced by the globally disseminated M1T1 GAS strain, associated with invasive infections worldwide. In this study, we examined the susceptibility of each of the M1T1 recombinant SAgs to degradation by rSpeB. Whereas SmeZ was degraded completely within 30 min of incubation with rSpeB, SpeG, and SpeA were more resistant and SpeJ was completely unaffected by the proteolytic effects of this protease. Proteomic analyses demonstrated that the order of susceptibility of the M1T1 SAgs to SpeB proteolysis is unaltered when they are present in a mixture that reflects their native physiological status. As expected, the degradation of SmeZ abolished its immune stimulatory activity. In silico sequence disorder and structural analyses revealed that SmeZ, unlike the three other structurally related SAgs, possesses a putative SpeB cleavage site within an area of the protein likely to be exposed to the surface. The study provides evidence for the effect of subtle structural differences between highly similar SAgs on their biological activity.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 2Kotb M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The outcome of these infections is affected by a complex interplay between several surface-associated and secreted bacterial virulence factors, and host immune defenses (3Kotb M. Norrby-Teglund A. McGeer A. El-Sherbini H. Dorak M.T. Khurshid A. Green K. Peeples J. Wade J. Thomson G. Schwartz B. Low D.E. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 4Norrby-Teglund A. Kotb M. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 49: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spes) are well known for their superantigenic activity and have been shown to be pivotal in the pathogenesis of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF, the flesh-eating disease) (5Watanabe-Ohnishi R. Low D.E. McGeer A. Stevens D.L. Schlievert P.M. Newton D. Schwartz B. Kreiswirth B. Kotb M. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Norrby-Teglund A. Thulin P. Gan B.S. Kotb M. McGeer A. Andersson J. Low D.E. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 184: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). SAgs are unusual bacterial toxins that play an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases including food poisoning, autoimmunity, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) (2Kotb M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Proft T. Sriskandan S. Yang L. Fraser J.D. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2003; 9: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A major feature of SAgs is that they bind directly to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules and to the T-lymphocyte receptor (TCR) causing the activation of larger numbers of T-lymphocytes, almost 1000-fold more than those activated by regular antigens (2Kotb M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This unconventional mode of activation causes excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, and multiple organ system failure (2Kotb M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Proft T. Sriskandan S. Yang L. Fraser J.D. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2003; 9: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Schlievert P.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Whereas all GAS isolates examined thus far secrete one or more SAg, different strains can produce very different spectra of the >24 streptococcal SAgs. One of the most clinically relevant strains, the M1T1 strain, whose appearance coincided with the resurgence of severe streptococcal infections around the world in the 1980s, has the following SAg-encoding genes: speA, speF, speG, speJ, and SmeZ (9Chatellier S. Ihendyane N. Kansal R.G. Khambaty F. Basma H. Norrby-Teglund A. Low D.E. McGeer A. Kotb M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3523-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). SpeA, a horizontally acquired SAg, that has been recently introduced into this strain, has been shown to be a major player in the pathogenesis of STSS. Another streptococcal superantigen, SmeZ, was shown to play an important role in streptococcal pathogenesis (10Unnikrishnan M. Altmann D.M. Proft T. Wahid F. Cohen J. Fraser J.D. Sriskandan S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Yang L. Thomas M. Woodhouse A. Martin D. Fraser J.D. Proft T. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 3570-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).M1T1 isolates obtained from patients with invasive GAS disease of varying severity carry identical spe genotypes but may differ in their SAg expression phenotype (9Chatellier S. Ihendyane N. Kansal R.G. Khambaty F. Basma H. Norrby-Teglund A. Low D.E. McGeer A. Kotb M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3523-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Whereas the disease severity could not be correlated to the a particular M1T1 SAg, there was a highly significant inverse correlation between severity of the invasive infection and the expression of the streptococcal cysteine protease, which is an important GAS virulence factor. SpeB modifies host proteins like matrix proteins thereby facilitating bacterial invasion, and it can posttranslationally cleave and activate precursors for several cytokines and important components of the coagulation pathway (12Berge A. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9862-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Raeder R. Woischnik M. Podbielski A. Boyle M.D. Res. Microbiol. 1998; 149: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, SpeB can also modify and/or inactivate several important GAS virulence proteins, including the anti-phagocytic M protein, the anti-chemotactic C5a peptidase as well as many secreted virulence proteins (12Berge A. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9862-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Raeder R. Woischnik M. Podbielski A. Boyle M.D. Res.

Microbiol. 2004; 51: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The activity of SpeB seems to be specific as certain bacterial proteins resist its proteolytic activity (14Kansal R.G. Nizet V. Jeng A. Chuang W.J. Kotb M. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that the expression of SpeB significantly reduces the immune-stimulating activity of secreted native M1T1 SAgs (14Kansal R.G. Nizet V. Jeng A. Chuang W.J. Kotb M. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, we never saw complete loss of the superantigenic activity, even in the presence of high concentrations of secreted or added rSpeB. The partial loss of proliferative activity and the fact that the SAgs responsible for the expansion of SmeZ1 specific T cells with TCRVβ4, TCRVβ7, and TCRVβ8 was blocked in the presence of SpeB while the expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ2 was unaffected, suggested that SpeB selectively degrade some but not all SAgs produced by M1T1 GAS.The present study was designed to examine the effect of SpeB on the streptococcal SAgs individually or in combination, as they exist in their native form during infection. We demonstrate a significantly higher susceptibility of SmeZ to SpeB-proteolysis that was correlated to the presence of an exposed loop on the surface of this protein, as revealed by bioinformatics and structural analysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Recombinant GAS Superantigens—rSpeA2, rSmeZ1, rSpeG, and rSpeJ were expressed as histidine-tagged fusion proteins containing a factor Xa protease site according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI and Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Primer pairs used for the cloning were as follows: SpeA (672 bp-5′-gaggcctcaacaagaccccgatc-3′ forward and 5′-gaagcttacttggttgttaggtagact-3′ reverse), SmeZ (645 bp-5′-gaggcctttagaagtagataataattc-3′ forward and 5′-caaagcttaggagtcaatttc-3′ reverse), SpeG (630 bp-5′-taggcctgatgaaaatttaaaag-3′ forward and 5′-caagcttctagtgcgtttttaa-3′ reverse) and SpeJ (630 bp-5′-gaggcctatgaaaagaataataaaaacaa-3′ forward and 5′-gaagcttatttagtccaaaggtaa-3′ reverse). The forward and reverse primers contained StuI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively. The amplified products were purified, subcloned in pGEM-TEasy vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), and sequenced (UTHSC Molecular Resource Center). The correct cloned inserts were digested with StuI and HindIII, subcloned into the pQE30Xa vector (Qiagen), propagated in DH5α Escherichia coli cells and subsequently used to transform M15 E. coli cells. rSAg protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside) for 3 h. Proteins in the bacterial cell lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the specific expression of each rSAg protein was determined by immunoblotting with RGS-His horseradish peroxidase conjugate kit (Qiagen) and specific rabbit polyclonal anti-Spe antibodies. rSAgs were purified as His fusion proteins using Ni-NTA superflow according to manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). The purity of rSAgs was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The purified rSAgs were treated with polymyxin B agarose (Roche Applied Sciences) to remove any contaminating endotoxin. Enzymatically active rSpeB was generated by one of us (Woei-Jer Chaung) and expressed and purified as detailed earlier (14Kansal R.G. Nizet V. Jeng A. Chuang W.J. Kotb M. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Polyclonal Rabbit anti-Spe Antibodies—Specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies to SpeA were generated as previously described (16Basma H. Norrby-Teglund A. Guedez Y. McGeer A. Low D.E. El-Ahmedy O. Schwartz B. Kotb M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to SmeZ, SpeG, and SpeJ were generated by an author (T. Proft).Effect of SpeB on rSAgs—Each of the rSAgs (200 μg/ml) was incubated with the preactivated rSpeB (200 μg/ml) at 37 °C. We generated the enzymatically active form of rSpeB by incubating the 40-kDa precursor for 8 h at 37°C in the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol and EDTA. To monitor the kinetics of the effect of rSpeB on rSAgs, we aliquoted samples at 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 18-h postincubation. We stopped the SpeB enzymatic activity immediately at each time point by adding the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (Roche Applied Science) at a final concentration of 28 μm. The samples were frozen at -20 °C until further analyses. To check the specificity of the SpeB proteolytic activity, we also included a control where its activity was inhibited from the start of incubation by adding E-64. The digestion mixtures (rSAgs + rSpeB) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper. We analyzed the proteolytic degradation of the rSAgs following incubation with rSpeB by Western blots using specific anti-Spe antibodies.Proteomic Analysis of the SAg Mixture—The four recombinant M1T1 SAgs (SpeA, SpeG, SpeJ, and SmeZ) were mixed in equal amounts (10 μg/ml) and treated with 20 or 200 μg/ml of preactivated SpeB. The cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64 (final concentration of 28 μm) was used to stop the reaction after 8 h. Prior to isoelectric focusing (IEF), the SAg mixture, with and without active SpeB, was lyophilized to dryness, then resuspended in 125 μl of rehydration buffer composed of 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.16% of 40% Bio-Rad 3-10 ampholytes (Bio-Rad). IEF was performed in a Protean IEF cell, and the second dimension SDS electrophoresis was run on a Protean Minigel Dodeca apparatus (Bio-Rad) as detailed elsewhere (15Aziz R.K. Pabst M.J. Jeng A. Kansal R. Low D.E. Nizet V. Kotb M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Protein spots, visualized by silver staining, were cut from the gels, destained, and digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile/5% trifluoroacetic acid, purified on micro-C18 columns (Ziptips-Millipore), and finally eluted in the matrix solution (α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). To identify these proteins, we analyzed their tryptic peptide masses by MALDI-TOF MS using a Voyager DE RP (ABI) in the Stout Neuroscience Laboratory (UTHSC proteomic facility) and then we used the Aldente software to match the peptide masses to proteins in the databases.N-terminal Sequencing of the Strep SAg following Incubation with rSpeB—N-terminal protein sequencing (Edman degradation) was performed by Midwest Analytical, Inc.Bioinformatics Analysis of SAg Sequences—We used several bioinformatics tools to analyze the amino acid sequences of the four M1T1 SAgs as well as their secondary and tertiary structures. We aligned the primary sequences using the ClustalW analysis tool (17Cherchi G.B. Kaplan E.L. Schlievert P.M. Bitti A. Orefici G. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1992; 11: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in VectorNTI suite (Invitrogen). We used the Consensus Disorder Prediction (CDP) tool from the Center on Proteolytic Pathways (CPP).This tool implements five different disorder prediction methods: COILs, REM465, and HOTLOOPs (from disEMBL) and GlobPlot (18Linding R. Russell R.B. Neduva V. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3701-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) and DISOPRED (19Ward J.J. McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2138-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In CDP, if more than half of these applied methods calculate a residue as disordered, a consensus is generated and the residue is scored as disordered. The three-dimensional structures for SpeA and SmeZ were accessed from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the Molecular Modeling DataBase (MMDB). SpeA accession numbers: 1L0X and 1L0Y, SmeZ accession numbers: 1ET6, 1EU3. The structure models were generated using SWISS-MODEL (20Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar).Effect of SpeB on the Functional Activity of Streptococcal Sags— For assessment of the effect of SpeB on the ability of SAgs to induce lymphocyte proliferation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized blood of healthy individuals as detailed previously (21Norrby-Teglund A. Kaul R. Low D.E. McGeer A. Newton D.W. Andersson J. Andersson U. Kotb M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3057-3064PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulated with each of rSAg with or without preincubation with active rSpeB as detailed above. PBMC (105 cells/200 μl) were stimulated with serial 2-fold dilutions of either the tested rSAg ± rSpeB or the polyclonal mitogen, phytohemagglutinin A (PHA) at 1 μg/ml conc. T-cell proliferation was assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine uptake after 72 h of culture.Analysis of TCR Vβ Repertoire by Flow Cytometry—Each SAg has a characteristic Vβ specificity and preferentially activates T cells expressing certain Vβ elements. We used flow cytometry for quantitative analysis of preferential expansion of lymphocytes with specific TCR Vβs using the IO Test Beta Mark TCR Vβ Repertoire kit (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). We used a CD3-PC5-conjugate as an additional marker to enable proper gating on T-lymphocytes only. PBMC were isolated from the blood of a healthy individual by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, incubated at 107 cells/5 ml of RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, and stimulated with optimum concentration of each SAg (without or with rSpeB) or PHA at 1 μg/ml. After 72 h, the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in the presence of 10 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 to allow the regeneration of modulated T-cell receptors. The cells were then harvested, washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and stained with different antibodies per the manufacturer's instructions. We gated on the CD3-PC5 blastogenic cells and performed simultaneous analysis of 3 TCR Vβs per tube using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. We analyzed the data using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). A minimum of 30,000 cell events were acquired for the analysis.RESULTSProteolytic Degradation of Individual SAgs by SpeB—The clinically relevant M1T1 strain harbors the genes encoding for SAgs: SpeA, SpeF, SpeG, SpeH, SpeJ, and SmeZ. Using conventional methods of protein detection and identification, we observed that SpeF is completely degraded in the presence of SpeB (14Kansal R.G. Nizet V. Jeng A. Chuang W.J. Kotb M. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because most of the remaining SAgs viz. SpeJ, SpeG, and SmeZ are secreted at levels much below the detection limits of conventional methods (14Kansal R.G. Nizet V. Jeng A. Chuang W.J. Kotb M. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Proft T. Moffatt S.L. Berkahn C.J. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we extended these studies with the rSAgs.SpeA, SpeJ, SpeG, and SmeZ appear to be affected differently by the rSpeB. SmeZ was most susceptible to proteolytic degradation by SpeB as early as 30-min postincubation (Fig. 1A) and was virtually undetectable after 8 h even at the lowest SpeB concentration used (Fig. 2A). Compared with SmeZ, SpeJ was the most resistant to SpeB degradation even after 18 h of co-incubation with the highest used dose of SpeB. Whereas SpeJ and SmeZ exhibited extreme resistance and susceptibility to SpeB, respectively, the susceptibility of SpeG and SpeA to the proteolytic activity of SpeB varied. After 8 h of incubation, SpeG showed slight and partial degradation by 20 and 200 μg/ml SpeB, whereas partial degradation of SpeA was only noted after 18h of incubation and only at the highest concentration of the protease (Fig. 1, A and B). In the presence of E-64, all SAgs were completely protected from SpeB degradation (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2Proteolytic degradation of SAgs mixture by SpeB. A, all of the indicated rSAgs (200 μg/ml) were mixed together and incubated for 8 h with 0, 20, or 200 μg/ml of preactivated rSpeB. The mixtures were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Digestion of the rSAg protein was monitored by Western blots using SAg-specific antibodies. B, two-dimensional gels of mixture of rSAgs (SpeA2:A, SpeG:G, SpeJ:J, SmeZ1:Z) incubated for 8 h with 0, 20, or 200 μg/ml of preactivated rSpeB (SpeB:B). The gels were stained with silver (left panels), and the silver-stained spots were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The gels were also blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, which were probed with anti-SmeZ (middle panels) or anti-SpeA (right panels) antibodies as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The SpeA spot in the lower right panel shows some tailing; this tailing in two-dimensional gels is due to incomplete isoelectric focusing (also apparent in the silver-stained gel) and may be caused by the excess SpeB (200 μg) added in this gel that might have rendered the focusing less efficient than the middle panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus far, we have determined the differential cysteine protease activity of rSpeB on each of the four rSAgs individually. In real life, however, these proteins are coexpressed in the GAS secretome. We asked if the presence of a mixture of SAgs would have a synergistic or antagonistic effect on their susceptibility to SpeB. Because these rSAgs have similar molecular weights, we resolved them by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis before and after their incubation with the activated rSpeB. The data shown in Fig. 2A and B confirmed the higher susceptibility of SmeZ to rSpeB activity and showed that this susceptibility is not altered by the presence of the other three SAgs. The susceptibility of other three SAgs in the mixture showed a similar pattern as that seen with each one of them individually: SpeG showed only partial degradation while SpeA and SpeJ remained unaffected up to 8 h of incubation with rSpeB (Fig. 2, A and B).SpeB-driven Proteolytic Degradation of SAgs Affects their Biological Activity—Following the 8-h co-incubation with SpeB, the proliferation-inducing activity of SmeZ was reduced significantly (p = 0.003) whereas that of SpeA remained unchanged (Fig. 3A). The loss of proliferation inducing activity of SmeZ following incubation with SpeB could be inhibited by the addition of specific inhibitor E-64. The proliferation-inducing activities of SpeG and SpeJ remained unaffected by SpeB (data not shown).FIGURE 3SpeB-driven proteolytic degradation of SAgs affects their biological activity. A, T-lymphocyte proliferation inducing activity of rSmeZ and rSpeA incubated without or with 200 μg/ml rSpeB (± E64) for 8 h. The proliferation inducing activity of each SAg was tested over a wide range (500 ng to 5pg/ml of the culture media). The results shown here, however, correspond to 2.5 and 10 ng/ml of SmeZ and SpeA, respectively. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Each value represents mean ± S.D. of four values. Statistical significance of the differences in the proliferation-inducing responses with or without incubation with rSpeB was determined by Student t test (two-tailed). B, SpeB selectively degrades SmeZ but spares SpeA. Expansion profiles of lymphocytes with specific T-cell receptor Vβ in response to stimulation with SmeZ and SpeA with or without incubation with 200 μg/ml of rSpeB for 8 h. The final concentrations used for stimulation of SmeZ and SpeA were 5 and 10 ng/ml of the culture media, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The proliferation results were supported by TCR Vβ analyses of the human T cells stimulated with a representative SpeB-resistant SAg, SpeA, or a SpeB-sensitive SAg, SmeZ. The skewed pattern of TCRVβ repertoire in response to stimulation with SpeA was not altered following preincubation with SpeB. By contrast, the ability of SmeZ to induce the expansion of T cells bearing TCRVβ4, TCRVβ7.1, and TCRVβ8, was diminished when the SAg was preincubated with SpeB (Fig. 3B), with a marked reduction in the number of activated T cells bearing TCRVβ8 elements.Specificity of SpeB Degradation—SpeB degraded the His tag on all the rSAgs used. This was first suggested by the appearance of a slightly faster migrating species in Westerns of SAgs preincubated with active SpeB, including those that resisted its proteolytic effects (Fig. 1A), and later confirmed when we probed the blots with anti-His antibodies and were unable to detect any SAg bands (data not shown), yet the proteins were readily detected at their expected size by their specific antibodies. These results prompted us to investigate the SpeB-specific cleavage sites on each of these SAgs and to explore why only SmeZ is degraded completely while other SAgs are not.N-terminal sequencing of the protein fragments followed by amino acid alignment revealed that all four SAgs were cleaved between the glutamate (E) and glycine (G) residues just after the histidine tag (Fig. 4). These two residues do not belong to the cloned proteins but are rather encoded by the expression vector as part of the factor Xa cleavage site that was engineered between the His tag and the cloned protein to facilitate the removal of the His tag. Although SmeZ was also initially cleaved at the same site (15 min postincubation with SpeB), it was completely degraded by 30 min.FIGURE 4Sites of cleavage of the various rSAgs by SpeB: alignment of the amino acid sequences of rSpeA2, rSpeG, rSpeJ, and rSmeZ1. All of the SAgs studied were cleaved at the N-terminal end of the first G in the protein (see arrow), thereby removing all extra amino acids added onto the protein as part of the His tag included in this expression vector. Sequences are aligned by ClustalW tool available in VectorNTI suite. Amino acids likely to be in disordered areas are shown in uppercase letters. The flexible loop encompassing the GSSYKS sequence in SmeZ1 (shown in a dashed box) is expected to be the most vulnerable site for SpeB cleavage. In the same loop, note that SpeA2 has an E instead of the K found in SmeZ1 and it is possible that this substitution may have rendered SpeA resistant to SpeB. Also, the extra P found in the SpeA but not the SmeZ1 loop, may restrict the flexibility of the loop and may contribute as well to its protection from SpeB proteolysis. (SpeA2 and SmeZ1 are the specific alleles of speA and SmeZ present in the M1T1 GAS.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Bioinformatics Analysis Reveals a Putative SpeB Target Loop in SmeZ—The consensus target for cleavage by SpeB has been suggested to contain a hydrophobic residue (isoleucine or valine) at the P2 site and a positively charged residue (preferably lysine) at P1 (23Chen C.Y. Luo S.C. Kuo C.F. Lin Y.S. Wu J.J. Lin M.T. Liu C.C. Jeng W.Y. Chuang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17336-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Nomizu M.

Bioinformatics analysis of the primary sequence and the predicted secondary structure of the SAgs used in this study did not reveal a preferential abundance of the SpeB preferred sites in SmeZ when compared with the other SAgs. Alternatively, a plausible explanation of why SmeZ is totally degraded within an hour while SpeG, SpeA, and SpeJ are spared could lie in the folds of the tertiary structures of these proteins. Accordingly, it appears that the tertiary structure of SmeZ may make some SpeB-vulnerable targets exposed whereas these may be sequestered in other SAgs. Indeed, it was suggested that large local motions proximate to the scissile bonds are required for proteolysis and that the prime determinant for limited proteolysis is this ability to unfold locally (25Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we used the CDP method (see “Experimental Procedures”) to predict intrinsically disordered regions in the four rSAgs. Subsequently, we looked for the SpeB extended specificity pattern [ILVFMYW]K in regions predicted to be disordered to find potential cut sites of SpeB. The only site in disordered region was found in SmeZ, boosting the experimental observation of its selective susceptibility to rSpeB. On the other hand, the homologous area in the other SAgs"

In the present study, we examine the mechanism whereby apigenin regulates normal human keratinocyte differentiation. Expression of involucrin (hINV), a marker of keratinocyte differentiation, is increased by differentiating agents via a protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), Ras, MEKK1, MEK3 cascade that increases AP1 factor level and AP1 factor binding to DNA elements in the hINV promoter. We show that apigenin inhibits this response. Apigenin suppresses the 12-O-tetradeconylphorbol-13-acetate-dependent increase in AP1 factor expression and binding to the hINV promoter and the increase in hINV promoter activity. Apigenin also inhibits the increase in promoter activity observed following overexpression of PKCδ, constitutively active Ras, or MEKK1. The suppression of PKCδ activity is associated with reduced phosphorylation of PKCδ-Y311. The physiological importance of this phosphorylation event was confirmed by showing that the PKCδ phosphorylation-defective mutant, PKCδ-Y311F, is less able to increase hINV promoter activity. Activation of hINV promoter activity by the green tea polyphenol, (-)-epigellocathecin-3-gallate, is also inhibited by apigenin, suggesting that the two chemopreventive agents can produce opposing actions in keratinocytes. Additional studies show that the apigenin-dependent suppression of differentiation is associated with reduced cell proliferation but that there is no evidence of apoptosis.

Flavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds present in plants. Epidemiological studies suggest that flavonoids play an important role in the prevention of disease (1Hertog M.G.

Apigenin has been reported to act via several mechanisms, including promotion of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, inhibition of cell transformation, inhibition of mutagenesis, and suppression of signal transduction, gap junction function, and angiogenesis (14Chaumontet C.

Topical application of apigenin on skin suppresses ornithine decarboxylase activity and reduces the number and the size of skin tumors induced by chemical carcinogen or UVB exposure (16Wei H. Tye L.

In the human-derived immortalized cell line, HaCaT, apigenin treatment suppresses COX-2 expression via a mechanism that involves inhibition of Akt (18Van Dross R.T. Hong X. Pelling J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 44: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Apigenin also causes G2/M arrest in murine keratinocytes (9Lepley D.M. Li B. Birt D.F. Pelling J.C.

However, despite the demonstrated activity of apigenin in inhibiting skin cancer and the ability of apigenin to inhibit the proliferation of keratinocyte cell lines, the impact of apigenin treatment on primary human epidermal keratinocytes has not been extensively studied. This is somewhat surprising, since these cells, due to their location on the body surface, are the cell type directly challenged by exposure to UVB and/or environmental carcinogens. Thus, it is important to understand the impact of chemopreventive agent treatment on this cell type. Keratinocytes undergo a process of differentiation in which proliferating undifferentiated cells, located in the basal epidermal layers, give rise to cells that differentiate as they migrate into the suprabasal layers (21Watt F.M. Green H. Nature. 1982; 295: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 22Watt F.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These cells ultimately undergo differentiation-related cell death and are lost from the body surface (24Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Cells can also be lost from the epidermis by apoptotic mechanisms. Apoptosis is not frequent in normal epidermis but is observed in epidermis that has been exposed to ultraviolet irradiation (25Murphy G. Young A.R. Wulf H.C. Kulms D. Schwarz T. Exp. Dermatol. 2001; 10: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Kim A.L. Labasi J.M. Zhu Y. Tang X. McClure K. Gabel C.A. Athar M. Bickers D.R. J. Invest.

Since normal differentiation and apoptosis are two major mechanisms for removing damaged cells from epidermis, it is important to understand how chemopreventive agents impact these processes. In the present study, we examine the effect of apigenin on normal human keratinocyte signal transduction, apoptosis, and proliferation. We use involucrin gene expression as a marker of skin cell differentiation (27Eckert R.L. Yaffe M.B. Crish J.F. Murthy S. Rorke E.A. Welter J.F. J. Invest.

Involucrin expression is restricted to the suprabasal epidermal layers (spinous and granular layers) during normal keratinocyte differentiation and is considered an early marker of the differentiation process (31Eckert R.L.

The AP1 and C/EBP factors interact with specific binding sites on the hINV promoter to increase gene expression (34Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem.

Our present studies show that apigenin inhibits the differentiation-associated increase in hINV gene expression via interference with PKCδ and MAPK signal transduction. In particular, apigenin treatment inhibits phosphorylation of PKCδ tyrosine 311, an event that is required for optimal hINV promoter activity. This action ultimately results in a reduction in AP1 factor expression, leading to a loss of differentiation-associated responses. (-)-Epigallocathecin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a chemopreventive agent that is effective in reducing the impact of environmental agents on epidermis (37Agarwal R. Katiyar S.K. Khan S.G. Mukhtar H.

Our previous studies show that EGCG treatment increases hINV gene expression by activating the MAPK signaling cascade described above (32Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Our present studies show that apigenin inhibits this EGCG-dependent increase in keratinocyte differentiation. However, apigenin does not stimulate keratinocyte apoptosis as measured by assessing procaspase cleavage and mitochondrial stability. These findings suggest that chemopreventive agents differentially influence keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis, a finding that must be considered when these agents are utilized to treat skin cancer.

Plasmids—The hINV reporter plasmids, encoding various lengths of hINV upstream promoter sequence, fused to the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2-basic, have been previously described (36Welter J.F.

Ohno, wild type MEKK1 was obtained from Dr. Dennis Templeton, and constitutively active Ras (RasG12V) was generously provided by Dr. Michael Simonson (41Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L.

A plasmid, pPKCδ-EGFP, which encodes PKCδ as a PKCδ-EGFP fusion protein, was used as a template to create PKCδ-Y311F-EGFP using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-GTCTGTCGGAATATTCCAGGGATTTGAG (sense) and 5′-CTCAAATCCCTGGAATATTCCGACAGAC (antisense). The presence of the mutation that converts tyrosine 311 to phenylalanine was confirmed by DNA sequencing. When convenient, PKCδ-EGFP and PKCδ-Y311F-EGFP are referred to as PKCδ-Y311 and PKCδ-Y311F. Cell Culture, Transfection, and hINV Promoter Assay—Primary human foreskin keratinocytes were cultured as previously described (32Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 39Balasubramanian S. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24007-24014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Third passage keratinocytes, grown in 10-cm2 dishes, were used when 70% confluent. For transfection, 4 μl of Fugene-6 reagent was added to 96 μl of KSFM, and the solution was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The mixture was then added to 1 μg of involucrin promoter reporter plasmid or, for co-transfection experiments, to 1 μg of involucrin reporter plasmid and 1 μg of kinase expression plasmid. This solution was then incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then added directly to the cells in 2 ml of KSFM. The final DNA concentration in all groups was adjusted to 2 μg of DNA per 4 μl of Fugene-6 reagent per 10-cm2 dish by the addition of empty expression vector. After 24 h, the cells were treated with KSFM in the presence or absence of TPA and/or apigenin. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. All assays were performed in triplicate, each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times, and luciferase activity was normalized per μg of protein. The transfection efficiency was determined using a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid (42Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27214-27220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation—For cell proliferation assays, keratinocytes were plated at 10,000 cells/cm2 in 10-cm2 dishes in KSFM and allowed to attach for 24 h. The cells were then treated by the addition of fresh KSFM or KSFM supplemented with 50 ng of TPA/ml in the absence or presence of apigenin. Treatment was continued for 4 days with the addition of fresh medium and TPA/apigenin every 2 days. The cells were then harvested with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.025% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA and counted using a Coulter counter. Cell Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—Total cell extracts were prepared from cultured human epidermal keratinocytes as reported previously (32Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 39Balasubramanian S. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24007-24014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bradford Bio-Rad protein assay was used to determine protein concentration. Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 8 or 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk solution and then incubated with a primary antibody, washed, and exposed to a corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Secondary antibody binding was visualized using a chemiluminescent detection system. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Gel Mobility Shift Assay— Human epidermal keratinocytes (75% confluent) growing in KSFM were treated without or with 50 ng/ml TPA in the absence or presence of apigenin 20 μm for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were isolated in the presence of proteinase inhibitors as reported previously (32Balasubramanian S. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1828-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 39Balasubramanian S. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24007-24014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assay was utilized to identify the transcription factors binding to the hINV promoter AP1-1 site. For mobility shift assays, a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 200 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml poly(dL-dC), 4 μg of nuclear extract, and 100,000 cpm double-stranded, 32P-labeled AP1-1 site oligonucleotide (5′-TGTGGTGAGTCAGGAAGGGGTT) was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The AP1-1 site is underlined (36Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Radioinert DNA competitor was added at a 20-fold molar excess for competition studies. For the gel supershift assay, AP1 factor-specific antibody (4 μg) was added to the reaction mixture after the initial incubation, and the incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at room temperature. An anti-IgG antibody was used as a control. The complexes were electrophoresed on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, and the radioactivity was detected using autoradiography. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Subconfluent keratinocytes, grown in KSFM, were treated with TPA (50 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 20 μm apigenin for 24 h. The cells were then processed, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry (44Balasubramanian S. Chandraratna R.A. Eckert R.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4257-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Apigenin Suppresses Involucrin Gene Expression—Involucrin serves as a marker of keratinocyte terminal differentiation (27Eckert R.L. Yaffe M.B. Crish J.F. Murthy S. Rorke E.A. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 613-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Yaffe M.B. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 3-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and involucrin expression is increased in cultured keratinocytes following treatment with differentiating agents, such as TPA (36Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 41Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To assess the impact on keratinocyte differentiation, we examined the effect of apigenin treatment on the increase in hINV promoter activity that is observed following TPA treatment. Keratinocytes were transfected with pINV-2473, a plasmid that encodes the full-length hINV upstream regulatory region and transcription start site linked to the luciferase gene (36Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and then treated with TPA in the absence or presence of apigenin. As shown in Fig. 1A, TPA treatment causes an 8-fold increase in pINV-2473 activity, and apigenin produces a concentration-dependent reduction in the TPA-dependent increase. To assess the physiologic relevance of this regulation, we monitored the effects of apigenin on endogenous involucrin expression. Fig. 1B shows that TPA treatment causes an increase in endogenous hINV protein level and that this increase is inhibited by co-treatment with 20 μm apigenin. Fig. 1C summarizes the results from four separate experiments. hINV protein level increases 3.9-fold in response to TPA treatment, and the increase is consistently inhibited by apigenin treatment. To assess whether apigenin influences the level of other keratinocyte differentiation markers, we monitored the impact of TPA and apigenin treatment on type 1 transglutaminase and filaggrin expression (24Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, apigenin inhibits the TPA-dependent increase in level of these differentiation markers. Apigenin Regulates Involucrin Promoter Activity—We next performed experiments designed to identify the DNA element(s) responsible for the TPA and apigenin-dependent regulation of hINV promoter activity. Previous studies show that key regulatory elements are located in the involucrin promoter proximal regulatory region (nucleotides -241/-7) (36Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, TPA treatment produces a 6-fold increase in pINV-241 and pINV-128; moreover, this response is abolished by treatment with 20 μm apigenin. In contrast, pINV-110 and pINV-41 are not regulated by these agents. This suggests that key TPA and apigenin-responsive regulatory elements reside in the -241/-110 segment, which encodes an AP1 site, AP1-1 (36Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Subsequent studies show that elimination of this site, in construct pINV-241(AP1-1m), results in a loss of regulation by both agents (Fig. 2C). In contrast, mutation of an ets factor binding site (EBS-2), results in a 10-fold increase in overall promoter activity but does not eliminate the TPA and apigenin-associated regulation, suggesting that the response is specific for the AP1-1 site. The EBS-2 site has a general suppressor activity (41Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Apigenin Inhibits Signaling Kinase-dependent hINV Promoter Activity—Previous studies show that an nPKC, Ras, MEKK1, MEK3 cascade regulates AP1 factor level and binding to the hINV promoter AP1-1 site (41Efimova T.

In fact, apigenin has been reported to interfere with PKC function by competing with adenosine triphosphate (49Lin J.K. Chen Y.C. Huang Y.T. Lin-Shiau S.Y. J. Cell. Biochem.

To assess these possibilities, we examined the ability of apigenin to inhibit promoter activity induced by overexpression of PKCδ,-ϵ, and -η, constitutively active Ras, and MEKK1. It has previously been established that expression of these kinases stimulates hINV promoter activity (31Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Efimova T. Dashti S.R. Deucher A. Bone F. Adhikary G. Huang G.

As shown in Fig. 3A, the novel PKC isoforms, PKCδ, -ϵ, and -η, increase human involucrin promoter activity when compared with empty vector. Moreover, treatment with 20 μm apigenin suppresses nPKC-dependent hINV promoter activation, suggesting a possible impact on PKC function. Fig. 3B shows that apigenin partially inhibits activation in response to constitutively active Ras (caRas) and nearly"

Serine proteases have been shown to play an important role in invasion by related Apicomplexan parasites such as the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Here we demonstrate the presence of two dominant serine proteases in asexual B. divergens using a biotinylated fluorophosphonate probe. One of these active serine proteases (p48) and its precursors were recognized by anti-PfSUB1 antibodies. These antibodies were used to clone the gene encoding a serine protease using a B. divergens cDNA library. BdSub-1 is a single copy gene with no introns. The deduced gene product (BdSUB-1) clearly belongs to the subtilisin superfamily and shows significant homology to Plasmodium subtilisins, with the highest degree of sequence identity around the four catalytic residues. Like subtilisin proteases in other Apicomplexan parasites, BdSUB-1 undergoes two steps of processing during activation in the secretory pathway being finally converted to an active form (p48). The mature protease is concentrated in merozoite dense granules, apical secretory organelles involved in erythrocyte invasion. Anti-PfSUB1 antibodies have a potent inhibitory effect on erythrocyte invasion by B. divergens merozoites in vitro. This report demonstrates conservation of the molecular machinery involved in erythrocyte invasion by these two Apicomplexan parasites and paves the way for a comparative analysis of other molecules that participate in this process in the two parasites.

Babesiosis, caused by infection with intraerythrocytic parasites of the genus Babesia, is one of the most common infections of free living animals worldwide and is gaining increasing interest as an emerging zoonosis (a disease communicable from animals to humans) (1Spielman A. Wilson M.L. Levine J.F. Piesman J. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1985; 30: 439-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Babesia are transmitted by their tick vectors during the taking of a blood meal from the vertebrate host (1Spielman A. Wilson M.L. Levine J.F. Piesman J. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1985; 30: 439-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2Lantos P.M. Krause P.J. Pediatr. Ann. 2002; 31: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Babesiosis has long been recognized as an economically important disease of cattle, but only in the last 30 years has Babesia been recognized as an important pathogen in man. Human babesiosis is caused by one of several babesial species that have distinct geographical distributions based on the presence of competent hosts (3Homer M.J. Aguilar-Delfin I. Telford S.R. Krause 3rd, P.J. Persing D.H. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 451-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In North America, babesiosis is caused predominantly by Babesia microti (4Dammin G.J. Spielman A. Benach J.L. Piesman J. Hum. Pathol. 1981; 12: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a rodent borne parasite, and also occasionally by two newly recognized species, WA1 (5Persing D.H. Herwaldt B.L. Glaser C.

In Europe, human babesiosis is considerably rarer but more lethal, and is caused by the bovine pathogen Babesia divergens (7Garnham P.C. Trans R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1980; 74: 153-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The spectrum of disease is broad, ranging from an apparently silent infection to a fulminant, malaria-like disease, which can be fatal. When present, symptoms typically are nonspecific (fever, headache, and myalgia). A number of factors have contributed to the “emergence” of human babesiosis, including increased awareness among physicians, changing ecology, and an increased population of immunocompromised individuals susceptible to infection. Because 1980, over 500 cases of human infections have been reported (9Kjemtrup A.M. Conrad P.A. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Parasites that live in red cells (RBCs) 2The abbreviations used are: RBC, red blood cell; WA-1, B. divergens Washington-1; MO-1, B. divergens Missouri-1; BdSUB-1, B. divergens subtilisin 1; PfSUB-1, P. falciparum subtilisin 1; PfSUB-2, P. falciparum subtilisin 2; TgSUB-1, T. gondii subtilisin; FP, fluorophosphonate probe; Ab, antibody; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ORF, open reading frame; UTR, untranslated region; BFA, Brefeldin A; PI, preimmune rabbit; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. have rather ingenious ways of gaining entry to these cells. The best studied is Plasmodium spp, the etiological agent of malaria. Like Plasmodium, Babesia merozoites enter RBCs using an active invasion process that is mediated by multiple receptor-ligand interactions. The various steps in the invasion process in both Plasmodium (10Hermentin P. Enders B. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1984; : 121-141PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dvorak J.A. Miller L.H. Whitehouse W.C. Shiroishi T.

They are identical in both apicomplexans, except for the fact that soon after entry of the Babesia merozoite, the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane disappears. The invasion, growth and maturation of both Plasmodium and Babesia within the human erythrocyte is accompanied by both morphological and biochemical changes in the RBC plasma membrane, which can be attributed to the activity of specific, parasite derived factors. Parasite derived proteases are of particular importance as they play a pivotal role in both the entry and the exit of the parasite by processing both parasite adhesins and host erythrocyte proteins (14Barale J.C. Blisnick T. Fujioka H. Alzari P.M. Aikawa M. Braun-Breton C. Langsley G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6445-6450Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Miller S.A. Binder E.M.

We therefore hypothesize that serine proteases function during B. divergens merozoite invasion, much like they do in Plasmodium falciparum, in two potential ways: the proteolysis of RBC surface and skeletal proteins and the processing of parasite proteins. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the hydrolysis of the RBC surface and cytoskeletal proteins in malaria, including the entire repertoire of enzymes involved, and how parasite proteases come into contact with the RBC proteins. However, recently the “sheddase” that is responsible for the proteolytic shedding of P. falciparum surface proteins during invasion was identified as a membrane-bound subtilisin-like protease called PfSUB2 (16Harris P.K. Yeoh S. Dluzewski A.R. O'Donnell R.A. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Blackman M.J. PLoS. Pathog. 2005; 1: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Proteases in Babesia, in contrast to Plasmodium, have not garnered much research attention besides a single report of a putative cathepsin l-like cysteine protease in B. equi (19Holman P.J. Hsieh M.M. Nix J.L. Bendele K.G. Wagner G.G. Ball J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As proteases serve important roles in the metabolism, development and infectivity of many protozoan parasites they are attractive targets for anti-parasite chemotherapy. A full understanding of the biological role of these enzymes should expedite identification of optimal chemotherapeutic targets and the development of optimal inhibitors of these proteases as anti-parasitic drugs, both for veterinary and human use. In this article, we report the identification of a novel B. divergens gene, Bdsub-1, that encodes a subtilisin-like serine protease, that is found in the apically situated dense granules, suggesting a function during invasion. This is the first molecular characterization of a protease from any Babesia spp. The B. divergens-human RBC invasion model that we employed is an accurate reflection of the invasion process in vivo. It also offers several technical advantages over the malaria culture system for studying different aspects of invasion: the high yield of parasites (>70%), the short life cycle of the parasite (8 h) and the higher infectivity and viability of free merozoites that can be obtained in vitro. The development of the B. divergens, human RBC model, offers the ability of directly testing parasite invasion of the RBC, using viable merozoites of B. divergens, which is not feasible with P. falciparum. Thus, the study of proteases participating in B. divergens invasion may also advance our understanding of the biology of P. falciparum invasion. Parasite Propagation—Blood stages cultures of the B. divergens (Bd Rouen 1986 strain) were maintained in vitro in human A+ RBCs using RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 10% human serum and sodium bicarbonate solution 7.5% (w/v) (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 90% C02, 5% nitrogen, and 5% oxygen, as previously described (20Gorenflot A. Brasseur P. Precigout E. L'Hostis M. Marchand A. Schrevel J. Parasitol. Res. 1991; 77: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Purification of Free, Viable Merozoites—Cultures were grown to ∼60% parasitemia (21Precigout E. Valentin A. Carcy B. Gorenflot A. Nakamura K. Aikawa M. Schrevel J. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Infected RBCs and culture supernatants were centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was first filtered through 5 μm and 1.2 μm reinforced acrylic copolymer membranes (Versapor 3000 and Versapor 1200, Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). Filtration was performed at 4 °C to avoid merozoite aggregation. Merozoites were then pelleted at 2000 × g for 10 min. 40 ml of supernatant yielded ∼108 merozoites. Free merozoites were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for electron microscopy or resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) and sonicated for Western blot. They were resuspended in RPMI 1640 for use in in vitro growth inhibitory assays. Binding of Biotinylated Fluorophosphonate Probe (FP) to Parasite Proteins—Adapting previous protocols (22Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), B. divergens infected cells were lysed with 0.15% saponin (equivolume), at 37 °C for 10 min, to release parasites, 5× volume of PBS was added to the suspension and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Following protocols in other systems (22Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), the B. divergens lysate was prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 and protein concentration adjusted to 1 μg/μl. 200 μl of this lysate was used for the reaction with FP-biotin for 30 min at 25 °C. The lysate was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with one-tenth volume of avidin-agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich) to deplete endogenous avidin-binding proteins. After a brief centrifugation to pellet the beads, the soluble fraction was removed and supplemented with FP-biotin (prepared as a stock reagent in Me2SO) to a final concentration of 2 μm. The reaction was quenched by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer before separation on SDS-PAGE and transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked in TBS with 1% Tween overnight at 4 °C, and probed with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad, 1:2000 dilution) in TBS-Tween with 1% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at 25 °C. The blot was washed with TBS-Tween three times (10 min/wash), treated with SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagents (Bio-Rad) and exposed to film for 0.1–5 min before development. Production and Immunoscreening of a B. divergens cDNA Expression Library—Total RNA was isolated from cultures with ∼60% of parasitemia using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) and chloroform extraction. The cDNA synthesis and construction of the library was performed by Lofstrand Labs, (Gaithersburg, MD). The cDNA synthesis was carried out using the synthesis kit from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, the cDNA was column purified to remove species <400 bp, and ligated into EcoRI-XhoI-digested λzap Express vector (Stratagene). The primary library had >98% recombinants and contained 2 × 106 pfu. The B. divergens cDNA library was screened with polyclonal antibodies specific for the PfSUB1 mature protease domain (PfSUB1m) (23Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using standard protocols. Positive clones were purified by the same serum selection procedure and amplified by PCR using T3 and T7 universal primers, and the products were sequenced. DNA sequences and predicted amino acid sequence comparisons were carried out with the GenBank™+EMBL+ DDBJ+PDB and all non-redundant GenBank™ CDS Translations +PDB+SwissProt+PIR+PRF databases, using BLAST and PSI-BLAST algorithm (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar), respectively. Polymerase Chain Reaction—PCR was carried out using TaqDNA polymerase (Promega). Primers for amplification by PCR of the catalytic domain (3′-region of bdsub-1 gene) were BdSub-1cdF (5′-ACTACAGAGAGGCCACCGAACGGC-3′) and BdSub-1cdR (5′-TCACTTTTCCTAGGTGGCAGAACC-3′). Primers prepared from bdsub-1 cDNA for amplification by PCR and RT-PCR of a genomic sequence of the bdsub-1 gene and the bdsub-1 ORF, using genomic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA (tRNA), respectively, were Bdsub-1F1 (5′-AGCCGCCCATACGATGGTTAAAAGC-3′) and Bdsub-1R1 (5′-ATCTAGATAATAATATTGACCTTATC-3′). For the PCR, 30 ng of B. divergens gDNA was used and 5 μg of tRNA for the RT-PCR. The extension of the 5′-end of the bdsub-1 cDNA was obtained by PCR, using standard PCR protocols and maxipools prepared from aliquots of the amplified B. divergens expression library. The primer Bdsub-1R2 (5′-GGAACTTAACGGCATCCAAGGCGT-3′) that derives from bdsub-1 cDNA sequence. DNA encoding the putative propeptide of BdSUB-1 was amplified by PCR from the bdsub-1 cDNA using the oligonucleotide primers, PF1 (5′-ATGGTTAAAGCTTTGA-3′) and PR1 (5′-CTTAACATCGCCGTTCGG-3′). The amplified products were subcloned into Topo TA vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. The constructs were maintained in the TOP10 Escherichia coli strain (Invitrogen) and then sequenced on both strands. All sequencing reactions were performed by the dideoxynucleotide (Sequenase) method using custom-synthesized primers. DNA sequences and predicted amino acid sequence comparisons were performed with the GenBank™+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB and all non-redundant GenBank™ CDS Translations +PDB+SwissProt+PIR+PRF databases, using BLAST and PSI-BLAST algorithm from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar). Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic B. divergens DNA was analyzed by high stringency Southern blot (65 °C) using a digoxigenin-labeled probe (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) designed to encompass the catalytic domain (3′-region of the gene) by PCR using primer pairs BdSub-1cdF (5′-ACTACAGAGAGGCCACCGAACGGC-3′) and BdSub-1cdR (5′-TCACTTTTCCTAGGTGGCAGAACC-3′). B. divergens gDNA was digested with a variety of restriction enzymes: XhoI and PstI that do not digest within the gene and SalI, NdeI, HindIII, and BglII that digest within the gene. 10 μg of each digest was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane. Following overnight hybridization, the blot was washed twice for 5 min each in 2× SSC and finally for 20 min each in 0.5× SSC at 65 °C. Bound probe was detected with disodium-2-chloro-5(4 methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3.2′-[5-chloro]tricycle[3.3.1.1.3.7] decan}-4-yl)-1-phenyl phosphate (CDP-Star™, Roche Applied Science). Protein Expression and Purification and Antiserum Production—DNA encoding Leu24–Lys186 of BdSUB-1 was amplified by PCR from bdsub-1 cDNA using the oligonucleotide primers, PF1 5′ and PR15′and cloned into the expression plasmid vector pGEX-6T1 (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. E. coli strain BL21-gold (DE3) plysS (Stratagene) was transformed with the BdSUB-1p expression plasmid. 250 ml of SOB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma Aldrich) was inoculated with 1 ml of fresh overnight culture and grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6 prior to induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h of induction, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in B-Per bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture that contains 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), pepstatinA, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the soluble fraction was used to purify the recombinant protein (called BdSUB-1p). The protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Polyclonal sera were raised against BdSUB-1p in mice using standard immunization protocols. Briefly, 6–8-week-old male BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 25 μg of BdSUB-1p in 0.1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma Aldrich,). Mice were boosted 14 days later with 25 μg of BdSUB-1 in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma Aldrich). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot assays, cultured parasites were solubilized into three volumes of a saponin buffer (0.15% of saponin in PBS) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were washed with PBS by centrifugation for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma Aldrich) and sonicated. Free merozoite lysates were prepared from sonicates of merozoites suspended in PBS and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After centrifugation, the supernantant was collected and boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting onto Immuno-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), which were blocked in blocking solution: Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma Aldrich). Blots were incubated with mouse anti-BdSUB-1p antiserum diluted 1:100 in blocking solution, for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then treated with horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce, 1:10,000). Blots were washed with washing buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl and 0.05% Tween-20). Antigen detection was by ECL (SuperSignal® WestPico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce). Electron Microscopy—Free B. divergens merozoites were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, for 1 h at 4°C, washed in 0.1 m buffer, pH 7.4 and treated with 50 mm ammonium chloride to quench remaining aldehydes. The fixed merozoites were then dehydrated and embedded in LR-White Resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Thin sections of embedded parasites were mounted on parlodion-covered nickel grids, blocked in 2% BSA, and probed with PfSUB1m antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed in buffer containing BSA and Tween 20 and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 6-nm gold particles (Electron Microscopy Science) or goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 5-nm gold particles (Amersham Biosciences). After staining with uranyl acetate, sections were observed under a Philips 410 electron microscope (Holland). Immunoprecipitation—Freshly cultured parasites were washed and resuspended in methionine-free medium (RPMI 1640, MP Biomedicals, Inc, Aurora, OH). 200 μCi ml–1 of [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) was added, and parasites were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Parasites were lysed in NETT buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) using a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and centrifuged to collect the supernatant. Lysates were precleared with protein G (Amersham Biosciences) before antibody addition. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added and washed extensively with NETTS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm, NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and NETT buffers. Protein was eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and run on SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, fixed with fixing solution (25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid) for 30 min and enhanced with Amplify™ fluorographic solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, dried under vacuum, and exposed to film for autoradiography. Monitoring the Effect of Brefeldin A—The effects of brefeldin A (BFA, Sigma Aldrich) on BdSUB-1 processing during secretory transport was monitored using 35S-radiolabeled B. divergens cultures. The drug was prepared as a stock solution in methanol at 1 mg ml–1 and then added to parasite cultures to a final concentration of 40 μgml–1 BFA. Methanol was added to the control cultures, and cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 90% CO2, 5% nitrogen, and 5% oxygen for 1 h. Samples were washed in PBS, lysed in saponin buffer, and analyzed by Western blot using the anti-PfSUB1m antibodies. In Vitro Growth Inhibitory Assays (GIA)—To ensure the antigen specificity of antibody-mediated inhibition, the total preimmune rabbit (PI) and PfSUB1m IgGs were purified using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with IgG binding and elution buffers (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendation and dialyzed with PBS. RPMI supplemented with 10% of human serum and 5% of RBC (6 × 108 RBC) were preincubated at 37 °C in a 90% CO2, 5% nitrogen, and 5% oxygen for 30 min in 2-cm wells. Purified IgG from PI or PfSUB1m or PBS (control solution) and 2 × 106 free merozoites were added to the prewarmed medium in triplicate wells. The final concentration of Ab in the GIA was 100 μg ml–1 in a 1.2-ml final volume. Samples were incubated at 37 °C with 90% CO2, 5% nitrogen, 5% oxygen. The invasion efficiency was checked after 24 h and quantitation of parasitemia was performed by counting the total number of intracellular parasites present in 1 × 104 RBC at ×100 magnification using an Eclipse E 600 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo Japan), after Giemsa staining of smears. Functional Profiling of B. divergens Serine Proteases—We applied a systems level of analysis as our first approach to the study of serine proteases in B. divergens invasion. Newly developed, potent, selective probes are available for different classes of proteases that allow simultaneous monitoring of the activities of multiple proteases even in crude protein mixture. The chemical FP probe (kind gift from M. Sajjid) (Fig. 1A) specifically directed against the active site of serine proteases (22Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) identified the expression of all serine proteases present in B. divergens crude extracts by virtue of their catalytic activity. Fig. 1B shows these results. Two dominant bands of protease activity were detected at ∼48 and ∼75 kDa, which we postulate correspond to two distinct serine proteases. Important controls in this experiment included a parasite extract that was heat-denatured before the addition of the probe (lane 2) and also a RBC extract (not shown) to ensure detected protease bands were of Babesia origin. Information gathered from the use of this active site-directed probe enabled us to assess the number of dominant serine proteases that exist in the intracellular asexual B. divergens parasite. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis Reveal Cross-reactive B. divergens Subtilisin Proteins—Because malaria proteases are likely to act on similar substrates like RBC membrane proteins, we decided to use tools derived from P. falciparum serine proteases to identify potential homologues in B. divergens. A similar strategy was used by Miller et al. (15Miller S.A. Binder E.M. Blackman M.J. Carruthers V.B. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45341-45348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) who used a rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for the catalytic region of PfSUB1 (PfSUB1m) to clone and characterize TgSUB-1 in T. gondii. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with the anti-PfSUB1m antibodies revealed cross-reactive B. divergens proteins in the lysates (Fig. 2, A and B). A specific dominant band at ∼48 kDa (p48) and a minor band at ∼75 kDa (p75) were identified by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, both these correspond approximately to the size of the mature protease (47 kDa) and proprotease (82 kDa) forms of PfSUB1 (23Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and to the bands detected by FP-biotin (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis with the same antibodies (Fig. 2B) revealed three BdSUB-1 protein bands p75, p48 and a new band of ∼55 kDa, not seen in the immunoprecipitation analysis. These results suggested the presence of B. divergens subtilisin-like proteases similar to those found in P. falciparum. Cloning of bdsub-1 by Immunoscreening of a cDNA Expression Library—To identify the putative serine protease observed by immunoprecipitation and to demonstrate that it is indeed a subtilisin; a B. divergens cDNA expression library was prepared and immunoscreened using the anti-PfSUB1m serum. The antibody screening of 1 × 105 pfu yielded four immunopositive plaques, each around 2 kb. All 4 clones were identical. One of these clones (bd-1) was sequenced in both directions and further characterized. Complete sequence analysis of the cDNA clone showed a single contiguous sequence 2051-bp long containing an uninterrupted ORF of 1701 bp encoding a protein (BdSUB-1) of 566 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 63,683 daltons and a isoelectric point of 8.74. To confirm the bdsub-1 ORF, the 5′-end of the molecule was amplified by a PCR-cloning approach, using standard PCR protocols and maxi pools prepared from aliquots of the amplified B. divergens expression library, as well as primers derived from both the λ-Zap express vector and the known bdsub-1 (T3 and Bdsub-1R2). A fragment of around 1000 bp was amplified, subcloned into Topo TA vector and sequenced. After analysis of the sequence of the PCR product, the 5′ cDNA bdsub-1 together with bd-1 clone confirmed that we had the complete open reading frame (1701 bp) and deduced amino acid sequence of BdSUB-1 protein as well as the nucleotide sequence of neighboring upstream (360 bp) region, shown in Fig. 3A. The initial ATG showed a purine in the –3 position upstream and a"
https://openalex.org/W2085602940,"Given the importance of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) as an essential endocytosis and signaling receptor for many protein ligands, and of α2-macroglobulin (α2M)-proteinase complexes as one such set of ligands, an understanding of the specificity of their interaction with LRP is an important goal. A starting point is the known role of the 138-residue receptor binding domain (RBD) in binding to LRP. Previous studies have localized high affinity α2M binding to the eight complement repeat (CR)-containing cluster 2 of LRP. In the present study we have identified the minimum CR domains that constitute the full binding site for RBD and, hence, for α2M on LRP. We report on the ability of the triple construct of CR3-4-5 to bind RBD with an affinity (Kd = 130 nm) the same as for isolated RBD to intact LRP. This Kd is 30-fold smaller than for RBD to CR5-6-7, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction with CR3-4-5. Binding requires previously identified critical lysine residues but is almost pH-independent within the range of pH values encountered between extracellular and internal compartments, consistent with an earlier proposed model of intracellular ligand displacement by intramolecular YWTD domains. The present findings suggest a model to explain the ability of LRP to bind a wide range of structurally unrelated ligands in which a nonspecific ligand interaction with the acidic region present in most CR domains is augmented by interactions with other CR surface residues that are unique to a particular CR cluster.

Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) family of mosaic receptor proteins that are responsible for binding and internalization of a large number of protein ligands (2Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Each of these receptors contains one or more clusters of ligand binding domains, known both as complement-like repeats (CR) and LDL receptor type A modules (3Catterall C.F. Lyons A. Sim R.B. Day A.J. Harris T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas LDLR contains only one such cluster of 7 CR domains, LRP has four clusters containing 2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats, counting from the N terminus (4Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 5Kristensen T. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Bendtsen L. Sand O. Sottrup-Jensen L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Commonly used nomenclature, thus, describes cluster 2 as being composed of domains CR3 through CR10. Each CR domain contains three conserved disulfide bridges and a functionally required calcium binding site within 40-42 residues. These domains are linked by variable length, flexible linkers that are likely to afford considerable orientational freedom to each CR domain with respect to others in the cluster (7Beglova N. North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2808-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the cysteines and calcium-coordinating residues are highly conserved, most of the remaining ∼30 residues are variable (8Simonovic M. Dolmer K. Huang W. Strickland D.K. Volz K. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15127-15134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This potentially gives LRP a wide variety of ligand recognition sites within its four clusters of 31 CR domains and may in part explain the very much broader range of ligands that can bind and be internalized by LRP compared with the much simpler LDLR. Thus, LRP binds ligands as diverse as ∼760-kDa α2M-protease complexes, various ∼100-kDa serpin-proteinase complexes such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-urokinase-like plasminogen activator (uPA), thrombin-antithrombin, and protease nexin-1-uPA, apolipoprotein E, and lipoprotein lipase, amyloid precursor protein, complement C3, and lactoferrin (2Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). One of the best studied LRP ligands is α2M. α2Misan abundant, homo-tetrameric pan-proteinase inhibitor (9Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is also reported to bind various growth factors (10Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. LaMarre J. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and that is evolutionarily related to the complement proteins C3, C4, and C5 (11Sottrup-Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Kristensen T.

A. 1985; 82: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Binding of α2M to LRP requires the exposure of a previously hidden receptor binding domain (RBD) that constitutes the C-terminal 138 residues of each α2M chain. Exposure of RBD results from the conformational transformation that occurs upon complex formation with proteinase. LRP can, thus, discriminate strongly between native and activated α2M species. Internalization of complexed α2M can result not only in internalization and degradation of the complexed proteinase but also in intracellular signaling responses, making this ligand an especially important one to study (12Lutz C. Nimpf J. Jenny M. Boecklinger K. Enzinger C. Utermann G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Baier G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43143-43151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is thought that the RBD of α2M, whose structure is known and consists of a β-sandwich edged by a single α-helix (13Huang W. Dolmer K. Liao X. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1089-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), is solely responsible for binding of α2M-proteinase complexes to LRP (5Kristensen T. Moestrup S.K.

Nevertheless, although intact α2M can bind to LRP with an affinity that reaches subnanomolar at high LRP density, isolated RBD binds with a Kd of 100-200 nm (15Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. Van Leuven F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The difference is thought to be due to the tetrameric nature of α2M allowing interaction with two or more LRP molecules when LRP is present at high density or to an interaction with more than one cluster of CR domains within a single LRP molecule. Thus, it has been reported that α2M can bind to both cluster 2 and cluster 4 when each cluster is expressed as a minreceptor (17Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H.P. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Given the importance both of LRP as an essential endocytosis and signaling receptor and of α2M-proteinase complexes as an LRP ligand, an understanding of the specificity of their interaction is a very worthwhile goal. An excellent starting point is the known importance of RBD in binding, the identification of two lysine residues within RBD that are required for tight binding to LRP (18Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thogersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the localization of high affinity α2M binding to CR cluster 2 of LRP (17Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H.P. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and our earlier observation that RBD can bind to CR3, the first CR domain of cluster 2, with modest affinity (19Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3264-3271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study we have built on this and attempted to identify the minimum additional CR domains that together with CR3, might constitute the full binding site for RBD and, hence, α2M on LRP. We report on the ability of the triple domain construct of CR3-4-5 to bind RBD with an affinity the same as for isolated RBD to intact LRP and to do so in a manner that requires the identified critical lysine residues, although in a manner that is almost pH-independent within the range of pH values encountered between extracellular and internal compartment environments. The latter finding supports the recently proposed model of intracellular ligand dissociation that involves displacement by YWTD domains adjacent to the CR-containing ligand binding clusters resulting from a pH-dependent increase in affinity of the competing YWTD domain for the CR cluster (20Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Expression, Purification, and Refolding of Wild Type and Variant Human RBDs—DNA encoding 1304SLKXnGNA1451 of human α2M was cloned into pET-15b (Novagen) as previously described (21Huang W. Dolmer K. Liao X.B. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2602-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pET-15b-RBD was transformed into BL21-(DE3), grown in 2YT medium to A600 = 0.6-0.8, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 4-5 h. Inclusion bodies were isolated after sonication and dissolved in 6 m GdnHCl, 100 mm NaPi, pH 7.4. RBD was loaded on a Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen) column, washed with 6 m GdnHCl, 100 mm NaPi, pH 6.0, and eluted with 6 m GdnHCl, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. All buffers were degassed, and 0.1% (vol) β-ME was added just before use. For efficient refolding of RBD, an on-column method based on Oganesyan et al. (22Oganesyan N. Kim S.-H. Kim R. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2005; 6: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was used. The pH of an aliquot of purified RBD was adjusted to 7.4 by the addition of 2 m Tris base and diluted to 100 ml with 6 m GdnHCl, 100 mm NaPi, 0.1% β-ME, pH 7.4. RBD was bound to 70 ml of Ni-NTA Superflow in a batch at 1 mg of protein/ml of resin and packed in a column. Upon washing with 3 column volumes of 6 m urea, 100 mm NaPi, 0.1% β-ME, pH 7.4, the column was washed with 500 ml of 0.1% SDS, 0.1% β-ME, in PBS500 (20 mm NaPi, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and refolded with 500 ml of 5 mm β-cyclodextran, 0.1% β-ME, and 0.1% 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide in PBS500 overnight. After washing with 2 column volumes of 50 mm NaPi, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, refolded RBD was eluted with 50 mm NaPi, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Unfolded RBD remained on the column and, after a wash with two column volumes of PBS buffer to remove imidazole, could be subjected to a second round of refolding starting with the wash with 6 m urea buffer as above. Almost all RBD loaded on the column could be refolded in 3-4 cycles. After dialysis against 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, RBD was cleaved with 1/100 (weight) papain for 2 h at room temperature to remove the His tag. The resulting domain is the one used for previous structural studies (13Huang W. Dolmer K. Liao X. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1089-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and is also the domain that is produced by papain cleavage of activated plasma α2M. Iodoacetamide was added to 5 mm, and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 2 m Tris base to inhibit papain. The His tag-cleaved RBD was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The final purification step was performed on a Q-Sepharose HP column, equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a gradient of 50-500 mm NaCl. A plasmid carrying K1370M/K1374M RBD was prepared from pET-15b-RBD by a single QuikChange (Stratagene) reaction. Expression, purification, and refolding were identical to those of wild type RBD. Expression, Purification, and Refolding of Complement Repeat Fragments—DNA encoding CR3-4 (853QCQXnCSA933) of human LRP was cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) modified to contain a TEV proteinase cleavage site. BL21 cells containing pGEX-CR3-4 were grown in 2YT medium to an A600 = 0.8 at 37 °C. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was lowered to 25 °C. Cells were harvested after 5-6 h. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified as previously described (23Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), cleaved with TEV protease, and repurified on GSH-Sepharose. CR3-4, collected from the flow-through, was further purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (10 × 250 mm) eluted with a gradient of 9-54% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peak fractions were pooled and lyophilized. DNA encoding CR3-4-5 (853QCQXnCAY973) of human LRP was cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) modified to contain a protein G fusion protein and a TEV site. The CR3-4-5 fusion protein was expressed in SG13009 pREP4 cells (Qiagen), grown to an A600 = 0.6 at 37 °C in 2YT medium, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 4-5 h. The His6protG-CR3-4-5 fusion protein was purified on a Ni-NTA Superflow column according to the manufacturer's protocol (QiaExpressionist). After cleavage with TEV, the mixture was passed over the Ni-NTA column, and the flow-through was further purified by reverse phase HPLC as described above for CR3-4. DNA encoding CR5-6-7 (934RTC XnCTN1053) was cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) modified to contain a TEV proteinase cleavage site. His6-tagged CR5-6-7 was expressed, purified, and processed essentially as described above for CR3-4-5 to give CR5-6-7 without a His tag. Purified CR3-4, CR3-4-5, and CR5-6-7 were refolded using a modification of the previously described protocol (23Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Each protein was dissolved in a minimal volume of 6 m GdnHCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and reduced with a 2× molar excess (over Cys) of dithiothreitol for 30 min. Each fragment was then diluted with refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.5) and mixed with a 50% molar excess of glutathione S-transferase-receptor-associated protein (RAP) for a final concentration of complement repeat fragment of 0.1 mg/ml. The refolding mixture was dialyzed at room temperature against 4 liters of degassed refolding buffer containing 1 mm GSH and 0.5 mm GSSG for 24 h with N2 bubbling to avoid oxidation by O2 followed by 24 h of refolding at 4 °C without bubbling. To purify correctly folded complement repeat fragments, the mixture was dialyzed against 3 × 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, and loaded on a GSH-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. After a brief wash to remove unbound material, folded fragment bound to glutathione S-transferase-RAP was eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. LRP fragments were further purified by reverse phase HPLC as described above. In each case, the folded protein eluted faster than the reduced protein before refolding. Folded CR3-4-5 and CR5-6-7 were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose-HP column (10 × 100 mm). The protein was eluted with a gradient of 50-1000 mm NaCl. As a final purification step to ensure that only correctly disulfide-bonded and, hence, functional protein was present, folded CR3-4-5 was mixed with His6-RBD in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 and passed over a small Ni-NTA column. After washing with 5 column volumes of buffer, CR3-4-5 capable of binding RBD was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm citrate. Traces of His6-RBD were removed by ion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose HP column, eluted with a gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Protein Concentrations—For each protein the extinction coefficient was calculated using the formula ϵ280 nm (m-1 cm-1) = 5500 × (number of tryptophans) + 1490 × (number of tyrosines) + 120 × (number of disulfide bridges). This empirical formula has been shown to be accurate to within a few percent of experimentally determined extinction coefficients for most proteins (24Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Binding experiments were performed on a PTI Quantamaster instrument equipped with double monochromators on both the excitation and emission sides. Because RBD does not contain tryptophan residues, the tryptophan residues in CR3-4(-5) and CR5-6-7 could be selectively excited at 295 nm and RBD binding followed by the increase in tryptophan fluorescence at 325 nm. The experiments were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% PEG 20,000 to avoid protein adsorption to the acrylic cuvette. Low pH binding experiments were performed in similar buffers containing 20 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5) or 20 mm MES (pH 6.0 and 5.5). Spectra of the apo-forms of CR3, CR3-4, CR3-4-5, and CR5-6-7, were obtained in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol 20,000. Determination of Kd Values—Dissociation constants were determined by fitting fluorescence titration data to a single binding site model by non-linear least-squares fitting using the program Scientist (MicroMath, Salt Lake City, UT). It should be noted that LRP fragment concentrations used (0.5 μm) were above the Kd for the tightest binding fragment CR3-4-5, so that the condition for 50% saturation to occur at a concentration of titrant equal to the Kd is not met. SDS and Non-denaturing PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed using a Novex 10-20% gel (Invitrogen) and standard Laemmli buffers. Non-denaturing PAGE was performed using a Novex 8% gel prerun for 4 h at 15 mA in 375 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.8, to introduce Ca2+ to the gel. The gel was run in the standard Tris-glycine buffer system supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 at 15 mA until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Characterization of CR3-4, CR3-4-5, and CR5-6-7—We have previously shown that the first complement-like repeat in the second cluster of LRP, CR3, binds RBD weakly, although with sufficient affinity (Kd ∼ 140 μm) to suggest that it forms part of the RBD binding site on LRP (19Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3264-3271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed first CR3-4 and then CR3-4-5 to determine whether the full affinity of RBD for LRP could be reproduced by adding contiguous domains and to enable evaluation of the contributions of individual domains to the overall binding energy. Because each CR domain contains three disulfide bonds, all of which are critical for the correct fold and, hence, function in ligand binding of the domain (25Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we took great care to ensure that only correctly folded material was used in subsequent binding studies. This was a particular concern since initial preparations using the previously described method for refolding CR3-4 gave only a small fraction that appeared to be folded, as judged by the shift in mobility in reverse phase HPLC upon reduction. We, therefore, modified the published protocol to include the chaperone RAP, shown to be important for LRP expression and function in vivo (26Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To aid in the subsequent purification of correctly folded CR3-4, we used glutathione S-transferase-tagged RAP, which after dialysis of the folding mixture to remove GSH, bound GSH-Sepharose with the folded CR3-4 still bound. Folded CR3-4 was then eluted with EDTA. In the case of CR3-4-5, with nine disulfides, an extra affinity purification step using RBD was used to eliminate any species that did not bind with the highest affinity. SDS-PAGE showed that under both non-reducing and reducing conditions, the resulting CR3-4 and CR3-4-5 gave only single bands, suggesting that preparations were homogeneous (Fig. 1). In contrast, preparations of CR3-4-5 that had not undergone the additional RBD affinity purification step showed the presence of additional bands under non-reducing conditions (not shown). Calcium binding to the complement repeats is also indicative of correct folding and can be followed by the increase in tryptophan fluorescence. CR3, CR3-4, and CR3-4-5 fluorescence in the absence and presence of saturating Ca2+ shows a marked increase due to Ca2+ binding (Fig. 2). Stoichiometric titrations with Ca2+ confirmed the ability of each domain to bind Ca2+ (not shown). The variation in fluorescence enhancement reflects the different properties of each domain, which has been seen elsewhere for CR domains from both LRP and LDLR (8Simonovic M. Dolmer K. Huang W. Strickland D.K. Volz K. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15127-15134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and perhaps also a degree of internal quenching that makes the fluorescence intensities of multidomain constructs less than the sum of contributions from the isolated constituent domains.FIGURE 2Fluorescence spectra of CR3, CR3-4, CR3-4-5, and CR5-6-7 in the absence (lower trace) and presence of 1 mm calcium (upper trace). All spectra are normalized to that of CR3 without calcium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For subsequent use as an important negative control for RBD binding, we also expressed and characterized CR5-6-7. As with the above fragments, only a single band was obtained on SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions (data not shown). Ca2+ binding showed a comparable large increase in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 2), confirming correct folding of domains. RBD Binding to CR3-4 and CR3-4-5 by Gel Shift—As a first, qualitative measure of the affinities of CR3-4 and CR3-4-5 for RBD, non-denaturing PAGE was used. RBD and the two CR constructs alone showed large differences in mobility. No shift was seen for a 1:1 mixture of CR3-4 and RBD, suggesting that the interaction was relatively weak (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 3, and 4). For CR3-4-5, however, there was not only a complete shift for the two component proteins, but the resulting complex had higher mobility than either component (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 5, and 6). This might indicate that CR3-4-5 is transformed from an extended conformation in the absence of RBD to a compact conformation when wrapped around the more globular RBD. RBD Binding to CR3-4, CR3-4-5, and CR5-6-7 by Fluorescence-monitored Titration—RBD contains 6 tyrosines, but no tryptophans, whereas each CR domain contains one tryptophan. When complexed with RBD, neither CR3-4, CR3-4-5, nor the control CR5-6-7 shows a large change in the intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence, although there is a blue shift of 5-6 nm of the emission peak (Fig. 4). We were, therefore, able to follow RBD binding to each of these LRP fragments by selectively exciting the single tryptophan residue in each complement-like repeat at 295 nm and monitoring tryptophan emission at 325 nm where the change in intensity is largest. For all three fragments, CR3-4, CR3-4-5, and CR5-6-7, titration curves for RBD binding were saturable and could be fitted to a single binding site (Fig. 5), confirming the homogeneity of the preparations. Whereas CR3 alone had previously been found to bind to RBD with a Kd of only 140 μm, CR3-4 bound to RBD much tighter, with a Kd of 1.5 μm, and CR3-4-5 bound tighter still, with a Kd more than 1 order of magnitude smaller (130 nm) (Table 1). The significance of the latter Kd is that it matches the values reported for binding of RBD to intact LRP (100-200 nm) and so implies that CR3-4-5 constitutes the whole of the RBD binding site within LRP. In contrast, whereas CR5-6-7 still bound in a saturable manner, with a stoichiometry of 1:1, its affinity for RBD (4 μm, Table 1) was lower than for the tandem construct CR3-4, demonstrating the strong preference for RBD binding at CR3-4-5 rather than at other possible sites, with a 30-fold lower Kd for binding at CR3-4-5 than at CR5-6-7.FIGURE 5Titration curves for RBD binding to LRP fragments. CR3-4 (top left), CR3-4-5 (top right), CR5-6-7 (bottom right). Bottom left, K1370M/K1374M RBD binding to CR3-4-5. The LRP fragment concentration was 0.5 μm in each case.

Here, we have identified a cis-acting RNA element required for regulated splicing of G6PD mRNA. Using transfection of G6PD RNA reporter constructs into rat hepatocytes, the cis-acting RNA element involved in this regulation was localized to nucleotides 43-72 of exon 12 in the G6PD mRNA. In in vitro splicing assays, RNA substrates containing exon 12 were not spliced. In contrast, RNA substrates containing other regions (exons 8 and 9 or exons 10 and 11) of the G6PD mRNA were efficiently spliced. Furthermore, exon 12 can inhibit splicing when substituted for other exons in RNA substrates that are readily spliced. This activity of the exon 12 regulatory element suggests that it is an exonic splicing silencer. Consistent with its activity as a splicing silencer, spliceosome assembly was inhibited on RNA substrates containing exon 12 compared with RNAs representing other regions of the G6PD transcript. Elimination of nucleotides 43-72 of exon 12 did not restore splicing of exon 12-containing RNA; thus, the 30-nucleotide element may not be exclusively a silencer. The binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins K, L, and A2/B1 from both HeLa and hepatocyte nuclear extracts to the element further supports its activity as a silencer. In addition, SR proteins bind to the element, consistent with the presence of enhancer activity within this sequence.

In liver, the lipogenic pathway plays an essential role in converting excess dietary energy into a storage form. Consistent with this role in energy homeostasis, the capacity of this pathway is regulated by dietary changes, such as fasting, feeding, and the amount and type of carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fat in the diet (1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). For many of the lipogenic enzymes, regulation of enzyme amount occurs primarily by changes in the transcription rate of the gene, but posttranscriptional regulation via mRNA stability has also been implicated (1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). G6PD differs from the other family members in that dietary regulation occurs exclusively at a posttranscriptional step (2Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol.

G6PD expression is inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid; this occurs at a unique posttranscriptional step involving a decrease in the rate of splicing of the nascent G6PD transcript. Several lines of evidence indicate that changes in mature mRNA accumulation are caused by changes in the efficiency of splicing of the G6PD transcript. First, changes in the cytoplasmic accumulation of G6PD mRNA are preceded by changes in the accumulation of mRNA in the nucleus in the absence of changes in transcriptional activity of the gene (3Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J.

Second, stimulatory treatments, such as refeeding, enhance the rate of accumulation of partially and fully spliced G6PD mRNA with little or no change in abundance of the primary transcript (2Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10514-10523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Third, inhibition of G6PD expression by polyunsaturated fat results in an accumulation of partially spliced mRNA in the nucleus despite a decrease in the nuclear content of mature mRNA (6Tao H. Szeszel-Fedorowicz W. Amir-Ahmady B. Gibson M.A. Stabile L.P. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31270-31278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, using transient transfection of RNA reporter constructs containing progressive deletion of the 13 exons of the G6PD precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) into rat hepatocytes, we have demonstrated that exon 12 and its surrounding introns are necessary for the arachidonic acid inhibition of mRNA accumulation (6Tao H. Szeszel-Fedorowicz W. Amir-Ahmady B. Gibson M.A. Stabile L.P. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31270-31278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that G6PD expression is regulated by changes in the rate of pre-mRNA splicing. This mechanism of regulation of G6PD by inhibition of its splicing may be shared across other metabolic genes, even those regulated by transcriptional mechanisms. In this regard, nutritional status regulates expression of the tricarboxylate (citrate) carrier and spot 14, a putative lipogenic protein by a nuclear posttranscriptional mechanism (2Amir-Ahmady B.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2293-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Regulation of accumulation of spliced intermediates has been observed for these genes, but the molecular details are not known. Regulating gene expression by changes in the rate of pre-mRNA splicing in addition to transcriptional regulation would result in a more rapid response to nutritional or hormonal changes. Pre-mRNA splicing results in the removal of introns from primary transcripts and the joining of the exons containing the protein coding information. The G6PD gene is over 18 kb, and all of its exons are constitutively spliced. Exons can be constitutively or alternatively spliced. Constitutively spliced exons are those always present in the mRNA and account for the majority of exons. The alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts, which occurs for at least 60% of all genes, results in the production of different proteins and can occur in a tissue- or treatment-specific manner (10Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Both constitutive and alternative splicing requires distinguishing exons from the surrounding intronic RNA. Exon definition, as the process of exon recognition is called, utilizes intronic sequences, which include the 5′ and 3′ splice sites, polypyrimidine tract, and branch point, as well as sequence elements in the exon called exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) (11Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). ESEs are not highly conserved with respect to sequence and thus must be functionally characterized in the pre-mRNA (12Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 13Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The activity of ESEs involves their binding by members of a family of splicing regulatory proteins, serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins (14Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). SR proteins participate in splicing by enhancing the recruitment of the key spliceosome components, U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) and U2 snRNP (11Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). In the absence of an ESE, binding of U1 and U2 snRNPs to the 5′ splice site and branch point, respectively, is less stable, and the rate of complex formation is slowed (11Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 15Hertel K.J. Graveley B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 115-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA splicing can also be inhibited by the action of silencer elements in the RNA. These sequences are present in both introns and exons and are bound by a diverse group of proteins that include some members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family of proteins (16Caputi M. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Rothrock C.R. House A.E. Lynch K.W.

Yeo G. Tung V. Mawson M. Burge C.B. Cell. 2004; 119: 831-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Like enhancer elements, silencers exhibit great sequence diversity, and their identification in mRNA requires functional tests for their activity (19Wang Z. Rolish M.E. Yeo G. Tung V. Mawson M. Burge C.B. Cell. 2004; 119: 831-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 20Grabowski P.J. Biochem. Soc.

When the silencer is present in the intron, it functions to suppress recognition of the splice sites; this is a key mechanism in alternative splicing (10Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). In contrast, exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) suppress exon definition, which involves interference with the binding of a splicing co-activator (22Tong A. Nguyen J. Lynch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38297-38304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In this regard, the juxtaposition of ESS and ESE elements in an exon results in the mutually exclusive binding of hnRNPs versus SR proteins (cf. Refs. 23Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 24Zhu J. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Although the role of ESSs in regulating splicing is best understood in alternative splicing, computational approaches suggest that ESSs are also present in constitutively spliced exons (21Zhang X.H. Chasin L.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The molecular details by which ESSs can regulate the splicing of constitutive exons remain largely unexplored. G6PD mRNA is not alternatively spliced; thus, the regulation of its splicing by nutritional factors involves changes in the rate of splicing of a constitutively spliced exon. Understanding the molecular details by which G6PD pre-mRNA splicing is regulated will provide novel information on the mechanisms by which cells can regulate the rate of constitutive splicing and the role this process can play in controlling gene expression. In the present report, we identify the splicing regulatory element involved in the inhibition of G6PD pre-mRNA splicing by polyunsaturated fatty acids. This 30-nt regulatory element contains an ESS. The ESS can block the splicing of heterologous introns in an in vitro splicing assay. Consistent with its activity as a silencer, the exon 12 element inhibits spliceosome assembly by attenuating the formation of the first ATP-requiring complex in this process and binds hnRNPs, associated with inhibition of splicing. This is the first report of an ESS in a constitutively spliced exon being involved in the regulation of gene expression. Animal Care and Cell Culture—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-250 g) were fed a chow diet and then starved 16 h prior to hepatocyte isolation. Hepatocytes were isolated by a modification of the Seglen technique (25Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) as described previously (4Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (3.1 × 106) were placed in 60-mm dishes coated with rat tail collagen and incubated in Hi/Wo/BA medium (Waymouth MB752/l plus 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm serine, 0.5 mm alanine, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) plus 5% newborn calf serum (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cell viability in all experiments was 90% or greater as estimated by trypan blue (0.04%) exclusion. After 3-4 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the constructs presented in Figs. 1 and 2 were transfected. Each construct (2.5 μg/plate) was transfected using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The ratio of DNA to liposome reagent was 1:6.7. A Matrigel overlay (0.3 mg/ml; BD Pharmingen) was added to hepatocytes 4 h after the transfection was begun (26Shih H.M. Towle H.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18 (816): 813-814PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection medium remained on the hepatocytes for 16 h and then was replaced with medium containing the treatments indicated in the figure legends. Subsequently, the medium was changed every 12 h to one of the same composition. Arachidonic acid (Nu-Check Prep, West Elysian, MN) was bound to bovine serum albumin (27Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11724-11733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acid (4 mm)/albumin (1 mm) stock contained butylated hydroxytoluene (0.01%), and the medium contained α-tocopherol phosphate, disodium (10 μg/liter), to minimize oxidation of the fatty acids.FIGURE 2The splicing regulatory element in exon 12 is located between nucleotides 42 and 73. A, structure of the mutated pre-mRNA reporters. Black rectangles represent the exons of the G6PD gene, black lines represent the introns, and the gray rectangles represent the 3′-untranslated region of G6PD. The CMV promoter drove transcription of the reporters. The lines below exon 12 indicate the mutations. Each mutation contains the indicated sequence in place of the sequence at the following locations: mutation 1, positions 3-12; mutation 2, positions 13-22; mutation 3, positions 23-32; mutation 4, positions 33-42; mutation 5, positions 43-52; mutation 6, positions 53-62; mutation 7, positions 63-72; mutation 8, positions 73-82; mutation 9, positions 83-92. B, quantification of reporter G6PD RNA. Transfection, treatment with insulin (0.04 μm) with or without arachidonic acid (175 μm), and RNA assay was as in Fig. 1. The percentage of inhibition by arachidonic acid for the pre-mRNA reporters was calculated by dividing the amount of G6PD mRNA in cells treated with arachidonic acid by the amount in cells not incubated with arachidonic acid. All values were normalized by amount of β-actin mRNA to correct for differences in total RNA amount. Each bar shows the mean ± S.E. for at least n = 3 separate hepatocyte isolations (mutation 1, n = 3; mutations 6 and 7, n = 4; mutations 2, 6, and 7, n = 6; mutations 3, 5, 8, and 9, n = 7; mutation 4, n = 9). C, sequence of exon 12 from nucleotides 42-73 of the mouse G6PD mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Construction of RNA Reporter Plasmids and Templates for the in Vitro Splicing Assay—Plasmids used in the analysis of cis-acting elements in the G6PD primary transcript were made using pGL3-Basic (Promega Corp.) as the vector backbone. The luciferase gene was removed from this vector, and portions of G6PD genomic DNA and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer sequences (1-640 bp from the pCMVβ vector; Clontech) were inserted into the multiple cloning site. Mutated RNA reporter constructs were prepared by replacing the G6PD sequence indicated in the legend to Fig. 2 with the sequence AAGCATGCAA using overlap extension PCR (28Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pβgal ex12-ex13 was made by replacing luciferase with the β-galactosidase gene from pCMVβ. G6PD sequences from nucleotide 37 of exon 12 through the end of the gene were ligated into β-galactosidase, deleting the terminal 13 amino acids of the β-galactosidase protein. The pβgal in 12-ex13 plasmid deletes all but the last 8 nt of exon 12 to maintain the 5′-splice site. All sequences were evaluated to ensure that premature termination codons did not arise during cloning. Templates (Fig. 3A) for preparing in vitro splicing substrates were synthesized by PCR using either wild type G6PD sequences or the mutated sequences described above as templates. The T3 promoter was introduced by PCR upstream of the first exon in the substrate, and the PCR products were used in the in vitro transcription reactions. The templates for the chimeric splicing substrates (Fig. 3C) were generated using overlap extension PCR and cloned downstream of a T7 promoter in pKS+ (Stratagene). These plasmids were linearized with XbaI prior to in vitro transcription of the RNA. The template for the β-globin in vitro splicing substrate (pSP64-Hβδ6) was obtained from Dr. Adrian Krainer (29Lopato S. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Barta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3074-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Isolation of Total RNA and Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Total RNA from three plates per treatment was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63225) Google Scholar). Quantitation of transgene and endogenous mRNA was conducted using RNase protection assays (Ambion, Inc.) as previously described (6Tao H. Szeszel-Fedorowicz W. Amir-Ahmady B. Gibson M.A. Stabile L.P. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31270-31278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). β-Actin mRNA was used as a loading control. The template for rat β-actin was purchased from Ambion, Inc. The resulting hybridization products protected from RNase digestion were separated in a 6% (7 m urea) polyacrylamide gel. Images were visualized by storage phosphorimaging and quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Splicing Assay—In vitro splicing substrates were synthesized by in vitro transcription of the G6PD minigenes with T7 or T3 polymerase using [32P]CTP. HeLa cell nuclear extract was purchased from Promega or prepared as previously described (31Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar) with packed HeLa S3 cells from the National Cell Culture Center. Splicing assays were performed in 20-μl reaction volumes containing 10-20 ng of 32P-labeled in vitro splicing substrate, 40% (v/v) nuclear extract, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% polyvinyl alcohol. Reactions were incubated for 4 h unless otherwise stated in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of stop-splicing solution (0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 μg/ml tRNA) (32Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was purified from the splicing mixture with Tris-HCl-saturated phenol (pH 8.0) followed by precipitation with ethanol. Splicing products were analyzed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by storage phosphorimaging. Quantification of splicing reactions in Fig. 4B was performed as follows. Radioactive bands corresponding to the spliced products and unspliced in vitro splicing substrates were quantified with ImageQuant. These values were corrected with respect to the number of cytosines in each band and are referred to as normalized PhosphorImager units. The percentage of spliced mRNA was calculated as the ratio of the normalized PhosphorImager units of spliced mRNA divided by the sum of the amounts of unspliced plus spliced RNA. Statistical analysis of spliced product accumulation used one-way analysis of variance and least squares fit (33Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. 6th Ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1967Google Scholar). Spliceosome Assembly and Gel Electrophoresis—Analysis of spliceosome complex formation was conducted by incubating the RNA substrates in the splicing conditions described above. At the time points indicated in Fig. 5, heparin (0.2 mg/ml) was added to the splicing mixture. After incubation for an additional 5 min at 30 °C, the samples were placed on ice, and 5 μl of each reaction was fractionated on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 80:1), using 200 V at room temperature for 3 h (34Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For agarose gel electrophoresis, in vitro splicing mixtures were incubated without heparin and were placed on ice at the indicated time points (Fig. 6). The complexes (5 μl of each reaction) were separated using electrophoresis in 1.5% low melting point agarose at 70 V for 3 h (35Reed R. Chiara M.D. Methods. 1999; 18: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).FIGURE 6Complex E is efficiently formed on IVS 11-12. 32P-Labeled RNAs for IVS 8-9 and IVS 11-12 were incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extracts under splicing conditions but in the absence of ATP for 20 min at 0 or 30 °C. Spliceosome assembly was analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. The locations of complexes H and E are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) UV Cross-linking Assay—UV cross-linking was preformed as described (36Edwalds-Gilbert G. Milcarek C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6420-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 5 μg of nuclear extract protein and 10-20 fmol of substrate RNA (50,000-100,000 cpm). Binding of proteins to the RNA was visualized using storage phosphorimaging and quantified using ImageQuant. RNA Affinity Assay—RNA oligomers were covalently linked to adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose beads (37Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 38Langland J.O. Pettiford S.M. Jacobs B.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1000 pmol of RNA in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 5 mm sodium m-periodate was incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose beads (400 μl; Sigma) were washed four times in 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and then mixed with the periodate-treated RNA. The beads with the bound RNA were washed three times with 2 m NaCl and three times with 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 200 μg/ml tRNA. The RNA-bound beads were incubated with 100-250 μg of nuclear extracts in buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) plus 2.5 mm ATP, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1000 ng/ml tRNA. Beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of buffer. After the final centrifugation, the proteins bound to the immobilized RNA were eluted in 80 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue for LC-MS/MS and in 1 m Tris, pH 7.0, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue for Western analysis by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. LC-MS/MS and Western Analysis—Proteins eluted from the RNA-linked beads were separated by size in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The protein bands of interest were visualized by colloidal Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen) and excised from the gels. The gel slices were digested with trypsin (2 μg/ml) overnight at 37 °C. The digests were dried and reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and then loaded onto a C18 column using a helium pressure cell. Protein peptides were eluted from the column using a linear acetonitrile gradient of 5-50% over 60 min with a flow rate 300 nl/min. The ion trap mass spectrometer (ProteomeX Work station) was programmed to perform a full MS scan followed by MS/MS scans of the five most abundant ions present. Raw data files were compared with the SwissProt data base using SEQUEST software to identify proteins that match the peptide fragments. SEQUEST results were manually confirmed using the criteria described (39Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). Peptides were accepted if they had a cross-correlation (Xcorr) score of at least 1.9, 2.2, or 3.7 for the +1, +2, or +3 charge states, respectively. Western analysis was as previously described (40Talukdar I. Szeszel-Fedorowicz W. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40660-40667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The hnRNP antibodies (Immuquest) and SR antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were purchased from the indicated sources.

https://openalex.org/W2003154618,"FRAT1, like its Xenopus homolog glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)-binding protein, is known to inhibit GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin. It is currently unknown how FRAT-GSK-3-binding protein activity toward GSK-3 is regulated. FRAT1 has recently been shown to be a phosphoprotein in vivo; however, the responsible kinase(s) have not been determined. In this study, we identified Ser188 as a phosphorylated residue in FRAT1. The identity of the kinase that catalyzes Ser188 phosphorylation and the significance of this phosphorylation to FRAT1 function were investigated. Protein kinase A (PKA) was found to phosphorylate Ser188 in vitro as well as in intact cells. Importantly, activation of endogenous cAMP-coupled β-adrenergic receptors with norepinephrine stimulated the phosphorylation of FRAT1 at Ser188. GSK-3 was also able to phosphorylate FRAT1 at Ser188 and other residues in vitro or when overexpressed in intact cells. In contrast, endogenous GSK-3 did not lead to significant FRAT1 phosphorylation in cells, suggesting that GSK-3 is not a major FRAT1 kinase in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser188 by PKA inhibited the ability of FRAT1 to activate β-catenin-dependent transcription. In conclusion, PKA phosphorylates FRAT1 in vitro as well as in intact cells and may play a role in regulating the inhibitory activity of FRAT1 toward GSK-3.

In contrast, endogenous GSK-3 did not lead to significant FRAT1 phosphorylation in cells, suggesting that GSK-3 is not a major FRAT1 kinase in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser188 by PKA inhibited the ability of FRAT1 to activate β-catenin-dependent transcription. In conclusion, PKA phosphorylates FRAT1 in vitro as well as in intact cells and may play a role in regulating the inhibitory activity of FRAT1 toward GSK-3.

Upon stimulation of both insulin/growth factor and Wnt-dependent signaling pathways, GSK-3 is inactivated. Insulin-dependent GSK-3 inhibition involves activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt/protein kinase B, which then phosphorylates GSK-3 at an N-terminal serine residue (Ser21 in GSK-3α and Ser9 in GSK-3β) (4Cross D.E.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated N terminus is believed to act as a pseudosubstrate and compete for substrate binding, thus leading to autoinhibition of the catalytic activity of GSK-3 (5Dajani R. Fraser E.

Inactivation of GSK-3 in response to insulin stimulation leads to dephosphorylation and activation of the GSK-3 substrates glycogen synthase and eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2B, ultimately contributing to the stimulation of glycogen and protein synthesis.In the Wnt signaling pathway, GSK-3 is known to phosphorylate β-catenin at defined residues at the N terminus, thus targeting the protein for ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation (1Frame S.M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 7Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4176) Google Scholar). β-Catenin phosphorylation occurs in a complex that includes the tumor suppressor protein APC and the scaffold protein Axin. Activation of Wnt signaling through binding of Wnt-secreted glycoproteins to their receptors leads to inhibition of the Axin-APC-GSK-3 complex. Consequently, β-catenin becomes stabilized and translocates into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator of transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, activating target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 (8He T.-C.

The mechanism by which GBP/FRAT inhibits GSK-3 activity toward β-catenin appears to involve preventing Axin from binding to GSK-3, probably by competition for a common (or closely overlapping) binding site on GSK-3. GBP, FRAT, and FRATtide, a 39-residue peptide derived from FRAT1 that is sufficient to bind GSK-3, have all been shown to dissociate GSK-3 from the Axin complex (17Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J.

In addition, using adenoviral expression of FRAT1 in PC12 cells, we have shown that FRAT1 overexpression results in β-catenin stabilization but does not alter glycogen synthase activity (22Culbert A.A.

These results indicate that FRAT1-mediated GSK-3 inhibition is also selective in vivo.It is not known how FRAT activity toward GSK-3 is regulated. A recent report demonstrated that murine Frat1 and Frat2 are phosphoproteins (23van Amerongen R. van der Gulden H. Bleeker F. Jonkers J. Berns A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26967-26974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, the responsible kinases have not been identified. We observed that FRAT1 immunoprecipitated from cells is phosphorylated by one or more endogenous kinases. We identified protein kinase A (PKA) as a kinase that phosphorylates FRAT1 in vitro as well as in cells. We also provide evidence that GSK-3 is not a major FRAT1 kinase in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Cell Culture—A full-length human FRAT1 clone was tagged with the Myc epitope at the N terminus and inserted into the mammalian pcDNA3 expression vector to generate Myc-FRAT1-pcDNA3. C-terminally 2×FLAG- or V5-tagged or untagged expression plasmids for GSK-3β or FRAT1 were generated by PCR amplification of the human GSK-3β and FRAT1 open reading frame from HEK293 or fetal brain cDNA and insertion into pcDNA3. pFC-PKA, encoding the mouse PKAα catalytic subunit, was obtained from Stratagene. Subconfluent HEK293T cells were transfected using Fugene reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in 2.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, Roche Applied Science “Complete” protease inhibitors, pH 7.5), and the lysates were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C until required. Lysates were precleared by centrifugation before use.Immunoprecipitation of Myc-FRAT1—10 μl of protein G-Sepharose was coupled to 5 μg of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10; Autogen Bioclear), and the pellet was used to immunoprecipitate Myc-FRAT1 from 1 ml of precleared lysate. The pellets were then washed three times in 1 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl and then twice with 1 ml of Buffer A. The washed immunoprecipitates were used for in vitro kinase reactions or denatured in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE.Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed as described above. Equal amounts of protein lysate or immunoprecipitated protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-Myc (clone 9E10; Autogen Bioclear), monoclonal anti-V5 (Serotec), monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), monoclonal anti-GSK-3β (BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal anti-PKAα catalytical subunit (sc-903 (C-20); Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and polyclonal FRAT1 phospho-Ser188-specific antibody, raised in rabbit and generated against a peptide representing residues 182-194 in human FRAT1 (LQQRRGpSQPETRT; where pS represents phosphoserine), which was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Blots were developed using the Amersham Biosciences Enhanced Chemiluminesence kit. The Western blots shown to detect protein expression and phosphorylation in intact cells and in vitro phosphorylation of FRAT1 are representative of three independent experiments.In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—FRAT1 immunoprecipitates were incubated on a shaking platform for 10 min with 35 μl of Buffer A in the presence of the different protein kinase inhibitors or recombinant kinases. The kinase reaction was then initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP (standard ATP for mass spectrometry analysis or [γ-32P]ATP (200-1000 cpm/pmol) for autoradiography) and incubated on a shaking platform for 30 min at 30 °C. LiCl and the selective GSK-3 inhibitors SB216763 and SB415286 were used as described previously (22Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Frame S.M. Hagen T. Cross D.A.E. Bax B. Reith A.D.

The gels were dried, and phosphorylation of Myc-FRAT1 was analyzed using autoradiography, where the reactions contained [γ-32P]ATP. Alternatively, the gels were stained with Coomassie and Myc-FRAT1 bands excised for phosphorylation site mapping using mass spectrometry.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The Myc-FRAT1 bands were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the protein was then digested in gel with trypsin (modified sequencing grade; Promega Corp.). Following digestion, the resulting peptides were desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore Corp.) and analyzed using electrospray ionization on an ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). The mass spectrometer was set to acquire an ion map by fragmenting each ion within a given range. In this way, each peptide in the sample was fragmented within the mass spectrometer to generate a tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS). The ion map, a representation of the tandem mass spectra of all components in a given sample, was then examined to see if any peptides had potentially lost a phosphate group. Identification of phosphorylated peptides was then confirmed by interpretation of the corresponding MS/MS spectra.In Vivo Labeling—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with Myc-FRAT1-pcDNA3. 16 h after transfection, each dish of cells was labeled with 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate and treated without or with the selective GSK-3 inhibitors SB216763 (10 μm) or SB415286 (40 μm). After 4 h of compound treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in lysis buffer, as described above. Myc-FRAT was immunoprecipitated from lysates using monoclonal 9E10 antibody, and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphate incorporation into Myc-FRAT was determined by autoradiography.β-Catenin-TCF/LEC-regulated Gene Reporter Assay—Luciferase activity in cells transiently transfected with a TCF/LEF-regulated luciferase gene reporter construct was determined as described previously (24Coghlan M.P.

Autoradiography showed that isolated Myc-FRAT1 was indeed phosphorylated, indicating that Myc-FRAT1 is phosphorylated in intact cells (Fig. 1a). Moreover, treatment of cells with selective GSK-3 inhibitors resulted in no significant reduction in FRAT phosphorylation in the case of SB216763 and a moderate reduction with SB415286, suggesting the presence of compound-insensitive FRAT kinase activities in intact cells (Fig. 1a).When Myc-FRAT1 immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293T cell lysates was incubated with Mg2+/[32-P]ATP in vitro, the protein became phosphorylated (Fig. 1b). Since FRAT1 has no intrinsic kinase catalytic activity, it was concluded that the observed FRAT1 phosphorylation reflected the in vitro activity of one or more endogenous kinases that had co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-FRAT1. In keeping with previous reports of a FRAT-GSK3 complex, the presence of the GSK-3 inhibitors LiCl or SB415286 (Fig. 1b) suppressed the phosphorylation of Myc-FRAT1 markedly. However, inhibition of GSK-3 activity did not completely abolish Myc-FRAT1 phosphorylation, raising the possibility of additional co-immunoprecipitating kinase activities within the Myc-FRAT1 complex.Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to identify the sites in Myc-FRAT1 that were phosphorylated. To this end, Myc-FRAT1 was immunoprecipitated from cells and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation with standard ATP, followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis of the excised Myc-FRAT1 band. This approach is expected to detect residues that are phosphorylated in intact cells or in vitro by endogenous coimmunoprecipitating kinases. Data from a series of MS/MS ion maps indicated that the tryptic peptide containing Ser188 (residues 187-193) was phosphorylated. This peptide also contains a threonine residue (Thr192), which, unlike Ser188, is not conserved in FRAT2 (see Fig. 2a). It was, therefore, assumed that the serine was the phosphorylated residue (see below). However, since not all tryptic peptides were analyzable by mass spectrometry, it is possible that there are additional phosphorylation sites.FIGURE 2In vitro phosphorylation of wild type and S188A mutant Myc-FRAT1 by PKA and PKC. a, alignment of human FRAT1 sequence surrounding Ser188 with human and mouse orthologs and paralogs. Conserved residues are shown in boldface type. b and c, immunoprecipitated wild type and S188A mutant Myc-FRAT1 were phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of SB415286 and recombinant PKA catalytic subunit (Novagen) (b) or PKC (Sigma) (c), as described under “Materials and Methods.” The PKC kinase assay was carried out in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol (1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol), and 0.5 mm CaCl2. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried for autoradiography or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis with monoclonal 9E10 antibody. 20 μm SB415286 was included in all reactions in b and c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ser188 in FRAT1 Is Phosphorylated by PKA and PKC in Vitro— Analysis of residues around Ser188 in FRAT1 suggested that this residue lay within a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by PKA (RRX(S/T)) (Fig. 2a). Ser188 also conforms to consensus motifs for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC), which are (S/T)X(K/R), (K/R)XX(S/T), or (K/R)X(S/T) (27Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). To evaluate further the role of PKA and/or PKC in FRAT phosphorylation, a FRAT1 mutant was generated in which Ser188 was mutated to Ala, and in vitro phosphorylation of wild type and mutant Myc-FRAT1 by recombinant PKA and PKC was determined in the presence of the GSK-3 inhibitor SB-415286. As shown in Fig. 2, both PKA and PKC phosphorylated wild type Myc-FRAT1. In contrast, no 32P incorporation into the S188A mutant could be observed with PKA, indicating that PKA exclusively phosphorylates FRAT1 at Ser188 in vitro (Fig. 2b). In comparison, phosphorylation of Myc-FRAT1 by PKC was only slightly reduced in the S188A mutant compared with wild type FRAT1 (Fig. 2c), indicating that PKC does not exclusively phosphorylate Ser188 in vitro.To characterize further the phosphorylation of Ser188 in FRAT1, a polyclonal phosphosite-specific pS188 antibody was generated. Incubation of immunoprecipitated wild type Myc-FRAT1 with either recombinant PKA or PKC increased the immunoreactivity of the phospho-Ser188-specific antibody, and this was abolished in the S188A mutant (Fig. 3). This result verified that the antibody only recognizes phosphorylation of Ser188, and confirmed that both PKA and PKC are able to phosphorylate this site in FRAT1 in vitro.FIGURE 3Phospho-Ser188-specific immunoblot of wild type and S188A mutant Myc-FRAT1 after in vitro phosphorylation by recombinant PKA and PKC. Immunoprecipitated wild type and S188A mutant Myc-FRAT1 were phosphorylated in vitro using unlabeled ATP at a concentration of 0.5 mm in the presence of recombinant PKA catalytic subunit or PKC plus PKC activators and 20 μm SB415286, as described in Fig. 2, followed by SDS-PAGE of immunoprecipitates and Western blot analysis with phospho-Ser188-specific or 9E10 Myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These findings indicated that recombinant PKA and PKC could phosphorylate Ser188 in vitro. We next wished to determine whether Ser188 is phosphorylated by a co-immunoprecipitating protein kinase. Interestingly, the addition of 8-bromo-cAMP to the Myc-FRAT1 protein complex significantly increased the amount of phosphate incorporated into Ser188 in vitro (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, consistent with this idea, the phosphorylation of Ser188 resulting from treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP was strongly inhibited by PKA inhibitor, as determined by autoradiography and Ser188 phosphospecific immunoblotting (Fig. 4, a and b). In contrast, 8-bromo-cAMP did not induce phosphorylation of the S188A mutant Myc-FRAT1 (Fig. 4b). In addition, PKA was observed by immunoblotting to co-immunoprecipitate with FRAT1 (Fig. 4b). We did not observe stimulation of Ser188 phosphorylation when adding PKC activators phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol plus calcium to FRAT1 immunoprecipitates in the presence of MgATP (data not shown). Together, these data indicated that PKA, but not PKC, is a co-immunoprecipitating kinase that mediates phosphorylation of FRAT1 at Ser188.FIGURE 4Myc-FRAT1 phosphorylation at Ser188 is stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP and inhibited by protein kinase A inhibitor. a, to measure Ser188 phosphorylation by a coimmunoprecipitating kinase, in vitro phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated Myc-FRAT1 was carried out in the presence of 0.5 mm unlabeled ATP, 20 μm SB415286, and 0.25 mm 8-bromo-cAMP or 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor 5-24 (PKI) (Calbiochem), as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with phospho-Ser188-specific or 9E10 Myc antibody. b, immunoprecipitated wild type and S188A mutant Myc-FRAT1 were phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm SB415286, 0.25 mm 8-bromo-cAMP, and 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor 5-24 (PKI), as described under “Materials and Methods.” Immunoprecipitates were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography or Western blotting with phospho-Ser188-specific, 9E10 Myc, or PKA catalytic subunit antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PKA Phosphorylates Ser188 in FRAT1 in Intact Cells—To assess whether PKA and/or PKC can phosphorylate Ser188 in intact cells, HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-FRAT1 and treated with activators of PKA (forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP) or PKC (TPA and bryostatin-1) for 1 h. Phosphorylation of Ser188 was then measured in immunoprecipitates of Myc-FRAT1 using the phospho-Ser188-specific antibody. Fig. 5a shows that the PKA activators forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP, but not the PKC activators TPA and bryostatin-1, were able to induce phosphorylation of Ser188. To confirm phosphorylation of Ser188 by PKA in cells, PKA was cotransfected with wild type and S188A mutant Myc-FRAT1. As shown in Fig. 5b, cotransfection of PKA resulted in a strong signal in wild type but not in S188A mutant Myc-FRAT1. Taken together, these results indicated that PKA can phosphorylate Ser188 in intact cells as well as in vitro and that PKA is more important to the regulation of phosphorylation of Ser188 in a cellular context than PKC.FIGURE 5Phosphorylation of Myc-FRAT1 at Ser188 by PKA in intact cells. a, HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-FRAT1.

To determine whether elevation of the cellular cAMP concentration through activation of an endogenous cAMP-coupled receptor induces Ser188 phosphorylation, HEK293 cells were transfected with FRAT1-FLAG followed by treatment with norepinephirne for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 5c, norepinephrine treatment led to marked Ser188 phosphorylation of FRAT1.Phosphorylation of Ser188 by GSK-3 in Vitro and in Intact Cells—Given that GSK-3 is known to interact with FRAT1 and that we found that the kinase could induce marked phosphorylation of Myc-FRAT1 in vitro, we determined whether this kinase can also phosphorylate Ser188. As shown in Fig. 6a, Ser188 phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated FRAT1 in vitro, as measured using the phosphosite-specific antibody, was inhibited in the presence of LiCl and SB415286, indicating that co-immunoprecipitating GSK-3 can phosphorylate Ser188. To determine GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of FRAT1 at Ser188 in cells, cells transfected with FRAT1 were treated with GSK-3 inhibitors or cotransfected with an expression plasmid for GSK-3β, followed by immunoblotting of cell lysates with Ser188 phosphospecific antibody. Cotransfection of GSK-3β increased Ser188 phosphorylation, but to a much smaller degree compared with the effect observed when PKA was cotransfected (Fig. 6b). GSK-3 is a constitutively active kinase; thus, if GSK-3 phosphorylates Ser188 in vivo, GSK-3 inhibitors would be expected to reduce Ser188 phosphorylation. However, treatment of cells with SB415286 or LiCl had no effect on Ser188 phosphorylation (Fig. 6b). When cells transfected with FRAT1 were treated with phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, a marked increase in Se"
