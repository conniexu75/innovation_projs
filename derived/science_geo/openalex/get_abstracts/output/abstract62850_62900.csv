https://openalex.org/W1516265214,"Abstract The enzyme, l-glutamine d-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase (EC 2.6.1.16), that catalyzes the formation of glucosamine 6-phosphate has been partially purified from rat liver, HeLa cells, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis. Enzyme from the mammalian sources is subject to feedback inhibition by uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, but enzyme from the bacteria is not. The approximate molecular weights, estimated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, are 340,000 for enzyme from the former two sources, and 100,000 for enzyme from the latter two. Kinetic studies on the rat liver enzyme show that UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine increases the Michaelis constant (Km) for fructose 6-phosphate without affecting the maximum velocity, and that it does not alter the Km for l-glutamine. A variety of treatments result in partial desensitization of the rat liver enzyme to inhibition by UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, suggesting that the inhibitor binds at a site on the enzyme distinct from the active site."

Although equilibrium concentrations are related to the magnitude of the relative stability constants, the kinetics of transfer appears to be regulated by steric factors. The time required for equimolar concentrations of three typical chelates to half-saturate the sites is nitrilotriacetate, 3 sec; citrate, 8 hours; ethylenediaminetetraacetate, about 4 days. The kinetics of ferric citrate transfer is complicated by the polynuclear behavior of this chelate. At a citrate to iron ratio of 1:1, the rate-limiting step of the metal binding is depolymerization to a low molecular weight, reactive complex. At ratios above 20:1, polymerization is suppressed by the formation of ferric dicitrate, which reacts rapidly with the protein to release the metal via the formation of a reactive ferric citrate complex. A reaction sequence is proposed involving the formation of a ternary complex of chelate-iron-transferrin as an intermediate. Ionic Fe(III) does not appear to be involved in the transfer."

Since Langerhans cells can proliferate, they can no longer be considered to be worn-out melanocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1500558125,"Abstract The data presented in this paper emphasize the importance of eliminating bacterial contamination in studies of amino acid incorporation into isolated mitochondria. A correlation between the number of bacteria present and amino acid incorporation into mitochondria was observed when pure cultures of bacteria were added to mitochondria prepared under sterile conditions. Low concentrations of dinitrophenol, presumably a selective inhibitor of amino acid incorporation into mitochondria, inhibited amino acid incorporation into some species of bacteria. In addition, a lack of correlation between amino acid incorporation and bacterial growth in time studies has been demonstrated. These results suggest that the criteria advanced by various workers to indicate that bacterial contamination is of little importance in studies of amino acid incorporation into mitochondria are insufficient. Mitochondrial preparations essentially free of bacterial contamination (less than 100 bacteria per ml of incubation medium) can incorporate amino acids into their protein in the presence of adenine nucleotides, Mg++, phosphate, a complete amino acid mixture, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and succinate."

https://openalex.org/W1874213600,"Studies of systematically varied series of synthetic polypeptides lead to several generalizations about the chemical factors involved in antigenicity. Polymers containing aromatic amino acids generally elicit more antibody than those not containing aromatic amino acids. This is not an exclusive property, however, since the incorporation of alanine can enhance immunogenicity in some cases. Tyrosine and phenylalanine are equally effective in enhancing antibody formation, but there is no correlation between the amount of antibody elicited and the amount of the aromatic amino acid in the polypeptide. The charge of the antigen plays essentially a restrictive role: completely charged and highly charged polypeptides are very poor immunogens. The immunogenicity of d -amino acid polymers and the stereospecificity of the antibody response have been confirmed, and the reason for the difficulty in eliciting antibody formation has been established. Immunization with the relatively large doses of antigen used with l polymers (2 to 20 mg) does not generally elicit antibody formation with d antigens, but low doses (0.3 to 0.6 mg) of antigen administered over a long period of time induce antibody formation to a wide variety of d -polypeptides. The d polymers do not display a significant booster effect, and eventually the antibody response is abolished by continued injection of the antigen. Using this same low dosage schedule, polylysine and polyglutamic acid of both optical configurations also elicit antibody. Thus, the generalization can be made that small doses of poor immunogens stimulate antibody formation and larger doses induce immunological paralysis. The experiments described in this study suggest that the method needed to induce antibody formation is determined by quite general properties of the antigen (e.g. optical configuration, excessively high charge) and that the quantitative control of antibody production depends upon both the general properties and the detailed composition of the antigen (e.g. types of amino acids)."

https://openalex.org/W2045399932,"Of 27 microorganisms examined, 23 plant pathogenic and saprophytic bacterial species were found to convert p,p' DDT to p,p' DDD under anaerobic conditions. The range of conversion of DDT (10 micrograms per milliliter) during an incubation of 14 days was from a trace to over 5 micrograms per milliliter, with the majority of the bacteria showing the greatest activity during the final 7-day period. There is evidence that metabolites of DDT other than DDD are also produced."

https://openalex.org/W2022235907,"THE most difficult aspect of determining the specific “trace element” requirements of micro-organisms is the preparation of a medium free of these factors. With some micro-organisms, EDTA chelates form a reserve from which cations may be drawn1, but we have found that L. acidophilus cannot utilize EDTA chelates. When the trace elements are tied up by EDTA, a medium in which L. acidophilus normally grows well no longer supports growth. Moreover, the EDTA portion of the molecule is not toxic per se, because the addition of excess cations provides the usual growth."

https://openalex.org/W130052660,"1. A modified purification procedure for β-methylaspartase from Clostridium tetanomorphum, which gives electrophoretically pure enzyme in almost 50% yield, is described. 2. The z-average molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined to be 100,000 by the sedimentation equilibrium technique. The molecular weight was invariant in the pH range, 5.9 to 9.7, and was also not affected by ethylenediaminetetraacetate (10-4 m ) or by Mg++ and K+ at concentrations which are optimal for catalytic activity. 3. Under a variety of experimental conditions similar to those used in the sedimentation equilibrium studies, sedimentation velocity experiments yielded an s020,w value of 6.05 S for the native enzyme. 4. Trailing boundary sedimentation experiments showed that the sedimentation coefficient associated with β-methylaspartase activity was very close to 6.05 S. This result established that the enzyme species having an s020,w value of 6.05 S and a molecular weight of 100,000 was present, and catalytically active, under the conditions we have commonly used in steady state kinetic studies of the reaction. 5. The value of e279 was 5.63 x 104 m -1 cm-1 and the molar turnover number at pH 9.7, with Mg++ and K+ as activators, was 650 sec-1. 6. All catalytic activity was lost when 2 sulfhydryl groups, out of a total of 20 in the enzyme molecule, had reacted with p-chloromercuribenzoate."

https://openalex.org/W2009948049,"IN the fifty years since Higgins1 obtained evidence that fructose has a greater tendency to change into fat in the body than has dextrose, more evidence has accumulated, much of it in the past few years, to show that lipid metabolism in man and experimental animals is affected differently by different carbohydrates2–5. Recently, it was found that substitution of sucrose for starch in the diet of weanling and three month old rats caused metabolic changes6, and that diets containing sucrose, and more especially fructose, increased plasma cholesterol levels and carcass and liver fat of adult rats compared with diets containing dextrose or liquid glucose or a standard laboratory diet7."

Field studies5–6 have provided the basic information on the copulatory sequences of behaviour of adult rhesus monkeys; findings which have recently been confirmed in the laboratory7. The present investigation is concerned with a particular aspect of sexual behaviour: namely, the relation between mounting and thrusting activity on one hand and the timing of ejaculation on the other."

https://openalex.org/W2080190383,"IT has recently been shown that the Rh activity of lyophilized human Rh-positive stroma could be abolished with certain sulphydryl reagents, that this could be prevented by the concurrent addition of excess thiol, and that the loss was reversible with one such reagent1. It was not established whether the antigenic activity of non-lyophilized erythrocytes shows such an effect. The resolution of this problem was hampered in the case of intact cells by the presence of soluble sulphydryl systems, including haemoglobin and glutathione2, and in the case of non-lyophilized stroma both by the occlusion of these soluble components, and by the difficulty of quantitation of wet stroma. The results of the present experiments suggest that the loss of Rh activity of lyophilized stroma brought about by sulphydryl reagents is equally true of stroma which has not been lyophilized."

https://openalex.org/W2030003199,"THE basic functions of cell DNA are priming of DNA synthesis and priming of RNA synthesis. The radiation damage of the first is believed to be closely related to mutant formation and cell reproduction, and that of the second to genetic determination and regulation of intra-cellular metabolic processes. Recent investigations of these basic functions of DNA resulted in profound changes in the existing research practice and directed the development of radiation biochemistry of DNA from an almost purely phenomenological ground to a more causal approach. Although a relatively clear picture of cell molecular biology does exist, conflicting results are still obtained about the activity of the DNA primer, so far as its radiosensitivity against ionizing radiation is concerned."
