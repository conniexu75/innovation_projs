https://openalex.org/W3206370075,"The durability of immune memory after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination remains unclear. In this study, we longitudinally profiled vaccine responses in SARS-CoV-2–naïve and –recovered individuals for 6 months after vaccination. Antibodies declined from peak levels but remained detectable in most subjects at 6 months. By contrast, mRNA vaccines generated functional memory B cells that increased from 3 to 6 months postvaccination, with the majority of these cells cross-binding the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants. mRNA vaccination further induced antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and early CD4+ T cell responses correlated with long-term humoral immunity. Recall responses to vaccination in individuals with preexisting immunity primarily increased antibody levels without substantially altering antibody decay rates. Together, these findings demonstrate robust cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3205496902,"Somatosensory autonomic reflexes allow electroacupuncture stimulation (ES) to modulate body physiology at distant sites1–6 (for example, suppressing severe systemic inflammation6–9). Since the 1970s, an emerging organizational rule about these reflexes has been the presence of body-region specificity1–6. For example, ES at the hindlimb ST36 acupoint but not the abdominal ST25 acupoint can drive the vagal–adrenal anti-inflammatory axis in mice10,11. The neuroanatomical basis of this somatotopic organization is, however, unknown. Here we show that PROKR2Cre-marked sensory neurons, which innervate the deep hindlimb fascia (for example, the periosteum) but not abdominal fascia (for example, the peritoneum), are crucial for driving the vagal–adrenal axis. Low-intensity ES at the ST36 site in mice with ablated PROKR2Cre-marked sensory neurons failed to activate hindbrain vagal efferent neurons or to drive catecholamine release from adrenal glands. As a result, ES no longer suppressed systemic inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxins. By contrast, spinal sympathetic reflexes evoked by high-intensity ES at both ST25 and ST36 sites were unaffected. We also show that optogenetic stimulation of PROKR2Cre-marked nerve terminals through the ST36 site is sufficient to drive the vagal–adrenal axis but not sympathetic reflexes. Furthermore, the distribution patterns of PROKR2Cre nerve fibres can retrospectively predict body regions at which low-intensity ES will or will not effectively produce anti-inflammatory effects. Our studies provide a neuroanatomical basis for the selectivity and specificity of acupoints in driving specific autonomic pathways. Neuroanatomical findings demonstrate why electroactupuncture at only specific acupoints can drive the vagal–adrenal axis and treat inflammation in mice."

During April 2021, the city became overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and fatalities, as a new variant, B.1.617.2 (Delta), replaced B.1.1.7 (Alpha). A Bayesian model explains the growth advantage of Delta through a combination of increased transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to immune responses generated against earlier variants (median estimates: 1.5-fold greater transmissibility and 20% reduction in sensitivity). Seropositivity of an employee and family cohort increased from 42% to 87.5% between March and July 2021, with 27% reinfections, as judged by increased antibody concentration after a previous decline. The likely high transmissibility and partial evasion of immunity by the Delta variant contributed to an overwhelming surge in Delhi."
https://openalex.org/W3206996158,"Intratumoral heterogeneity is a critical frontier in understanding how the tumor microenvironment (TME) propels malignant progression. Here, we deconvolute the human pancreatic TME through large-scale integration of histology-guided regional multiOMICs with clinical data and patient-derived preclinical models. We discover ""subTMEs,"" histologically definable tissue states anchored in fibroblast plasticity, with regional relationships to tumor immunity, subtypes, differentiation, and treatment response. ""Reactive"" subTMEs rich in complex but functionally coordinated fibroblast communities were immune hot and inhabited by aggressive tumor cell phenotypes. The matrix-rich ""deserted"" subTMEs harbored fewer activated fibroblasts and tumor-suppressive features yet were markedly chemoprotective and enriched upon chemotherapy. SubTMEs originated in fibroblast differentiation trajectories, and transitory states were notable both in single-cell transcriptomics and in situ. The intratumoral co-occurrence of subTMEs produced patient-specific phenotypic and computationally predictable heterogeneity tightly linked to malignant biology. Therefore, heterogeneity within the plentiful, notorious pancreatic TME is not random but marks fundamental tissue organizational units."
https://openalex.org/W3207744615,"Antibiotics are used to fight pathogens but also target commensal bacteria, disturbing the composition of gut microbiota and causing dysbiosis and disease1. Despite this well-known collateral damage, the activity spectrum of different antibiotic classes on gut bacteria remains poorly characterized. Here we characterize further 144 antibiotics from a previous screen of more than 1,000 drugs on 38 representative human gut microbiome species2. Antibiotic classes exhibited distinct inhibition spectra, including generation dependence for quinolones and phylogeny independence for β-lactams. Macrolides and tetracyclines, both prototypic bacteriostatic protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibited nearly all commensals tested but also killed several species. Killed bacteria were more readily eliminated from in vitro communities than those inhibited. This species-specific killing activity challenges the long-standing distinction between bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotic classes and provides a possible explanation for the strong effect of macrolides on animal3–5 and human6,7 gut microbiomes. To mitigate this collateral damage of macrolides and tetracyclines, we screened for drugs that specifically antagonized the antibiotic activity against abundant Bacteroides species but not against relevant pathogens. Such antidotes selectively protected Bacteroides species from erythromycin treatment in human-stool-derived communities and gnotobiotic mice. These findings illluminate the activity spectra of antibiotics in commensal bacteria and suggest strategies to circumvent their adverse effects on the gut microbiota. This study systematically profiles the activity of several classes of antibiotics on gut commensal bacteria and identifies drugs that mitigate their collateral damage on commensal bacteria without compromising their efficacy against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3206598272,"To secure phosphorus (P) from soil, most land plants use a direct phosphate uptake pathway via root hairs and epidermis and an indirect phosphate uptake pathway via mycorrhizal symbiosis. The interaction between these two pathways is unclear. Here, we mapped a network between transcription factors and mycorrhizal symbiosis-related genes using Y1H. Intriguingly, this gene regulatory network is governed by the conserved P-sensing pathway, centered on phosphate starvation response (PHR) transcription factors. PHRs are required for mycorrhizal symbiosis and regulate symbiosis-related genes via the P1BS motif. SPX-domain proteins suppress OsPHR2-mediated induction of symbiosis-related genes and inhibit mycorrhizal infection. In contrast, plants overexpressing OsPHR2 show improved mycorrhizal infection and are partially resistant to P-mediated inhibition of symbiosis. Functional analyses of network nodes revealed co-regulation of hormonal signaling and mycorrhizal symbiosis. This network deciphers extensive regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by endogenous and exogenous signals and highlights co-option of the P-sensing pathway for mycorrhizal symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3183569244,"The event rate, energy distribution and time-domain behaviour of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) contain essential information regarding their physical nature and central engine, which are as yet unknown1,2. As the first precisely localized source, FRB 121102 (refs. 3–5) has been extensively observed and shows non-Poisson clustering of bursts over time and a power-law energy distribution6–8. However, the extent of the energy distribution towards the fainter end was not known. Here we report the detection of 1,652 independent bursts with a peak burst rate of 122 h−1, in 59.5 hours spanning 47 days. A peak in the isotropic equivalent energy distribution is found to be approximately 4.8 × 1037 erg at 1.25 GHz, below which the detection of bursts is suppressed. The burst energy distribution is bimodal, and well characterized by a combination of a log-normal function and a generalized Cauchy function. The large number of bursts in hour-long spans allows sensitive periodicity searches between 1 ms and 1,000 s. The non-detection of any periodicity or quasi-periodicity poses challenges for models involving a single rotating compact object. The high burst rate also implies that FRBs must be generated with a high radiative efficiency, disfavouring emission mechanisms with large energy requirements or contrived triggering conditions. For FRB 121102, 1,652 burst events are detected over 47 days, with a peak burst rate of 122 per hour, a bimodal burst rate energy distribution, and no periodicity or quasi-periodicity."
https://openalex.org/W3206452667,"The cyclic pyrimidines 3',5'-cyclic cytidine monophosphate (cCMP) and 3',5'-cyclic uridine monophosphate (cUMP) have been reported in multiple organisms and cell types. As opposed to the cyclic nucleotides 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which are second messenger molecules with well-established regulatory roles across all domains of life, the biological role of cyclic pyrimidines has remained unclear. Here we report that cCMP and cUMP are second messengers functioning in bacterial immunity against viruses. We discovered a family of bacterial pyrimidine cyclase enzymes that specifically synthesize cCMP and cUMP following phage infection and demonstrate that these molecules activate immune effectors that execute an antiviral response. A crystal structure of a uridylate cyclase enzyme from this family explains the molecular mechanism of selectivity for pyrimidines as cyclization substrates. Defense systems encoding pyrimidine cyclases, denoted here Pycsar (pyrimidine cyclase system for antiphage resistance), are widespread in prokaryotes. Our results assign clear biological function to cCMP and cUMP as immunity signaling molecules in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3207915361,"Abstract Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) create large conduits for cargo transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm across the nuclear envelope (NE) 1–3 . These multi-megadalton structures are composed of about thirty different nucleoporins that are distributed in three main substructures (the inner, cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic rings) around the central transport channel 4–6 . Here we use cryo-electron tomography on DLD-1 cells that were prepared using cryo-focused-ion-beam milling to generate a structural model for the human NPC in its native environment. We show that—compared with previous human NPC models obtained from purified NEs—the inner ring in our model is substantially wider; the volume of the central channel is increased by 75% and the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic rings are reorganized. Moreover, the NPC membrane exhibits asymmetry around the inner-ring complex. Using targeted degradation of Nup96, a scaffold nucleoporin of the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic rings, we observe the interdependence of each ring in modulating the central channel and maintaining membrane asymmetry. Our findings highlight the inherent flexibility of the NPC and suggest that the cellular environment has a considerable influence on NPC dimensions and architecture."
https://openalex.org/W3205523263,"Fractionalization is a phenomenon in which strong interactions in a quantum system drive the emergence of excitations with quantum numbers that are absent in the building blocks. Outstanding examples are excitations with charge e/3 in the fractional quantum Hall effect, solitons in one-dimensional conducting polymers and Majorana states in topological superconductors. Fractionalization is also predicted to manifest itself in low-dimensional quantum magnets, such as one-dimensional antiferromagnetic S = 1 chains. The fundamental features of this system are gapped excitations in the bulk and, remarkably, S = 1/2 edge states at the chain termini, leading to a four-fold degenerate ground state that reflects the underlying symmetry-protected topological order. Here, we use on-surface synthesis to fabricate one-dimensional spin chains that contain the S = 1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon triangulene as the building block. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 4.5 K, we probe length-dependent magnetic excitations at the atomic scale in both open-ended and cyclic spin chains, and directly observe gapped spin excitations and fractional edge states therein. Exact diagonalization calculations provide conclusive evidence that the spin chains are described by the S = 1 bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian in the Haldane symmetry-protected topological phase. Our results open a bottom-up approach to study strongly correlated quantum spin liquid phases in purely organic materials, with the potential for the realization of measurement-based quantum computation."
https://openalex.org/W3207879702,"Human epithelial tissues accumulate cancer-driver mutations with age1–9, yet tumour formation remains rare. The positive selection of these mutations suggests that they alter the behaviour and fitness of proliferating cells10–12. Thus, normal adult tissues become a patchwork of mutant clones competing for space and survival, with the fittest clones expanding by eliminating their less competitive neighbours11–14. However, little is known about how such dynamic competition in normal epithelia influences early tumorigenesis. Here we show that the majority of newly formed oesophageal tumours are eliminated through competition with mutant clones in the adjacent normal epithelium. We followed the fate of nascent, microscopic, pre-malignant tumours in a mouse model of oesophageal carcinogenesis and found that most were rapidly lost with no indication of tumour cell death, decreased proliferation or an anti-tumour immune response. However, deep sequencing of ten-day-old and one-year-old tumours showed evidence of selection on the surviving neoplasms. Induction of highly competitive clones in transgenic mice increased early tumour removal, whereas pharmacological inhibition of clonal competition reduced tumour loss. These results support a model in which survival of early neoplasms depends on their competitive fitness relative to that of mutant clones in the surrounding normal tissue. Mutant clones in normal epithelium have an unexpected anti-tumorigenic role in purging early tumours through cell competition, thereby preserving tissue integrity. The rarity of tumour formation despite the high proportion of cancer-driver mutations in epithelia is explained by the competitive fitness of tumour cells relative to that of surrounding mutant epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3205323262,"Recent studies indicate that the adaptive immune system plays a role in Lewy body dementia (LBD). However, the mechanism regulating T cell brain homing in LBD is unknown. Here, we observed T cells adjacent to Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurons in postmortem LBD brains. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified up-regulated expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) in CD4+ T cells in LBD. CSF protein levels of the CXCR4 ligand, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), were associated with neuroaxonal damage in LBD. Furthermore, we observed clonal expansion and up-regulated interleukin 17A expression by CD4+ T cells stimulated with a phosphorylated α-synuclein epitope. Thus, CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling may represent a mechanistic target for inhibiting pathological interleukin-17–producing T cell trafficking in LBD."
https://openalex.org/W3206615564,"The progression of chronic liver disease to hepatocellular carcinoma is caused by the acquisition of somatic mutations that affect 20–30 cancer genes1–8. Burdens of somatic mutations are higher and clonal expansions larger in chronic liver disease9–13 than in normal liver13–16, which enables positive selection to shape the genomic landscape9–13. Here we analysed somatic mutations from 1,590 genomes across 34 liver samples, including healthy controls, alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Seven of the 29 patients with liver disease had mutations in FOXO1, the major transcription factor in insulin signalling. These mutations affected a single hotspot within the gene, impairing the insulin-mediated nuclear export of FOXO1. Notably, six of the seven patients with FOXO1S22W hotspot mutations showed convergent evolution, with variants acquired independently by up to nine distinct hepatocyte clones per patient. CIDEB, which regulates lipid droplet metabolism in hepatocytes17–19, and GPAM, which produces storage triacylglycerol from free fatty acids20,21, also had a significant excess of mutations. We again observed frequent convergent evolution: up to fourteen independent clones per patient with CIDEB mutations and up to seven clones per patient with GPAM mutations. Mutations in metabolism genes were distributed across multiple anatomical segments of the liver, increased clone size and were seen in both alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but rarely in hepatocellular carcinoma. Master regulators of metabolic pathways are a frequent target of convergent somatic mutation in alcohol-related and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of somatic mutations in liver samples from patients with chronic liver disease identifies driver mutations in metabolism-related genes such as FOXO1, and shows that these variants frequently exhibit convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3206478830,"Earth has had oceans for nearly four billion years1 and Mars had lakes and rivers 3.5–3.8 billion years ago2. However, it is still unknown whether water has ever condensed on the surface of Venus3,4 because the planet—now completely dry5—has undergone global resurfacing events that obscure most of its history6,7. The conditions required for water to have initially condensed on the surface of Solar System terrestrial planets are highly uncertain, as they have so far only been studied with one-dimensional numerical climate models3 that cannot account for the effects of atmospheric circulation and clouds, which are key climate stabilizers. Here we show using three-dimensional global climate model simulations of early Venus and Earth that water clouds—which preferentially form on the nightside, owing to the strong subsolar water vapour absorption—have a strong net warming effect that inhibits surface water condensation even at modest insolations (down to 325 watts per square metre, that is, 0.95 times the Earth solar constant). This shows that water never condensed and that, consequently, oceans never formed on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, this shows that the formation of Earth’s oceans required much lower insolation than today, which was made possible by the faint young Sun. This also implies the existence of another stability state for present-day Earth: the ‘steam Earth’, with all the water from the oceans evaporated into the atmosphere. Global climate model simulations of early Venus and Earth show that differences in the cloud regimes prevented ocean formation on Venus but not on Earth."

https://openalex.org/W3206129109,"The ability to help and care for others fosters social cohesiveness and is vital to the physical and emotional well-being of social species, including humans1-3. Affiliative social touch, such as allogrooming (grooming behaviour directed towards another individual), is a major type of prosocial behaviour that provides comfort to others1-6. Affiliative touch serves to establish and strengthen social bonds between animals and can help to console distressed conspecifics. However, the neural circuits that promote prosocial affiliative touch have remained unclear. Here we show that mice exhibit affiliative allogrooming behaviour towards distressed partners, providing a consoling effect. The increase in allogrooming occurs in response to different types of stressors and can be elicited by olfactory cues from distressed individuals. Using microendoscopic calcium imaging, we find that neural activity in the medial amygdala (MeA) responds differentially to naive and distressed conspecifics and encodes allogrooming behaviour. Through intersectional functional manipulations, we establish a direct causal role of the MeA in controlling affiliative allogrooming and identify a select, tachykinin-expressing subpopulation of MeA GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-expressing) neurons that promote this behaviour through their projections to the medial preoptic area. Together, our study demonstrates that mice display prosocial comforting behaviour and reveals a neural circuit mechanism that underlies the encoding and control of affiliative touch during prosocial interactions."

https://openalex.org/W3205902287,"Oestrogen depletion in rodents and humans leads to inactivity, fat accumulation and diabetes1,2, underscoring the conserved metabolic benefits of oestrogen that inevitably decrease with age. In rodents, the preovulatory surge in 17β-oestradiol (E2) temporarily increases energy expenditure to coordinate increased physical activity with peak sexual receptivity. Here we report that a subset of oestrogen-sensitive neurons in the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHvl)3–7 projects to arousal centres in the hippocampus and hindbrain, and enables oestrogen to rebalance energy allocation in female mice. Surges in E2 increase melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) signalling in these VMHvl neurons by directly recruiting oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) to the Mc4r gene. Sedentary behaviour and obesity in oestrogen-depleted female mice were reversed after chemogenetic stimulation of VMHvl neurons expressing both MC4R and ERα. Similarly, a long-term increase in physical activity is observed after CRISPR-mediated activation of this node. These data extend the effect of MC4R signalling — the most common cause of monogenic human obesity8 — beyond the regulation of food intake and rationalize reported sex differences in melanocortin signalling, including greater disease severity of MC4R insufficiency in women9. This hormone-dependent node illuminates the power of oestrogen during the reproductive cycle in motivating behaviour and maintaining an active lifestyle in women. A subset of oestrogen-sensitive neurons integrate melanocortin and oestrogen signalling to rebalance energy allocation in female mice leading to reduced sedentary behaviour and decreasing obesity in oestrogen-depleted female mice"

https://openalex.org/W3205789009,"The hippocampal formation is linked to spatial navigation, but there is little corroboration from freely moving primates with concurrent monitoring of head and gaze stances. We recorded neural activity across hippocampal regions in rhesus macaques during free foraging in an open environment while tracking their head and eye. Theta activity was intermittently present at movement onset and modulated by saccades. Many neurons were phase-locked to theta, with few showing phase precession. Most neurons encoded a mixture of spatial variables beyond place and grid tuning. Spatial representations were dominated by facing location and allocentric direction, mostly in head, rather than gaze, coordinates. Importantly, eye movements strongly modulated neural activity in all regions. These findings reveal that the macaque hippocampal formation represents three-dimensional (3D) space using a multiplexed code, with head orientation and eye movement properties being dominant during free exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3205408718,"Retrotransposons mediate gene regulation in important developmental and pathological processes. Here, we characterized the transient retrotransposon induction during preimplantation development of eight mammals. Induced retrotransposons exhibit similar preimplantation profiles across species, conferring gene regulatory activities, particularly through long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon promoters. A mouse-specific MT2B2 retrotransposon promoter generates an N-terminally truncated Cdk2ap1ΔN that peaks in preimplantation embryos and promotes proliferation. In contrast, the canonical Cdk2ap1 peaks in mid-gestation and represses cell proliferation. This MT2B2 promoter, whose deletion abolishes Cdk2ap1ΔN production, reduces cell proliferation and impairs embryo implantation, is developmentally essential. Intriguingly, Cdk2ap1ΔN is evolutionarily conserved in sequence and function yet is driven by different promoters across mammals. The distinct preimplantation Cdk2ap1ΔN expression in each mammalian species correlates with the duration of its preimplantation development. Hence, species-specific transposon promoters can yield evolutionarily conserved, alternative protein isoforms, bestowing them with new functions and species-specific expression to govern essential biological divergence."
https://openalex.org/W3206987031,"µ-Opioid peptide receptor (MOPR) stimulation alters respiration, analgesia and reward behaviour, and can induce substance abuse and overdose1-3. Despite its evident importance, the endogenous mechanisms for MOPR regulation of consummatory behaviour have remained unknown4. Here we report that endogenous MOPR regulation of reward consumption in mice acts through a specific dorsal raphe to nucleus accumbens projection. MOPR-mediated inhibition of raphe terminals is necessary and sufficient to determine consummatory response, while select enkephalin-containing nucleus accumbens ensembles are engaged prior to reward consumption, suggesting that local enkephalin release is the source of the endogenous MOPR ligand. Selective modulation of nucleus accumbens enkephalin neurons and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of enkephalin substantiate this finding. These results isolate a fundamental endogenous opioid circuit for state-dependent consumptive behaviour and suggest alternative mechanisms for opiate modulation of reward."
https://openalex.org/W3206332086,"Robustness against disorder and defects is a pivotal advantage of topological systems1, manifested by the absence of electronic backscattering in the quantum-Hall2 and spin-Hall effects3, and by unidirectional waveguiding in their classical analogues4,5. Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators4-13, in particular, provide unprecedented opportunities in a variety of fields owing to their compact planar geometries, which are compatible with the fabrication technologies used in modern electronics and photonics. Among all 2D topological phases, Chern insulators14-25 are currently the most reliable designs owing to the genuine backscattering immunity of their non-reciprocal edge modes, brought via time-reversal symmetry breaking. Yet such resistance to fabrication tolerances is limited to fluctuations of the same order of magnitude as their bandgap, limiting their resilience to small perturbations only. Here we investigate the robustness problem in a system where edge transmission can survive disorder levels with strengths arbitrarily larger than the bandgap-an anomalous non-reciprocal topological network. We explore the general conditions needed to obtain such an unusual effect in systems made of unitary three-port non-reciprocal scatterers connected by phase links, and establish the superior robustness of anomalous edge transmission modes over Chern ones to phase-link disorder of arbitrarily large values. We confirm experimentally the exceptional resilience of the anomalous phase, and demonstrate its operation in various arbitrarily shaped disordered multi-port prototypes. Our results pave the way to efficient, arbitrary planar energy transport on 2D substrates for wave devices with full protection against large fabrication flaws or imperfections."

Simulations predict9-11 that planets in Jupiter-like orbits around stars of ≲8 M☉ (solar mass) avoid being destroyed by the strong tidal forces of their stellar host, but as yet, there has been no observational confirmation of such a survivor. Here we report the non-detection of a main-sequence lens star in the microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-477Lb12 using near-infrared observations from the Keck Observatory. We determine that this system contains a 0.53 ± 0.11 M☉ white-dwarf host orbited by a 1.4 ± 0.3 Jupiter-mass planet with a separation on the plane of the sky of 2.8 ± 0.5 astronomical units, which implies a semi-major axis larger than this. This system is evidence that planets around white dwarfs can survive the giant and asymptotic giant phases of their host's evolution, and supports the prediction that more than half of white dwarfs have Jovian planetary companions13.

https://openalex.org/W3205552454,"Cell division is thought to be initiated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) inactivating key transcriptional inhibitors. In budding yeast, the G1 cyclin Cln3-Cdk1 complex is thought to directly phosphorylate the Whi5 protein, thereby releasing the transcription factor SBF and committing cells to division. We report that Whi5 is a poor substrate of Cln3-Cdk1, which instead phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb1’s C-terminal domain on S5 of its heptapeptide repeats. Cln3-Cdk1 binds SBF-regulated promoters and Cln3’s function can be performed by the canonical S5 kinase Ccl1-Kin28 when synthetically recruited to SBF. Thus, we propose that Cln3-Cdk1 triggers cell division by phosphorylating Rpb1 at SBF-regulated promoters to promote transcription. Our findings blur the distinction between cell cycle and transcriptional Cdks to highlight the ancient relationship between these two processes."

Although naturally acquired leprosy has also been described in captive nonhuman primates 4–7 , the exact origins of infection remain unclear. Here we describe leprosy-like lesions in two wild populations of western chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes verus ) in Cantanhez National Park, Guinea-Bissau and Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa. Longitudinal monitoring of both populations revealed the progression of disease symptoms compatible with advanced leprosy. Screening of faecal and necropsy samples confirmed the presence of M. leprae as the causative agent at each site and phylogenomic comparisons with other strains from humans and other animals show that the chimpanzee strains belong to different and rare genotypes (4N/O and 2F). These findings suggest that M. leprae may be circulating in more wild animals than suspected, either as a result of exposure to humans or other unknown environmental sources."
https://openalex.org/W3206106712,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)1 and the related leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK)2 are recently deorphanized receptor tyrosine kinases3. Together with their activating cytokines, ALKAL1 and ALKAL24–6 (also called FAM150A and FAM150B or AUGβ and AUGα, respectively), they are involved in neural development7, cancer7–9 and autoimmune diseases10. Furthermore, mammalian ALK recently emerged as a key regulator of energy expenditure and weight gain11, consistent with a metabolic role for Drosophila ALK12. Despite such functional pleiotropy and growing therapeutic relevance13,14, structural insights into ALK and LTK and their complexes with cognate cytokines have remained scarce. Here we show that the cytokine-binding segments of human ALK and LTK comprise a novel architectural chimera of a permuted TNF-like module that braces a glycine-rich subdomain featuring a hexagonal lattice of long polyglycine type II helices. The cognate cytokines ALKAL1 and ALKAL2 are monomeric three-helix bundles, yet their binding to ALK and LTK elicits similar dimeric assemblies with two-fold symmetry, that tent a single cytokine molecule proximal to the cell membrane. We show that the membrane-proximal EGF-like domain dictates the apparent cytokine preference of ALK. Assisted by these diverse structure–function findings, we propose a structural and mechanistic blueprint for complexes of ALK family receptors, and thereby extend the repertoire of ligand-mediated dimerization mechanisms adopted by receptor tyrosine kinases. Structural studies of the complex of anaplastic lymphoma kinase and leukocyte tyrosine kinase and their activating cytokines identify unique architectural features of the complex, and provide a novel mechanistic paradigm among receptor tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W3207577241,"Impairment in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is strongly associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the regulators responsible for its impairment remain elusive. In this paper, we identify the E3 ligase Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interacting Protein 12 (TRIP12) as a key regulator of GCase. TRIP12 interacts with and ubiquitinates GCase at lysine 293 to control its degradation via ubiquitin proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinated GCase by TRIP12 leads to its functional impairment through premature degradation and subsequent accumulation of α-synuclein. TRIP12 overexpression causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which is ameliorated by GCase overexpression. Further, conditional TRIP12 knockout in vitro and knockdown in vivo promotes the expression of GCase, which blocks α-synuclein preformed fibrils (α-syn PFFs)-provoked dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Moreover, TRIP12 accumulates in human PD brain and α-synuclein-based mouse models. The identification of TRIP12 as a regulator of GCase provides a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunctional GCase-driven neurodegeneration in PD."
https://openalex.org/W3206954814,"LDLRAD3 is a recently defined attachment and entry receptor for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)1, a New World alphavirus that causes severe neurological disease in humans. Here we present near-atomic-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of VEEV virus-like particles alone and in a complex with the ectodomains of LDLRAD3. Domain 1 of LDLRAD3 is a low-density lipoprotein receptor type-A module that binds to VEEV by wedging into a cleft created by two adjacent E2-E1 heterodimers in one trimeric spike, and engages domains A and B of E2 and the fusion loop in E1. Atomic modelling of this interface is supported by mutagenesis and anti-VEEV antibody binding competition assays. Notably, VEEV engages LDLRAD3 in a manner that is similar to the way that arthritogenic alphaviruses bind to the structurally unrelated MXRA8 receptor, but with a much smaller interface. These studies further elucidate the structural basis of alphavirus-receptor interactions, which could inform the development of therapies to mitigate infection and disease against multiple members of this family."

Despite the observation of rich Mott-Wigner physics stemming from an interplay between the periodic potential and Coulomb interactions, the absence of tunnel coupling–induced hybridization of electronic states has ensured a classical layer degree of freedom. We investigated a MoSe2 homobilayer structure where interlayer coherent tunneling allows for electric field–controlled manipulation and measurement of the ground-state hole-layer pseudospin. We observed an electrically tunable two-dimensional Feshbach resonance in exciton-hole scattering, which allowed us to control the strength of interactions between excitons and holes located in different layers. Our results may enable the realization of degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3205415671,"Understanding long-run patterns in the incarceration of Black Americans requires integrating the study of racial inequality with the study of political economy. I offer a parsimonious framework describing how the Black incarceration rate has been affected by the dynamics of exploitation and exclusion over time and across space. This framework helps to explain otherwise puzzling facts, like why the Black incarceration rate was lower in the South than in the North for much of the 20th century, why it was lowest in the South’s cotton belt, and why it began to tick upward when it did. It also enables us to better understand recent changes in racial and class inequality in incarceration in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W3206290808,"Most patients cannot be included in randomized clinical trials. We report real-world outcomes of all Danish patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with daratumumab-based regimens until 1 January 2019. Methods Information of 635 patients treated with daratumumab was collected retrospectively and included lines of therapy (LOT), hematologic responses according to the International Myeloma Working Group recommendations, time to next treatment (TNT) and the cause of discontinuation of treatment. Baseline characteristics were acquired from the validated Danish Multiple Myeloma Registry (DMMR). Results Daratumumab was administrated as monotherapy (Da-mono) in 27.7%, in combination with immunomodulatory drugs (Da-IMiD) in 57.3%, in combination with proteasome inhibitors (Da-PI) in 11.2% and in other combinations (Da-other) in 3.8% of patients. The median number of lines of therapy given before daratumumab was 5 for Da-mono, 3 for Da-IMiD, 4 for Da-PI, and 2 for Da-other. In Da-mono, overall response rate (ORR) was 44.9% and median time to next treatment (mTNT) was 4.9 months. In Da-IMiD, ORR was 80.5%, and mTNT was 16.1 months. In Da-PI, OOR was 60.6% and mTNT was 5.3 months. In patients treated with Da-other, OOR was 54,2% and mTNT was 5.6 months. The use of daratumumab in early LOT was associated with longer TNT (p&lt;0.0001). Patients with amplification 1q had outcome comparable to standard risk patients, while patients with t(4;14), t(14;16) or del17p had worse outcome (p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis indicated that timing of treatment (timing of daratumumab in the sequence of all LOT that the patients received throughout the course of their disease) was the most important factor for outcome (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion The real-world outcomes of multiple myeloma patients treated with daratumumab are worse than the results of clinical trials. Outcomes achieved with daratumumab were best when daratumumab was used in combination with IMIDs and in early LOT. Patients with high-risk CA had worse outcomes, but patients with amp1q had similar outcomes to standard-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W3205436214,"Molecular switch proteins whose cycling between states is controlled by opposing regulators1,2 are central to biological signal transduction. As switch proteins function within highly connected interaction networks3, the fundamental question arises of how functional specificity is achieved when different processes share common regulators. Here we show that functional specificity of the small GTPase switch protein Gsp1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (the homologue of the human protein RAN)4 is linked to differential sensitivity of biological processes to different kinetics of the Gsp1 (RAN) switch cycle. We make 55 targeted point mutations to individual protein interaction interfaces of Gsp1 (RAN) and show through quantitative genetic5 and physical interaction mapping that Gsp1 (RAN) interface perturbations have widespread cellular consequences. Contrary to expectation, the cellular effects of the interface mutations group by their biophysical effects on kinetic parameters of the GTPase switch cycle and not by the targeted interfaces. Instead, we show that interface mutations allosterically tune the GTPase cycle kinetics. These results suggest a model in which protein partner binding, or post-translational modifications at distal sites, could act as allosteric regulators of GTPase switching. Similar mechanisms may underlie regulation by other GTPases, and other biological switches. Furthermore, our integrative platform to determine the quantitative consequences of molecular perturbations may help to explain the effects of disease mutations that target central molecular switches."
https://openalex.org/W3205764741,"St. John's wort (SJW), from traditional herbs, activates the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a potential drug target for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, how SJW alleviates dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced experimental IBD by activating PXR is unknown. To test this, PXR-humanized, wild-type (WT) and Pxr-null mice, primary intestinal organoids cultures, and the luciferase reporter gene assays were employed. In vivo, a diet supplemented with SJW was found to activate intestinal PXR both in WT and PXR-humanized mice, but not in Pxr-null mice. SJW prevented DSS-induced IBD in PXR-humanized and WT mice, but not in Pxr-null mice. In vitro, hyperforin, a major component of SJW, activated PXR and suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α-induced nuclear factor (NF) κB translocation in primary intestinal organoids from PXR-humanized mice, but not Pxr-null mice. Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that hyperforin dose-dependently alleviated TNFα-induced NFκB transactivation by activating human PXR in Caco2 cells. Furthermore, SJW therapeutically attenuated DSS-induced IBD in PXR-humanized mice. These data indicate the therapeutic potential of SJW in alleviating DSS-induced IBD in vivo, and TNFα-induced NFκB activation in vitro, dependent on PXR activation, which may have clinical implications for using SJW as a herbal drug anti-IBD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3206050715,"More than 60% of the flora of the Galapagos Islands is introduced and some of these species have become invasive, severely altering ecosystems. An example of an affected ecosystem is the Scalesia forest, originally dominated by the endemic giant daisy tree Scalesia pedunculata (Asteraceae). The remnant patches of this unique forest are increasingly being invaded by introduced plants, mainly by Rubus niveus (blackberry, Rosaceae). To help large-scale restoration of this ecologically important forest, we seek to better understand the natural regeneration of S. pedunculata after invasive plant control. We monitored naturally recruited S. pedunculata saplings and young trees over five years in an area where invasive plant species are continuously being removed by manual means. We measured survival, height and growth of S. pedunculata saplings and young trees along permanent transects. Percent cover of surrounding plant species and of canopy shade directly above each S. pedunculata individual were determined, as well as distance to the next mature S. pedunculata tree. We identified potential factors influencing initial sapling survival and growth by applying generalized linear models. Results showed a rapid growth of saplings and young trees of up to 0.45 cm per day and a high mortality rate, as is typical for pioneer species like S. pedunculata. Sapling survival, growth and mortality seemed to be influenced by light availability, surrounding vegetation and distance to the next adult S. pedunculata tree. We concluded that natural regeneration of S. pedunculata was high only five months after the last herbicide application but that 95% of these recruits had died over the 5-year period. Further studies are needed to corroborate whether the number of surviving trees is sufficient to replace the aging adult trees and this way maintain remnants of the Scalesia forest. Urgent action is needed to help improve future restoration strategies to prevent further degradation of this rapidly shrinking threatened forest ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3205700144,"To describe the profile of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with fingolimod in Spain and to assess the effectiveness and safety of fingolimod after 4 years of inclusion in the Spanish Gilenya Registry.An observational, retrospective/prospective, multicenter case registry, including all patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) starting treatment with fingolimod in 43 centers in Spain. Analyses were performed in the overall population and in subgroups according to prior disease-modifying therapy (DMT): glatiramer acetate/interferon beta-1 (BRACE), natalizumab, other treatment, or naïve.Six hundred and sixty-six evaluable patients were included (91.1% previously treated with at least one DMT). The mean annualized relapse rate (ARR) prior to fingolimod was 1.12, and the mean EDSS at fingolimod initiation was 3.03. Fingolimod reduced the ARR by 71.4%, 75%, 75.5%, and 80.3%, after 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively (p<0.001). This significant reduction in the ARR continued to be observed in all subgroups. After 4 years, the EDSS showed a minimal deterioration, with the EDSS scores from year 1 to year 4 remaining mostly stable. The percentage of patients without T1 Gd+ lesions progressively increased from 45.6% during the year prior to fingolimod initiation to 88.2% at year 4. The proportion of patients free from new/enlarged T2 lesions after 4 years of fingolimod treatment was 80.3%. This trend in both radiological measures was also observed in the subgroups. Adverse events (AEs) were experienced by up to 41.6% of patients (most commonly: lymphopenia [12.5%] and urinary tract infection [3.7%]). Most AEs were mild in severity, 3.6% of patients had serious AEs.The patient profile was similar to other observational studies. The results obtained from the long-term use of fingolimod showed that it was effective, regardless of prior DMT, and it had adequate safety results, with a positive benefit-risk balance."
https://openalex.org/W3205802883,"Glutamate is the most pivotal excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) dimerize and can couple to inhibitory intracellular signal cascades, thereby protecting glutamatergic neurons from excessive excitation and cell death. MGluR7 is correlated with age-related hearing deficits and noise-induced hearing loss; however its exact localization in the cochlea is unknown. Here, we analyzed the expression and localization of mGluR7a and mGluR7b in mouse cochlear wholemounts in detail, using confocal microscopy and 3D reconstructions. We observed a presynaptic localization of mGluR7a at inner hair cells (IHCs), close to the synaptic ribbon. To detect mGluR7b, newly generated antibodies were characterized and showed co-localization with mGluR7a at IHC ribbon synapses. Compared to the number of synaptic ribbons, the numbers of mGluR7a and mGluR7b puncta were reduced at higher frequencies (48 to 64 kHz) and in older animals (6 and 12 months). Previously, we reported a presynaptic localization of mGluR4 and mGluR8b at this synapse type. This enables the possibility for the formation of homo- and/or heterodimeric receptors composed of mGluR4, mGluR7a, mGluR7b and mGluR8b at IHC ribbon synapses. These receptor complexes might represent new molecular targets suited for pharmacological concepts to protect the cochlea against noxious stimuli and excitotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3205394071,"Kinetin or N6-furfuryladenine (K) belongs to a class of plant hormones called cytokinins, which are biologically active molecules modulating many aspects of plant growth and development. However, biological activities of cytokinins are not only limited to plants; their effects on animals have been widely reported in the literature. Here, we found that Kinetin is a potent small molecule that efficiently stimulates differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes in vitro. The highest efficacy was achieved at 1μM and 10μM Kinetin concentrations, in both mitogen-poor and rich media. More importantly, Kinetin was able to strongly stimulate the MyoD-dependent conversion of fibroblasts into myotubes. Kinetin alone did not give rise to fibroblast conversion and required MyoD; this demonstrates that Kinetin augments the molecular repertoire of necessary key regulatory factors to facilitate MyoD-mediated myogenic differentiation. This novel Kinetin pro-myogenic function may be explained by its ability to alter intracellular calcium levels and by its potential to impact on Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) signalling. Taken together, our findings unravel the effects of a new class of small molecules with potent pro-myogenic activities. This opens up new therapeutic avenues with potential for treating skeletal muscle diseases related to muscle aging and wasting."

https://openalex.org/W3206406903,"There is limited data on the effects of low carbohydrate diets on renal outcomes particularly in patients with underlying diabetic kidney disease. Therefore, this study determined the safety and effects of very low carbohydrate (VLCBD) in addition to low protein diet (LPD) on renal outcomes, anthropometric, metabolic and inflammatory parameters in patients with T2DM and underlying mild to moderate kidney disease (DKD).This was an investigator-initiated, single-center, randomized, controlled, clinical trial in patients with T2DM and DKD, comparing 12-weeks of low carbohydrate diet (<20g daily intake) versus standard low protein (0.8g/kg/day) and low salt diet. Patients in the VLCBD group underwent 2-weekly monitoring including their 3-day food diaries. In addition, Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was performed to estimate body fat percentages.The study population (n = 30) had a median age of 57 years old and a BMI of 30.68kg/m2. Both groups showed similar total calorie intake, i.e. 739.33 (IQR288.48) vs 789.92 (IQR522.4) kcal, by the end of the study. The VLCBD group showed significantly lower daily carbohydrate intake 27 (IQR25) g vs 89.33 (IQR77.4) g, p<0.001, significantly higher protein intake per day 44.08 (IQR21.98) g vs 29.63 (IQR16.35) g, p<0.05 and no difference in in daily fat intake. Both groups showed no worsening of serum creatinine at study end, with consistent declines in HbA1c (1.3(1.1) vs 0.7(1.25) %) and fasting blood glucose (1.5(3.37) vs 1.3(5.7) mmol/L). The VLCBD group showed significant reductions in total daily insulin dose (39(22) vs 0 IU, p<0.001), increased LDL-C and HDL-C, decline in IL-6 levels; with contrasting results in the control group. This was associated with significant weight reduction (-4.0(3.9) vs 0.2(4.2) kg, p = <0.001) and improvements in body fat percentages. WC was significantly reduced in the VLCBD group, even after adjustments to age, HbA1c, weight and creatinine changes. Both dietary interventions were well received with no reported adverse events.This study demonstrated that dietary intervention of very low carbohydrate diet in patients with underlying diabetic kidney disease was safe and associated with significant improvements in glycemic control, anthropometric measurements including weight, abdominal adiposity and IL-6. Renal outcomes remained unchanged. These findings would strengthen the importance of this dietary intervention as part of the management of patients with diabetic kidney disease."

The UK COVID-19 Public Experiences (COPE) study aims to identify determinants of health behaviour using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation (COM-B) model using a longitudinal mixed-methods approach. Here, we provide a detailed description of the demographic and self-reported health characteristics of the COPE cohort at baseline assessment, an overview of data collected, and plans for follow-up of the cohort. The COPE baseline survey was completed by 11,113 UK adult residents (18+ years of age). Baseline data collection started on the 13th of March 2020 (10-days before the introduction of the first national COVID-19 lockdown in the UK) and finished on the 13th of April 2020. Participants were recruited via the HealthWise Wales (HWW) research registry and through social media snowballing and advertising (Facebook®, Twitter®, Instagram®). Participants were predominantly female (69%), over 50 years of age (68%), identified as white (98%), and were living with their partner (68%). A large proportion (67%) had a college/university level education, and half reported a pre-existing health condition (50%). Initial follow-up plans for the cohort included in-depth surveys at 3-months and 12-months after the first UK national lockdown to assess short and medium-term effects of the pandemic on health behaviour and subjective health and well-being. Additional consent will be sought from participants at follow-up for data linkage and surveys at 18 and 24-months after the initial UK national lockdown. A large non-random sample was recruited to the COPE cohort during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which will enable longitudinal analysis of the determinants of health behaviour and changes in subjective health and well-being over the course of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3205150913,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of hearing aids on body balance function in a strictly controlled auditory environment.We recorded the findings of 10 experienced hearing aid users and 10 normal-hearing participants. All the participants were assessed using posturography under eight conditions in an acoustically shielded non-reverberant room: (1) eyes open with sound stimuli, with and without foam rubber, (2) eyes closed with sound stimuli, with and without foam rubber, (3) eyes open without sound stimuli, with and without foam rubber, and (4) eyes closed without sound stimuli, with and without foam rubber.The auditory cue improved the total path area and sway velocity in both the hearing aid users and normal-hearing participants. The analysis of variance showed that the interaction among eye condition, sound condition, and between-group factor was significant in the maximum displacement of the center-of-pressure in the mediolateral axis (F [1, 18] = 6.19, p = 0.02). The maximum displacement of the center-of-pressure in the mediolateral axis improved with the auditory cues in the normal-hearing participants in the eyes closed condition (5.4 cm and 4.7 cm, p < 0.01). In the hearing aid users, this difference was not significant (5.9 cm and 5.7 cm, p = 0.45). The maximum displacement of the center-of-pressure in the anteroposterior axis improved in both the hearing aid users and the normal-hearing participants."
https://openalex.org/W3205177433,"Background Executive functions underlie self-regulation and are thus important for physical activity and adaptation to new situations. The aim was to investigate, if yearlong physical and cognitive training (PTCT) had greater effects on physical activity among older adults than physical training (PT) alone, and if executive functions predicted physical activity at baseline, after six (6m) and twelve months (12m) of the interventions, one-year post-intervention follow-up and an extended follow-up during COVID-19 lockdown. Methods Data from a single-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (PASSWORD-study, ISRCTN52388040) were utilized. Participants were 70–85 years old community-dwelling men and women from Jyväskylä, Finland. PT (n = 159) included supervised resistance, walking and balance training, home-exercises and self-administered moderate activity. PTCT (n = 155) included PT and cognitive training targeting executive functions on a computer program. Physical activity was assessed with a one-item, seven-scale question. Executive functions were assessed with color-word Stroop, Trail Making Test (TMT) B-A and Letter Fluency. Changes in physical activity were modeled with multinomial logistic models and the impact of executive functions on physical activity with latent change score models. Results No significant group-by-time interaction was observed for physical activity (p&gt;0.1). The subjects were likely to select an activity category higher than baseline throughout the study (pooled data: B = 0.720–1.614, p&lt;0.001–0.046). Higher baseline Stroop predicted higher physical activity through all subsequent time-points (pooled data: B = 0.011–0.013, p = 0.015–0.030). Higher baseline TMT B–A predicted higher physical activity at 6m (pooled data: B = 0.007, p = 0.006) and during COVID-19 (B = 0.005, p = 0.030). In the PT group, higher baseline Letter Fluency predicted higher physical activity at 12m (B = -0.028, p = 0.030) and follow-up (B = -0.042, p = 0.002). Conclusions Cognitive training did not have additive effects over physical training alone on physical activity, but multicomponent training and higher executive function at baseline may support adaptation to and maintenance of a physically active lifestyle among older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3206436045,"A substantial number of patients presenting with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and multivessel disease (MVD) have severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 35%). But data are lacking regarding optimal percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy for these patients. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of IRA (infarct-related artery)-only and multivessel PCI in patients with NSTEMI and MVD complicated by severe LVSD.Among 13,104 patients enrolled in the PCI registry from November 2011 to December 2015, patients with NSTEMI and MVD with severe LVSD who underwent successful PCI were screened. The primary outcome was 3-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as all-cause death, any myocardial infarction, stroke, and any revascularization.Overall, 228 patients were treated with IRA-only PCI (n = 104) or MV-PCI (n = 124). The MACE risk was significantly lower in the MV-PCI group than in the IRA-only PCI group (35.5% vs. 54.8%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.561; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.378-0.832; p = 0.04). This result was mainly driven by a significantly lower risk of all-cause death (23.4% vs. 41.4%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.503; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.314-0.806; p = 0.004). The results were consistent after multivariate regression, propensity-score matching, and inverse probability weighting to adjust for baseline differences.Among patients with NSTEMI and MVD complicated with severe LVSD, multivessel PCI was associated with a significantly lower MACE risk. The findings may provide valuable information to physicians who are involved in decision-making for these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3206622442,"This ex vivo study aimed to evaluate the strengthening effect of different ferrule and reattachment designs with fiber and adhesive materials on vertically fractured teeth.Ninety extracted single-root premolars were instrumented and divided into nine groups (two control groups and seven experimental groups; n = 10). The negative control (NC) group comprised of intact teeth, while the positive control (PC) group comprised of root canal-treated teeth. The roots of the teeth in the experimental groups were vertically fractured into two equal fragments. The fragments were reattached with one of the followings: 4-methacryloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride/methacrylate-tri-n-butyl borane (4-META/MMA-TBB) resin, 4-META/MMA-TBB + quartz fiber post, 4-META/MMA-TBB + glass fiber bundles, 4-META/MMA-TBB + quartz fiber post + 1 mm ferrule, 4-META/MMA-TBB + glass fiber bundles + 1 mm ferrule, 4-META/MMA-TBB + quartz fiber post + 2 mm ferrule, and 4-META/MMA-TBB + glass fiber bundles + 2 mm ferrule. The core build-ups were made with composite resin. The specimens were subjected to compressive loading until failure occurred. Mean load necessary to fracture each sample and the fracture types of these samples were recorded.The highest mean fracture load was recorded in the NC group (1,036.7 N), which was not significantly higher than the PC group (989.66 N) (p > 0.05). The roots reattached with quartz fiber post demonstrated significantly less fracture strength (871.9 N) as compared to the other test and control groups (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the PC group and reattached fragments with different ferrule designs in terms of fracture resistance (p > 0.05).The customized fiber bundles may be more suitable for reattachment of vertically fractured teeth than the rigid fiber posts. For reattachment procedures, the ferrule design may be preferred to increase the fracture strength of vertically fractured teeth."
https://openalex.org/W3206815022,"Chlamydial infections, caused by a group of obligate, intracellular, gram-negative bacteria, have health implications for animals and humans. Due to their highly infectious nature and zoonotic potential, staff at wildlife rehabilitation centers should be educated on the clinical manifestations, prevalence, and risk factors associated with Chlamydia spp. infections in raptors. The objectives of this study were to document the prevalence of chlamydial DNA shedding and anti-chlamydial antibodies in raptors admitted to five wildlife rehabilitation centers in California over a one-year period. Chlamydial prevalence was estimated in raptors for each center and potential risk factors associated with infection were evaluated, including location, species, season, and age class. Plasma samples and conjunctiva/choana/cloaca swabs were collected for serology and qPCR from a subset of 263 birds of prey, representing 18 species. Serologic assays identified both anti-C. buteonis IgM and anti-chlamydial IgY antibodies. Chlamydial DNA and anti-chlamydial antibodies were detected in 4.18% (11/263) and 3.14% (6/191) of patients, respectively. Chamydial DNA was identified in raptors from the families Accipitridae and Strigidae while anti-C.buteonis IgM was identified in birds identified in Accipitridae, Falconidae, Strigidae, and Cathartidae. Two of the chlamydial DNA positive birds (one Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni) and one red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis)) were necropsied, and tissues were collected for culture. Sequencing of the cultured elementary bodies revealed a chlamydial DNA sequence with 99.97% average nucleotide identity to the recently described Chlamydia buteonis. Spatial clusters of seropositive raptors and raptors positive for chlamydial DNA were detected in northern California. Infections were most prevalent during the winter season. Furthermore, while the proportion of raptors testing positive for chlamydial DNA was similar across age classes, seroprevalence was highest in adults. This study questions the current knowledge on C. buteonis host range and highlights the importance of further studies to evaluate the diversity and epidemiology of Chlamydia spp. infecting raptor populations."
