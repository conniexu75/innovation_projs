https://openalex.org/W2075320194,"THIS note describes the histological demonstration of mucin by Schiff's reagent following the action of periodic acid. Zenker-formol sections were passed to water, after iodine and hypo, and placed for two minutes in a 0.5 per cent solution of periodic acid in distilled water. The sections were then washed in tap and distilled water and placed in Schiff's reagent for fifteen minutes at room temperature. The customary rinsings in sulphurous acid, as for the Feulgen's test, followed, and the sections were dehydrated in alcohols and mounted in balsam after xylene."

https://openalex.org/W2138351090,"IN a previous publication1 we described the results of an investigation into the spatial distribution of cosmic electromagnetic noise radiation at 5 metres wave-length. We have recently been engaged in an attempt to make a more detailed determination by using a more sensitive receiver of narrower beam-width. An interesting new feature which has emerged from these latter experiments is the occurrence of short-period irregular fluctuations which have been found to be associated with the direction of Cygnus. This region, which is a secondary peak in the cosmic noise distribution, appears to be unique in being characterized by short-period variations of marked amplitude in the intensity of power flux."

https://openalex.org/W1994148283,"THE first quantitative measurements on the formation of fission products in thermal neutron bombardment of uranium were made by Anderson, Fermi and von Grosse1. The fission yield of a fission isotope is the probability of the isotope being formed per thermal neutron fission. In bombardment, the rate of production of any active isotope from fission, that is, the fission rate multiplied by the fission yield, is equal to the disintegration rate of the active isotope referred to saturation of bombardment for the isotope. Thus data required for measurement the fission yield of an active fission isotope are: (a) number of fissions occurring in a given sample per unit time; and (b) disintegrations per unit time of the isotope referred to saturation of bombardment."

Highly active normal aliphatic monobasic acids having odd numbers of carbon atoms, including pelargonic acid, have been isolated from hair fat of adults. The ""adult type"" of hair fat does not kill the fungus spores within the hair but prevents infection of the new hair following the old infected hair in the process of shedding."

Suggestions regarding space charge corrected lenses have been made2, but have not yet been submitted to experimental tests."

https://openalex.org/W2757419416,"VARIOUS attempts have been described1 to acetylate alginic acid by means of acetic anhydride or acetic acid, without or with catalysts, for example, pyridine, acids, etc. Some of the products thus obtained were probably degraded, and it appeared of interest, therefore, to find out whether the acetylation of alginic acid can be done by a relatively mild method; for this reason the interaction with ketene was studied."
https://openalex.org/W1998998625,"IN 1941 Boer and Jansen showed1 that summer-butter contains a growth-promoting factor that was neither vitamin A nor one of the other known fat-soluble vitamins. Later, Boer and Jansen demonstrated that the growth-promoting action was due to the saponifiable fraction of the summer-butter We have now divided the saponifiable fraction by fractional distillation. The different fatty acids obtained in this way were administered to rats, and the growth of the rats on the different fractions was compared. Details of the technique of this test are given in our earlier publications. In a fuller publication, that will appear elsewhere, the method of distillation also will be described."

https://openalex.org/W2067033152,"THE study of the solar diurnal variations of cosmic rays, which has been described elsewhere1, has now been extended, in respect of the first harmonic, by arranging in six groups the data for 860 complete days during the period May 1941–April 1944. The first group consists of the data for January and February of all three years, the second group of data for March and April of all three years, and so on, the material for each day consisting of 12 bi-hourly numbers of triple coincidences."
https://openalex.org/W2070851329,"THE cortical layer of the unfertilized egg of Psammechinus miliaris exhibits a remarkable positive birefringence (with respect to the radial axis) which has been interpreted as meaning that the cortical layer is built up of radially arranged lipid molecules1,2. The birefringence disappears at fertilization and reappears during the anaphase of the first mitosis3. This means that the cortical layer undergoes rhythmic variations of its submicroscopic structure. We have investigated the cycle of such structural variations in relation to the phases of mitosis and to the modifications of permeability occurring during the early stages of development, in both fertilized and parthenogenetic eggs."
https://openalex.org/W2087025408,"IN 1935, Windaus, Lettre and Schenck1 described the preparation from cholesterol (I) of 7-dehydrocholesterol (III), which on irradiation gave a highly antirachitic product (vitamin D3), later2 shown to be identical with the naturally occurring vitamin D isolated from tunny liver oil. The original route to provitamin D3, giving an overall conversion from cholesterol of about 4 per cent, has since been employed for the synthesis of several related dehydrosteroids3, but it has not been materially improved, although some useful minor modifications have been described4. Claims5 have been made for alternative and improved methods, but, so far as we are aware, none of these has proved entirely satisfactory."

Equimolar doses of 2,3-dimercapto-propanol are about five times as active as cysteine or glutathione."

The combined action of these substances is of considerable interest, in view of the important part taken by adenine triphosphate in muscular contraction and of the participation of acetylcholine in the transmission of impulses at the myoneural junction."

https://openalex.org/W2037173890,"THE news of any further increases in the effectiveness of the atom bomb would at the present time be received with universal disgust or indifference. The discovery of a successful defence against it would occasion actually universal satisfaction and relief. It may be doubted whether the distribution of the world's expenditure on research between the two aspects of the subject—offensive and defensive—takes account of this world-wide prejudice in favour of survival. The publication of the recent report of the British Mission to Japan*, with its unequivocal emphasis on the defensive point of view, is therefore doubly welcome, first as indicating that the British Government does not necessarily subscribe to the view that no defence is possible, and secondly as providing a starting-point for any defensive investigation."

Even now, a year after the armistice, conditions are such that accommodation for all the sections of the British Association and their members at Newcastle or Birmingham, where, but for the War, we should have met in 1940 and 1941, is impracticable, on account of the devastation which these cities have suffered ffom enemy action. Next year, however, the series of annual meetings which was begun in 1831, when the Association was founded, will be resumed at Dundee, and the broken parts of the chain will again be linked together."
https://openalex.org/W2076108770,"FOR rapid examinations of near infra-red light up to 15,000 A., image converters are very useful. Their main advantage lies in enabling one to ‘see’ immediately what infra-red sensitized plates show only after involved processing. The spectrum under test is projected on to a photo-electric cathode of the type (Ag)âCs2O, Cs, AgâCs. The number of photo-electrons released is proportional to the intensity of radiation on that particular part of the cathode; they are focused by an electronic lens and form a picture on the fluorescent screen, which can either be studied visually or photographed. The accompanying illustration shows a photograph (× 1.5) of the mercury spectrum. In addition to the visible lines a number of lines in the near infra-red part of the spectrum have appeared. On the original photographic plate we can also see some lines of longer wave-length, which cannot be seen on the reproduction."

A scientific discovery is an addition to knowledge; and an invention is an additional use of knowledge. On the principle that “Necessity is the mother of invention”, the atom bomb was manufactured as a devastating weapon of war; but it should not be assumed that scientists, any more than other groups of people, desire to be associated with the prostitution of knowledge in any form."
