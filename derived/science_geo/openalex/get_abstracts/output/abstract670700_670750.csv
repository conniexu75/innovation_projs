https://openalex.org/W3138965320,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced healthcare services organization to adjust to mutating healthcare needs. Not exhaustive data are available on the consequences of this on non-COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the pandemic on non-COVID-19 patients living in a one-million inhabitants' area in Northern Italy (Bologna Metropolitan Area-BMA), analyzing time trends of Emergency Department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and mortality. We conducted a retrospective observational study using data extracted from BMA healthcare informative systems. Weekly trends of ED visits, hospitalizations, in- and out-of-hospital, all-cause and cause-specific mortality between December 1st, 2019 to May 31st, 2020, were compared with those of the same period of the previous year. Non-COVID-19 ED visits and hospitalizations showed a stable trend until the first Italian case of COVID-19 has been recorded, on February 19th, 2020, when they dropped simultaneously. The reduction of ED visits was observed in all age groups and across all severity and diagnosis groups. In the lockdown period a significant increase was found in overall out-of-hospital mortality (43.2%) and cause-specific out-of-hospital mortality related to neoplasms (76.7%), endocrine, nutritional and metabolic (79.5%) as well as cardiovascular (32.7%) diseases. The pandemic caused a sudden drop of ED visits and hospitalizations of non-COVID-19 patients during the lockdown period, and a concurrent increase in out-of-hospital mortality mainly driven by deaths for neoplasms, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases. As recurrencies of the COVID-19 pandemic are underway, the scenario described in this study might be useful to understand both the population reaction and the healthcare system response at the early phases of the pandemic in terms of reduced demand of care and systems capability in intercepting it."
https://openalex.org/W3137621526,"Decidualizing endometrial stromal cells (EnSC) critically determine the maternal response to an implanting conceptus, triggering either menstruation-like disposal of low-fitness embryos or creating an environment that promotes further development. However, the mechanism that couples maternal recognition of low-quality embryos to tissue breakdown remains poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that successful transition of the cycling endometrium to a pregnancy state requires selective elimination of pro-inflammatory senescent decidual cells by activated uterine natural killer (uNK) cells. Here we report that uNK cells express CD44, the canonical hyaluronan (HA) receptor, and demonstrate that high molecular weight HA (HMWHA) inhibits uNK cell-mediated killing of senescent decidual cells. In contrast, low molecular weight HA (LMWHA) did not attenuate uNK cell activity in co-culture experiments. Killing of senescent decidual cells by uNK cells was also inhibited upon exposure to medium conditioned by IVF embryos that failed to implant, but not successful embryos. Embryo-mediated inhibition of uNK cell activity was reversed by recombinant hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2), which hydrolyses HMWHA. We further report a correlation between the levels of HYAL2 secretion by human blastocysts, morphological scores, and implantation potential. Taken together, the data suggest a pivotal role for uNK cells in embryo biosensing and endometrial fate decisions at implantation."
https://openalex.org/W3138271364,"An excessive, non-resolving inflammatory response underlies severe COVID-19 that may have fatal outcomes. Therefore, the investigation of endogenous pathways leading to resolution of inflammation is of interest to uncover strategies for mitigating inflammation in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This becomes particularly urgent in individuals with preexisting pathologies characterized by chronic respiratory inflammation and prone to bacterial infection, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we analyzed the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virion spike 1 glycoprotein (S1) of macrophages (MΦ) from volunteers with and without CF and tested the efficacy of resolvins (Rv) D1 and D2 in regulating the inflammatory and antimicrobial functions of MΦ exposed to S1. S1 significantly increased chemokine release, including interleukin (IL)-8, in CF and non-CF MΦ, while it enhanced IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in non-CF MΦ, but not in CF cells. S1 also triggered the biosynthesis of RvD1 and modulated microRNAs miR-16, miR-29a, and miR-103, known to control the inflammatory responses. RvD1 and RvD2 treatment abated S1-induced inflammatory responses in CF and non-CF MΦ, significantly reducing the release of select chemokines and cytokines including IL-8 and TNF-α. RvD1 and RvD2 both restored the expression of miR-16 and miR-29a, while selectively increasing miR-223 and miR-125a, which are involved in NF-κB activation and MΦ inflammatory polarization. During Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, S1 stimulated the MΦ phagocytic activity that was further enhanced by RvD1 and RvD2. These results provide a map of molecular responses to SARS-CoV-2 in MΦ, key determinants of COVID-19-related inflammation, unveiling some peculiarity in the response of cells from individuals with CF. They also demonstrate beneficial, regulatory actions of RvD1 and RvD2 on SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3136772206,"The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has grown into a global pandemic and a major public health threat since its breakout in December 2019. To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine for treating COVID-19 and SARS has been FDA approved. Previous studies suggest that berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, has shown various biological activities that may help against COVID-19 and SARS, including antiviral, anti-allergy and inflammation, hepatoprotection against drug- and infection-induced liver injury, as well as reducing oxidative stress. In particular, berberine has a wide range of antiviral activities such as anti-influenza, anti-hepatitis C, anti-cytomegalovirus, and anti-alphavirus. As an ingredient recommended in guidelines issued by the China National Health Commission for COVID-19 to be combined with other therapy, berberine is a promising orally administered therapeutic candidate against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The current study comprehensively evaluates the potential therapeutic mechanisms of berberine in preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS using computational modeling, including target mining, gene ontology enrichment, pathway analyses, protein-protein interaction analysis, and in silico molecular docking. An orally available immunotherapeutic-berberine nanomedicine, named NIT-X, has been developed by our group and has shown significantly increased oral bioavailability of berberine, increased IFN-γ production by CD8+ T cells, and inhibition of mast cell histamine release in vivo, suggesting a protective immune response. We further validated the inhibition of replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cells line in vitro (Calu3 cells) by berberine. Moreover, the expression of targets including ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL-1α, IL-8, IL-6, and CCL-2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu3 cells were significantly suppressed by NIT-X. By supporting protective immunity while inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines; inhibiting viral infection and replication; inducing apoptosis; and protecting against tissue damage, berberine is a promising candidate in preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS. Given the high oral bioavailability and safety of berberine nanomedicine, the current study may lead to the development of berberine as an orally, active therapeutic against COVID-19 and SARS."
https://openalex.org/W3137302896,"Despite the importance of germ cell (GC) differentiation for sexual reproduction, the gene networks underlying their fate remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively characterize the gene expression dynamics during sex determination based on single-cell RNA sequencing of 14 914 XX and XY mouse GCs between embryonic days (E) 9.0 and 16.5. We found that XX and XY GCs diverge transcriptionally as early as E11.5 with upregulation of genes downstream of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and nodal/Activin pathways in XY and XX GCs, respectively. We also identified a sex-specific upregulation of genes associated with negative regulation of mRNA processing and an increase in intron retention consistent with a reduction in mRNA splicing in XY testicular GCs by E13.5. Using computational gene regulation network inference analysis, we identified sex-specific, sequential waves of putative key regulator genes during GC differentiation and revealed that the meiotic genes are regulated by positive and negative master modules acting in an antagonistic fashion. Finally, we found that rare adrenal GCs enter meiosis similarly to ovarian GCs but display altered expression of master genes controlling the female and male genetic programs, indicating that the somatic environment is important for GC function. Our data are available on a web platform and provide a molecular roadmap of GC sex determination at single-cell resolution, which will serve as a valuable resource for future studies of gonad development, function, and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3136835134,"More than 65 million people have been confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and more than 1 million have died from COVID-19 and this pandemic remains critical worldwide. Effective vaccines are one of the most important strategies to limit the pandemic. Here, we report a construction strategy of DNA vaccine candidates expressing full length wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, S1 or S2 region and their immunogenicity in mice. All DNA vaccine constructs of pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2 induced high levels of specific binding IgG that showed a balance of IgG1/IgG2a response. However, only the sera from mice vaccinated with pCMKkan-S or -S1 DNA vaccines could inhibit viral RBD and ACE2 interaction. The highest neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer was found in pCMVkan-S group, followed by -S1, while -S2 showed the lowest PRNT50 titers. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 2,551, 1,005 and 291 for pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2, respectively. pCMVkan-S construct vaccine also induced the highest magnitude and breadth of T cells response. Analysis of IFN-γ positive cells after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide pools were 2,991, 1,376 and 1,885 SFC/10 6 splenocytes for pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2, respectively. Our findings highlighted that full-length S antigen is more potent than the truncated spike (S1 or S2) in inducing of neutralizing antibody and robust T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W3138134542,"Inflammation in arterial walls leads to coronary artery disease (CAD). We previously reported that a high omega-3 fatty index was associated with prevention of progression of coronary atherosclerosis, a disease of chronic inflammation in the arterial wall. However, the mechanism of such benefit is unclear. The two main omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are precursors of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs)-resolvins and maresins-which actively resolve chronic inflammation. To explore whether SPMs are associated with coronary plaque progression, levels of SPMs and proinflammatory mediators (leukotriene B4 [LTB4 ] and prostaglandins) were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 31 statin-treated patients with stable CAD randomized to either EPA and DHA, 3.36 g daily, or no EPA/DHA (control). Coronary plaque volume was measured by coronary computed tomographic angiography at baseline and at 30-month follow-up. Higher plasma levels of EPA+DHA were associated with significantly increased levels of two SPMs-resolvin E1 and maresin 1-and 18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE), the precursor of resolvin E1. Those with low plasma EPA+DHA levels had a low (18-HEPE+resolvin E1)/LTB4 ratio and significant plaque progression. Those with high plasma EPA+DHA levels had either low (18-HEPE+resolvin E1)/LTB4 ratios with significant plaque progression or high (18-HEPE+resolvin E1)/LTB4 ratios with significant plaque regression. These findings suggest that an imbalance between pro-resolving and proinflammatory lipid mediators is associated with plaque progression and potentially mediates the beneficial effects of EPA and DHA in CAD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3138286502,"Objective To understand the nature of genetic and environmental susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) and, by extension, susceptibility to other complex genetic diseases. Background Certain basic epidemiological parameters of MS (e.g., population-prevalence of MS, recurrence-risks for MS in siblings and twins, proportion of women among MS patients, and the time-dependent changes in the sex-ratio) are well-established. In addition, more than 233 genetic-loci have now been identified as being unequivocally MS-associated, including 32 loci within the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ), and one locus on the X chromosome. Despite this recent explosion in genetic associations, however, the association of MS with the HLA-DRB1*15 : 01~HLA-DQB1*06 : 02~a1 ( H+ ) haplotype has been known for decades. Design/Methods We define the “genetically-susceptible” subset ( G ) to include everyone with any non-zero life-time chance of developing MS. Individuals who have no chance of developing MS, regardless of their environmental experiences, belong to the mutually exclusive “non-susceptible” subset ( G– ). Using these well-established epidemiological parameters, we analyze, mathematically, the implications that these observations have regarding the genetic-susceptibility to MS. In addition, we use the sex-ratio change (observed over a 35-year interval in Canada), to derive the relationship between MS-probability and an increasing likelihood of a sufficient environmental exposure. Results We demonstrate that genetic-susceptibitly is confined to less than 7.3% of populations throughout Europe and North America. Consequently, more than 92.7% of individuals in these populations have no chance whatsoever of developing MS, regardless of their environmental experiences. Even among carriers of the HLA-DRB1*15 : 01~HLA-DQB1*06 : 02~a1 haplotype, far fewer than 32% can possibly be members the ( G ) subset. Also, despite the current preponderance of women among MS patients, women are less likely to be in the susceptible ( G ) subset and have a higher environmental threshold for developing MS compared to men. Nevertheless, the penetrance of MS in susceptible women is considerably greater than it is in men. Moreover, the response-curves for MS-probability in susceptible individuals increases with an increasing likelihood of a sufficient environmental exposure, especially among women. However, these environmental response-curves plateau at under 50% for women and at a significantly lower level for men. Conclusions The pathogenesis of MS requires both a genetic predisposition and a suitable environmental exposure. Nevertheless, genetic-susceptibility is rare in the population (&lt; 7.3%) and requires specific combinations of non-additive genetic risk-factors. For example, only a minority of carriers of the HLA-DRB1*15 : 01~HLA-DQB1*06 : 02~a1 haplotype are even in the ( G ) subset and, thus, genetic-susceptibility to MS in these carriers must result from the combined effect this haplotype together with the effects of certain other (as yet, unidentified) genetic factors. By itself, this haplotype poses no MS-risk. By contrast, a sufficient environmental exposure (however many events are involved, whenever these events need to act, and whatever these events might be) is common, currently occurring in, at least, 76% of susceptible individuals. In addition, the fact that environmental response-curves plateau well below 50% (especially in men), indicates that disease pathogenesis is partly stochastic. By extension, other diseases, for which monozygotic-twin recurrence-risks greatly exceed the disease-prevalence (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and celiac disease), must have a similar genetic basis."
https://openalex.org/W3138556523,"There has long been debate about how nanoproducts meet agricultural requirements. This study aimed to investigate tomato responses to the long-time foliar application of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NP; 0 and 3 mgl-1) or bulk type (BZnO). Both ZnO-NP and BZnO treatments, especially the nanoform, were significantly capable of improving growth, biomass, and yield. The ZnO-NP treatment upregulated the expression of the R2R3MYB transcription factor by 2.6 folds. The BZnO and ZnO-NP treatments transcriptionally up-regulated WRKY1 gene by 2.5 and 6.4 folds, respectively. The bHLH gene was also upregulated in response to BZnO (2.3-fold) or ZnO-NP (4.7-fold). Moreover, the ZnO-NP application made a contribution to upregulation in the EREB gene whereas the bulk compound did not make a significant change. Upregulation in the HsfA1a gene also resulted from the ZnO-NP (2.8-fold) or BZnO (1.6-fold) supplementation. The MKK2 and CAT genes displayed a similar upregulation trend in response to the supplements by an average of 3-folds. While the application of ZnO-NP slightly down-regulated the histone deacetylases (HDA3) gene by 1.9-fold, indicating epigenetic modification. The supplements, especially the nano-product, enhanced concentrations of K, Fe, and Zn in both leaves and fruits. The concentrations of Chla, Chlb, and carotenoids were increased in response to the BZnO or ZnO-NP treatments. Likewise, BZnO or ZnO-NP mediated an increase in activity of nitrate reductase and proline content in leaves. These treatments increased soluble phenols and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. With a similar trend, the BZnO or ZnO-NP application improved the activities of catalase and peroxidase enzymes. The reinforcement in metaxylem and secondary tissues resulted from the applied supplements. This study provides comprehensive comparative evidence on how ZnO-NPs may remodel the chromatin ultrastructure and transcription program, and confer stress tolerance in crops. This study also underlines the necessity of providing integrated transcriptome and proteome data in future studies."

https://openalex.org/W3024519191,"The sublime–the mixed aesthetic experience of uplift and elevation in response to a powerful or vast object that otherwise is experienced as menacing–has nurtured philosophical discourse for centuries. One of the major philosophical issues concerns whether the sublime is best thought of as a subjective response or as a stimulus. Recently, psychology has conceived of the sublime as an emotion, often referred to as awe, arising from natural or artistic stimuli that are great, rare, and/or vast. However, it has not yet been empirically demonstrated whether two major elicitors of the sublime–nature and art–differ in inducing this state. In order to experimentally compare nature and art, we exposed 50 participants to sublimity-inducing content in two different formats (nature-based and art-based) using 360° videos. We compared Vincent Van Gogh’s The Starry Night with a photorealistic version of the actual place depicted in the painting, Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. We measured participants’ emotional responses before and after each exposure, as well as the sense of presence. The nature-based format induced higher intensity emotional responses than the art-based format. This study compares different sublime stimuli (nature vs. art) for eliciting the sublime."
https://openalex.org/W3136359687,"Recently. recommender systems have become a very crucial application in the online market and e-commerce as users are often astounded by choices and preferences and they need help finding what the best they are looking for. Recommender systems have proven to overcome information overload issues in the retrieval of information, but still suffer from persistent problems related to cold-start and data sparsity. On the flip side, sentiment analysis technique has been known in translating text and expressing user preferences. It is often used to help online businesses to observe customers’ feedbacks on their products as well as try to understand customer needs and preferences. However, the current solution for embedding traditional sentiment analysis in recommender solutions seems to have limitations when involving multiple domains. Therefore, an issue called domain sensitivity should be addressed. In this paper, a sentiment-based model with contextual information for recommender system was proposed. A novel solution for domain sensitivity was proposed by applying a contextual information sentiment-based model for recommender systems. In evaluating the contributions of contextual information in sentiment-based recommendations, experiments were divided into standard rating model, standard sentiment model and contextual information model. Results showed that the proposed contextual information sentiment-based model illustrates better performance as compared to the traditional collaborative filtering approach."
https://openalex.org/W3138706539,"A treatment option for constipation that improves the quality of life is needed since available laxatives do not effectively improve the quality of life in patients with constipation. A significant association between gut dysbiosis and constipation is recognized, suggesting that probiotics may be an important option for management of constipation. The underlying mechanism by which probiotics improve constipation remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 (BBG9-1) on loperamide-induced delayed colonic transit constipation and to elucidate its mechanism of action. First, the effect of BBG9-1 was evaluated in a rat model of constipation induced by subcutaneous administration of loperamide. BBG9-1 improved constipation parameters (number of feces, fecal water content, and fecal hardness) in constipated rats. Next, the relationship of organic acids and neurotransmitters to gut microbiota was investigated. BBG9-1 improved dysbiosis and prevented a decrease in butyric acid concentration in the gut, increased serum serotonin, and suppressed an increase in dopamine and a decrease in acetylcholine in serum. Further, an increase in the expression level of tryptophan hydroxylase 1, a 5-HT-synthetizing enzyme, was observed. These results suggest that BBG9-1 improves dysbiosis, which results in an increase in organic acids and improvement of neurotransmission. These actions may increase intestinal mobility, finally leading to alleviating constipation. The probiotic BBG9-1 may, therefore, be a potential option for the treatment of constipation."
https://openalex.org/W3136598158,"ω3 fatty acids show potent bioactivities via conversion into lipid mediators; therefore, metabolism of dietary lipids is a critical determinant in the properties of ω3 fatty acids in the control of allergic inflammatory diseases. However, metabolic progression of ω3 fatty acids in the skin and their roles in the regulation of skin inflammation remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (12-HEPE), which is a 12-lipoxygenase metabolite of eicosapentaenoic acid, was the prominent metabolite accumulated in the skin of mice fed ω3 fatty acid-rich linseed oil. Consistently, the gene expression levels of Alox12 and Alox12b, which encode proteins involved in the generation of 12-HEPE, were much higher in the skin than in the other tissues (eg, gut). We also found that the topical application of 12-HEPE inhibited the inflammation associated with contact hypersensitivity by inhibiting neutrophil infiltration into the skin. In human keratinocytes in vitro, 12-HEPE inhibited the expression of two genes encoding neutrophil chemoattractants, CXCL1 and CXCL2, via retinoid X receptor α. Together, the present results demonstrate that the metabolic progression of dietary ω3 fatty acids differs in different organs, and identify 12-HEPE as the dominant ω3 fatty acid metabolite in the skin."
https://openalex.org/W3136857264,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has been creating a panic and distressing situations among the entire population globally including Nepal. No study has been conducted assessing the psychological impact of this pandemic on the general public in Nepal. The objective of this study is to assess the mental health status during COVID-19 outbreak and explore the potential influencing factors among the population attending the hospital fever clinics with COVID–19 symptoms. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May—June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. Results The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. In reference to Karnali, participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.31–9.06), while stress (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.09–18.32) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.05–9.23) observed higher among the participants in Province 1. Women were more at risk of anxiety (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.83–6.36) than men. Similarly, people currently living in rented houses reported more stress (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.05–8.43) and those living far from family reported higher rates of depressive symptoms (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.03–11.46). Conclusion The study identified increased prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Considering the findings, there is urgent need to develop and implement appropriate community-based mental health programs targeting individuals who have had COVID-19 symptoms and who are prone to develop adverse mental health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3138976802,"Detailed insights in both visual effects of light and effects beyond vision due to manipulations in illuminance and correlated color temperature (CCT) are needed to optimize study protocols as well as to design light scenarios for practical applications. This study investigated temporal dynamics and interindividual variability in subjective evaluations of sensation, comfort and mood as well as subjective and objective measures of alertness, arousal and thermoregulation following abrupt transitions in illuminance and CCT in a mild cold environment. The results revealed that effects could be uniquely attributed to changes in illuminance or CCT. No interaction effects of illuminance and CCT were found for any of these markers. Responses to the abrupt transitions in illuminance and CCT always occurred immediately and exclusively amongst the subjective measures. Most of these responses diminished over time within the 45-minute light manipulation. In this period, no responses were found for objective measures of vigilance, arousal or thermoregulation. Significant interindividual variability occurred only in the visual comfort evaluation in response to changes in the intensity of the light. The results indicate that the design of dynamic light scenarios aimed to enhance human alertness and vitality requires tailoring to the individual to create visually comfortable environments."
https://openalex.org/W3137787161,"Persistent infection by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions. While some cytokines help immune cells in virus clearance, others contribute to the persistence of infection and neoplastic progression. Here, the levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-2 were quantified in the serum and exfoliated cervical cells (ECCs) of patients with HR-HPV, and the presence of IL-6 + cells was investigated in uterine cervix biopsies. Cytokine levels in the serum and ECCs of 26 HR-HPV DNA-positive patients and 18 HPV DNA-negative patients were measured using flow cytometry. Fifteen uterine cervix biopsy samples embedded in paraffin were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for the detection of IL-6 + cells. HR-HPV-positive patients showed increased IL-6 and IL-10 in the ECCs and serum, respectively. Compared with HPV DNA-positive patients, HPV DNA-negative patients had higher levels of IL-6 in ECCs. Patients with multiple infections of HPV had higher levels of IL-6 in their ECCs than those with a single infection. Immunostaining of uterine cervix biopsy samples revealed no differences in IL-6 expression between the different classes of histopathological lesions. However, differences were observed in the expression levels of IL-6 and IL-10 at the systemic and local levels in HR-HPV-positive patients without cervical lesions. Considering the functional characteristics of these cytokines, it can be inferred that such patients are prone to persistent HPV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3138587181,"The Acidobacteriota is ubiquitous and is considered as one of the major bacterial phyla in soils. The current taxonomic classifications of this phylum are divided into 15 class-level subdivisions (SDs), with only 5 of these SDs containing cultured and fully described species. Within the fynbos biome, the Acidobacteriota has been reported as one of the dominant bacterial phyla, with relative abundances ranging between 4–26%. However, none of these studies reported on the specific distribution and diversity of the Acidobacteriota within these soils. Therefore, in this study we aimed to first determine the relative abundance and diversity of the Acidobacteriota in three pristine fynbos nature reserve soils, and secondly, whether differences in the acidobacterial composition can be attributed to environmental factors, such as soil abiotic properties. A total of 27 soil samples were collected at three nature reserves, namely Jonkershoek, Hottentots Holland, and Kogelberg. The variable V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using the Ion Torrent S5 platform. The mean relative abundance of the Acidobacteriota were 9.02% for Jonkershoek, 14.91% for Kogelberg, and most significantly ( p &lt;0.05), 18.42% for Hottentots Holland. A total of 33 acidobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. The dominant subdivisions identified in all samples included SDs 1, 2, and 3. Significant differences were observed in the distribution and composition of these OTUs between nature reserves. The SD1 were negatively correlated to soil pH, hydrogen (H + ), potassium (K + ) and carbon (C). In contrast, SD2, was positively correlated to soil pH, phosphorus (P), and K + , and unclassified members of SD3 was positively correlated to H + , K, and C. This study is the first to report on the specific acidobacterial distribution in pristine fynbos soils in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3138742881,"Background Serological response and association to clinical manifestation is important for understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Materials and methods A prospective observational study was conducted where antibody responses of IgG and IgA towards SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were studied over time in patients with COVID-19. Possible associations between antibody titers and outcome were analyzed. Results Forty patients with COVID-19, hospitalized at Skåne University hospital, Sweden, between April and June 2020 were included. IgG antibody responses were detected for all patients with the highest levels four weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. Levels of IgA were generally higher at diagnosis and decreased towards baseline 4 weeks after confirmed COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 had higher levels of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with patients with mild disease. Conclusion IgG and IgA antibodies towards the spike protein follow different kinetics during COVID-19 and patients with severe disease develop higher antibody levels."
https://openalex.org/W3139341767,"The apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APE1), the main AP-endonuclease of the DNA base excision repair pathway, is a key molecule of interest to researchers due to its unsuspected roles in different nonrepair activities, such as: i) adaptive cell response to genotoxic stress, ii) regulation of gene expression, and iii) processing of microRNAs, which make it an excellent drug target for cancer treatment. We and others recently demonstrated that APE1 can be secreted in the extracellular environment and that serum APE1 may represent a novel prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular and non-small-cell lung cancers. However, the mechanism by which APE1 is released extracellularly was not described before. Here, using three different approaches for exosomes isolation: commercial kit, nickel-based isolation, and ultracentrifugation methods and various mammalian cell lines, we elucidated the mechanisms responsible for APE1 secretion. We demonstrated that APE1 p37 and p33 forms are actively secreted through extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes from different mammalian cell lines. We then observed that APE1 p33 form is generated by proteasomal-mediated degradation and is enzymatically active in EVs. Finally, we revealed that the p33 form of APE1 accumulates in EVs upon genotoxic treatment by cisplatin and doxorubicin, compounds commonly found in chemotherapy pharmacological treatments. Taken together, these findings provide for the first time evidence that a functional Base Excision Repair protein is delivered through exosomes in response to genotoxic stresses, shedding new light into the complex noncanonical biological functions of APE1 and opening new intriguing perspectives on its role in cancer biology.

Taken together, these findings provide for the first time evidence that a functional Base Excision Repair protein is delivered through exosomes in response to genotoxic stresses, shedding new light into the complex noncanonical biological functions of APE1 and opening new intriguing perspectives on its role in cancer biology. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is responsible for repairing DNA lesions caused by alkylation damage or oxidative stress conditions due to endogenous or exogenous sources, including chemotherapy treatments (1Antoniali G.

The apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APE1) is the main endonuclease that participates in the BER pathway and recognizes abasic sites on DNA and RNA in human cells (3Wilson D.M.

Biol. 2008; 379: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In DNA, abasic sites can be generated by the action of glycosylases, such as OGG1, which are responsible for the recognition of modified bases and the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond between the damaged base and the deoxyribose (5Wallace S.S. Base excision repair: A critical player in many games.DNA Repair (Amst). 2014; 19: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Upon the action of APE1, a nick on the DNA backbone is introduced at the 5’ of the abasic site, generating an abasic dRP, which is subsequently processed by the downstream BER pathway enzymes, including Polβ, XRCC1, Polδ, and ligases (6Prasad R. Beard W.A. Batra V.K. Liu Y. Shock D.D. Wilson S.H. A review of recent experiments on step-to-step ‘hand-off’ of the DNA intermediates in mammalian base excision repair pathways.Mol. Biol. (Mosk.). 2011; 45: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The generation of abasic sites in RNA is still a matter of debate, but its occurrence has been associated with profound biological consequences (7Simms C.L. Zaher H.S. Quality control of chemically damaged RNA.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 73: 3639-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Besides its crucial role in the BER pathway, APE1 exerts several nonrepair functions, which have been characterized in the last 20 years (2Antoniali G. Malfatti M.C. Tell G. Chapter 17.

Demple B. Base excision DNA repair and cancer.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 584-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The multifunctional activity of APE1 depends on a modular structure characterized by three functional subregions: i) the N-terminal region, including the first 33–35 unstructured amino acidic residues, which is mainly involved in the stabilization of protein–protein or protein–RNA interaction (10Vascotto C.

Genome-wide analysis and proteomic studies reveal APE1/Ref-1 multifunctional role in mammalian cells.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1058-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); ii) the central region of the protein, comprising amino acid 35 to amino acid 127, which exerts the nonrepair activities based on redox mechanisms; and iii) the C-terminal domain, which entails the AP-endonuclease activity responsible for DNA repair (11Antoniali G.

Biological evidence for the multifunctional activities of APE1 is supported by omics data, obtained in APE1 knock-down HeLa cells, showing significant variations in the expression of hundreds of genes, associated with: i) mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis; ii) dysregulation of the intracellular redox state, and iii) generation of membrane ruffling, as a consequence of a modification of the cytoskeleton (10Vascotto C.

Genome-wide analysis and proteomic studies reveal APE1/Ref-1 multifunctional role in mammalian cells.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1058-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). APE1 can act as a coactivator or as a corepressor of gene transcription through redox-dependent (for this reason, APE1 is also called Ref-1, redox effector factor 1) and redox-independent mechanisms (14Bhakat K.K.

SIRT1 gene expression upon genotoxic damage is regulated by APE1 through nCaRE-promoter elements.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 532-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More intriguingly, and largely unexplored yet, is the unsuspected role of APE1 in RNA metabolism, which plays a significant impact on microRNAs (miRNAs) expression (10Vascotto C. Cesaratto L. Zeef L.A. Deganuto M. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. Romanello M. Damante G. Taglialatela G. Delneri D. Kelley M.R. Mitra S. Quadrifoglio F. Tell G.

Mammalian APE1 controls miRNA processing and its interactome is linked to cancer RNA metabolism.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 797Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that APE1 is involved in controlling miRNAs stability and regulation, during oxidative stress conditions, through the interaction with DROSHA (18Antoniali G. Serra F. Lirussi L. Tanaka M. D'Ambrosio C. Zhang S. Radovic S. Dalla E. Ciani Y. Scaloni A. Li M. Piazza S. Tell G. Mammalian APE1 controls miRNA processing and its interactome is linked to cancer RNA metabolism.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 797Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An alteration of miRNAs expression profile was observed in human osteosarcoma cells upon APE1 knock-down (19Dai N. Zhong Z.Y. Cun Y.P. Qing Y. Chen C. Jiang P. Li M.X. Wang D. Alteration of the microRNA expression profile in human osteosarcoma cells transfected with APE1 siRNA.Neoplasma. 2013; 60: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Analysis of promoters regulating a list of miRNAs affected by APE1 downregulation and involved in cell growth, cell signaling, and cancer development clearly showed the presence of putative binding sites for transcription factors, such as NF-κB, p53, HIF-1α, AP1, and c-Myc, redox-regulated by APE1. These observations suggested that APE1 could indirectly regulate gene expression through miRNAs transcriptional control of target genes (19Dai N. Zhong Z.Y. Cun Y.P. Qing Y. Chen C. Jiang P. Li M.X. Wang D. Alteration of the microRNA expression profile in human osteosarcoma cells transfected with APE1 siRNA.Neoplasma. 2013; 60: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is also emerging that the different functions of APE1 are modulated by distinct interactomes, which redirect the protein activities to different substrates (20Ayyildiz D. Antoniali G. D'Ambrosio C. Mangiapane G. Dalla E. Scaloni A. Tell G. Piazza S. Architecture of the human Ape1 interactome Defines novel cancers Signatures.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These findings provided the molecular basis for considering APE1 as a prognostic factor in several tumors such as: ovarian, hepatic, pulmonary, and neurologic cancers (8Tell G. Quadrifoglio F.

APE1 and NPM1 protect cancer cells from platinum compounds cytotoxicity and their expression pattern has a prognostic value in TNBC.J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2019; 38: 309Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), in which the protein is often overexpressed in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. For all these reasons, it can be hypothesized that a dysregulation of APE1 expression may contribute to tumor development and progression through mechanisms independent from the canonical DNA repair function (18Antoniali G. Serra F. Lirussi L. Tanaka M. D'Ambrosio C. Zhang S. Radovic S. Dalla E. Ciani Y. Scaloni A. Li M. Piazza S. Tell G. Mammalian APE1 controls miRNA processing and its interactome is linked to cancer RNA metabolism.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 797Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). APE1 is also emerging as an important predictive factor being associated with chemoresistance phenomena due to its positive role in expression of cancer resistance genes, such as MDR1 and others (23Sengupta S. Mantha A.K. Mitra S. Bhakat K.K. Human AP endonuclease (APE1/Ref-1) and its acetylation regulate YB-1-p300 recruitment and RNA polymerase II loading in the drug-induced activation of multidrug resistance gene MDR1.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 482-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Malfatti M.C.

New perspectives in cancer biology from a study of canonical and non-canonical functions of base excision repair proteins with a focus on early steps.Mutagenesis. 2020; 35: 129-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, APE1’s presence in the extracellular milieu is a novel unsuspected biological aspect of the protein, yet poorly characterized (25Choi S. Lee Y.R. Park M.S. Joo H.K. Cho E.J. Kim H.S. Kim C.S. Park J.B. Irani K. Jeon B.H. Histone deacetylases inhibitor trichostatin A modulates the extracellular release of APE1/Ref-1.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Rep. 2016; 6: 23015Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The link between APE1 amount in sera and tumor progression and chemoresistance was proved in a previous study performed on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, in which the levels of serum APE1 (sAPE1) resulted significantly more elevated than in healthy controls and were associated with a worse progression-free survival (28Zhang S. He L. Dai N. Guan W. Shan J. Yang X. Zhong Z. Qing Y. Jin F. Chen C. Yang Y. Wang H. Baugh L. Tell G.

Therefore, sAPE1 is actually considered as a novel biomarker for the prognosis of NSCLC (28Zhang S. He L. Dai N. Guan W. Shan J. Yang X. Zhong Z. Qing Y. Jin F. Chen C. Yang Y. Wang H. Baugh L. Tell G. Wilson 3rd, D.M. et al.Serum APE1 as a predictive marker for platinum-based chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer patients.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 77482-77494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Confirmatory results, along these lines, were recently obtained by our laboratory in a cohort of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients (29Pascut D. Sukowati C.H.C. Antoniali G. Mangiapane G. Burra S. Mascaretti L.G. Buonocore M.R. Crocè L.S. Tiribelli C. Tell G. Serum AP-endonuclease 1 (sAPE1) as novel biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.Oncotarget. 2019; 10: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), in which we found that sAPE1 levels correlated with poor prognosis and were able to discriminate between cancer patients and cirrhotic or healthy donors (29Pascut D. Sukowati C.H.C. Antoniali G. Mangiapane G. Burra S. Mascaretti L.G. Buonocore M.R. Crocè L.S. Tiribelli C. Tell G. Serum AP-endonuclease 1 (sAPE1) as novel biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.Oncotarget. 2019; 10: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The presence of this protein in sera of patients is not solely restricted to cancer diseases but also in inflammatory models, such as coronary artery disease (30Jin S.-A. Seo H.J. Kim S.K. Lee Y.R. Choi S. Ahn K.T. Kim J.H. Park J.H. Lee J.H. Choi S.W. Seong I.W. Jeon B.H. Jeong J.O. Elevation of the serum apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 in coronary artery disease.Korean Circ. J. 2015; 45: 364Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and endotoxemia (31Park M.S. Lee Y.R. Choi S. Joo H.K. Cho E.J. Kim C.S. Park J.B. Jo E.K. Jeon B.H.

Commun. 2013; 435: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The biological function of secreted APE1 is still completely unknown. An intriguing hypothesis considers that it might act as a paracrine molecule in triggering cell-to-cell communication, important for the local tissue microenvironment inflammatory response (25Choi S. Lee Y.R. Park M.S. Joo H.K. Cho E.J. Kim H.S. Kim C.S. Park J.B. Irani K. Jeon B.H. Histone deacetylases inhibitor trichostatin A modulates the extracellular release of APE1/Ref-1.Biochem. Biophys.

Serum AP-endonuclease 1 (sAPE1) as novel biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.Oncotarget. 2019; 10: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Also evidences on the mechanisms responsible for APE1 secretion are lacking, even though the importance of the acetylation, occurring on specific lysine residues sited in the first 33 N-terminal portion of the protein, has been highlighted in cells treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (25Choi S. Lee Y.R. Park M.S. Joo H.K. Cho E.J. Kim H.S. Kim C.S. Park J.B. Irani K. Jeon B.H. Histone deacetylases inhibitor trichostatin A modulates the extracellular release of APE1/Ref-1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 435: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, it seems reasonable that APE1 secretion might derive from extracellular vesicle formation via endosomal sorting complex (ESCRT), due to the protein lacking of a classic secretory signal peptide (28Zhang S. He L. Dai N. Guan W. Shan J. Yang X. Zhong Z. Qing Y. Jin F. Chen C. Yang Y. Wang H. Baugh L. Tell G. Wilson 3rd, D.M. et al.Serum APE1 as a predictive marker for platinum-based chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer patients.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 77482-77494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This pathway is responsible for the biogenesis and maturation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), composed of many intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), which are released in the extracellular milieu as exosomes. ILVs formation can occur through several mechanisms, and information about the regulation of these processes and the possible differences between the promoted cargo selection is still missing (32Bebelman M.P. Smit M.J. Pegtel D.M. Baglio S.R. Biogenesis and function of extracellular vesicles in cancer.Pharmacol. Ther. 2018; 188: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this work, by using different biochemical techniques and several tumor and nontumor cell lines, it was demonstrated that secreted APE1 is exosome-associated. We also found that APE1 secretion is an active mechanism, exacerbated by genotoxic treatments, and that the secreted protein is enzymatically active. Altogether, these findings add new light in understanding the complex biological roles of APE1 in mammalian cells. Recent evidence obtained from human monocytes, upon inflammatory challenges, indicated the presence of APE1 in the extracellular milieu and possibly associated with EVs (26Nath S. Roychoudhury S. Kling M.J. Song H. Biswas P. Shukla A. Band H. Joshi S. Bhakat K.K. The extracellular role of DNA damage repair protein APE1 in regulation of IL-6 expression.Cell. Signal. 2017; 39: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In our previous work, we found that APE1 may be released in sera of HCC patients, with significantly higher levels in comparison to healthy donors (29Pascut D. Sukowati C.H.C. Antoniali G. Mangiapane G. Burra S. Mascaretti L.G. Buonocore M.R. Crocè L.S. Tiribelli C. Tell G. Serum AP-endonuclease 1 (sAPE1) as novel biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.Oncotarget. 2019; 10: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated whether APE1 could be secreted through small EVs, e.g., exosomes, using the JHH-6 HCC cell line. First, we isolated EVs from JHH-6 serum-free media using Exosome isolation kit (Invitrogen) and characterized the quality of the preparations obtained, as indicated in Material and Methods. JHH-6 cells were kept in culture for 24h under serum starvation conditions and then EVs were isolated. Purified particles were analyzed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), using the NanoSight instrument, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Figure 1A shows a representative distribution of vesicles with a mean concentration of 1.39e + 09 ± 0.00e + 00 particles/ml, with a mode of 149.5 nm and an average of 237 nm, ranging from ∼50 to ∼550 nm of the main populations. The morphology of the recovered EVs, which peaked at 150 nm in size, was assessed by Transmission Electron Microscopy, confirming the presence of round-shaped vesicles with a mean diameter around 80 nm (data not shown). Then, we performed a protein analysis of exosomal markers. Western blot analysis of EVs (EXE) confirmed the presence of Syntenin and Alix proteins, luminal markers of EVs from endosomal origin, in contrast to the Golgi apparatus protein GM130, used as negative control (33Gurunathan S. Kang M.-H. Jeyaraj M. Qasim M. Kim J.-H.

Furthermore, we analyzed the presence of APE1 in EVs. As shown in Figure 1B, EXE from JHH-6 cells confirmed the presence of a specific band of 37 kDa (APE1 p37) corresponding to the full-length APE1 protein, as well as a faint band corresponding to the truncated form of APE1 at 33 kDa, indicated as APE1 p33. Notably, by using an antibody specific for the N-terminal region of APE1, we demonstrated that this truncated form corresponded to the NΔ33 one (Fig. S1 and data not shown), which loses the first 33 amino acid residues as a consequence of proteolysis, as already described in previous papers (29Pascut D.

To quantify APE1 protein levels in EVs, we used an EV isolation procedure recently published (38Notarangelo M. Zucal C. Modelska A. Pesce I. Scarduelli G. Potrich C. Lunelli L. Pederzolli C. Pavan P. la Marca G. Pasini L. Ulivi P. Beltran H. Demichelis F.

We applied NBI to the media of JHH-6 cells to isolate EVs and then combined an amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay (alpha). We designed the alpha assay using purified and quantified recombinant Glutathione S-transferase-APE1 (rGST-APE1WT) (Fig. S2). The alpha assay was performed using Glutathione-Donor beads and Protein G-Acceptor beads recognizing the anti-APE1 antibody. We tested the detection of the recombinant protein by titrating the purified rGST-APE1WT protein, protein lysates from JHH-6 cells, and purified GST alone as further control ("
https://openalex.org/W3136673281,"The role of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) in the regulation of skeletal muscle (SM) mitochondria-sarcoplasmic (SR) juxtaposition, mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial cristae density (MCD), and SM quality has not been studied in humans. In in vitro studies, whether Mfn2 increases or decreases mitochondria-SR juxtaposition remains controversial. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are commonly used to measure the organelle juxtaposition, but the measurements are performed by-hand, thus potentially leading to between-rater differences. The purposes of this study were to: (1) examine the repeatability and reproducibility of mitochondrial-SR juxtaposition measurement from TEM images of human SM between three raters with different experience and (2) compare the mitochondrial-SR juxtaposition, mitochondrial morphology, MCD (stereological-method), and SM quality (cross-sectional area [CSA] and the maximum voluntary contraction [MVC]) between subjects with high abundance (Mfn2-HA; n = 6) and low abundance (Mfn2-LA; n = 6) of Mfn2 protein. The mitochondria-SR juxtaposition had moderate repeatability and reproducibility, with the most experienced raters showing the best values. There were no differences between Mfn2-HA and Mfn2-LA groups in mitochondrial size, distance from mitochondria to SR, CSA, or MVC. Nevertheless, the Mfn2-LA group showed lower mitochondria-SR interaction, MCD, and VO2max . In conclusion, mitochondrial-SR juxtaposition measurement depends on the experience of the rater, and Mfn2 protein seems to play a role in the metabolic control of human men SM, by regulating the mitochondria-SR interaction."

Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of myopia. Myopia is appearing with greater prevalence in young children.This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of myopia among school children in Bahir Dar city, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019.A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among school children of 6 to 18 years of age in Bahir Dar city from October to November 2019. A pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data among 634 participants using a multi-stage sampling technique from primary and secondary schools. Cycloplegic refraction was performed by optometrists for each student with 1% cyclopentolate eye drop, and subjective refraction was carried out to determine the final prescription of the students. Myopia was defined as spherical equivalent refractive error of ≥ 0.5 diopter in either eye. Data were entered into Epi Info version 7 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 23 for analysis. Tables, frequency, and mean were used for descriptive statistics. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done to identify risk factors of myopia. Odds ratio with 95% confidence level was determined and variables with p-value of < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.Among a total of 601 study participants, 51 (8.49%) were myopic. Age group of 10-13 years (AOR = 6.54: 95% CI = 5.56-10.86), 14-18 years (AOR = 6.32: 95% CI = 5.32-9.69), 2-4 hour per day mobile exposure (AOR = 3.69: 95% CI = 1.63-8.38), > 4 hour per day mobile exposure (AOR = 11.6: 95% CI = 4.41-30.42), near working distance of < 33 centimeter (AOR = 6.89: 95% CI = 2.71-17.56) and outdoor activity (AOR = 3.94: 95% CI = 1.87-8.31) were significantly associated with myopia.The prevalence of myopia was high among school children in Bahir Dar city. Older age, longer duration of mobile exposure, shorter near working distance were the risk factors for the development of myopia whereas having outdoor activity was the protective factor."

Eliciting HIV-specific cellular immune responses has not been sufficient to achieve durable removal of HIV-infected cells due to the restriction on effective immune responses by mutation and establishment of latent reservoirs. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are an avenue to potentially develop more potent redirected cellular responses against infected T cells. We developed and tested a range of HIV- and SIV-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell reagents based on Env-binding proteins. In general, SHIV/SIV CAR T cells showed potent viral suppression in vitro, and adding additional CAR molecules in the same transduction resulted in more potent viral suppression than single CAR transduction. Importantly, the primary determinant of virus suppression potency by CAR was the accessibility to the Env epitope, and not the neutralization potency of the binding moiety. However, upon transduction of autologous T cells followed by infusion in vivo, none of these CAR T cells impacted either acquisition as a test of prevention, or viremia as a test of treatment. Our study illustrates limitations of the CAR T cells as possible antiviral therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3137359830,"Introduction Adolescents encounter misleading claims about health interventions that can affect their health. Young people need to develop critical thinking skills to enable them to verify health claims and make informed choices. Schools could teach these important life skills, but educators need access to suitable learning resources that are aligned with their curriculum. The overall objective of this context analysis was to explore conditions for teaching critical thinking about health interventions using digital technology to lower secondary school students in Rwanda. Methods We undertook a qualitative descriptive study using four methods: document review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and observations. We reviewed 29 documents related to the national curriculum and ICT conditions in secondary schools. We conducted 8 interviews and 5 focus group discussions with students, teachers, and policy makers. We observed ICT conditions and use in five schools. We analysed the data using a framework analysis approach. Results Two major themes found. The first was demand for teaching critical thinking about health. The current curriculum explicitly aims to develop critical thinking competences in students. Critical thinking and health topics are taught across subjects. But understanding and teaching of critical thinking varies among teachers, and critical thinking about health is not being taught. The second theme was the current and expected ICT conditions. Most public schools have computers, projectors, and internet connectivity. However, use of ICT in teaching is limited, due in part to low computer to student ratios. Conclusions There is a need for learning resources to develop critical thinking skills generally and critical thinking about health specifically. Such skills could be taught within the existing curriculum using available ICT technologies. Digital resources for teaching critical thinking about health should be designed so that they can be used flexibly across subjects and easily by teachers and students."
https://openalex.org/W3138413497,"Epigenetic regulation of skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise is a recent topic for which there is limited information. This study investigated whether exercise training activates histone turnover in the skeletal muscle fibers of mice. Experiments using a tetracycline-inducible H2B-GFP expression model demonstrated that 4 weeks of running training, but not 2 weeks of training, significantly promoted the incorporation of H2B-GFP into nucleosomes and the dissociation of histone H3.3 at both transcriptionally upregulated and nonresponsive loci. Muscle-specific PGC-1α-b-overexpressing mice crossed with H2B-GFP mice showed a slight increase in H2B-GFP incorporation at transcriptionally active loci, but not in the dissociation of H3.3 from nucleosomes. Gene expression responses to a single bout of running were significantly enhanced in 4-week trained mice when compared with those in 2-week trained mice. The most drastic increase in the gene response was found in the expression of Hspa1a and Hspa1b, in which the magnitude of upregulation in response to running was significantly enhanced from 8-fold in 2 week trained mice to 97- and 121-fold in 4 week trained mice, respectively. It was also found that the HSP70 level increased during the training period. In a myonuclear immunohistochemical analysis of chromatin remodelers, we further found that the level of SPT16, an H2A-H2B-specific chaperone, was upregulated after running training. These results revealed that 4 weeks of running training activated histone turnover in skeletal muscle fibers. They also suggested that histone turnover led to loosening of the nucleosomes and enhanced gene responses to exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3139114332,"Mitochondrial remodeling through fusion and fission is crucial for progenitor cell differentiation but its role in myogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we characterized the function of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein critical for mitochondrial fusion, in muscle progenitor cells (myoblasts). Mfn2 expression is upregulated during myoblast differentiation in vitro and muscle regeneration in vivo. Targeted deletion of Mfn2 gene in myoblasts (Mfn2MKO ) increases oxygen-consumption rates (OCR) associated with the maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity, and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Skeletal muscles of Mfn2MKO mice exhibit robust mitochondrial swelling with normal mitochondrial DNA content. Additionally, mitochondria isolated from Mfn2MKO muscles have reduced OCR at basal state and for complex I respiration, associated with decreased levels of complex I proteins NDUFB8 (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8) and NDUFS3 (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S3). However, Mfn2MKO has no obvious effects on myoblast differentiation, muscle development and function, and muscle regeneration. These results demonstrate a novel role of Mfn2 in regulating mitochondrial complex I protein abundance and respiratory functions in myogenic progenitors and myofibers."
https://openalex.org/W3138080603,"Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a ubiquitous serine threonine kinase with established roles in physiological and pathophysiological vascular remodeling. Based on our previous study demonstrating that CaMKIIδ promotes thrombin-induced endothelial permeability and recent reports that CaMKII may contribute to inflammatory remodeling in the heart, we investigated CaMKIIδ-dependent regulation of endothelial function downstream of an interleukin-6 (IL-6)/JAK/STAT3 signaling axis. Upon treatment with IL-6 and its soluble receptor (sIL-6r), CaMKIIδ expression is significantly induced in HUVEC. Using pharmacological inhibitors of JAK and siRNA targeting STAT3, we demonstrated that activation of STAT3 is sufficient to induce CaMKIIδ expression. Under these conditions, rather than promoting IL-6-induced permeability, we found that CaMKIIδ promotes endothelial cell migration as measured by live cell imaging of scratch wound closure and single-cell motility analysis. In a similar manner, endothelial cell proliferation was attenuated upon knockdown of CaMKIIδ as determined by growth curves, cell cycle analysis, and capacitance of cell-covered electrodes as measured by ECIS. Using inducible endothelial-specific STAT3 knockout mice, we demonstrate that STAT3 signaling promotes developmental angiogenesis in the neonatal mouse retina assessed at postnatal day 6. CaMKIIδ expression in retinal endothelium was attenuated in these animals as measured by qPCR. STAT3's effects on angiogenesis were phenocopied by the endothelial-specific knockout of CaMKIIδ, with significantly reduced vascular outgrowth and number of junctions in the developing P6 retina. For the first time, we demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of CaMKIIδ by STAT3 promotes endothelial motility, proliferation, and in vivo angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3139198046,"Endometriosis is a painful inflammatory disorder affecting ~10% of women of reproductive age. Although chronic pelvic pain (CPP) remains the main symptom of endometriosis patients, adequate treatments for CPP are lacking. Animal models that recapitulate the features and symptoms experienced by women with endometriosis are essential for investigating the etiology of endometriosis, as well as developing new treatments. In this study, we used an autologous mouse model of endometriosis to examine a combination of disease features and symptoms including: a 10 week time course of endometriotic lesion development; the chronic inflammatory environment and development of neuroangiogenesis within lesions; sensory hypersensitivity and altered pain responses to vaginal, colon, bladder, and skin stimulation in conscious animals; and spontaneous animal behavior. We found significant increases in lesion size from week 6 posttransplant. Lesions displayed endometrial glands, stroma, and underwent neuroangiogenesis. Additionally, peritoneal fluid of mice with endometriosis contained known inflammatory mediators and angiogenic factors. Compared to Sham, mice with endometriosis displayed: enhanced sensitivity to pain evoked by (i) vaginal and (ii) colorectal distension, (iii) altered bladder function and increased sensitivity to cutaneous (iv) thermal and (v) mechanical stimuli. The development of endometriosis had no effect on spontaneous behavior. This study describes a comprehensive characterization of a mouse model of endometriosis, recapitulating the clinical features and symptoms experienced by women with endometriosis. Moreover, it delivers the groundwork to investigate the etiology of endometriosis and provides a platform for the development of therapeutical interventions to manage endometriosis-associated CPP."

To facilitate this process, more information is needed on the basic biochemistry of this enzyme. For example, PHGDH was found to form tetramers in solution and the structure of its catalytic unit (sPHGDH) was solved as a dimer. However, how the oligomeric states affect PHGDH enzyme activity remains elusive. We studied the dependence of PHGDH enzymatic activity on its oligomeric states. We found that sPHGDH forms a mixture of monomers and dimers in solution with a dimer dissociation constant of ∼0.58 μM, with the enzyme activity depending on the dimer content. We computationally identified hotspot residues at the sPHGDH dimer interface. Single-point mutants at these sites disrupt dimer formation and abolish enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that dimer formation facilitates substrate binding and maintains the correct conformation required for enzyme catalysis. We further showed that the full-length PHGDH exists as a dynamic mixture of monomers, dimers, and tetramers in solution with enzyme concentration-dependent activity. Mutations that can completely disrupt the sPHGDH dimer show different abilities to interrupt the full-length PHGDH tetramer. Among them, E108A and I121A can also disrupt the oligomeric structures of the full-length PHGDH and abolish its enzyme activity.

Serine, glycine and one-carbon units: Cancer metabolism in full circle.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 572-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). As a nonessential amino acid, serine participates in the synthesis of nucleotides, lipids, other amino acids, antioxidants, and cofactors, which plays critical roles in a number of biosynthetic and signaling pathways in addition to serving as a major donor of one-carbon units (3Yang M. Vousden K.H. Serine and one-carbon metabolism in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). L-Serine is also the immediate precursor of D-serine, a neurotransmitter that relies on de novo serine synthesis due to the poor transport of plasma serine across the blood–brain barrier (4Yang J.H.

Human D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is the first and rate-limiting step of de novo serine synthesis, converting the 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) generated from glycolysis into serine precursor 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (3-PHP) coupled with NAD+.

These findings suggest that targeting PHGDH provides a promising anticancer and drug resistance approach (19Rathore R. Schutt C.R. Van Tine B.A. PHGDH as a mechanism for resistance in metabolically-driven cancers.Cancer Drug Resist. 2020; 3: 762-774PubMed Google Scholar). PHGDH belongs to the SerA subset of D-isomer-specific 2-hydroxyacid-dehydrogenase (2HADH) family that catalyzes the stereospecific reductions of 2-keto acids to corresponding 2-hydroxy acids (20Matelska D.

D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases (PGDHs) expressed in various organisms are grouped into three types based on their domain arrangement. All the three types of PGDHs have a common catalytic unit containing the substrate-binding domain and the cofactor-binding domain. Type III PGDH from Entamoeba histolytica with only the catalytic unit adopts a dimeric configuration (21Grant G.A. D-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2018; 5: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PHGDH belongs to the most complex type I PGDHs, which contain two additional regulatory domains, the ACT (aspartate kinase-chorismate mutase-tyrA prephenate dehydrogenase) and ASB (allosteric substrate binding) domains (5Grant G.A. D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2018; 5: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The ACT domain plays its role in the feedback inhibition by L-serine in bacteria, while all mammalian enzymes so far studied have lost this ability (22Lan X. Chen S. Salinas N.D. Tolia N.H.

However, the functions of these two regulatory domains of PHGDH remain elusive and the full-length structure of PHGDH is currently unavailable. The only full-length type I PGDH structure (PDB code: 1YGY) solved was that from M. tuberculosis, which forms tetrameric structure (23Dey S. Grant G.A. Sacchettini J.C.

Although the full-length PHGDH is not currently available, the structure of its catalytic unit without the two regulatory domains has been solved as a dimer (sPHGDH, PDB codes: 2G76, 5N6C, and 6CWA). In the 2G76 structure, the carboxylate moiety of the substrate analog (D-malate, MLT) forms hydrogen bonds with Arg54 and Ser55 and Arg135’ from the other monomer (24Ravez S. Spillier Q. Marteau R.

Novel mutations in 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are distributed throughout the protein and result in altered enzyme kinetics.Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, an interfacial mutation E108A of E. histolytica PGDH (EhPGDH) caused dimer dissociation and reduced enzyme activity, suggesting that dimer interface plays a crucial role in the stability of the protein and a complete dimer is required for the optimal enzymatic activity of EhPGDH (31Mishra V. Kumar A. Ali V. Nozaki T. Zhang K.Y.J. Bhakuni V. Glu-108 is essential for subunit assembly and dimer stability of D-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Entamoeba histolytica.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2012; 181: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). W139 in Escherichia coli PGDH (corresponding to position 133 in human PHGDH), which sits at the bottom of the catalytic site of the adjacent subunit, plays a critical role in maintaining the oligomeric state of the enzyme as well as the integrity of the catalytic site (32Grant G.A. Kim S.J. Xu X.L. Hu Z. The contribution of adjacent subunits to the active sites of D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5357-5361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). W139G of E. coli PGDH weakens the subunit/subunit contact and is 600-fold less active. It appears to be in equilibrium between a tetrameric and a dimeric form, and the dimeric species were proposed to be mediated by interactions of the regulatory domains (33Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Removal of the tryptophan 139 side chain in Escherichia coli D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase produces a dimeric enzyme without cooperative effects.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, there is no suggestive evidence about the relationship between the dimerization or oligomerization and the activity of PHGDH. Here, we addressed this question by analyzing the solution behavior and biophysical properties of both the catalytic unit and the full-length wild-type PHGDH and variants. We computationally identified hotspot residues at the dimer interface of sPHGDH and studied the oligomeric state and catalytic activity of corresponding mutants. We showed that sPHGDH exists as a monomer and dimer mixture and only the dimeric form is catalytically active. Mutants that disrupt the dimeric structure of sPHGDH showed reduced enzyme catalytic activity. We also showed that full-length PHGDH exists as a monomer, dimer, and tetramer mixture in solution and their ratios vary with enzyme concentration. We demonstrated that dimerization is required to maintain the enzyme activity of PHGDH. Targeting the dimerization of PHGDH provides an alternative approach for PHGDH inhibitor design and the interface hotspots we identified serve as a guideline for interfacial inhibitor design. The catalytic unit of PHGDH (sPHGDH, 1–307) containing the cofactor-binding domain and the substrate-binding domain, forms a homodimer in the crystal structure (24Ravez S. Spillier Q. Marteau R. Feron O. Challenges and opportunities in the development of serine synthetic pathway inhibitors for cancer therapy.J. Med. Chem. 2017; 60: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whether this dimer is essential for the catalytic activity is not fully understood. We expressed and purified sPHGDH, studied its oligomeric states and concentration-dependent catalytic activity in solution. Analytic ultracentrifugation (AUC) sedimentation velocity analysis revealed two peaks (∼2.4S and 3.9S), corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric state of sPHGDH (Fig. 1A). The dimer and monomer peak ratio displayed concentration dependent increase with the 1:1 ratio at about 1 μM. We further measured sPHGDH catalytic activity at different enzyme concentrations with excessive substrate and cofactor. While the Km did not change much (Fig. S1), the kcat, app increased abruptly along with the increase of the total enzyme concentration (Fig. 1B) and the dimer proportion. Assuming that there is an equilibrium between the monomer and dimer and both of them are active, we derived their catalytic parameters according to the following equations.Kd=[M][M][D](1) [E]=[M]+2[D](2) V=kcat,app[E]=kcat,mono[M]+kcat,dimer[D](3) V=kcat,monoKd2+8Kd[E]−Kd4+kcat,dimer4[E]+Kd−Kd2+8Kd[E]8(4) Here [M], [D], and [E] refer to the monomer, the dimer, and the total concentration of PHGDH, respectively. Kd is the apparent dissociation constant of the dimer. kcat, app is the apparent catalytic constant. kcat, dimer and kcat, mono are the catalytic constants of the monomer and the dimer, respectively. By fitting the enzyme activity data at different [E] values using Eq.4, the kcat, mono was deduced as 0.04 s−1, the kcat, dimer was 1.62 s−1, and the Kd was 0.58 μM (Fig. 1C). The kcat, dimer is 40-fold to kcat, mono, indicating that the monomer contributes little to enzyme activity. These observations suggest that sPHGDH dimeric assembly is essential for its catalytic activity. We have shown that the dimer structure of sPHGDH is essential for its catalytic activity. In order to identify mutations that can perturb the dimer structure, we performed computational alanine screening and structural analysis with the sPHGDH structure (PDB: 2G76, DOI: 10.2210/pdb2G76/pdb) to identify putative hot spots using the FoldX method and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (34Kortemme T.

FoldX 5.0: Working with RNA, small molecules and a new graphical interface.Bioinformatics. 2019; 35: 4168-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As the interface consists of 122 interfacial residues contributed equally by the two subunits, we used the alanine screening method implemented in FoldX 5 (the PSSM module) as the primary screening tool to unravel key residues (36Delgado J.

Evaluating protein engineering thermostability prediction tools using an independently generated dataset.ACS omega. 2020; 5: 6487-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We found 14 strong destabilizing residues (effective ΔΔG ≥ 1.82 kcal/mol), including E108, L109, R119, I121, T125, M128, K129, W133, L143, F262, R270, E290, and R294. We also detected several weak destabilizing residues including S105, M115, R163, V273, I279, and L284. Subsequently, we subjected all these predicted strong and weak destabilizing residues to MD simulation-based alanine screenings to further distinguish energetically hot spots. In addition, we also carried out MD simulations for the three naturally occurring variants, including R135 W, G140 R, and R163Q (Fig. 2A), to evaluate their effects on dimerization. Each of the sPHGDH protein and interfacial variants underwent three 200 ns MD production simulations, and the binding free energies between the two protomers forming the dimer were calculated using the MM-GBSA method implemented in AMBER16 (38Genheden S. Ryde U. The MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods to estimate ligand-binding affinities.Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2015; 10: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2B, listed mutants significantly weakened the binding free energies as compared with the WT sPHGDH structure. Effective ΔΔG of substitutions including E108A, R119A, I121A, T125A, M128A, K129A, W133A, R135W, G140R, R163Q, and I279A exceeded 10 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we found that five out of the ten predicted key residues including E108, R119, and W133 are highly conserved, while I121 and I279 are moderately conserved according to the sequence alignment of the SerA subfamily homologs. In addition, these five residues are also structurally conserved and fully buried in the interface among the SerA subfamily via structure-based sequence alignment with known PGDH structures (PDB codes: 2G76, 4NJO, 1YBA, 1YGY, 3K5P, 1WWK, and 2EKL) (Fig. S2) (20Matelska D.

Protein–protein interaction studies have suggested that hot spots are likely to be structurally conserved residues and are organized in high packing density regions. We therefore selected these five key residues together with the three naturally occurring variants (R135W, G140R, and R163Q) as putative hot spots for further experimental validation (41Guharoy M.

It is noteworthy that the residues predicted to contribute significantly to the energetics of dimer formation are mainly located at a region consisting of a core helix (aa: 102–119) and an interfacial loop referred to as the dimerization loop (aa: 120–145) (Fig. 2C) (44Hilbert B.J. Grossman S.R. Schiffer C.A. Royer W.E.J.

The core helix possessing more hydrophobic residues is fully buried in the interface, whereas the dimerization loop contains atoms that retain partial accessibility. Remarkably, the dimerization loop is adjacent to the catalytic loop (aa: 280–288, H283 is the proton donor during catalysis), which provides the active site with a substrate-binding residue (R135) based on a lately solved sPHGDH-complex structure (PDB: 6CWA) (29Weinstabl H.

We expressed and purified the five conserved hot spot mutants (E108A, R119A, I121A, W133A, and I279 A), the three pathogenic mutants (R135W, G140R, and R163Q), as well as R135A.

https://openalex.org/W3139145057,"LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) is a HAP3 subunit of CCAAT-binding transcription factor, which controls several aspects of embryo and postembryo development, including embryo morphogenesis, storage reserve accumulation and skotomorphogenesis. Herein, using the method of chromosomal walking, a 2707bp upstream sequence from the ATG initiation codon site of AhLEC1A which is a homolog of Arabidopsis LEC1 was isolated in peanut. Its transcriptional start site confirmed by 5’ RACE was located at 82 nt from 5’ upstream of ATG. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that there existed many tissue-specific elements and light responsive motifs in its promoter. To identify the functional region of the AhLEC1A promoter, seven plant expression vectors expressing the GUS (β-glucuronidase) gene, driven by 5’ terminal series deleted fragments of AhLEC1A promoter, were constructed and transformed into Arabidopsis. Results of GUS histochemical staining showed that the regulatory region containing 82bp of 5’ UTR and 2228bp promoter could facilitate GUS to express preferentially in the embryos at different development periods of Arabidopsis. Taken together, it was inferred that the expression of AhLEC1A during seed development of peanut might be controlled positively by several seed-specific regulatory elements, as well as negatively by some other regulatory elements inhibiting its expression in other organs. Moreover, the GUS expression pattern of transgenic seedlings in darkness and in light was relevant to the light-responsive elements scattered in AhLEC1A promoter segment, implying that these light-responsive elements harbored in the AhLEC1A promoter regulate skotomorphogenesis of peanut seeds, and AhLEC1A expression was inhibited after the germinated seedlings were transferred from darkness to light."

Despite the abundant consumption of dairy products, the biological effects of dietary milk polar lipids on metabolic health have only been sparsely examined. Maternal obesity results in neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairment in offspring. Considering the importance of maternal nutrition, the effects of polar lipids-enriched milk fat globule membrane (MFGM-PL) supplementation to dams during pregnancy and lactation on neurodevelopment and its long-term programming effects on offspring cognition were examined. Female Sprague-Dawley rats consumed 8-week control diet (CON) or high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity before mating. Then, female rats were fed CON or HFD with or without the supplementation of 400 mg/kg body weight MFGM-PL during pregnancy and lactation. The offspring were fed 11-week HFD after weaning. MFGM-PL supplementation to obese dams suppressed body weight gain and hyperinsulinemia in both dams and offspring. Offspring born to obese dams displayed delayed neurological reflexes development, impaired neurogenesis before weaning, and cognitive impairment in adulthood, which were recovered by maternal MFGM-PL supplementation. Insulin resistance and aberrant brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling were induced in the hippocampus of neonatal and adult offspring due to maternal and progeny HFD, but recovered by maternal MFGM-PL administration. This study demonstrates that maternal MFGM-PL supplementation can promote neurodevelopment and exert long-term effects against HFD-induced cognitive impairment in offspring via alleviating hippocampal insulin resistance. Hence, MFGM-PL is a promising ingredient for exerting beneficial programming effects on the brain health of offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3136345746,"FOXL2 and ESR2 are key transcriptional regulators in ovarian granulosa cells. To explore their transcriptional roles and their interplay, we have depleted Foxl2 and Esr2 in mouse primary granulosa cells to assess their ability to bind their targets and/or to modulate gene expression and cellular functions. We show that FOXL2 is involved in a large number of regulatory actions essential for the maintenance of granulosa cell fate. A parallel ChIP-seq analysis showed that FOXL2 mainly binds to sites located in intergenic regions quite far from its targets. A bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that FOXL2-activated genes were enriched in peaks associated with the H3K27ac mark, whereas FOXL2-repressed genes were not, suggesting that FOXL2 can activate transcription through binding to enhancer sites. We also identified about 500 deregulated genes upon Esr2 silencing, of which one third are also targets of FOXL2. We provide evidence showing that both factors modulate, through a coherent feed-forward loop, a number of common targets. Many of the FOXL2/ESR2 targets are involved in cell motility and, consistently, granulosa cells depleted for either Foxl2 or Esr2 exhibit decreased migration, invasion and adhesion. This effect is paralleled by the depletion of their target Phactr1, involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Our analysis expands the number of direct and indirect transcriptional targets of both FOXL2 and ESR2, which deserve investigation in the context of adult-type granulosa cell tumors whose molecular diagnostic hallmark is the presence of the C134W FOXL2 pathogenic variant."
https://openalex.org/W3136706315,"Skeletal muscle is the largest organ of the body, the development of skeletal muscle is very important for the health of the animal body. Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) are the classical regulator of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signal pathway, many researchers found that PHDs are involved in the muscle fiber type transformation, muscle regeneration, and myocyte differentiation. However, whether PHDs can impact the protein turnover of skeletal muscle is poorly understood. In this study, we constructed denervated muscle atrophy mouse model and found PHD3 was highly expressed in the atrophic muscles and there was a significant correlation between the expression level of PHD3 and skeletal muscle weight which was distinct from PHD1 and PHD2. Then, the similar results were getting from the different weight muscles of normal mice. To further verify the relationship between PHD3 and skeletal muscle protein turnover, we established a PHD3 interference model by injecting PHD3 sgRNA virus into tibialis anterior muscle (TA) muscle of MCK-Cre-cas9 mice and transfecting PHD3 shRNA lentivirus into primary satellite cells. It was found that the Knock-out of PHD3 in vivo led to a significant increase in muscle weight and muscle fiber area (P < .05). Besides, the activity of protein synthesis signal pathway increased significantly, while the protein degradation pathway was inhibited evidently (P < .05). In vitro, the results of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) fluorescence detection showed that PHD3 interference could lead to a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase of cell apoptosis. After the differentiation of satellite cells, the production of puromycin in the interference group was higher than that in the control group, and the content of 3-methylhistidine in the interference group was lower than that in the control group (P < .05) which is consistent with the change of protein turnover signal pathway in the cell. Mechanistically, there is an interaction between PHD3, NF-κB, and IKBα which was detected by immunoprecipitation. With the interfering of PHD3, the expression of the inflammatory signal pathway also significantly decreased (P < .05). These results suggest that PHD3 may affect protein turnover in muscle tissue by mediating inflammatory signal pathway. Finally, we knocked out PHD3 in denervated muscle atrophy mice and LPS-induced myotubes atrophy model. Then, we found that the decrease of PHD3 protein level could alleviate the muscle weight and muscle fiber reduction induced by denervation in mice. Meanwhile, the protein level of the inflammatory signal pathway and the content of 3-methylhistidine in denervated atrophic muscle were also significantly reduced (P < .05). In vitro, PHD3 knock-out could alleviate the decrease of myotube diameter induced by LPS, and the expression of protein synthesis pathway was also significantly increased (P < .05). On the contrary, the expression level of protein degradation and inflammatory signal pathway was significantly decreased (P < .05). Through these series of studies, we found that the increased expression of PHD3 in denervated muscle might be an important regulator in inducing muscle atrophy, and this process is likely to be mediated by the inflammatory NF-κB signal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3136818992,"Background Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) results in a tremendous disease burden worldwide. Available research on active surveillance among hospitalized adult patients suffering from SARI in China is limited. This pilot study aimed to identify associated etiologies and describe the demographic, epidemiological and clinical profiles of hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years in Jinshan, Shanghai. Methods Active surveillance was conducted at 1 sentinel hospital in Jinshan district, Shanghai, from April 2017 to March 2018. Hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old were enrolled, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected within 24 hours of admission and tested for multiple respiratory viruses (including 18 common viruses) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information was obtained from case report forms. Results In total, 397 SARI patients were enrolled; the median age was 68 years, and 194 (48.9%) patients were male. A total of 278 (70.0%) patients had at least one underlying chronic medical condition. The most frequent symptoms were cough (99.2%) and sputum production (88.4%). The median duration of hospitalization was 10 days. A total of 250 infection patients (63.0%) were positive for at least one pathogen, of whom 198 (49.9%) were positive for a single pathogen and 52 (13.1%) were positive for multiple pathogens. The pathogens identified most frequently were M . pneumoniae (23.9%, 95/397), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (11.6%, 46/397), influenza virus A/H3N2 (Flu A/H3N2) (11.1%, 44/397), human rhinovirus (HRhV) (8.1%, 32/397), influenza virus B/Yamagata (Flu B/Yamagata) (6.3%, 25/397), pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (Flu A/pH1N1) (4.0%, 16/397), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1 (2.0%, 8/397), human coronavirus (HCoV) type NL63 (2.0%, 8/397), HCoV 229E (1.5%, 6/397), HCoV HKU1 (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 3 (1.5%, 6/397), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 4 (1.3%, 5/397), HCoV OC43 (1.0%, 4/397), influenza virus B/Victoria (Flu B/Victoria) (0.5%, 2/397), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type B (0.5%, 2/397), and human bocavirus (HBoV) (0.3%, 1/397). The seasonality of pathogen-confirmed SARI patients had a bimodal distribution, with the first peak in the summer and the second peak in the winter. Statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the rates of dyspnea, radiographically diagnosed pneumonia and the presence of at least one comorbidity in patients who were infected with only M . pneumoniae , AdV, HRhV, Flu A/H3N2, Flu A /pH1N1 or Flu B/Yamagata. The differences in the positivity rates of the above 6 pathogens among the different age groups were nonsignificant. Conclusions M . pneumoniae , AdV and Flu A/H3N2 were the main pathogens detected in hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old in Jinshan district, Shanghai. Our findings highlight the importance of sustained multipathogen surveillance among SARI patients in sentinel hospitals, which can provide useful information on SARI etiologies, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics."

Rater anesthesiologists judged the change in precordial Doppler sound (S test) before and after injection of 0.5 mL/kg of normal saline (NS) via PIV. Blood flow velocity before and after NS injection was recorded, and multiple cutoff points were set to analyze the accuracy of detecting the infiltration and dysfunction of PIV catheter (V test).The total incidence of peripheral infiltration and dysfunction of PIV catheter was 7/512 (1.4%). In the S test, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were 5/7 (71.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29.0%-96.3%), 490/505 (97.0%; 95% CI, 95.1%-98.3%), 24.0, 0.29, and 0.84, respectively. The V test showed that the reasonable threshold of blood flow velocity change was 1.0 m/s, with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and AUC of 4/7 (57.1%; 95% CI, 18.4%-90.1%), 489/505 (96.8%; 95% CI, 94.9%-98.2%), 18.0 and 0.44, and 0.84, respectively.This preliminary study demonstrated that precordial Doppler ultrasound is a feasible, easy-to-use, and noninvasive technique with good accuracy to confirm the correct PIV access during general anesthesia in children. However, its accuracy requires further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3136415164,"Pain is one of the cardinal signs accompanying inflammation. The prostaglandins (PGs), synthetized from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, are major bioactive lipids implicated in inflammation and pain. However, COX-2 is also able to metabolize other lipids, including the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), to give glycerol ester (PG-G) and ethanolamide (PG-EA) derivatives of the PGs. Consequently, COX-2 can be considered as a hub not only controlling PG synthesis, but also PG-G and PG-EA synthesis. As they were more recently characterized, these endocannabinoid metabolites are less studied in nociception compared to PGs. Interestingly R-profens, previously considered as inactive enantiomers of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are substrate-selective COX inhibitors. Indeed, R-flurbiprofen can selectively block PG-G and PG-EA production, without affecting PG synthesis from COX-2. Therefore, we compared the effect of R-flurbiprofen and S-flurbiprofen in models of inflammatory pain triggered by local administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and carrageenan in mice. Remarkably, the effects of flurbiprofen enantiomers on mechanical hyperalgesia seem to depend on (i) the inflammatory stimuli, (ii) the route of administration, and (iii) the timing of administration. We also assessed the effect of administration of the PG-Gs, PG-EAs, and PGs on LPS-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Our data support the interest of studying the nonhydrolytic endocannabinoid metabolism in the context of inflammatory pain."
https://openalex.org/W3136694472,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common primary tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Rodent models of HCC have contributed to the advancement of studies investigating liver carcinogenesis, tumor-host interactions, and drug screening. However, their small size renders them unsuitable for surgical or clinical imaging studies, necessitating the development of larger-size HCC models. Here, we developed a xenograft model of human HCC in X-linked interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain gene ( Il2rg )-targeted severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) pigs. HepG2 cell suspension in serum-free medium containing 50% membrane matrix was directly injected into the liver parenchyma of eight X-linked Il2rg -targeted SCID pigs (6.6–15.6 kg) via ultrasonography-guided percutaneous puncture. Tumor engraftment was evaluated weekly using ultrasonography, and cone-beam computed tomography was performed during arterial portography (CTAP) and hepatic arteriography (CTHA) to evaluate the hemodynamics of engrafted tumors. The engrafted tumors were histologically analyzed following necropsy and assessed for pathological similarities to human HCCs. Macroscopic tumor formation was observed in seven of the eight pigs (simple nodular tumors in three and multinodular tumors in four). Engrafted tumors were identified as low-echoic upon ultrasonography and as perfusion-defect nodules on the CTAP images. Meanwhile, CTHA showed that the tumors were hyperattenuating. Further, histopathological findings of the engrafted tumors were consistent with those of human HCC. In conclusion, the porcine model of human HCC, successfully generated herein, might help develop more effective therapeutic strategies for HCC."

In this paper, we developed a stacked ensemble model that averages the predictions from various competing methodologies in the current frontier for ILI-related forecasts. We also constructed a back-of-the-envelope prediction interval for the stacked ensemble, which provides a conservative characterization of the uncertainty in the stacked ensemble predictions. We assessed the accuracy and reliability of our model with 1 to 4 weeks ahead forecast targets using real-time hospital-level data on weekly ILI visit volumes during the 2012-2018 flu seasons in the Alberta Children’s Hospital, located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Our results suggest the forecasting performance of the stacked ensemble meets or exceeds the performance of the individual models over all forecast targets."
https://openalex.org/W3139326147,"DNA methylation is increasingly recognized as a potential biomarker of metabolic disease. However, there is limited information on the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the candidacy of DNA methylation to serve as molecular biomarkers. This study investigated the effect of HIV infection on DNA methylation patterns in the peripheral blood of South African women with (n = 95) or without (n = 191) gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). DNA methylation levels at eight CpG sites in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) promoter were measured using bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing. Differences between HIV negative ( - ) and positive ( + ) women were observed. In HIV - women, methylation at CpG -3400 was lower in GDM + women compared to those with normoglycemia (8.5-fold; p = 0.004), and was associated with higher fasting glucose (β-co-efficient = 0.973; p = 0.006) and lower adiponectin (β-co-efficient = -0.057; p = 0.014) concentrations. These associations were not observed in HIV + women. In silico analysis showed that Transcription Factor AP2-alpha is able to bind to the altered CpG site, suggesting that CpG -3400 may play a functional role in the regulation of ADIPOQ expression. Our findings show that DNA methylation differs by HIV status, suggesting that HIV infection needs to be taken into consideration in studies exploring DNA methylation as a biomarker of GDM in high HIV prevalence settings."
https://openalex.org/W3137620675,"Nonmelanoma skin cancers occur primarily in individuals over the age of 60 and are characterized by an abundance of ultraviolet (UV) signature mutations in keratinocyte DNA. Though geriatric skin removes UV photoproducts from DNA less efficiently than young adult skin, it is not known whether the utilization of other prosurvival but potentially mutagenic DNA damage tolerance systems such as translesion synthesis (TLS) is altered in older individuals. Using monoubiquitination of the replicative DNA polymerase clamp protein PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) as a biochemical marker of TLS pathway activation, we find that UVB exposure of the skin of individuals over the age of 65 results in a higher level of PCNA monoubiquitination than in the skin of young adults. Furthermore, based on previous reports showing a role for deficient insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling in altered UVB DNA damage responses in geriatric human skin, we find that both pharmacological inhibition of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and deprivation of IGF-1 potentiate UVB-induced PCNA monoubiquitination in both human skin ex vivo and keratinocytes in vitro. Interestingly, though the TLS DNA polymerase Pol eta can accurately replicate the major photoproducts induced in DNA by UV radiation, we find that it fails to accumulate on chromatin in the absence of IGF-1R signaling and that this phenotype is correlated with increased mutagenesis in keratinocytes in vitro. Thus, altered IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling in geriatric skin may predispose epidermal keratinocytes to carry out a more mutagenic form of DNA synthesis following UVB exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3137682690,"Reintubation after weaning from mechanical ventilation is relatively common and is associated with poor outcomes. Different methods to decrease the reintubation rate post extubation, including noninvasive ventilation, and more recently high-flow oxygen (HFO) therapy, have been proposed. In this study, we aimed to assess the safety of introducing HFO in the post-extubation care of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We conducted a single-center cohort study of extubated adult patients hospitalized in a surgical ICU and previously mechanically ventilated for > 1 day. Our study consisted of two phases: Phase 1 (before the introduction of HFO from April 2015 to April 2016) and Phase P2 (after the introduction of HFO from April 2017 to April 2018). The primary endpoint was the reintubation rate within 48 hours of extubation. In total, 290 patients (median age 65 years [50-74]; 190 men [65.5%]) were included in the analysis (181 and 109 in Phases 1 and 2, respectively). The results of the post-extubation use of noninvasive methods (noninvasive ventilation and/or HFO) were not significantly different between the two phases (41 [22.7%] versus 29 [26.6%] patients; p = 0.480), however these methods were implemented earlier in Phase 2 (0 versus 4 hours; p = 0.009) and HFO was used significantly more often than noninvasive ventilation (24 [22.0%] versus 25 [13.8%] patients; p = 0.039). The need for reintubation within 48 hours post extubation was significantly lower in Phase 2 (4 [3.7%] versus 20 [11.0%] patients; p = 0.028) but was not significantly different at 7 days post extubation (10 [9.2%] versus 30 [16.6%] patients; p = 0.082). The earlier implementation of noninvasive methods and the increased use of HFO beginning in Phase 2 were safe and effective based on the reintubation rates within the first 48 hours post extubation and after 7 days."
https://openalex.org/W3138259852,"Objectives To determine: i) the emergency department (ED) utilization history of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients, and ii) the potential individual and public health consequences of a missed diagnosis of PTB in this setting. Design Retrospective observational cohort study. Participants Patients with PTB aged &gt;16 years diagnosed between April 1, 2010 and December 31, 2016 in the Province of Alberta, Canada. Methods We identified valid new cases of PTB from a provincial registry and linked them to ED attendees in administrative databases. Visits are considered ‘PTB’, pulmonary ‘other’, and non-pulmonary based on the most responsible discharge diagnosis. Individual consequences of a missed diagnosis included health system delay and PTB-related death; public health consequences included nosocomial ED exposure time and secondary cases. Results Of 711 PTB patients, 378 (53%) made 845 ED visits in the six months immediately preceding the date of diagnosis. The most responsible ED discharge diagnosis was PTB in 92 (10.9%), pulmonary ‘other’ in 273 (32%) and non-pulmonary in 480 (56.8%). ED attendees had a median (IQR) health system delay of 27 (7,180) days and, compared to non-ED attendees were more likely to die a TB-related death 5.9% vs 1.2%, p = 0.001. Emergency attendees generated 3812 hours of ED nosocomial exposure time, and 31 secondary cases (60.8% of all secondary cases reported). Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from ED-attendees were more likely than non-attendees to be clustered–i.e., have an identical DNA fingerprint with another isolate (27% vs. 21%, p = 0.037). Conclusions ED utilization by PTB patients, and related consequences, are substantial. EDs are a potential resource for earlier PTB diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3138337750,"In Europe and America, associations between personality traits and body-mass index (BMI) have been reported. However, in Japan, the association between personality traits and BMI (i.e., thinness and obesity) has not been well studied. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) personality traits and changes in BMI status among Japanese students during their university attendance. We measured the height and weight of 5,340 students in a Japanese university during annual medical checkups and calculated their BMI. The students' personality traits were measured using the short Japanese version of the TCI at university admission. The participants were divided into seven groups based on how BMI changed from the first year to the fourth year at university. In men, compared to the group that maintained normal BMI status (N = 2,189) over time (i.e., the control group), the group that maintained thinness status (N = 226) were lower in Reward Dependence, and the group whose status improved from thinness to normal (N = 117) were higher in Harm Avoidance. In women, compared with the control group (N = 1,510), the group that maintained thinness status (N = 302) was lower in Novelty Seeking, and the group whose status worsened from normal to thinness (N = 127) was higher in Harm Avoidance. Weak associations were found between thinness and TCI personality traits among Japanese university students. Further elaboration of the relationship between obesity or thinness and personality traits may help to provide effective preventive interventions in these areas."
https://openalex.org/W3139412297,"Readmissions are very costly, in monetary terms but also for the individual patient's safety and health. Only by understanding the reasons and drivers of readmissions, it is possible to ensure quality of care and improve the situation. The aim of this study was to assess inpatient readmissions during the first three months after discharge from geriatric inpatient care regarding main diagnosis and frequency of readmission. Furthermore, the aim was to analyze association between readmission and patient characteristics including demography and socioeconomics, morbidity, physical function, risk screening and care process respectively.The study includes all individuals admitted for inpatient care at three geriatric departments operated by the Stockholm region during 2016. Readmission after discharge was studied within three different time intervals; readmission within 10 days after discharge, within 11-30 days and within 31-90 days, respectively. Main diagnosis at readmission was assessed.One fourth of the individuals discharged from inpatient geriatric care was readmitted during the first three months after discharge. The most common main diagnoses for readmission were heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Statistically significant risk factors for readmission included age, sex, number of diagnoses at discharge, and to some extent polypharmacy and destination of discharge.Several clinical risk factors relating to physical performance and vulnerability were associated with risk of readmission. Socioeconomic information did not add to the predictability. To enable reductions in readmission rates, proactive monitoring of frail individuals afflicted with chronic conditions is necessary, and an integrated perspective including all stakeholders involved is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3138905872,"Grandparents are important childcare providers, but grandparental relationship status matters. According to several studies, caregiving is reduced after grandparental divorce, but differential responses by grandmothers versus grandfathers have often been glossed over. To explore the effects of relationship status on grandparental care, we analysed data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) comparing four grandparental relationship statuses (original couple, widowed, divorced, and repartnered) with respect to grandmothers' and grandfathers' provision of care to their birth children's children. When proximity, kinship laterality, and grandparents' age, health, employment, and financial status were controlled, divorced grandmothers without current partners provided significantly more childcare than grandmothers who were still residing with the grandfather, those who had new partners unrelated to the grandchildren, and widows without current partners. Grandfathers exhibited a very different pattern, providing substantially less grandchild care after divorce. Grandfathers in their original partnerships provided the most grandchild care, followed by widowers, those with new partners and finally those who were divorced. Seemingly contradictory findings in prior research, including studies using SHARE data, can be explained partly by failures to distinguish divorce's effects on grandmothers versus grandfathers, and partly by insufficient controls for the grandmother's financial and employment statuses."
https://openalex.org/W3136306107,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β (HNF1β) is an essential transcription factor in development of the kidney, liver, and pancreas. HNF1β-mediated transcription of target genes is dependent on the cell type and the development stage. Nevertheless, the regulation of HNF1β function by enhancers and co-factors that allow this cell-specific transcription is largely unknown. To map the HNF1β interactome we performed mass spectrometry in a mouse kidney inner medullary collecting duct cell line. Pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase 2 (PCBD2) was identified as a novel interaction partner of HNF1β. PCBD2 and its close homolog PCBD1 shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus to exert their enzymatic and transcriptional activities. Although both PCBD proteins share high sequence identity (48% and 88% in HNF1 recognition helix), their tissue expression patterns are unique. PCBD1 is most abundant in kidney and liver while PCBD2 is also abundant in lung, spleen, and adipose tissue. Using immunolocalization studies and biochemical analysis we show that in presence of HNF1β the nuclear localization of PCBD1 and PCBD2 increases significantly. Promoter luciferase assays demonstrate that co-factors PCBD1 and PCBD2 differentially regulate the ability of HNF1β to activate the promoters of transcriptional targets important in renal electrolyte homeostasis. Deleting the N-terminal sequence of PCBD2, not found in PCBD1, diminished the differential effects of the co-factors on HNF1β activity. All together these results indicate that PCBD1 and PCBD2 can exert different effects on HNF1β-mediated transcription. Future studies should confirm whether these unique co-factor activities also apply to HNF1β-target genes involved in additional processes besides ion transport in the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W3137679268,"Wheat germ acid phosphatase (WGAP) is a commercial preparation of partially purified protein commonly used in laboratory settings for non-specific enzymatic dephosphorylation. It is known that these preparations contain multiple phosphatase isozymes and are still relatively crude. This study therefore aimed to identify the protein components of a commercial preparation of wheat germ acid phosphatase using mass spectroscopy and comparative genomics. After one post-purchase purification step, the most prevalent fifteen proteins in the mixture included heat shock proteins, beta-amylases, glucoseribitol dehydrogenases, enolases, and an aminopeptidase. While not among the most abundant components, eight unique dephosphorylation enzymes were also present including three purple acid phosphatases. Furthermore, it is shown that some of these correspond to previously isolated isozymes; one of which has been also previously shown by transcriptome data to be overexpressed in wheat seeds. In summary, this study identified the major components of WGAP including phosphatases and hypothesizes the most active components towards a better understanding of this commonly used laboratory tool."
https://openalex.org/W3137813256,"Impairment of protein clearance mechanisms leads to α-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons, contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on the finding that Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1), a positive modulator of PD, colocalizes with α-synuclein in PD patient brains, we investigated the existence of pathological interplay between FAF1 and α-synuclein. Monomeric and high-molecular-weight forms of α-synuclein were increased in FAF1-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells. In particular, α-synuclein turnover was accelerated by genetic depletion of FAF1 in SH-SY5Y cells. Therefore, we questioned whether FAF1 is involved in the α-synuclein clearance process. Autophagy inhibitors, but not proteasome inhibitors, restored concurrent attenuation of α-synuclein expression by FAF1 depletion in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, we found alterations in autophagy markers in SH-SY5Y cells caused by FAF1 overexpression, indicating that FAF1 disturbed α-synuclein clearance through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Indeed, FAF1 activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, subsequently suppressing autophagosome formation. Consistently, α-synuclein-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction was observed in FAF1-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, FAF1 overexpression using stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus led to α-synuclein accumulation and autophagy dysregulation in the PD model mice. Taken together, our results reveal a novel role for FAF1: that of a negative regulator of autophagic α-synuclein clearance."
https://openalex.org/W3136865832,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) secondary to congenital heart disease (CHD-PAH) with systemic-to-pulmonary shunt (SPS) is characterized by proliferative vascular remodeling. Capillary morphogenesis gene-2 (CMG2) plays a key role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. This study aimed to determine the role of CMG2 in the pathogenesis of SPS-induced PAH. CMG2 levels were significantly downregulated in pulmonary arterioles from patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and rats with SPS-induced PAH. CMG2 was highly expressed in several cells including human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs). CMG2−/− rats exhibited more severe PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling than wild-type rats when exposed to SPS for 8 weeks. Overexpression of CMG2 significantly inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HPASMCs, while knockdown of CMG2 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis. Next-generation sequencing and subsequent validation results suggested that PI3K-AKT was the most prominent signaling pathway regulated by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CMG2−/− rat lungs. Our work identified a novel role for CMG2 in SPS-induced PAH based on the findings that CMG2 deficiency exacerbates SPS-induced vascular remodeling in the development of PAH, indicating that CMG2 might act as a potential target for the treatment of CHD-PAH."
https://openalex.org/W3137507607,"Vitiligo is perceived as an autoimmune skin disease. Previous studies showed conflicting data about vitiligo and pregnancy outcomes. To delineate the associations between vitiligo and the pregnancy outcomes, we used the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan to conduct a retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015. This study population was composed of 1,096 women with vitiligo and 4,384 women without vitiligo, who were all matched according to age, comorbidity, and index year. Compared with the non-vitiligo controls, women with vitiligo had a higher risk of abortion (aHR 1.158, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.095–1.258, P &lt; .001). Perinatal events, such as preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, stillbirth, and intrauterine growth retardation, were not different between both groups (aHR 1.065, 95% CI 0.817–1.157, P = .413). To determine if systemic treatment before conception decreases the risk of abortion, we assessed the medical history of pregnant women with vitiligo 1 year before pregnancy. Patients who were treated with oral medications had a lower risk of abortion than those who were not (aHR: 0.675, 95% CI: 0.482–0.809, P &lt; .001). Our study indicates that there is a higher risk of abortion in pregnant women with vitiligo and the control of disease activity with systemic treatment before conception could improve pregnancy outcomes."
