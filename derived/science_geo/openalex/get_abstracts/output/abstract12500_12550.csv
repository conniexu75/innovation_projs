https://openalex.org/W2088333712,"The prostaglandin endoperoxide ring structure alone does not establish suitability as a substrate for thromboxane synthetase, but the degree of unsaturation and carbon chain length are also essential features. Thus, human platelet microsomes can synthesize thromboxane A2, thromboxane A3, but not thromboxane A1 from their respective endoperoxides. The potent vasoconstrictor property of thromboxanes can be dissociated from its capacity to produce platelet aggregation. Furthermore, thromboxane formation is not an essential process in platelet aggregation. The observations indicate the remarkable structural specificity of both the synthetic enzymes, cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthetase, as well as the vascular and platelet receptor sites."
https://openalex.org/W1640849052,"Guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), GTP, and other purine nucleotides selectively decrease the binding affinity of the beta-adrenergic receptors of frog erythrocyte membranes for beta-adrenergic agonists but not antagonists. Shifts in binding affinity were assessed by determining the ability of unlabeled ligands to compete with (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol for the membrane-bound receptors. The magnitude of theright shift in the binding displacement curve for any of 13 ligands tested was directly related to the intrinsic activity (maximal stimulatory capacity) of that agent for stimulation of the frog erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase. Thus, Gpp(NH)p-induced shifts in binding affinity were greatest for full agonists such as isoproterenol, intermediate for partial agonists such as soterenol, and no shifts were observed for antagonists such as propranolol. Shifts in binding affinity were observed only in preparations where agonist binding to the receptors leads to coupling of the receptors with adenylate cyclase. In solubilized preparations where the beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase are functionally uncoupled, Gpp(NH)p did not cause right shifts in agonist receptor binding displacement curves. In particulate preparations the Km of Gpp(NH)p for stimulation of adenylate cyclase was identical with that for its effect on beta-adrenergic agonist binding affinity, 1 to 2 muM. Moreover, the ability of several other nucleotides to cause shifts in receptor binding affinity directly paralleled their previously determined for the nucleotide regulatory sites on adenylate cyclase. Gpp(NH)p also shifted agonist dose-response curves for stimulation of adenylate cyclase, but to the left. As with the effects on the receptor binding curves, the effects of Gpp(NH)p on the apparent affinities of agonists for enzyme stimulation were directly related to their intrinsic activities. Gpp(NH)p also markedly increased the intrinsic activity of partial agonists. These results appear to indicate that conformational alterations in adenylate cyclase caused by occupation of nucleotide regulatory sites by Gpp(NH)p are capable of inducing alterations in the beta-adrenergic receptors. These receptor alterations are induced only when the receptors are coupled to the enzyme by virtue of agonist binding. The nucleotide-altered conformation of the beta-adrenergic receptors is characterized by decreased binding affinity for agonist but increased functional efficacy in stimulating the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1509038776,"We have used 125I-labeled vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) to study the kinetics, stoichiometry, and chemical specificity with which the labeled peptide binds to dispersed acinar cells prepared from guinea pig pancreas. Binding of 125I-VIP to pancreatic acinar cells was moderately rapid, reversible, specific, saturable, and depended on incubation temperature. Deterioration of 125I-VIP incubated with pancreatic acinar cells at 37 degrees was reflected in a decrease in acid-precipitable radioactivity and in the amount of tracer which could bind to fresh acinar cells. On the other hand, 125I-VIP bound to pancreatic acinar cells appeared to be protected from deterioration. VIP and secretin but not glucagon or COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin inhibited binding of 125I-VIP to pancreatic acinar cells. The dose-response curve for inhibition of 125I-VIP binding by VIP or secretin was biphasic and suggested that pancreatic acinar cells have two classes of binding sites: (a) a relatively small number of sites with a high affinity for VIP and a low affinity for secretin, and (b) a relatively large number of sites with a low affinity for VIP and a high affinity for secretin. The difference between the relative affinities of VIP and secretin for the high affinity VIP binding sites appears to be primarily attributable to the NH2-terminal portions of these molecules since synthetic COOH-terminal fragments VIP 14-28, VIP 15-28, and secretin 14-27 were equipotent in inhibiting 125I-VIP binding. On the other hand, secretin 5-27, [6-tyrosine] secretin and native secretin were equipotent in inhibiting binding of 125I-VIP to its high affinity site, and these three peptides were 5 times more potent than secretin 14-27 but 10,000 times less potent than native VIP."
https://openalex.org/W1537526970,"A general immunochemical method for the assay of haptens and proteins has been devised and applied to morphine, a morphine-albumin conjugate, and human immunoglobulin G. A fluorescein-labeled antigen and a quencher-labeled antibody are employed. By use of fluorescein and rhodamine as the fluorescer and quencher, respectively, dipole-dipole-coupled excitation energy transfer can occur within the antigen-antibody complex. The resulting quenching of fluorescence can be inhibited by competitive binding with unlabeled antigen, Alternatively, separate antibody samples can be labeled with fluorescein and rhodamine, respectively. Unlabeled antigen causes aggregation of the separately labeled components with resultant quenching. Using the latter method, experiments suggest that up to about 20 anti-morphine antibody binding sites will associate with morphine-albumin conjugates. When an excess of the conjugate is present the antibodies appear to assemble in clumps on the protein surface. Mathematical analysis of the quenching of fluorescein-labeled morphine by rhodamine-labeled anti-morphine gives an approximate fit to the quenching data, but the calculations are very dependent on the assumptions used."
https://openalex.org/W1514634719,"The acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.20) activity of isolated fat cells was predominantly (89%) localized to the microsomal subcellular fraction by assays based on the conversion of 1,2-[3H]diacyl-sn-glycerol to triacylglycerol using 1 to 4 mug of protein. A complementary assay based on the conversion of [3H]palmitoyl-CoA to triacylglycerol was developed. These methods, 100 to 1000 times more sensitive than those previously employed, were used to characterize the microsomal activity. The choice of dispersing agent for addition of diacylglycerol to the reaction mixture was crucial. Addition of diacylglycerol in ethanol resulted in the highest diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity of the methods tested. Tween 20, which has previously been employed as the dispersing agent, severely inhibited the activity. A broad pH optimum from 7.4 to 8.0 was noted and several salts stimulated the activity more than 2-fold. The activity was unstable at temperatures of 28 degrees and above. Dependences on acyl-CoAs containing 6 to 18 carbon atoms were investigated using bacterial diacylglycerol. Acetyl- and butyryl-CoA were not substrates. Highest diacylglycerol acyltransferase activities were observed with decanoyl-CoA and lower activities were noted with longer and shorter saturated chains. Maximal activity with oleoyl-CoA was only 34% of that seen with stearoyl-CoA. No simple relationship between the critical micellar concentrations of the acyl-CoAs employed and diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was observed. The dependences on diacylglycerols containing fatty acids 6 to 18 carbon atoms in length were investigated with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA. While all the 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerols tested were substrates, diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was highest with 1,2-dioleoylglycerol. Maximum activity with the bacterial diacylglycerol was 86% that with 1,2-dioleoylglycerol. The diacylglycerol concentrations required for half-maximal velocity were 20 to 40 muM for long chain diacylglycerols and 2 to 3 muM for short chain diacylglycerols; these were 75- to 750-fold lower than previously reported. Microsomal diacylglycerol acyltransferase specific activities from isolated cells around 50 nmol/min/mg, 10- to 50-fold higher than previously reported from adipose tissue, were typical using dioleoylglycerol and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase specific activities were 17-fold higher in microsomes from isolated fat cells than any other tissue examined. The diacylglycerol acyltransferase appears to have specificity with respect to acyl-CoAs and diacylglycerols, but a definitive interpretation is limited by the lack of data on the physical properties of these substrates in solution under the conditions employed."
https://openalex.org/W2089349175,"The accumulation of macrophages at neoplastic sites may be an important event in immunologically mediated tumor killing. The implantation of syngeneic neoplasms in mice, however, was found to depress the animal's ability to localize macrophages at inflammatory sites. A low-molecular-weight (6,000 to 10,000) factor released by growing neoplasms that inhibits the accumulation of macrophages in vivo and chemotactic responsiveness in vitro was identified. The factor is active in the inhibition of macrophages and is ineffectual at retarding the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Neoplastic cells may thus abrogate immunosurveillance by releasing products that prevent potentially tumoricidal macrophages from accumulating at sites of developing malignancies."

Fractions A2 and C2 were highly purified with specific contents of 16.5 and 17.5 nmol of cytochrome P-450/mg of protein, respectively, based on their amino acid compositions. The major hemeprotein bands of A2 and C2 have different minimum molecular weights (50,000 and 56,000, respectively) on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. All four fractions with respect to their spectral and catalytic properties, thereby demonstrating that mouse liver microsomes from phenobarbital-treated hybrid mice contain at least four forms of cytochrome P-450."

https://openalex.org/W1519306122,"A biphasic response to changes in Ca2+ concentration was observed for basal and norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in homogenates of C-6 glioma cells. The enzyme was stimulated approximately 40% by low concentrations of free Ca2+ (less than or equal to 1 muM) and inhibited to successively greater extents as free Ca2+ concentrations were increased to approximately 100 muM. Ca2+ did not alter the concentration of norepinephrine required for enzyme activation. Homogenates of C-6 cells were separated into particulate and supernatant fractions by centrifugation at 27,000 X g for 20 min. The particulate fraction contained nearly all of the adenylate cyclase activity. This activity was stimulated approximately 40% by the addition of untreated supernatant fraction, by boiled or dialyzed supernatant fraction, and by a homogenous Ca2+-binding protein (calcium-dependent regulator (CDR) prepared from brain. Addition of either the supernatant fraction or CDR lowered the Ca2+ concentration required for maximal stimulation of the adenylate cyclase. The factor in the supernatant fraction which activated the particulate enzyme was subsequently identified in acrylamide gel electrophoretic studies to be CDR. The amount of CDR required for maximal activation of the enzyme was found to be lowered as the Ca2+ concentration in the assay was increased. High amounts of added CDR (100 to 1000 ng) were inhibitory. Use of the monionic detergent, Lubrol PX, to prepare dispersed adenylate cyclase from the particulate fraction resulted in large losses of activity. The resultant preparation of enzyme contained some CDR which could not be removed by chromatography of the preparation on anion exchange columns. Addition of homogeneous CDR to the assay activated the enzyme several-fold at low Ca2+ concentrations. At higher Ca2+ concentrations the enzyme was activated fully by the CDR endogenous to the preparation and added Ca2+. CDR was inhibitory."
https://openalex.org/W2010038930,"Several proteolytic enzymes have been studied with regard to their ability to induce DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in resting chick embryo fibroblasts. Of the enzymes examined, thrombin, bromelin, and trypsin exhibit potent mitogenic activity, elastase has significant but less marked activity, whereas thermolysin, papain, and α-protease are inactive. The enzymes were also tested for their ability to induce morphological change or to remove two iodinatable proteins of 250,000 and 205,000 daltons. Although the larger protein is removed by some but not all of the proteases examined, every protease tested removed the smaller cell surface protein. The ability of proteases to stimulate cell growth could not be correlated directly with removal of either of these cell surface proteins; however, loss of the smaller protein does correlate with the reduction of both cytoplasmic spreading and cell-cell interactions observed after protease treatment. A secondary, later event of migration of cells into clumps is observed in those instances when protease treatment did not result in a loss of the 250K protein. A role for each of these proteins in the processes of cellular adhesion is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2044525314,"The influence of amino acid starvation on both the pool sizes of nucleoside triphosphates and the rRNA synthetic capacity of Ehrlich ascites cells was studied. The results indicate that under shift-down conditions, an immediate shrinkage of the cellular ATP and GTP levels occurs. Concomitant with this, protein and rRNA synthesis are markedly inhibited. If the pool sizes of purine nucleoside triphosphates are expanded by adding adenosine or guanosine to cells cultured in histidine-free medium, the nucleolar RNA synthesis is fully restored, while protein synthesis remains inhibited. The results suggest that the rate of pre-rRNA transcription may be controlled by the actual nucleoside triphosphate levels of the cells rather than by short-lived protein(s), as has been previously postulated."
https://openalex.org/W1485678634,"Chromatographic procedures were developed which permit the separation of the monoglutamylfolic acid derivatives from each other and from their polyglutamyl congeners. Using these methods, the cellular folate derivatives in logarithmically growing L1210 cells were found to consist entirely of polyglutamyl derivatives. When ascorbate extracts of these cells were digested with hog kidney gamma-glutamylcarboxypeptidase and then chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose columns, the cellular folates eluted coincident with tetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, with minimal amounts associated with folate (approximately 0.8%) or dihydrofolate (approximately 0.4%). When these experiments were repeated on cells previously depleted of folates which were then grown on 0.4 muM pteroylglutamic acid (a concentration insufficient to maintain an optimal growth rate) more than 95% of the folates were again found in polyglutamyl form. These results imply that the polyglutamyl derivatives found are not storage forms of enzymatically active cofactor, but rather are the actual cofactor forms used by these mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1513638021,"NCTC 2071 cells, transformed mouse fibroblasts, when grown in chemically defined medium, are deficient in gangliosides and do not respond to choleragen. The cells lack two biosynthetic enzymes, CMP-sialic acid:lactosylceramide sialyltransferase and UDP-galactose:GM2 (GalNAc-[AcNeu]-Gal-Glc-ceramide) galactosyltransferase, which are required for ganglioside synthesis. Following uptake of ganglioside GM1 (Gal-GalNAc-[AcNeu]-Gal-Glc-ceramide) from the medium, the cells respond to choleragen; however, they remain unresponsive following uptake of gangliosides GM2 (approximately 6 X 10(6) molecules/cell) and GM3 (AcNeu-Gal-Glc-ceramide) (approximately 2 X 10(6) molecules/cell). A response was observed when the cells had bound approximately 2 X 10(7) molecules of GM2/cell. After binding GD1a (AcNeu-Gal-GalNAc-[AcNeu]-Gal-Glc ceramide) (approximately 2 X 10(5) molecules/cell), cells exhibit some response to the toxin which can be attributed to enzymatic conversion of GD1a to GM1. A second line of NCTC 2071 cells which have 2.5 X 10(7) molecules of endogenous GM2/cell is slightly responsive to choleragen; adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels rise 150%. However, when these cells have bound 4.4 X 10(4) molecules of GM1 per cell, cyclic AMP levels rise 7-fold following toxin treatment. GM1, which becomes functionally integrated into the cells, appears to be the natural receptor for choleragen and is 50 to 1000 times more effective than other gangliosides in eliciting a choleragen response."
https://openalex.org/W1587879375,"Under conditions favoring its autocatalytic reaction, phosphorylase kinase may be activated and phosphorylated in 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonate (Mes) buffer to a much higher level than in beta-glycerophosphate buffer. The fact that the reaction is autocatalytic is supported by several observations: (a) the progress curve of the reaction exhibits a pronounced lag phase, (b) the reaction is strongly inhibited by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetate, which inhibits phosphorylase kinase, (c) the pH profile of the reaction resembles that of the phosphorylase b to a reaction as catalyzed by nonactivated phosphorylase kinase, and (d) the reaction is not significantly affected by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) nor by the heat-stable protein inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. When fully autoactivated, phosphorylase kinase possesses an activity that is 100% higher than that of the protein kinase-activated form. The results suggest that autophosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase may be an important regulatory mechanism. The autocatalytic reaction involves phosphorylation of the two larger subunits of phosphorylase kinase, i.e. subunits A and B, with a combined total of 7 to 9 phosphates incorporated per mol of enzyme. Although the cAMP-dependent protein kinase also catalyzes the phosphorylation of subunits A and B, the two mechanisms of phosphorylation appear to involve different sites. Prior phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase by the protein kinase has little effect on the level of autophosphorylation. Thus activation of phosphorylase kinase may be brought about by phosphorylation of the enzyme at different sites."

Molecular hybridization assays used as probes full-length DNA copies of human α- and β-globin messenger RNA. The results of these hybridization assays demonstrated the expected amounts of α-globin mRNA and gene DNA, but absence of β-globin mRNA and absence of β-globin gene DNA. In the individual studied, hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin is associated with total deletion of the β-globin structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W2013388921,"A cell-free protein-synthesizing system, containing an S-100 fraction from yeast, ribosomal subunits from Krebs ascites cells, and ribosome initiation factors from rabbit reticulocytes, translates yeast, adenovirus, and rabbit globin messenger RNAs and the RNA from bacteriophage Qbeta. An amber mutation in the Qbeta synthetase gene is suppressed in vitro if the S-100 fraction s from yeast strains carrying amber suppressor mutations. Suppressor SUP6-2 gives 16% suppression, and the recessive lethal suppressor RL-1 gives 50% suppression. Extracts from strain FM6, which has the ochre suppressor SUP4-1, give a longer protein product from the normal synthetase gene at Qbeta with an efficiency of 63%. This implies that UAA is the terminator for the synthetase gene, and that synthesis of this read through protein can be used as an assay for ochre suppression. Suppression in each of these cases is mediated by tRNA, since pufified tRNA is the only fraction from suppressing strains that is required in an otherwise nonsuppressing cell-free system."
https://openalex.org/W1487675571,"The proteins of the small subunit of rat liver ribosomes were separated into five groups by stepwise elution from carboxymethylcellulose with LiCl at pH 6.5 (Collatz, E., Lin, A., Stoffler, G., Tsurugi, K., and Wool, I.G., (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1808-1816). From the several groups, 12 proteins (S2,S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S13, S23/S24, S27, and S28) wereisolated by ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose, by chromatography on sulfopropyl-Sephadex, and by gel filtration through Sephadex G-75. The amount of protein obtained varied from 1 to 9 mg depending on the number of steps required for the preparation; several proteins had no detectable contamination and the impurities in the others were no greater than 9%. The molecular weight of the proteins was estimated by polyazrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate; the amino acid composition was determined."
https://openalex.org/W2050528548,"Polysomal RNA from cultured sublines of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells directed protein synthesis in an in vitro system derived from wheat germ extract. One product of the in vitro synthesis was dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), as confirmed by methotrexate-substituted Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of the proteins labeled with 35S-methionine. The DHFR synthesized in vitro comigrates in the gel with authentic BHK DHFR, indicating that the molecular weights and structures of the in vivo and in vitro enzymes are probably the same. Polysomal RNA obtained from the methotrexate-resistant BHK subline (A5), which possesses some 140 times higher DHFR levels than the methotrexate-sensitive parents subline (B1), directed the synthesis of approximately 70 times more DHFR per unit of total in vitro synthesized protein than did B1 polysomal RNA. Assuming then that the rates of translation of A5 and B1 DHFR mRNAs in the wheat germ cell-free system are the same, our results show that a major part of the high DHFR levels observed in A5 cells is due to the presence of elevated quantities of DHFR mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1484196488,"Horse liver aldehyde dehydrogenase, like other aldehyde dehydrogenases, is capable of hydrolyzing esters such as nitrophenyl acetate. Pre-steady state and burst kinetics were performed using substrate levels of enzyme to determine whether the rate-limiting step occurred prior to or after the formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate. A burst was found by both techniques for the dehydrogenase reaction; but no burst was found for the esterase reaction. These data show that the rate-limiting step for the two reactions catalyzed by the enzyme differs. For dehydrogenase it occurs after the formation of the acyl intermediate, but for esterase it occurs prior to its formation."
https://openalex.org/W1563592346,"Pyridoxal phosphate and salicylaldehyde were used as protein-labeling probes to study the organization of membrane proteins in the intact myelin sheath of the cat dorsal column. Both reagents react with protein amino groups to form Schiff's bases which can be reduced with NaB3H4. The relatively membrane-impermeant pyridoxal phosphate labels all proteins of the intact myelin except basic protein. This major protein of myelin is labeled only after loss of membrane integrity. The relatively membrane-permeant probe, salicylaldehyde, was then used to establish that the basic protein is truly located on the cytoplasmic side of the myelin bilayer, and not merely sequestered within the multiple lamellar structure of the sheath. All proteins in the intact myelin are readily labeled by this reagent, with the label distribution pattern identical to that of disrupted myelin fragments. These data suggest a model for myelin structure in which the basic protein is the only major protein component located exclusively on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (the major period zone of the sheath), with the other major proteins disposed wholly, or in part, in the extracellular half of the membrane bilayer (the intraperiod zone). All proteins, although asymmetrically disposed with respect to membrane sidedness, appear to be randomly distributed throughout the lamellae which comprise the sheath."
https://openalex.org/W1486672919,"Mannose-labeled glycopeptides were prepared from human diploid fibroblasts harvested by brief pronase digestion. Combined use of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and D converted most of the mannose-label into arrays of oligosaccharides. They were separated by paper chromatography and were characterized by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography, by affinity column chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, and by successive digestion with alpha-mannosidase and beta-mannosidase. The results indicated that mannose residues existed as clusters of various sizes, which we refer to as cores. The large oligomannosyl cores (approximately 7 to 8 mannosyl residues) were predominant in the glycopeptides from growing cells and were preferentially associated with neutral glycopeptides, similar to Unit A glycopeptides of thyroglobulin (mannose-N-acetylglucosamine unit). In glycopeptides from nongrowing cells, the ratio of the large oligomannosyl cores decreased, accompanying the increase of a small oligommanosyl core consisting of 3 mannosyl residues. The small core was preferentially associated with acidic glycopeptides."

https://openalex.org/W2040069632,"Aaron J. Shatkin and Gerald W. Both Roche Institute of Molecular Biology Nutley, New Jersey 07110 Human reovirus type 3 is the prototype of a widely distributed group of animal, plant, and insect viruses that contain double-stranded RNA genomes (Joklik, 1974). In contrast to most viruses in the group, reovirus multiplies rapidly and yields high in- fectivity titers in a variety of mammalian tissue cul- ture cells. Consequently, the molecular biology of its replication under conditions of single-cycle growth has been studied intensively. Many of the biochemical properties defined for reovirus type 3 are common to other double-stranded RNA viruses. A singular characteristic of members of the group is the presence of a large genome that consists of a reproducible set of ten unique segments of dou- ble-stranded RNA (Shatkin, Sipe, and Loh, 1968; Bellamy and Joklik, 1967a; Watanabe, Millward, and Graham, 1968), each apparently specifying a single viral polypeptide (McDowell and Joklik, 1971; Mc- Dowell et al., 1972; Graziadei et al., 1973; Both, Lavi, and Shatkin, 1975). The double-stranded RNA is not used directly for viral protein synthesis, but is transcribed to form functional mRNA by a virion- associated RNA polymerase (Shatkin and Sipe, 1968a; Borsa and Graham, 1968). This enzyme syn- thesizes multiple copies of one strand of each genome segment; consequently, large quantities of single-stranded mRNA can be accumulated by in- cubating activated virions in vitro for long periods (Skehel and Joklik, 1969; Banerjee and Shatkin, 1970; Levin et al., 1970a). The mRNA species can be partially separated on the basis of their different molecular weights by velocity sedimentation or poly- acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Floyd, Stone, and Joklik, 1974). They represent monocistronic tran- scripts that contain no 3’-poly(A) (Stoltzfus, Shat- kin, and Banerjee, 1973), but are translated with ap- parent fidelity in cell-free, protein-synthesizing extracts prepared from many sources, including mouse L cells (Graziadei et al., 1973), rabbit reticu- locytes (McDowell et al., 1972) and wheat germ (Both et al., 1975a). The availability of in vitro sys- tems for studying the genetic expression of a rela- tively well defined animal virus genome at the levels of both transcription and translation has provided an opportunity to study some of the details of eu- caryotic mRNA formation and the relationship of mRNA structure to function. In addition to the pre- viously characterized virion-associated enzymes (Joklik, 1974; Shatkin, 1974a), it was recently found that purified reovirus contains mRNA “capping”"
https://openalex.org/W1583468563,"Antiserum to bovine serum albumin were used as a probe for native structure to study the process of refolding of denatured bovine serum albumin. Different antigenically active fragments that represent domains and subdomains of the molecule were isolated. Restricted populations of antibody to albumin were obtained by fractionating antisera to the native intact molecule on immunoadsorbents bearing these fragments. The restricted antibody populations were then used to probe the surface of the molecule during the refolding process. Some regions of the molecule refolded more rapidly than other regions. Isolated domains of albumin also refolded to native antigenic structure demonstrating that the entire polypeptide chain was not necessary for reformation of native structure. However, there does seem to be some interdomain influence on the rate of refolding of a particular domain within the intact protein."

Saturation-hybridization of in vitro labeled Ad 12 DNA (2-4 x 10(8) cpm/mug) with HE C19 DNA showed that 93-100% of viral DNA sequences are present in the transformed cell. Reassociation of Ad 12 32P-DNA in the presence of HE C19 DNA detected 8 viral genome equivalents per diploid quantity of cell DNA. REannealing each of the six Ad 12 EcoRl restriction DNA fragments with HE C19 DNA indicated that the sequences of each fragment are present in near equimolar quantities, 8-10.5 copies per cell. HE C19 DNA ""networks"" were prepared and shown to contain the same viral DNA sequences and in the same amounts as present in unfractionated transformed cell DNA; these data provide the first direct evidence that human adenovirus genes are covalently linked to cellular DNA. The presence of most, if not all, of the viral genes was demonstrated also in the Ad 12 hamster tumor cell line, HT-2. The pattern of integrated viral genes in these nonpermissive hamster cells transformed by Ad 12 is different from that described for cells transformed by group C and B human adenoviruses and for SV40."
https://openalex.org/W1647761057,"We have used an immunochemical approach to study the refolding of bovine serum albumin. Using antibody as a probe for return of native structure, we have been able to demonstrate the regeneration of native structure at several sites on the surface of the molecule. Using this technique, we have shown that the rate of refolding of reduced bovine serum albumin catalyzed by either glutathione or rat liver disulfide interchange enzyme is greater than the rate of air reoxidation of albumin. The half-regeneration times for albumin, however, are substantially greater than those obtained with smaller proteins that have fewer disulfide bonds. We have also demonstrated that the reoxidized monomers isolated at the end of the refolding process are immunologically identical to native monomers. In addition, the tryptophan fluorescence emission maxima were the same as that of the native monomers."

In this report we conclude that the defects is in NADH-coenzyme Q reductase (NADH oxidase), the first part of the electron transport chain. The conclusion is based on the following observations. (a) In this and in the earlier report we determined that the relevant enzymes of the Krebs cycle are present and active. (b) Oxygen consumption by isolated mitochondria is normal when driven by succinate and alpha-glycerolphosphate. (c) Difference spectra between reduced and oxidized forms indicate that all cytochromes are present and functional. (d) In contrast, substrates such as malate, glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and isocitrate which generate NADH do not stimulate oxygen consumption in mutant mitochondria. (e) A direct assay of the rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidase in Lubrol-treated mitochondria from mutant cells revealed less than one-tenth of the activity when compared with wild type mitochondria. (f) The treatment of wild type cells with rotenone, a specific inhibitor of NADH-CoQ reductase, yielded an exact phenocopy of the mutant by several criteria. This is the first report of a respiration-deficient mammalian cell mutant in tissue culture."
https://openalex.org/W1984882670,"Intracerebral injection of L-proline, 1 minute after one-trial avoidance training of chicks, impaired memory 24 hours later. Chicks injected with proline 1 or 4 hours after training and controls injected with L-isoleucine at intervals after training, showed no impairment of memory 24 hours after training. The retrograde impairment of long-term memory induced by proline occurred without the convulsions or electrographic events usually associated with retrograde amnesic treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1536362965,"An exonuclease, which hydrolyzes single-stranded DNA, has been purified from human placenta. It initiates hydrolysis at both the 3' and 5' termini of such DNA with equal facility, yielding 5'-phosphorylated oligonucleotides averaging 4 nucleotides in length. These oligonucleotides are released from both termini at equal rates with the same size distribution. Although not detectably active against intact native DNA, this enzyme can initiate hydrolysis at single-stranded breaks, creating a gap 30 to 40 nucleotides long. If a pyrimidine dimer is adjacent to this break, the enzyme, by virtue of its action at internal phosphodiester bonds, can excise such dimers. We refer to this exonuclease as human correxonuclease because of its excision capability."

https://openalex.org/W1538845485,"Histones, extractable non-histone proteins, and a tightly bound non-histone protein DNA complex were fractionated from chromatins which were isolated from estrogen-stimulated and hormone-withdrawn chick oviducts. Reconstitution of homologous constituents was performed and RNA was transcribed from these reconstituted chromatins using Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. DNA complementary to ovalbumin mRNA was then used as a hybridization probe to estimate the concentration of ovalbumin messenger RNA sequences in these in vitro transcripts. Our results demonstrated that 0.011% of the in vitro RNA transcripts produced from reconstituted estrogen-stimulated chromatin was ovalbumin mRNA sequences as compared to 0.0015% obtained for reconstituted hormone-withdrawn chromatin. Thus, the ratio of ovalbumin mRNA sequences in the in vitro transcripts of reconstituted stimulated and withdrawn chromatins was 8 to 1, identical with the value obtained from native estrogen-stimulated and hormone-withdrawn chromatins. Furthermore, the number of initiation sites for RNA synthesis on reconstituted and native chromatins are indistinguishable. Thus, the specificity of transcription of isolated chromatins appears to be conserved upon dissociation and fractionation of the chromatin proteins followed by reconstitution of these constituents to DNA. The effect of chromatin proteins on gene expression was further examined by reconstituting components from different development stages. Reconstitution of extractable non-histone proteins from estrogen-stimulated chromatins to tightly bound non-histone protein. DNA complexes from hormone-withdrawn chromatins resulted in the synthesis of a substantial amount of ovalbumin mRNA sequences. Conversely, when extractable non-histone proteins from withdrawn chromatins were reconstituted to tightly bound non-histone protein DNA complexes from estrogen-stimulated chromatins, very low levels of mRNAov sequences were detected. In contrast, interchange of the histones and tightly bound non-histone protein DNA complexes from hormone-withdrawn and estrogen-stimulated chromatins during reconstitution did not affect the level of mRNAOV sequences produced. Therefore, the extractable non-histone proteins of chromatin appear to be extremely important in regulating specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1994402604,"The messenger RNA for silk fibroin, labeled with 32PO4 and methyl-3H L-methionine, was purified to near homogeneity from the posterior silk gland of the silkworm Bombyx mori, and the sequence of a methylated, RNAase T2-resistant structure was determined. This sequence is similar structurally to 5′ terminal blocked and methylated sequences found on the total populations of polyadenylated eucaryotic cellular and certain viral mRNAs. The RNAase T2-resistant oligomer from fibroin mRNA was cleaved by nuclease P1 into three components: a blocked and methylated sequence containing three phosphates; a 2′-0-methyl UMP residue (pUm), and an unmethylated CMP (pC). The blocked and methylated sequence comigrated in three chromatographic systems with the blocked and methylated terminus of silkworm cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus mRNA, which has the structure m7GpppAm. The fibroin mRNA cap was cleaved by nucleotide pyrophosphatase to yield 7-methyl GMP (pm7G) and 2′-0-methyl AMP (pAm). This sequence also appeared to be terminally located, with the m7G joined by a 5′-5′ pyrophosphate linkage to the Am. It was concluded that the 5′ terminal sequence of fibroin mRNA molecules is m7G(5′)ppp(5′)AmpUmpCp. The regulation of expression of the highly specialized gene for fibroin is discussed in light of this finding."
https://openalex.org/W1983957064,Mice homozygous for the mutant gene quaking (qk) with a high frequency of axial tremors had a low concentration of copper in the brain. Supplementation during pregnancy and lactation with a high level of dietary copper greatly reduced the frequency of tremors and brought brain copper level to normal in the offspring. It is suggested that qk affects copper metabolism.
https://openalex.org/W1518938753,"The disulfide bonds that link together single collagen pro-alpha chains into trimers, prior to their secretion, were found to be synthesized after the pro-alpha chains were completed and released from polysomes and not while the pro-alpha chains were still nascent. After a 4- or 8-min incubation of cell cultures derived from embryonic chick sternum with [3H]proline, the nascent chains isolated from polysome preparations contained negligible amounts of disulfide-linked chains. After a 20-min incubation, some very large disulfide-linked material was found associated with the polysome preparation, but this material proved to be noncollagenous and also appeared to represent completed, and not nascent, chains. The presence of this proline-labeled species was confirmed in analyses of whole cell lysates, in which it is present as a mixture of monomers of approximately 290,000 molecular weight and disulfide-linked dimers. Pulse-chase experiments also gave results that were consistent with the conclusion that released single pro-alpha chains are the precursors of released disulfide-linked pro-alpha chains. Such experiments also showed that pro-alpha chains could continue to form disulfide-linked species in the presence of inhibitors of peptide chain elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1639814834,"Activity levels of three glycosyltransferases (UDP-D-xylose:core protein xylosyltransferase, UDP-D-galactose:D-xylose galactosyltransferase, and UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine: (GluUA-GalNAc-4-sulfate)3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase), which are involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, were measured during the development of chrondrocytes in monolayer culture. Maxima in enzyme specific activities occurred on Day 8 of culture and preceded the maximum rate of synthesis of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (Day 10) by 2 days. The activity of xylosyltransferase was lowered by treatment of cells with inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis, whereas the activities of the other two glycosyltransferases were relatively stable to treatments with these drugs. In the presence of puromycin, xylosyltransferase decayed with a half-life of 2 to 3 hours in rapidly growing cells, while galactosyltransferase decayed with a half-life or approximately 12 hours, indicating that the chrondroitin sulfate glycosyltransferases are not coordinately synthesized and degraded. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine also caused a greater decrease in xylosyltransferase activity than in the activities of the other two glycosyltransferases. The differential effect of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine on glycosyltransferase activity was also showm by correlating the residual enzyme activity with the potential for synthesis of chrondroitin sulfate chains as measured in the presence of beta-xylosides."

https://openalex.org/W1485343771,"The predominant protein in the embryonic chick lens, delta-crystallin, is composed of four subunits with molecular weights near 50,000. The degree to which these 4 polypeptides are the same or dissimilar was explored in delta crystallin purified from 15-day-old embryonic chick lenses by relating the numbers of methionine-containing tryptic peptides and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides derived from the native protein to the average number of methionine residues per subunit. Amino acid analyses indicated that 1 mol of native delta-crystallin contains approximately 32 methionine residues, leading to an average of 8 methionine residues per subunit. Approximately equal amounts of 8 methionine-containing tryptic peptides were resolved by two-dimensional thin layer separation on cellulose sheets and by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels. Nine CNBr peptides were resolved by a combination of electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels and chromatography on SDS-hydroxylapatite columns. The additive molecular weight of the 9 CNBr peptides was very close to the delta-crystallin subunit molecular weight of 50,000. Thus, the subunits of 15-day-old embryonic chick delta-crystallin have similar sequence of encoded amino acids."

Results of the sham treatment suggest that maternal stress induced by handling, rather than the nature of the substance injected, increased the susceptibility of the offspring to seizures."

Spermatozoa that had been treated with egg jelly to induce the acrosome reaction also failed to fertilize eggs in seawater free of magnesium.

https://openalex.org/W1510434454,"The differentiation of embryonic chick lens fibers is characterized by an increased rate of synthesis of the lens protein, delta-crystallin, and accumulation of delta-crystallin mRNA. In the present study, the number of delta-crystallin genes in lens and non-lens tissues of embryonic chicks has been determined to test whether the accumulation of delta-crystallin mRNA during lens fiber differentiation is associated with an amplification of delta-crystallin genes. DNA from embryonic chick lens fibers, embryonic chick lens epithelia, or whole chick embryos with the eyes removed, was annealed with [3H]DNA complementary to delta-crystallin mRNA. Analysis of the annealing reactions indicated that the sequences for delta-crystallin are in the unique fraction of the chick genome, and are not amplified in the lens during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1993195197,"After transplantation of MIT/F4 pituitary tumor cells to male rats of the Fisher strain, the masculine type of hepatic steroid metabolism was changed into a feminine pattern of enzyme activities. Liver metabolism of steroid hormones in female rats was relatively unaffected following transplantation of pituitary tumor cells. Furthermore, extract from MIT/F4 tumors and “autonomous” pituitary tissue increased the 5α-reductase activity of hepatoma cells in the culture (HTC cells) at subsaturation concentrations of the substrate 4-androstene-3, 17-dione by decreasing the apparent Km of the enzyme. It is concluded that the pituitary tumor (in accord with the secretion from an “autonomous” pituitary gland) secretes “feminotropin,” a novel hypophyseal principle that probably is an important regulator of hepatic steroid metabolism. It is suggested that pituitary tumor tissue of the MtT/F4 type could be used as source of feminotropin in purification studies."
https://openalex.org/W1538779457,"Mixing of native concanavalin A (Con A) and its dimeric succinylated derivative (succinyl-Con A) in glycine-HCl buffer, pH 4.5, resulted in the formation of a new chemical species that could be separated as a unique fraction by DEAE-cellulose chromatography or by gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of this new component, which contained the subunits (Mr= 26,000) of native Con A and its succinyl derivative in equimolar amounts, was 50,000 at both pH 5 and pH 7. These data suggest that subunit exchange between 2 chemically distinct Con A molecules yields a hybrid molecule consisting of one protomer of native Con A and one protomer of succinyl-Con A. Similar exchange reactions and hybrid molecules were also observed after mixing acetyl-Con A and succinyl-Con A. These procedures provide several new chemical variants of the Con A molecule that may be useful for the analysis of lectin-cell surface interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1496633871,"Effects of hydrogen-bonding interactions of amide groups on reactivity of esters to alpha-chymotrypsin were studied. Of the methyl esters studied, only that from acetyl-L-phenylalanine has k3 rate-limiting. In methyl beta-phenylpropionates an alpha-acetamido substituent increased k2 greater than 550 times, k3 approximately 5 times; an alpha-acetylclycyloxy substituent increased k2 approximately 2 times, k3 approximately 6 times, both in comparison with the alpha-acetoxy esters. Essentially all carboxamidomethyl esters studied have k3 rate-limiting; reactivity to hydroxide is only 4 times that of methyl esters. In alpha-substituted beta-phenylpropionates, carboxamido-methyl esters show k2 values greater than 110 times greater than 280 times, greater than 26 times, and 7 times the k2 values of the methyl esters for the alpha substituents, acetoxy, acetylglycyloxy, hydroxy, and hydrogen, respectively. In esters of alpha-acetamido acids, carboxamidomethyl esters show k2 values 44 times, greater than 110 times, greater than 12 times, and approximately 33 times the k2 values of the methyl esters of glycine, alanine, leucine, and phenylalanine, respectively. Cyanomethyl esters also had k3 rate-limiting. Hydrogen-bonding to the enzyme of either an alpha-acetamido group or a carboxamidomethyl group combined with bonding of the beta-aryl group, orients the hydrolyzing groups properly, increasing k2. Hydrogen-bonding of both alpha-acetamido and carboxamido-methyl groups is effective to a lesser degree. The amide group appears to have small effects on Ks as hydrogen bonding is balanced by desolvation. It is proposed that desolvation during bonding increases k2 and Ks."
