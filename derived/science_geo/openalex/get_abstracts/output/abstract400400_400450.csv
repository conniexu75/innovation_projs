https://openalex.org/W1963904011,"Macrophages are abundant in tumours, where they promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. Jeffrey Pollard and colleagues now identify inflammatory monocytes as a precursor population for the macrophages that promote breast cancer metastasis to the lung or bone. These cells are recruited through the cytokine CCL2 and promote tumour-cell extravasation (by producing the signal protein VEGF) and the seeding of metastases. These findings can explain the poor prognosis for breast cancer patients with elevated expression of CCL2. Macrophages, which are abundant in the tumour microenvironment, enhance malignancy1. At metastatic sites, a distinct population of metastasis-associated macrophages promotes the extravasation, seeding and persistent growth of tumour cells2. Here we define the origin of these macrophages by showing that Gr1-positive inflammatory monocytes are preferentially recruited to pulmonary metastases but not to primary mammary tumours in mice. This process also occurs for human inflammatory monocytes in pulmonary metastases of human breast cancer cells. The recruitment of these inflammatory monocytes, which express CCR2 (the receptor for chemokine CCL2), as well as the subsequent recruitment of metastasis-associated macrophages and their interaction with metastasizing tumour cells, is dependent on CCL2 synthesized by both the tumour and the stroma. Inhibition of CCL2–CCR2 signalling blocks the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, inhibits metastasis in vivo and prolongs the survival of tumour-bearing mice. Depletion of tumour-cell-derived CCL2 also inhibits metastatic seeding. Inflammatory monocytes promote the extravasation of tumour cells in a process that requires monocyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor. CCL2 expression and macrophage infiltration are correlated with poor prognosis and metastatic disease in human breast cancer3,4,5,6. Our data provide the mechanistic link between these two clinical associations and indicate new therapeutic targets for treating metastatic breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2070772918,"A significant bottleneck in cardiovascular regenerative medicine is the identification of a viable source of stem/progenitor cells that could contribute new muscle after ischaemic heart disease and acute myocardial infarction. A therapeutic ideal--relative to cell transplantation--would be to stimulate a resident source, thus avoiding the caveats of limited graft survival, restricted homing to the site of injury and host immune rejection. Here we demonstrate in mice that the adult heart contains a resident stem or progenitor cell population, which has the potential to contribute bona fide terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction. We reveal a novel genetic label of the activated adult progenitors via re-expression of a key embryonic epicardial gene, Wilm's tumour 1 (Wt1), through priming by thymosin β4, a peptide previously shown to restore vascular potential to adult epicardium-derived progenitor cells with injury. Cumulative evidence indicates an epicardial origin of the progenitor population, and embryonic reprogramming results in the mobilization of this population and concomitant differentiation to give rise to de novo cardiomyocytes. Cell transplantation confirmed a progenitor source and chromosome painting of labelled donor cells revealed transdifferentiation to a myocyte fate in the absence of cell fusion. Derived cardiomyocytes are shown here to structurally and functionally integrate with resident muscle; as such, stimulation of this adult progenitor pool represents a significant step towards resident-cell-based therapy in human ischaemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2030959471,"Central to quantum theory, the wavefunction is the complex distribution used to completely describe a quantum system. Despite its fundamental role, it is typically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit definition. Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the wavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities via the Born Rule. Presently, scientists determine the wavefunction through tomographic methods, which estimate the wavefunction that is most consistent with a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods compounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the wavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two complementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first measurement is performed in a gentle way (i.e. weak measurement) so as not to invalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of the wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an experimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction of a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that the concept is universal, being applicable both to other degrees of freedom of the photon (e.g. polarization, frequency, etc.) and to other quantum systems (e.g. electron spin-z quantum state, SQUIDs, trapped ions, etc.). Consequently, this method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in terms of a specific set of experimental operations. We expect it to expand the range of quantum systems scientists are able to characterize and initiate new avenues to understand fundamental quantum theory."
https://openalex.org/W2806760348,"A new study identifies the bone marrow haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche — a specialized microenvironment where stem cells reside — as an immune privileged site. This property is known to exist in the testis, ovary and hair follicle but has not been universally demonstrated in all stem cell niches. High-resolution in vivo imaging shows the accumulation of regulatory T cells in the HSC niche, enabling transplanted allo-HSCs to escape from allogeneic rejection. As well as supporting stem-cell function, the niche may provide a relative sanctuary from immune attack that could extend to malignant cells in some instances. Stem cells reside in a specialized regulatory microenvironment or niche1,2, where they receive appropriate support for maintaining self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capacity1,2,3. The niche may also protect stem cells from environmental insults3 including cytotoxic chemotherapy and perhaps pathogenic immunity4. The testis, hair follicle and placenta are all sites of residence for stem cells and are immune-suppressive environments, called immune-privileged sites, where multiple mechanisms cooperate to prevent immune attack, even enabling prolonged survival of foreign allografts without immunosuppression4. We sought to determine if somatic stem-cell niches more broadly are immune-privileged sites by examining the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) niche1,2,5,6,7 in the bone marrow, a site where immune reactivity exists8,9. We observed persistence of HSPCs from allogeneic donor mice (allo-HSPCs) in non-irradiated recipient mice for 30 days without immunosuppression with the same survival frequency compared to syngeneic HSPCs. These HSPCs were lost after the depletion of FoxP3 regulatory T (Treg) cells. High-resolution in vivo imaging over time demonstrated marked co-localization of HSPCs with Treg cells that accumulated on the endosteal surface in the calvarial and trabecular bone marrow. Treg cells seem to participate in creating a localized zone where HSPCs reside and where Treg cells are necessary for allo-HSPC persistence. In addition to processes supporting stem-cell function, the niche will provide a relative sanctuary from immune attack."
https://openalex.org/W2095319512,"Supernovae (SNe) are stellar explosions driven by gravitational or thermonuclear energy, observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeks or more. In all known SNe, this radiation comes from internal energy deposited in the outflowing ejecta by either radioactive decay of freshly-synthesized elements (typically 56Ni), stored heat deposited by the explosion shock in the envelope of a supergiant star, or interaction between the SN debris and slowly-moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. Here we report on a new class of luminous SNe whose observed properties cannot be explained by any of these known processes. These include four new SNe we have discovered, and two previously unexplained events (SN 2005ap; SCP 06F6) that we can now identify as members. These SNe are all ~10 times brighter than SNe Ia, do not show any trace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (UV) flux for extended periods of time, and have late-time decay rates which are inconsistent with radioactivity. Our data require that the observed radiation is emitted by hydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (~10^15 cm) and expanding at high velocities (>10^4 km s^-1). These long-lived, UV-luminous events can be observed out to redshifts z>4 and offer an excellent opportunity to study star formation in, and the interstellar medium of, primitive distant galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2043369736,"The ability of insects to learn and navigate to specific locations in the environment has fascinated naturalists for decades. The impressive navigational abilities of ants, bees, wasps and other insects demonstrate that insects are capable of visual place learning, but little is known about the underlying neural circuits that mediate these behaviours. Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) is a powerful model organism for dissecting the neural circuitry underlying complex behaviours, from sensory perception to learning and memory. Drosophila can identify and remember visual features such as size, colour and contour orientation. However, the extent to which they use vision to recall specific locations remains unclear. Here we describe a visual place learning platform and demonstrate that Drosophila are capable of forming and retaining visual place memories to guide selective navigation. By targeted genetic silencing of small subsets of cells in the Drosophila brain, we show that neurons in the ellipsoid body, but not in the mushroom bodies, are necessary for visual place learning. Together, these studies reveal distinct neuroanatomical substrates for spatial versus non-spatial learning, and establish Drosophila as a powerful model for the study of spatial memories."

https://openalex.org/W1986551392,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major medical problem. Antiviral treatment is only partially effective and a vaccine does not exist. Development of more effective therapies has been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Although xenotransplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hepatocytes has shown promise, these models are subject to important challenges. Building on the previous observation that CD81 and occludin comprise the minimal human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry in vitro, we attempted murine humanization via a genetic approach. Here we show that expression of two human genes is sufficient to allow HCV infection of fully immunocompetent inbred mice. We establish a precedent for applying mouse genetics to dissect viral entry and validate the role of scavenger receptor type B class I for HCV uptake. We demonstrate that HCV can be blocked by passive immunization, as well as showing that a recombinant vaccinia virus vector induces humoral immunity and confers partial protection against heterologous challenge. This system recapitulates a portion of the HCV life cycle in an immunocompetent rodent for the first time, opening opportunities for studying viral pathogenesis and immunity and comprising an effective platform for testing HCV entry inhibitors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1994450611,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated from somatic cells by the transgenic expression of three transcription factors collectively called OSK: Oct3/4 (also called Pou5f1), Sox2 and Klf4. However, the conversion to iPSCs is inefficient. The proto-oncogene Myc enhances the efficiency of iPSC generation by OSK but it also increases the tumorigenicity of the resulting iPSCs. Here we show that the Gli-like transcription factor Glis1 (Glis family zinc finger 1) markedly enhances the generation of iPSCs from both mouse and human fibroblasts when it is expressed together with OSK. Mouse iPSCs generated using this combination of transcription factors can form germline-competent chimaeras. Glis1 is enriched in unfertilized oocytes and in embryos at the one-cell stage. DNA microarray analyses show that Glis1 promotes multiple pro-reprogramming pathways, including Myc, Nanog, Lin28, Wnt, Essrb and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition. These results therefore show that Glis1 effectively promotes the direct reprogramming of somatic cells during iPSC generation."
https://openalex.org/W2030800943,"Cyclin D1 has a crucial role in the cell cycle and is often overexpressed in cancer. Piotr Sicinski and colleagues report an unexpected function for cyclin D1 in DNA repair that is independent of its known CDK-dependent role. Cyclin D1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage and binds to RAD51, a key DNA recombinase that drives the homologous recombination process. This function for cyclin D1 also operates in retinoblastoma protein (pRB)-negative human cancer, suggesting that targeting cyclin D1 may be beneficial in this condition. Cyclin D1 is a component of the core cell cycle machinery1. Abnormally high levels of cyclin D1 are detected in many human cancer types2. To elucidate the molecular functions of cyclin D1 in human cancers, we performed a proteomic screen for cyclin D1 protein partners in several types of human tumours. Analyses of cyclin D1 interactors revealed a network of DNA repair proteins, including RAD51, a recombinase that drives the homologous recombination process3. We found that cyclin D1 directly binds RAD51, and that cyclin D1–RAD51 interaction is induced by radiation. Like RAD51, cyclin D1 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a BRCA2-dependent fashion. Reduction of cyclin D1 levels in human cancer cells impaired recruitment of RAD51 to damaged DNA, impeded the homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, and increased sensitivity of cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. This effect was seen in cancer cells lacking the retinoblastoma protein, which do not require D-cyclins for proliferation4,5. These findings reveal an unexpected function of a core cell cycle protein in DNA repair and suggest that targeting cyclin D1 may be beneficial also in retinoblastoma-negative cancers which are currently thought to be unaffected by cyclin D1 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2070587415,"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib have been widely used in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Unfortunately, the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs is limited because of natural and acquired resistance. As a novel cytoprotective mechanism for tumor cell to survive under unfavorable conditions, autophagy has been proposed to play a role in drug resistance of tumor cells. Whether autophagy can be activated by gefitinib or erlotinib and thereby impair the sensitivity of targeted therapy to lung cancer cells remains unknown. Here, we first report that gefitinib or erlotinib can induce a high level of autophagy, which was accompanied by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, cytotoxicity induced by gefitinib or erlotinib was greatly enhanced after autophagy inhibition by the pharmacological inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and siRNAs targeting ATG5 and ATG7, the most important components for the formation of autophagosome. Interestingly, EGFR-TKIs can still induce cell autophagy even after EGFR expression was reduced by EGFR specific siRNAs. In conclusion, we found that autophagy can be activated by EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer cells and inhibition of autophagy augmented the growth inhibitory effect of EGFR-TKIs. Autophagy inhibition thus represents a promising approach to improve the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in the treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2032911882,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a self-renewing population of cells that continuously replenish all blood and immune cells during the lifetime of an individual. HSCs are used clinically to treat a wide array of diseases, including acute leukaemias and congenital blood disorders, but obtaining suitable numbers of cells and finding immune-compatible donors remain serious problems. These difficulties have led to an interest in the conversion of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells into HSCs, which is not possible using current methodologies. To accomplish this goal, it is critical to understand the native mechanisms involved in the specification of HSCs during embryonic development. Here we demonstrate in zebrafish that Wnt16 controls a novel genetic regulatory network required for HSC specification. Non-canonical signalling by Wnt16 is required for somitic expression of the Notch ligands deltaC (dlc) and deltaD (dld), and these ligands are, in turn, required for the establishment of definitive haematopoiesis. Notch signalling downstream of Dlc and Dld is earlier than, and distinct from, known cell-autonomous requirements for Notch, strongly suggesting that novel Notch-dependent relay signal(s) induce the first HSCs in parallel to other established pathways. Our results demonstrate that somite-specific gene expression is required for the production of haemogenic endothelium."

https://openalex.org/W2063754694,"The presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn), particularly in its amyloid form, is widely recognized for its involvement in Parkinson disease (PD). Recent genetic studies reveal that mutations in the gene GBA are the most widespread genetic risk factor for parkinsonism identified to date. GBA encodes for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD). In this work, we investigated the possibility of a physical linkage between α-syn and GCase, examining both wild type and the GD-related N370S mutant enzyme. Using fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we determined that α-syn and GCase interact selectively under lysosomal solution conditions (pH 5.5) and mapped the interaction site to the α-syn C-terminal residues, 118-137. This α-syn-GCase complex does not form at pH 7.4 and is stabilized by electrostatics, with dissociation constants ranging from 1.2 to 22 μm in the presence of 25 to 100 mm NaCl. Intriguingly, the N370S mutant form of GCase has a reduced affinity for α-syn, as does the inhibitor conduritol-β-epoxide-bound enzyme. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies verified this interaction in human tissue and neuronal cell culture, respectively. Although our data do not preclude protein-protein interactions in other cellular milieux, we suggest that the α-syn-GCase association is favored in the lysosome, and that this noncovalent interaction provides the groundwork to explore molecular mechanisms linking PD with mutant GBA alleles."

However, recognition side chains in a PUM repeat for cytosine are unknown. Here we report identification of a cytosine-recognition code by screening random amino acid combinations at conserved RNA recognition positions using a yeast three-hybrid system. This C-recognition code is specific and modular as specificity can be transferred to different positions in the RNA recognition sequence. A crystal structure of a modified PUF domain reveals specific contacts between an arginine side chain and the cytosine base. We applied the C-recognition code to design PUF domains that recognize targets with multiple cytosines and to generate engineered splicing factors that modulate alternative splicing. Finally, we identified a divergent yeast PUF protein, Nop9p, that may recognize natural target RNAs with cytosine. This work deepens our understanding of natural PUF protein target recognition and expands the ability to engineer PUF domains to recognize any RNA sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2028739654,"The primary site of mercury-induced injury is the kidney due to uptake of the reactive Hg2+-conjugated organic anions in the proximal tubule. Here, we investigated the in vivo role of Oat1 (organic anion transporter 1; originally NKT (Lopez-Nieto, C. E., You, G., Bush, K. T., Barros, E. J., Beier, D. R., and Nigam, S. K. (1997) J. Biol.

Mercury-induced nephrotoxicity was observed in a wild-type model. We then used the Oat1 knock-out to determine in vivo whether the renal injury effects of mercury are mediated by Oat1. Most of the renal injury (both histologically and biochemically as measured by blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) was abolished following HgCl2 treatment of Oat1 knock-outs. Thus, acute kidney injury by HgCl2 was found to be mediated mainly by Oat1. Our findings raise the possibility that pharmacological modulation of the expression and/or function of Oat1 might be an effective therapeutic strategy for reducing renal injury by mercury.

Environmental exposure to mercury represents a major threat in an increasingly industrialized world. Children exposed to high levels of the metal before and after birth suffer from chorea, ataxia, seizures, tremors, and mental retardation (2Lee R. Middleton D. Caldwell K. Dearwent S. Jones S.

The ingestion of mercury-contaminated seafood represents the major source of exposure, although other sources such as many manufacturing processes, salvaging of electronics, and mining practices (particularly in the developing world) contribute to the accumulation of heavy metals in the environment. Metallic mercury, methyl mercury, and ethyl mercury are neurotoxic compounds that can be converted in the body to inorganic mercury, which is highly nephrotoxic. Mercuric (Hg2+) ions are found in the plasma primarily as conjugates of thiol-containing biomolecules such as glutathione, cysteine, homocysteine, N-acetylcysteine, and albumin. Mercuric S-conjugates of these thiols are considered primary substrates for transport by the proximal tubule cells of the kidney (4Zalups R.K. Pharmacol.

Although the renal transport of mercury and the mechanism of renal toxicity are not well characterized, accumulating evidence suggests that the uptake is mediated, at least in part, via the organic anion transporter system (6Bridges C.C.

Moreover, p-aminohippurate (a high affinity competitive substrate transported by this organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger) and probenecid (an Oat1 inhibitor) can block the uptake of mercuric conjugates (13Lungkaphin A.

In this study, we investigated the mercury-induced renal injury in both rats and Oat1−/− mice by intraperitoneal administration of 4 mg/kg of body weight of HgCl2. Our results indicate that, although the rodents are susceptible to mercury, mice deficient in Oat1 due to genetic deletion are largely protected from the mercury-induced kidney injury. This is consistent with the notion that Oat1 is the major transporter mediating cellular uptake of mercuric conjugates and provides direct genetic evidence implicating Oat1 in the renal injury from HgCl2 by mediating its transport into the proximal tubular cells. Wistar Rats (110–150 days of age) were treated with a single injection (intraperitoneal) of HgCl2 at a nephrotoxic dose of 4 mg/kg of body weight (w/v in 1 ml of saline/kg; HgCl2 group, n = 4) (4Zalups R.K. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 113-143PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) and were approved by the local animal ethics committee. Controls (control group, n = 4) received the vehicle alone (1 ml of saline/kg). Urine volumes were collected for 18 h after the injection in metabolic cages. Blood was collected, and kidneys were decapsulated, weighed, and processed for histopathological studies. The volume of urine was determined by gravimetry. The plasma was separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 3 min). Creatinine concentrations were determined in urine and plasma samples.

Creatinine clearance was calculated by conventional formulas for each animal. blood urea nitrogen. Mice between 12 and 20 weeks of age (matched within 2 weeks) with the Oat1 null allele were backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice for a total of 10 generations. Oat1 knock-out mice and wild-type C57BL/6J controls were used in the experiments described. After 18 h of HgCl2 treatment as described above, urine, blood, and tissues were collected. The plasma was separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 3 min). BUN concentrations were assayed in plasma samples employing commercial kits (QuantiChromTM, BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA). Kidneys were rinsed with 0.9% saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, transferred to 70% ethanol, processed, and finally embedded in paraffin. 5-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination using a light microscope. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were analytical grade. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test. When variances were not homogeneous, Welch's correction was employed. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. A substantial body of evidence indicates that mercuric conjugates are the major form in which mercury is transported by the kidney (Table 1). Nevertheless, a major environmental source is inorganic mercury, even though it is believed to be eliminated as mercury organic conjugates transported predominantly by Oat1 (see “Discussion”). HgCl2 treatment is a well established model for studying this process in vivo (11Zalups R.K. Ahmad S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Di Giusto G. Anzai N. Ruiz M.L. Endou H. Torres A.M. Arch. Toxicol. 2009; 83: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, treatment of rats with HgCl2 significantly increased plasma BUN levels (Table 2), suggesting impairment of renal function. In addition, blood and urine chemistry analyses revealed significant renal disturbance under the HgCl2-treated conditions. When both HgCl2-treated and vehicle-treated rats were placed in metabolic cages for 18 h immediately following the injection, significantly reduced amounts of urine were excreted by the HgCl2-treated rats versus the controls treated with vehicle alone. This was accompanied by a reduction in the clearance of creatinine, further supporting the notion that HgCl2 treatment results in renal impairment. Fig. 1 shows that the ratio of kidney weight to body weight was increased (Fig. 1A) and that the urine volume (Fig. 1B) and clearance of creatinine (Fig. 1C) were decreased in the HgCl2-treated rats.TABLE 1Known mercuric conjugates that are substrates for OAT1SubstrateAssayTransporterKmRef.μmCys-S-Hg-S-CysMDCK IIhOAT19111Zalups R.K.

Open table in a new tab To confirm that the physiological disturbance observed was of renal tubular origin, kidneys from both the HgCl2-treated and control rats were examined histologically. Examination of hematoxylin/eosin-stained rat kidney slices 18 h after HgCl2 treatment revealed dilated tubular lumina, disrupted tubular basement membranes, sloughing of cells, and intratubular cast formation (Fig. 2), suggesting early stages of tubular necrosis that are consistent with acute kidney injury. When the relative diameter of the lumen was measured, significant increases in the width of the lumen in tubules was found in HgCl2-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated controls. Thus, histopathological data are consistent with pathophysiological analyses showing that a single dose of 4 mg of HgCl2/kg of body weight is sufficient to cause proximal tubular injury within 18 h. The kidney is a primary target organ of mercury injury. Studies in vitro have suggested that mercury-induced renal injury could be mediated by organic anion transporters (10Zalups R.K. Ahmad S. Kidney Int. 2005; 68: 1684-1699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Zalups R.K. Ahmad S. J. Am. Soc.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We thus sought to confirm this in vivo by treating mice deficient in Oat1 with HgCl2 in a manner similar to that described above for rats. The Oat1 coding sequences in mice and rats are extremely similar (17Wu W. Baker M.E. Eraly S.A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 38: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and it is known that similar substrates are transported (18VanWert A.L. Gionfriddo M.R. Sweet D.H. Biopharm. Drug Dispos. 2010; 31: 1-71PubMed Google Scholar). As in the case of the rat, treatment of wild-type mice with 4 mg of HgCl2/kg of body weight (intraperitoneal) led to a significant increase in the ratio of kidney weight to body weight (Fig. 3A). In addition, significant increases in plasma BUN levels were also observed in wild-type (C57/BL6) mice following HgCl2 treatment (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with the phenotypes observed in rats upon similar treatment. To obtain direct evidence regarding the role of Oat1 in the renal injury induced by mercury, Oat1/Slc22a6 knock-outs (backcrossed to C57/BL6) were subjected to treatment with 4 mg of HgCl2/kg of body weight (intraperitoneal; same conditions as for the wild-type mice; see above). Following treatment with HgCl2, there was a slight increase in the ratio of kidney weight to body weight in Oat1-deficient mice compared with vehicle-treated wild-type mice. However, this increase was much smaller than that observed in HgCl2-treated wild-type mice (Fig. 3A). In contrast to wild-type mice treated with HgCl2, no significant increase in the plasma BUN level was observed in Oat1−/− mice treated with HgCl2 (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that mercury-induced renal insufficiency is markedly reduced in mice deficient in Oat1/Slc22a6. Histopathological damage as assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining of kidney sections revealed a marked difference in the pattern of renal injury between wild-type and Oat1 knock-out mice (Fig. 4). The wild-type kidneys showed proximal tubular necrosis characterized by dilated tubular lumina with retention of urine and loss of the epithelial brush border with pyknotic nuclei. These signs of renal injury were virtually undetectable in the Oat1 knock-out kidneys (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Our functional and histopathological data indicate that Oat1/Slc22a6 is a direct mediator of mercury renal injury and that its deletion in Oat1−/− mice is responsible for the remarkable reduction in HgCl2-induced proximal tubular necrosis (Fig. 6).FIGURE 5A and B, high magnification hematoxylin and eosin images demonstrating tubular structures in WT (A) and Oat1 knock-out (B) kidneys after HgCl2 treatment.

In this study, a single injury dose of HgCl2 induced significant renal impairment in rodents. This HgCl2-induced renal insufficiency is caused by proximal tubular injury mediated mainly by the renal organic anion transporter Oat1/Slc22a6. Inorganic mercury has been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant; nevertheless, it is still used in some batteries and continues to be an essential component of fluorescent light bulbs (20Clarkson T.W. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 100: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). People can be exposed to mercury through contaminated water and food (21Magos L. Clarkson T.W. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 2006; 43: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Moreover, different mercury species (vapor, inorganic mercury, and methyl mercury) have been associated with human contamination in gold-mining areas (22Steckling N. Boese-O'Reilly S. Gradel C.

Total Environ. 2001; 267: 151-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Renal proximal tubular cells represent the primary target site where highly reactive mercuric ions rapidly accumulate and induce cell injury by binding to and inhibiting various sulfhydryl-containing enzymes (4Zalups R.K. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 113-143PubMed Google Scholar). Complex factors may account for this susceptibility, including the selective presence of specific transport systems involved in the uptake of mercuric ions by particular cell populations (6Bridges C.C. Zalups R.K. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 2010; 13: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The extraction of mercury from renal tubular cells does not appear to involve glomerular filtration but rather a direct secretory process whereby mercury moves from peritubular blood into the tubular lumen (24Zalups R.K. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health A. 1998; 53: 615-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mercury is believed to access proximal tubular cells primarily via the organic anion transporters found on the basolateral plasma membrane (12Aslamkhan A.G. Han Y.H. Yang X.P. Zalups R.K.

Oat1 is expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, where it plays an important role in the elimination of numerous organic anions of physiological (25Wikoff W.R. Nagle M.A. Kouznetsova V.L.

Although we have detected inhibition by HgCl2 of the transport of 6-carboxyfluorescein (an Oat1 substrate), the in vivo physiological relevance of this finding and whether inorganic mercury is a true Oat1 substrate are not clear (data not shown). The bulk of published evidence supports the view that inorganic mercury is converted to an organic form before being transported by Oat1. In vitro assays indicate that Oat1 mediates the uptake of a number of mercuric conjugates, including homocysteine, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, and glutathione (Table 1) (10Zalups R.K. Ahmad S.

For example, the observed increase in kidney weight (presumably due to edema) (27Di Giusto G. Anzai N. Endou H. Torres A.M. Pharmacology. 2008; 81: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Villar S.R. Brandoni A. Anzai N. Endou H. Torres A.M.

In addition, other parameters of renal function perturbed by HgCl2 treatment were also less affected in the Oat1 knock-out mice. For example, BUN levels were largely similar to control levels, whereas histological parameters (35Di Giusto G. Torres A.M. Arch. Toxicol. 2010; 84: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36Stacchiotti A. Borsani E. Ricci F. Lavazza A. Rezzani R. Bianchi R. Rodella L.F. Toxicol.

Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F910-F918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were largely unchanged in the Oat1−/− kidney following HgCl2 treatment. These differences in renal injury are striking and indicate that Oat1 is the main transporter responsible for HgCl2-induced renal injury. This is also one of the most impressive phenotypes reported in the Oat1 knock-out. It is worth noting that the expression of Oat3 is somewhat reduced in the Oat1 knock-out kidney, but this appears to be physiologically insignificant based upon analysis of Oat3-selective substrates in knock-outs (7Eraly S.A. Vallon V. Vaughn D.A. Gangoiti J.A. Richter K. Nagle M. Monte J.C. Rieg T. Truong D.M. Long J.M. Barshop B.A. Kaler G. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although Oat3 transport of mercury in vitro has been reported, it remains possible, although unlikely, that some of the observed protection was due to somewhat decreased Oat3 expression. The expression of other Slc22 family members is unchanged (40Vallon V. Rieg T. Ahn S.Y. Wu W. Eraly S.A. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F867-F873Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro evidence suggests that Oat1 is the primary mediator of proximal tubular basolateral uptake of mercuric conjugates. On the other hand, several transporters, including multidrug resistance-associated proteins of the ABCC gene family, have been suggested to mediate the mercury excretion at the apical membrane of the proximal tubules. However, our previous analysis of ABCC gene family expression did not reveal significant alterations in the Oat1 knock-out kidneys (40Vallon V. Rieg T. Ahn S.Y. Wu W. Eraly S.A. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F867-F873Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In summary, in the study, we demonstrated that a single dose of HgCl2 can cause acute kidney injury in both rats and mice, which is mediated mainly by injury to the proximal tubule. This injury is directly linked to the organic anion transporter Oat1 based on in vivo and in vitro studies. The fact that mercury-induced acute kidney injury is directly linked to Oat1 expression may be useful for developing biological protection against toxic effects exerted by mercury or by specific forms of mercury. Pharmacological modulation of the expression and/or function of Oat1 (such as the use of specific inhibitors) might be an effective therapeutic strategy for reducing kidney injury due to mercury.

https://openalex.org/W2152632376,"The SAINTS (SN 1987A Intensive Study) team has been observing the nearby supernova SN 1987A using the Hubble Space Telescope for 17 years. They have been rewarded with a view of a phase in the life of a supernova that has never previously been observed — the point at which the energy emitted comes from interactions between the ejecta and the surrounding medium. This source took over from the initial flash of light from shock heating, and a period of decades during which the decay of radioactive elements was the prime energy source. The Hubble data suggest that an increase in the brightness of SN 1987A since 2001 is the result of heat from X-rays produced as the ejecta interacts with the surrounding material. When a massive star explodes as a supernova, substantial amounts of radioactive elements—primarily 56Ni, 57Ni and 44Ti—are produced1. After the initial flash of light from shock heating, the fading light emitted by the supernova is due to the decay of these elements2. However, after decades, the energy powering a supernova remnant comes from the shock interaction between the ejecta and the surrounding medium3. The transition to this phase has hitherto not been observed: supernovae occur too infrequently in the Milky Way to provide a young example, and extragalactic supernovae are generally too faint and too small. Here we report observations that show this transition in the supernova SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. From 1994 to 2001, the ejecta faded owing to radioactive decay of 44Ti as predicted. Then the flux started to increase, more than doubling by the end of 2009. We show that this increase is the result of heat deposited by X-rays produced as the ejecta interacts with the surrounding material. In time, the X-rays will penetrate farther into the ejecta, enabling us to analyse the structure and chemistry of the vanished star."
https://openalex.org/W2109848000,"Protein-protein interactions mediated by modular protein domains are critical for cell scaffolding, differentiation, signaling, and ultimately, evolution. Given the vast number of ligands competing for binding to a limited number of domain families, it is often puzzling how specificity can be achieved. Selectivity may be modulated by intradomain allostery, whereby a remote residue is energetically connected to the functional binding site via side chain or backbone interactions. Whereas several energetic pathways, which could mediate intradomain allostery, have been predicted in modular protein domains, there is a paucity of experimental data to validate their existence and roles. Here, we have identified such functional energetic networks in one of the most common protein-protein interaction modules, the PDZ domain. We used double mutant cycles involving site-directed mutagenesis of both the PDZ domain and the peptide ligand, in conjunction with kinetics to capture the fine energetic details of the networks involved in peptide recognition. We performed the analysis on two homologous PDZ-ligand complexes and found that the energetically coupled residues differ for these two complexes. This result demonstrates that amino acid sequence rather than topology dictates the allosteric pathways. Furthermore, our data support a mechanism whereby the whole domain and not only the binding pocket is optimized for a specific ligand. Such cross-talk between binding sites and remote residues may be used to fine tune target selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1986336605,"The growing epidemic of obesity and metabolic diseases calls for a better understanding of adipocyte biology. The regulation of transcription in adipocytes is particularly important, as it is a target for several therapeutic approaches. Transcriptional outcomes are influenced by both histone modifications and transcription factor binding. Although the epigenetic states and binding sites of several important transcription factors have been profiled in the mouse 3T3-L1 cell line, such data are lacking in human adipocytes. In this study, we identified H3K56 acetylation sites in human adipocytes derived from mesenchymal stem cells. H3K56 is acetylated by CBP and p300, and deacetylated by SIRT1, all are proteins with important roles in diabetes and insulin signaling. We found that while almost half of the genome shows signs of H3K56 acetylation, the highest level of H3K56 acetylation is associated with transcription factors and proteins in the adipokine signaling and Type II Diabetes pathways. In order to discover the transcription factors that recruit acetyltransferases and deacetylases to sites of H3K56 acetylation, we analyzed DNA sequences near H3K56 acetylated regions and found that the E2F recognition sequence was enriched. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing, we confirmed that genes bound by E2F4, as well as those by HSF-1 and C/EBPα, have higher than expected levels of H3K56 acetylation, and that the transcription factor binding sites and acetylation sites are often adjacent but rarely overlap. We also discovered a significant difference between bound targets of C/EBPα in 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes, highlighting the need to construct species-specific epigenetic and transcription factor binding site maps. This is the first genome-wide profile of H3K56 acetylation, E2F4, C/EBPα and HSF-1 binding in human adipocytes, and will serve as an important resource for better understanding adipocyte transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2034519672,"NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) belongs to a class of highly lethal and poorly differentiated epithelial cancers arising mainly in human midline organs. NMC is caused by the chromosome translocation-mediated fusion of the <i>NUT</i> (nuclear protein in testis) gene on chromosome 15 to a few other genes, most frequently the <i>BRD4</i> gene on chromosome 19. The mechanism by which the <i>BRD4-NUT</i> fusion product blocks NMC cellular differentiation and contributes to oncogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we show that BRD4-NUT and BRD4 colocalize in discrete nuclear foci that are hyperacetylated but transcriptionally inactive. BRD4-NUT recruits histone acetyltransferases to induce histone hyperacetylation in these chromatin foci, which provide docking sites for accumulation of additional BRD4 and associated P-TEFB (positive transcription elongation factor b) complexes in the transcriptionally inactive BRD4-NUT foci. These molecular events lead to repression of a BRD4·P-TEFB downstream target gene c-<i>fos</i>, a component of activator protein 1 (AP-1), that directly regulates epithelial differentiation. Knockdown of <i>BRD4-NUT</i> in NMC cells disperses the transcriptionally inactive chromatin foci and releases the transcriptional activators to stimulate c-<i>fos</i> expression, leading to restoration of cellular differentiation. Our study provides a novel mechanism by which the <i>BRD4-NUT</i> oncogene perturbs BRD4 functions to block cellular differentiation and to contribute to the oncogenic progression in the highly aggressive NMC."
https://openalex.org/W2081034936,"Calreticulin and calnexin are key components in maintaining the quality control of glycoprotein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum. Although their lectin function of binding monoglucosylated sugar moieties of glycoproteins is well documented, their chaperone activity in suppressing protein aggregation is less well understood. Here, we use a series of deletion mutants of calreticulin to demonstrate that its aggregation suppression function resides primarily within its lectin domain. Using hydrophobic peptides as substrate mimetics, we show that aggregation suppression is mediated through a single polypeptide binding site that exhibits a K(d) for peptides of 0.5-1 μM. This site is distinct from the oligosaccharide binding site and differs from previously identified sites of binding to thrombospondin and GABARAP (4-aminobutyrate type A receptor-associated protein). Although the arm domain of calreticulin was incapable of suppressing aggregation or binding hydrophobic peptides on its own, it did contribute to aggregation suppression in the context of the whole molecule. The high resolution x-ray crystal structure of calreticulin with a partially truncated arm domain reveals a marked difference in the relative orientations of the arm and lectin domains when compared with calnexin. Furthermore, a hydrophobic patch was detected on the arm domain that mediates crystal packing and may contribute to calreticulin chaperone function."

https://openalex.org/W1996360912,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are molecular switches modulated by families of structurally and functionally related regulators. GIV (Gα-interacting vesicle-associated protein) is the first non-receptor guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Gαi subunits via a defined, evolutionarily conserved motif. Here we found that Calnuc and NUCB2, two highly homologous calcium-binding proteins, share a common motif with GIV for Gαi binding and activation. Bioinformatics searches and structural analysis revealed that Calnuc and NUCB2 possess an evolutionarily conserved motif with sequence and structural similarity to the GEF sequence of GIV. Using in vitro pulldown and competition assays, we demonstrate that this motif binds preferentially to the inactive conformation of Gαi1 and Gαi3 over other Gα subunits and, like GIV, docks onto the α3/switch II cleft. Calnuc binding was impaired when Lys-248 in the α3 helix of Gαi3 was replaced with M, the corresponding residue in Gαo, which does not bind to Calnuc. Moreover, mutation of hydrophobic residues in the conserved motif predicted to dock on the α3/switch II cleft of Gαi3 impaired the ability of Calnuc and NUCB2 to bind and activate Gαi3 in vitro. We also provide evidence that calcium binding to Calnuc and NUCB2 abolishes their interaction with Gαi3 in vitro and in cells, probably by inducing a conformational change that renders the Gαi-binding residues inaccessible. Taken together, our results identify a new type of Gαi-regulatory motif named the GBA motif (for Gα-binding and -activating motif), which is conserved across different proteins throughout evolution. These findings provide the structural basis for the properties of Calnuc and NUCB2 binding to Gα subunits and its regulation by calcium ions.

We also provide evidence that calcium binding to Calnuc and NUCB2 abolishes their interaction with Gαi3 in vitro and in cells, probably by inducing a conformational change that renders the Gαi-binding residues inaccessible. Taken together, our results identify a new type of Gαi-regulatory motif named the GBA motif (for Gα-binding and -activating motif), which is conserved across different proteins throughout evolution. These findings provide the structural basis for the properties of Calnuc and NUCB2 binding to Gα subunits and its regulation by calcium ions."

However, molecular and functional properties of EGb761 and its major subcomponents have not been well characterized. We investigated the effect of EGb761 and its major subcomponents (bilobalide, kaemferol, and quercetin) on preventing atherosclerosis in vitro, and in a rat model of type 2 diabetes.EGb761 (100 and 200 mg/kg) or normal saline (control) were administered to Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, an obese insulin-resistant rat model, for 6 weeks (from 3 weeks before to 3 weeks after carotid artery injury). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to investigate cell proliferation and apoptosis in the injured arteries. Cell migration, caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation, monocyte adhesion, and ICAM-1/VCAM-1 levels were explored in vitro. Treatment with EGb761 dose-dependently reduced intima-media ratio, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and induced greater apoptosis than the controls. Proliferation and migration of VSMCs in vitro were also decreased by the treatment of EGb761. Glucose homeostasis and circulating adiponectin levels were improved, and plasma hsCRP concentrations were decreased in the treatment groups. Caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation increased while monocyte adhesion and ICAM-1/VCAM-1 levels decreased significantly. Among subcomponents of EGb761, kaemferol and quercetin reduced VSMC migration and increased caspase activity.EGb761 has a protective role in the development of atherosclerosis and is a potential therapeutic agent for preventing atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2079690512,"Signal peptide CUB (complement proteins C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp 1)-EGF domain-containing protein 2 (SCUBE2) is a secreted, membrane-associated multidomain protein composed of five recognizable motifs: an NH(2)-terminal signal peptide sequence, nine copies of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a spacer region, three cysteine-rich repeats, and one CUB domain at the COOH terminus. Our previous clinical study showed that SCUBE2 may act as a novel breast tumor suppressor gene and serve as a useful prognostic marker. However, the specific domain responsible for its tumor suppressor activity and the precise mechanisms of its anti-tumor effect remain unknown. Using a combination of biochemical, molecular, and cell biology techniques, we further dissected the molecular functions and signal pathways mediated by the NH(2)-terminal EGF-like repeats or COOH-terminal CUB domain of SCUBE2. Independent overexpression of the NH(2)-terminal EGF-like repeats or COOH-terminal CUB domain resulted in suppression of MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation and reduced MCF-7 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that the COOH-terminal CUB domain could directly bind to and antagonize bone morphogenetic protein activity in an autocrine manner, whereas the NH(2)-terminal EGF-like repeats could mediate cell-cell homophilic adhesions in a calcium-dependent fashion, interact with E-cadherin (a master tumor suppressor), and decrease the β-catenin signaling pathway. Together, our data demonstrate that SCUBE2 has growth inhibitory effects through a coordinated regulation of two distinct mechanisms: antagonizing bone morphogenetic protein and suppressing the β-catenin pathway in breast cancer cells."

However, in some primary cells and tumor cell lines, cIAP1 is expressed in the nucleus, and its nuclear function remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the N-terminal part of cIAP1 directly interacts with the DNA binding domain of the E2F1 transcription factor. cIAP1 dramatically increases the transcriptional activity of E2F1 on synthetic and CCNE promoters. This function is not conserved for cIAP2 and XIAP, which are cytoplasmic proteins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that cIAP1 is recruited on E2F binding sites of the CCNE and CCNA promoters in a cell cycle- and differentiation-dependent manner. cIAP1 silencing inhibits E2F1 DNA binding and E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation of the CCNE gene. In cells that express a nuclear cIAP1 such as HeLa, THP1 cells and primary human mammary epithelial cells, down-regulation of cIAP1 inhibits cyclin E and A expression and cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2092627407,"Arabinogalactan proteins are proteoglycans found on the cell surface and in the cell walls of higher plants. The carbohydrate moieties of most arabinogalactan proteins are composed of β-1,3-galactan main chains and β-1,6-galactan side chains, to which other auxiliary sugars are attached. For the present study, an endo-β-1,3-galactanase, designated FvEn3GAL, was first purified and cloned from winter mushroom Flammulina velutipes. The enzyme specifically hydrolyzed β-1,3-galactan, but did not act on β-1,3-glucan, β-1,3:1,4-glucan, xyloglucan, and agarose.

AGPs consist of a hydroxyproline-rich core protein and large arabinogalactan (AG) moieties, which generally account for more than 90% of total weight (1Fincher G.B. Stone B.A. Clarke A.E. Annu. Rev.

Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). AGs lacking a core protein can also be found in several plants. Gum arabic is a commercial mixture of AGPs from the acacia tree and widely used as a food stabilizer. A type of AG has been identified as the active ingredient in the herbal medicine Juzen-Taiho-To (4Majewska-Sawka A. Nothnagel E.A.

Although AGPs are differentiated by their core proteins, the AG moieties have a common overall structure, that is, β-1,3-galactan main chains to which β-1,6-galactan side chains are attached through O-6. The β-1,6-galactan side chains are further substituted with l-Ara and lesser amounts of other auxiliary sugars such as glucuronic acid (GlcUA), 4-O-methyl-glucuronic acid, l-rhamnose, and l-fucose (1Fincher G.B.

AGPs are implicated in various physiological phenomena including cell adhesion, stress resistance, programmed cell death, and the growth of pollen tubes in higher plants (6Showalter A.M. Cell. Mol.

Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the importance of the AG moieties for the functions of AGPs. For instance, β-glycosyl-Yariv reagent (chemical name, 1,3,5-tri(p-glycosyloxyphenylazo)-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene), which selectively binds to the carbohydrate moieties of AGPs, perturbs development and growth in plants (11Yariv J.

An AGP of tobacco stylar transmitting tissue, named TTS protein, undergoes degradation of its carbohydrate moieties in pollen tubes, stimulating the elongation of the pollen tubes (9Cheung A.Y.

Cell. 1995; 82: 395-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, xylogen, which is a non-classical AGP from Zinnia (Zinnia elegans) mesophyll cells, induces the differentiation to tracheary elements. Importantly, the inductive activity is lost when the carbohydrate moieties are removed from xylogen by chemical treatment (16Motose H. Sugiyama M. Fukuda H. Nature. 2004; 429: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The specific carbohydrate structures that are crucial for the functioning of these AGPs, however, have not been identified. AG moieties can be degraded, modified, and investigated by using specific glycoside hydrolases (GHs). Endo-β-1,6-galactanase (EC 3.2.1.164) isolated from Trichoderma viride specifically acts on β-1,6-galactan side chains (17Okemoto K. Uekita T. Tsumuraya Y. Hashimoto Y. Kasama T. Carbohydr.

Exo-β-1,3-galactanase (EC 3.2.1.145), belonging to GH family 43, hydrolyzes β-1,3-galactan main chains, bypassing β-1,6-galactan side chains. The enzyme can release Gal, β-1,6-galactooligosaccharides (β-1,6-Galn), and their derivatives substituted with l-arabinofuranosyl, l-fucosyl, and/or uronosyl residues from AGPs (22Tsumuraya Y.

On the other hand, no endo-β-1,3-galactanase has so far been identified and satisfactorily described. Arabinogalactanase found in Rhizopus niveus was once labeled as an endo-β-1,3-galactanase (EC 3.2.1.90) (24Hashimoto Y. Tsujisaka Y. Fukumoto J.

For the present study, an endo-β-1,3-galactanase, designated FvEn3GAL, was isolated and cloned from winter mushroom Flammulina velutipes. The enzyme specifically hydrolyzed β-1,3-galactan in an endo-fashion. Phylogenetic analysis including hypothetical bacterial fungal proteins indicated that the enzyme belongs to an unknown subgroup of GH family 16 and stands apart from known enzymes. F. velutipes (NBRC 7663) was distributed from NITE Biological Resource Center (Kisarazu, Japan). The mycelia were cultured in a liquid medium containing 2% (w/v) gum arabic as the carbon source, 0.6% (w/v) Tryptone, 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) potassium phosphate, and 0.05% (w/v) magnesium sulfate at 30 °C for 20 days. Native FvEn3GAL was purified from the culture medium of F. velutipes mycelia. The culture medium was filtered through nylon mesh to remove cell debris. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 4.0 with acetic acid. The medium was adsorbed onto a carboxymethyl (CM)-Sepharose fast flow column (2.8 × 84 cm, GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in the buffer. The active fraction was concentrated and then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.5 × 145 cm, GE Healthcare) equilibrated and eluted with the buffer. The active fraction eluted was collected and used for the analysis of enzyme properties. The purified native enzyme was separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), blotted onto a PVDF-Plus membrane (Osmonics, Moers, Germany), and subjected to an N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis with a protein sequencer (HP G1000A, Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). The corresponding partial cDNA was searched for in the cDNA database that was constructed for mycelia of F. velutipes by Beckman Coulter Genomics. For the determination of full-length cDNA sequence, rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA was performed with a GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) using an internal specific primer (5′-AGTACTAGTCGGCGGGGATGGGT-3′). The secondary structure of FvEn3GAL was predicted with the Phyre program (28Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar). The alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed by the ClustalW program using sequences of characterized GH 16 enzymes collected at the CAZy web site (29Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55761) Google Scholar). Information for the sequences including enzyme names, origins, and accession numbers is given in the supplemental Materials and Methods. FvEn3GAL cDNA corresponding to the mature form of the enzyme (Ala-22 to Asn-249) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pPICzαC (Invitrogen). For the preparation of rPM1 and rPM2, point mutations E138D and E143D, respectively, were introduced into FvEn3GAL cDNA by PCR using the following sets of primers: PM1 forward (5′-GTTGATATCGGTGAATGGAAGGGC-3′) and PM1 reverse (5′-GTCGGGGGGCCATCCAGAC-3′) and PM2 forward (5′-TGGAAGGGCACCCCCGAC-3′) and PM2 reverse (5′-GTCACCGATATCTTCGGGG-3′), respectively, with KOD-Plus (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). The nucleotide sequences of the mutated fragments were confirmed with an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer. The methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris strain KM71 was transformed with the linearized plasmid constructs with a multicopy Pichia expression kit (Invitrogen). The transformants were cultured for 2 days, and then the recombinant proteins were induced by 1% (v/v) methanol according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant proteins were purified by the same conventional chromatography procedure that was used for the native enzyme. Preparation of β-1,3-galactan and β-galactan I and II was from gum arabic (Sigma) by Smith degradation (22Tsumuraya Y. Mochizuki N. Hashimoto Y. Kovác P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7207-7215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); β-1,3-galactobiose (Gal2) and β-1,3-galactotriose (Gal3) were prepared from larch wood arabinogalactan (22Tsumuraya Y. Mochizuki N. Hashimoto Y. Kovác P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7207-7215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain β-1,3-galactotetraose (Gal4), β-1,3-galactopentaose (Gal5), and β-1,3-galactohexaose (Gal6), β-1,3-galactan was partially hydrolyzed with 40 mm trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 60 min. The β-1,3-Galns were purified on a Bio-Gel P-2 (Bio-Rad) column. AGPs from radish roots and leaves and β-1,4- and β-1,6-Galns were prepared as described previously (17Okemoto K. Uekita T. Tsumuraya Y. Hashimoto Y. Kasama T. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Tsumuraya Y. Mochizuki N. Hashimoto Y. Kovác P. J. Biol.

CM-cellulose 4M, β-1,4-galactan from lupin, and β-1,3:1,4-glucan from barley were purchased from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). β-1,3:1,6-Glucan from Laminaria digitata, κ-carrageenan, and p-nitrophenyl (PNP)-glycosides were from Sigma. Keratan sulfate was from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Agarose and CM-curdlan were from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Xyloglucan was prepared from tamarind as described (33Kooiman P. Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1961; 80: 849-865Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The activity of the native enzyme toward polysaccharides was measured using reaction mixtures (total volume, 0.1 ml) consisting of 0.1% (w/v) polysaccharide, 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and the enzyme. The liberated sugars were determined reductometrically by the method of Nelson (34Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 153: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Somogyi (35Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity liberates 1 μmol of reducing sugar/min. The enzymatic activity toward Galn was measured using reaction mixtures (total volume, 8 μl) consisting of the enzyme, 2.5 mm oligosaccharides, and 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Mono- and oligosaccharides in enzymatic hydrolysates were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica gel 60 F254 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using 7:1:2 (v/v/v) 1-propanol/ethanol/water as solvent and detected by charring after spraying TLC plates with 20% (v/v) H2SO4-methanol (17Okemoto K. Uekita T. Tsumuraya Y. Hashimoto Y. Kasama T. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Kotake T. Kaneko S. Kubomoto A. Haque M.A. Kobayashi H. Tsumuraya Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 749-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of hydrolysis action was analyzed with a reaction mixture (total volume, 6 μl) containing the native enzyme, 1 mm β-1,3-Gal6, and 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0). For the analysis of transglycosylation activity, 10 mm β-1,3-Gal3 was used as the substrate. After incubation at 37 °C, the reducing sugars in the reaction mixtures were coupled at their reducing terminals with p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (ABEE) according to the method of Matsuura and Imaoka (36Matsuura F. Imaoka A. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 13-26Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ABEE-derivatized sugars were analyzed on a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a TSKgel Amide-80 (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) column as described previously (18Kotake T. Kaneko S. Kubomoto A. Haque M.A. Kobayashi H. Tsumuraya Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 749-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, the culture medium of F. velutipes mycelia showed high hydrolytic activity toward β-1,3-galactan that was prepared from gum arabic by Smith degradation when mycelia were grown with 2% (w/v) gum arabic as the carbon source. For the present study, the enzyme hydrolyzing β-1,3-galactan was purified by ion-exchange and gel-permeation chromatography from the culture medium (Fig. 1, supplemental Table S1). The purified enzyme showed high activity toward β-1,3-galactan (specific activity, 12.8 units/mg of protein) but failed to act on β-1,3-Gal2 and PNP-β-galactoside (β-Gal). Based on these observations, the enzyme was inferred to be an endo-β-1,3-galactanase and designated FvEn3GAL. The purified FvEn3GAL appeared as a single protein with a relative molecular mass of 30 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The enzyme is probably N-glycosylated because the relative molecular mass apparently decreased when it was treated with endoglycosidase H (supplemental Fig. S1). The enzyme showed relatively high activity between pH 4 and pH 6. The optimal temperature for the enzyme action was 50 °C (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2SDS-PAGE of rFvEn3GAL at different purification steps.

The cloned FvEn3GAL cDNA appeared to encode a polypeptide of 249 amino acids (molecular mass 26,690 Da) (supplemental Fig. S2). The deduced amino acid sequence showed low but significant similarities to GH 16 enzymes such as endo-β-1,3(4)-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium (17% identical, accession number BAC67687.1) (37Kawai R. Igarashi K. Yoshida M. Kitaoka M. Samejima M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 71: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). FvEn3GAL also had relatively high identity to several hypothetical proteins from Streptomyces hygroscopicus (accession number ZP_05512236, 42% identical) and Aspergillus fumigatus (accession number XP_001481519, 41% identical), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that FvEn3GAL forms a novel subgroup with the highly related sequences, apart from other GH 16 enzymes such as endo-β-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39), endo-β-1,3(4)-glucanase, endo-β-1,3:1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.73), and xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase (EC 2.4.1.207/3.2.1.151) (Fig. 4). The Phyre program predicted a secondary structure of FvEn3GAL closely related to an endo-β-1,3-glucanase from Nocardiopsis sp. F96, BglF (NspBglF), which is a member of GH family 16 (2.3 × 10−20) (28Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar, 38Fibriansah G. Masuda S.

The overall structure of FvEn3GAL proposed by the program was a β-jellyroll fold, which is typical for GH 16 enzymes (39Baumann M.J. Eklöf J.M. Michel G. Kallas A.M. Teeri T.T. Czjzek M.

FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3858-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results indicate that FvEn3GAL belongs to GH family 16 but is distinct from known enzymes. The FvEn3GAL open reading frame, except for the signal peptide, was fused to a yeast secretion signal (α-factor) and heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris. Recombinant FvEn3GAL (rFvEn3GAL) was purified by conventional chromatography (supplemental Table S2). The purified rFvEn3GAL appeared as a single band with a relative molecular mass of 32 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1) and showed hydrolytic activity toward β-1,3-galactan (specific activity, 7.0 units/mg of protein). As is the case for the native enzyme, rFvEn3GAL also appeared to be N-glycosylated (supplemental Fig. S1). The activity of rFvEn3GAL was high between pH 4 and pH 5.5. The optimal temperature for enzyme action was 45 °C (Fig. 3). In general, enzymes belonging to GH family 16 possess a highly conserved catalytic motif, EXDX(X)E, in which the first Glu residue functions as the nucleophile and the last functions as the Brønsted acid/base (Fig. 5) (41Hahn M. Olsen O. Politz O. Borriss R. Heinemann U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3081-3088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 42Masuda S. Endo K. Koizumi N. Hayami T. Fukazawa T. Yatsunami R. Fukui T. Nakamura S. Extremophiles. 2006; 10: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of the residues for the activity of the enzyme, rFvEn3GALs with E138D or E143D mutations, designated rPM1 and rPM2, respectively, were prepared (Fig. 5, supplemental Fig. S1). Neither rPM1 nor rPM2 hydrolyzed β-1,3-galactan at all, demonstrating the importance of these Glu residues for activity. The substrate specificity of the native FvEn3GAL was determined using various polysaccharides as substrates. The native enzyme substantially hydrolyzed β-1,3-galactan prepared from gum arabic by triple Smith degradation but failed to act on β-1,3:1,4-glucan, β-1,3:1,6-glucan, β-1,3-glucan, xyloglucan, keratan sulfate, κ-carrageenan, and agarose, which are substrates for other members of GH family 16 (Table 1). PNP-β-Gal, PNP-β-glucoside, PNP-β-glucuronide, and PNP-β-xyloside did not serve as substrate for the enzyme, and β-1,4-galactan was also resistant to hydrolysis by the enzyme. The rFvEn3GAL exhibited substrate specificity essentially identical to the native enzyme, demonstrating the high specificity of FvEn3GAL toward β-1,3-galactosyl residues (Table 1). The relative activities of the native and recombinant enzymes toward radish AGPs and gum arabic were low when compared with that toward β-1,3-galactan. These observations suggest that the β-1,6-galactosyl branches of AG moieties hinder the access of the enzyme to the β-1,3-galactan main chains. Supporting this suggestion is the fact that removal of β-1,6-galactosyl branches from gum arabic by Smith degradation made it more susceptible to the enzyme, showing that β-galactan II with fewer β-1,6-galactosyl branches is a better substrate than gum arabic and β-galactan I (Table 1) (22Tsumuraya Y.

Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2009; 73: 2303-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It seems likely that FvEn3GAL acted only on the limited parts of β-1,3-galactan main chains devoid of branches in the AGPs.TABLE 1Substrate specificities of native and recombinant enzymesRelative activityaActivity is expressed in percentage of that toward β-1,3-galactan.SubstrateNative enzymerFvEn3GAL%β-Galactansβ-1,3-Galactan prepared from gum arabic100100Gum arabic from acacia treeTraceTraceβ-Galactan I prepared from gum arabic149β-Galactan II prepared from gum arabic5046Native AGP from radish leaves78Native AGP from radish roots55β-1,4-Galactan from lupin00Substrates for other GH 16 enzymesAgarose00Curdlan (β-1,3-glucan)bThe enzymes were incubated with this polysaccharide at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml.

The concentration of all other polysaccharides was 1.0 mg/ml. Open table in a new tab The activity of the native enzyme toward Galn was also examined using β-1,3-, β-1,4-, and β-1,6-Galn. The enzyme hydrolyzed β-1,3-Gal3, β-1,3-Gal4, and β-1,3-Gal5 into Gal and β-1,3-Gal2, whereas β-1,4- and β-1,6-Galn were impervious to the enzyme (Fig. 6). The enzyme probably requires at least three contiguous β-1,3-galactosyl residues for hydrolysis as it failed to act on β-1,3-Gal2. These results confirm the high specificity of the enzyme toward β-1,3-galactosyl residues. The effect of substrate concentration on the activity of the native enzyme was examined using β-1,3-galactan, β-1,3-Gal3, and β-1,3-Gal4. The resulting Km, kcat, and catalytic efficiency values are listed in Table 2. As the Km value (0.58 mm) toward β-1,3-Gal4 was lower than that (1.25 mm) toward β-1,3-Gal3, the longer β-1,3-Galn probably serves as a better substrate for FvEn3GAL.TABLE 2Kinetics of native FvEn3GALSubstrateKmaTo examine the effects of substrates, reactions were carried out with varying concentrations of β-1,3-galactan (0.05–2.0 mg/ml), β-1,3-Gal3 (0.25–2.5 mm), and β-1,3-Gal4 (0.25–2.5 mm).kcataTo examine the effects of substrates, reactions were carried out with varying concentrations of β-1,3-galactan (0.05–2.0 mg/ml), β-1,3-Gal3 (0.25–2.5 mm), and β-1,3-Gal4 (0.25–2.5 mm).kcat/KmaTo examine the effects of substrates, reactions were carried out with varying concentrations of β-1,3-galactan (0.05–2.0 mg/ml), β-1,3-Gal3 (0.25–2.5 mm), and β-1,3-Gal4 (0.25–2.5 mm).sm/sβ-1,3-Galactan0.137 mg/ml7.56—bThe value was not calculated.β-1,3-Gal31.25 mm5.474.38 × 103β-1,3-Gal40.57 mm6.501.14 × 104a To examine the effects of substrates, reactions were carried out with varying concentrations of β-1,3-galactan (0.05–2.0 mg/ml), β-1,3-Gal3 (0.25–2.5 mm), and β-1,3-Gal4 (0.25–2.5 mm).b The value was not calculated. Open table in a new tab To understand the mode of action of FvEn3GAL, the products released from β-1,3-Gal6 by the action of the native enzyme were analyzed. The enzyme released β-1,3-Gal2, β-1,3-Gal3, β-1,3-Gal4, and β-1,3-Gal5 together with Gal in the initial phase of the hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 7A, supplemental Fig. S3). This is convincing proof that the enzyme acts on the oligosaccharide in an endo-fashion because exo-acting enzymes, including exo-β-1,3-galactanase and β-galactosidase, would accumulate Gal and β-1,3-Gal5 in the initial phase. Upon prolonged incubation, β-1,3-Gal6 was mostly hydrolyzed into Gal and β-1,3-Gal2, although a small amount of β-1,3-Gal3 remained in the reaction mixture. These observations also imply that the enzyme requires at least three contiguous β-1,3-galactosyl residues to act on. Through a “retaining” mechanism, GH 16 enzymes may catalyze not just hydrolysis but also transglycosylation, in which glycosyl transfer to carbohydrate occurs. In fact, GH family 16 includes xyloglucan endo-transglycosylases that catalyze transglycosylation rather than hydrolysis (39Baumann M.J. Eklöf J.M. Michel G. Kallas A.M. Teeri T.T. Czjzek M. Brumer 3rd, H. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1947-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 44Nishitani K. Tominaga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21058-21064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the transglycosylation activity of native FvEn3GAL in the presence of a high concentration (10 mm) of β-1,3-Gal3. The native enzyme formed a small amount of the transglycosylation products β-1,3-Gal4, β-1,3-Gal5, and β-1,3-Gal6, as well as the hydrolysis products, Gal and β-1,3-Gal2 (Fig. 7B). We conclude that the linkage formed by the transglycosylation reaction is a β-1,3-galactosidic type linkage because we found that the transglycosylation products were completely hydrolyzed into Gal by the action of exo-β-1,3-galactanase specific to β-1,3-galactosyl residues (supplemental Fig. S4A). Because the transglycosylation reaction was apparently weak when compared with the hydrolysis activity, it is not likely that transglycosylation is the predominant type of reaction catalyzed by this enzyme in nature. As no transglycosylation activity toward 10 mm β-1,6-Gal3 was observed (supplemental Fig. S4B), the transglycosylation activity of the enzyme is presumably specific to β-1,3-galactosyl residues. On the basis of the high specificity toward β-1,3-galactan and its mode of action, FvEn3GAL can be classified as an endo-β-1,3-galactanase. With regard to the arabinogalactanase previously found in R. niveus, we could not find definitive information about its mode of action (24Hashimoto Y. Tsujisaka Y. Fukumoto J. Nippon Nogeikagaku Kaishi. 1969; 43: 831-836Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Hashimoto Y. Nippon Nogeikagaku Kaishi. 1971; 45: 147-150Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Dekker R.F. Richards G.N. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1976; 32: 277-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The enzyme has been found to hydrolyze coffee AG into β-1,6-Galn; however, these oligosaccharides could also be released by the action of exo-β-1,3-galactanase (22Tsumuraya Y. Mochizuki N. Hashimoto Y. Kovác P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7207-7215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kotake T. Kitazawa K. Takata R. Okabe K. Ichinose H. Kaneko S. Tsumuraya Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2009; 73: 2303-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We could not find a sequence related to FvEn3GAL in the genomic database of an organism of the Rhizopus genus, Rhizopus oryzae (Rhizopus oryzae Database available from the Broad Institute). Even if we assume that the Rhizopus arabinogalactanase hydrolyzes β-1,3-galactan main chains of coffee AG in an endo-fashion, it would have to be an enzyme distinct from FvEn3GAL. GH family 16 comprises endo-β-1,3-glucanase, endo-β-1,3(4)-glucanase, endo-β-1,3:1,4-glucanase, β-agarase (EC 3.2.1.81), xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase, keratan-sulfate endo-β-1,4-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.103), κ-carrageenase (EC 3.2.1.83), and porphyranase (no EC entry) (29Cantarel B.L.

Czjzek M. Michel G. Nature. 2010; 464: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Endo-β-1,3-galactanase will be a new member of GH family 16. Although the substrate specificity of FvEn3GAL was apparently different from these known GH 16 enzymes, the cleavage of β-1,3-galactosyl linkages by FvEn3GAL reminds us of the reaction catalyzed by endo-β-1,3-glucanase. Based on the wide distribution and sequence diversity of endo-β-1,3-glucanase, it has been proposed that the GH 16 enzymes share a common ancestor having laminarinase activity (46Barbeyron T. Gerard A. Potin P. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 47Michel G. Chantalat L. Duee E. Barbeyron T. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Dideberg O. Structure. 2001; 9: 513-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). FvEn3GAL has probably evolved from the same ancestor. Endo-β-1,3-galactanase is likely distributed at least in several fungi and bacteria such as Aspergillus flavus, Neurospora crassa, and S. hygroscopicus, whereas we could not find any closely related sequences in plants. Endo-β-1,3-galactanases are expected to benefit organisms by accelerating the degradation of plant AGPs and AGs, which are utilized as a source of carbon. Because FvEn3GAL alone is restricted to a limited part of β-1,3-galactan main chains of radish AGPs and gum arabic, natural AGPs will be efficiently degraded only by synergistic action with other GHs hydrolyzing the β-1,6-galactan side chains. Indeed, the culture medium of F. velutipes evinced α-l-arabinofuranosidase and β-galactosidase activities beside the endo-β-1,3-galactanase activity investigated here. The degradation by FvEn3GAL of plant material through the release of large AG fragments from cell walls by acting on the exposed parts of β-1,3-galactan main chains of AGPs and AGs may be an important contribution to fungal digestive strategies in nature. In conclusion, the present study has for the first time isolated and cloned an endo-β-1,3-galactanase. FvEn3GAL from F. velutipes is a member of GH family 16 and seems to belong to a novel subgroup, with a number of hypothetical fungal proteins, that stands apart from known enzymes in family 16. The enzyme, in concert with endo-β-1,6-galactanase and exo-β-1,3-galactanase, should prove a useful tool in efforts to reveal the specific carbohydrate structure of AGPs and AGs and determine their particular functions.

Our aim was to develop simple approaches to program cell-cell interactions that would otherwise not exist toward cell targeting and understanding the complex biology of cell-cell interactions. We employed a chemistry approach to engineer P- or L-selectin binding nucleic acid aptamers onto mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to enable them to engage inflamed endothelial cells and leukocytes, respectively. We show for the first time that engineered cells with a single artificial adhesion ligand can recapitulate 3 critical cell interactions in the inflammatory cell adhesion cascade under dynamic flow conditions. Aptamer-engineered MSCs adhered on respective selectin surfaces under static conditions >10 times more efficiently than controls including scrambled-DNA modified MSCs. Significantly, engineered MSCs can be directly captured from the flow stream by selectin surfaces or selectin-expressing cells under flow conditions (≤2dyn/cm2). The simple chemistry approach and the versatility of aptamers permit the concept of engineered cell-cell interactions to be generically applicable for targeting cells to diseased tissues and elucidating the biology of cell-cell interactions.—Zhao, W., Loh, W., Droujinine, I.

https://openalex.org/W1993126060,"Pluripotent stem cells possess a tremendous potential for the treatment of many diseases because of their capacity to differentiate into a variety of cell lineages. However, they provide little promise for muscle-related diseases, mainly because of the lack of small molecule inducers to efficiently direct myogenic conversion. Retinoic acid, acting through the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), affects stem cell fate determination in a concentration-dependent manner, but it only has a modest efficacy on the commitment of ES cells into skeletal muscle lineage. The RXR is very important for embryonic development but is generally considered to act as a silent partner of RAR in a non-permissive mode. In this study, we have examined whether activation of the RXR by rexinoid or RXR-specific signaling play a role in the specification of stem cells into muscle lineage. Our findings demonstrate that mouse ES cells generate skeletal myocytes effectively upon treatment with rexinoid at the early stage of differentiation and that on a molecular level, rexinoid-enhanced myogenesis simulates the sequential events observed in vivo. Moreover, RXR-mediated myogenic conversion requires the function of β-catenin but not RAR. Our studies establish the feasibility of applying the RXR agonist in cell-based therapies to treat muscle-related diseases. The aptitude of mouse ES cells to generate skeletal myocytes following rexinoid induction also provides a model system to study the convergence of different signaling pathways in myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1983502697,"Metabolic pathways for amino sugars (N-acetylglucosamine; GlcNAc and glucosamine; Gln) are essential and remain largely conserved in all three kingdoms of life, i.e., microbes, plants and animals. Upon uptake, in the cytoplasm these amino sugars undergo phosphorylation by phosphokinases and subsequently deacetylation by the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate deacetylase (nagA) to yield glucosamine-6-phosphate and acetate, the first committed step for both GlcNAc assimilation and amino-sugar-nucleotides biosynthesis. Here we report the cloning of a DNA fragment encoding a partial nagA gene and its implications with regard to amino sugar metabolism in the cellulose producing bacterium Glucoacetobacter xylinus (formally known as Acetobacter xylinum). For this purpose, nagA was disrupted by inserting tetracycline resistant gene (nagA::tetr; named as ΔnagA) via homologous recombination. When compared to glucose fed conditions, the UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and bacterial growth (due to lack of GlcNAc utilization) was completely inhibited in nagA mutants. Interestingly, that inhibition occured without compromising cellulose production efficiency and its molecular composition under GlcNAc fed conditions. We conclude that nagA plays an essential role for GlcNAc assimilation by G. xylinus thus is required for the growth and survival for the bacterium in presence of GlcNAc as carbon source. Additionally, G. xylinus appears to possess the same molecular machinery for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis from GlcNAc precursors as other related bacterial species."

Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), the S4S5 linker, which is located within atomic proximity (4–5 Å) of the S6 helix, interacts with the latter in the closed state of the channel. The movement of the S4 voltage sensor is likely to induce a conformational change that pulls the S4S5 linker away from the S6 inner helix ultimately resulting in ions flowing through the pore. The closed conformation of the channel is postulated to be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions at the level of the “closed bundle” in S6 (13Armstrong C.M. Sci. STKE. 2003; : re10PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hackos D.H. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence supporting a role for the S4S5 linker in the voltage dependence of activation of KV channels is steadily mounting. Introduction of the S4S5 linker from KcsA disrupts the voltage-dependent activation of KV2.1 (16Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. Nature. 2001; 413: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 17Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In hERG, cross-linking studies have shown that residues located in the S4S5 linker and in the S6 helix are in atomic proximity and that gating currents were greatly affected as a result of disulfide bridge formation (18Ferrer T. Rupp J. Piper D.R. Tristani-Firouzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12858-12864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations of a unique glycine residue (Gly-546) within the N-terminal end of the S4S5 linker were shown to stabilize the closed state by ∼1.6–4.3 kcal/mol and restricted the voltage sensor movement (19Van Slyke A.C. Rezazadeh S. Snopkowski M. Shi P. Allard C.R. Claydon T. Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2841-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The potential coupling mechanism between the S4S5 linker and the S6 helix has yet to be explored in CaV channels. In contrast to KV channels, CaV channels are structurally asymmetrical with four distinct albeit homologous S4S5 linkers and four distinct S6 helices. We have already shown that glycine substitutions in the distal S6 regions of domains I, II, III, and IV altered the relative stability between the open and closed states (20Raybaud A. Baspinar E.E. Dionne F. Dodier Y. Sauvé R. Parent L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27944-27952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutations within IIS6 were found to impact most significantly on the activation gating of CaV2.3. In particular, I701G shifted by −35 mV the voltage dependence of activation while slowing down inactivation and deactivation kinetics (20Raybaud A. Baspinar E.E. Dionne F. Dodier Y. Sauvé R. Parent L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27944-27952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data indicated that IIS6 plays a unique role in the channel equilibrium between the closed and the open state(s) in CaV2.3. To determine whether the S4S5 linker of Domain II (IIS4S5) is coupled with the S6 helix of the same domain (IIS6) during activation of CaV2.3, we performed a double mutant cycle analysis (21Horovitz A. Fold. Des. 1996; 1: R121-R126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) within domain II of CaV2.3. Double mutant cycle analysis has often been proven to be a powerful tool for studying intra-protein interactions in CaV1.2 (22Kudrnac M. Beyl S. Hohaus A. Stary A. Peterbauer T. Timin E. Hering S. J.

Our assay, conducted by introducing pairs of glycine residues, one in the IIS4S5 linker and one in the IIS6 helix, has identified crucial points of energy interaction between these two regions. Notably Leu-596 in IIS4S5 appeared to be strongly coupled with IIS6 distal residues from Leu-699 to Asp-704 with ΔΔGinteract more negative than −2 kcal mol−1. Altogether, our results provide the first series of evidence that the IIS4S5 and IIS6 regions are coupled during the activation of CaV2.3. The human CaV2.3 (GenBank L27745) (26Schneider T. Wei X.

Run-off transcripts were prepared using the T7 RNA Polymerase mMessage mMachine® transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and stored at −20 °C before use. Oocytes were obtained from female Xenopus laevis clawed frogs as described previously (20Raybaud A. Baspinar E.E. Dionne F. Dodier Y. Sauvé R. Parent L. J. Biol.

Functional expression of mutants was deemed significant with whole cell Ba2+ currents larger than −300 nA. Wild-type and mutant channels were screened at room temperature for macroscopic Ba2+ currents, 2 to 4 days after RNA injection, using a two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (OC-725C, Warner Instruments) as described earlier (20Raybaud A.

Oocytes were routinely injected with 23 nl of a 50 mm EGTA (Sigma) solution 0.5 to 2 h before the experiments. The pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used for on-line data acquisition and analysis. A series of 500-ms voltage pulses (5 mV steps) was applied at a frequency of 0.2 Hz from a holding potential of −120 mV in most cases. The holding potential was −140 mV for mutants that show a strong negative shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation. Gating currents were recorded using the cut-open oocyte voltage-clamp technique (35Stefani E. Bezanilla F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 300-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 36Batulan Z.

The membrane of the oocyte exposed to the bottom chamber was permeabilized by a brief treatment with 0.1% saponin. The external solution contained 2 mm CoCl2, 110 mm NaOH, and 10 mm Hepes, titrated to pH 7.0 with methanesulfonic acid (37Olcese R. Neely A. Qin N. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The internal solution in contact with the oocyte cytoplasm was either 120 mm tetraethyl ammonium, 10 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgSO4, titrated to pH 7.0 with methanesulfonic acid; or 110 mm potassium glutamate and 10 mm Hepes, titrated to pH 7.0 with KOH. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the Digidata 1322A 16-bit system (Molecular Devices). Gating currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Holding potential was −120 mV and 30-ms voltage steps were evoked from −100 to 60 mV by 5-mV increments. Linear components arising from charging the membrane and leak currents were eliminated by a P/−-4 protocol. Gating charge versus voltage (Q-V) relations were obtained by integrating the OFF gating currents and then fitting single Boltzmann functions (Equation 1) according to Q/Qmax=11+exp[-ze(V-V0.5,Q)/kT]Eq. 1 where parameter e is the elementary electric charge; k is the Boltzmann constant; z is the effective valence. Activation parameters were estimated from the peak I–V curves obtained for each channel combination and are reported as the mean of individual measurements ± S.E. Briefly, the I–V relationships were normalized to the maximum amplitude and fitted to a Boltzmann equation with E0,5,act being the midpotential of activation as described elsewhere (20Raybaud A. Baspinar E.E. Dionne F. Dodier Y. Sauvé R. Parent L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27944-27952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Berrou L. Dodier Y. Raybaud A.

J. 2001; 80: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The estimation of E0,5,act using nonstationary measurements rests upon the assumption that the transition to the open state is much faster than the transition to the inactivated state. The free energy of activation was calculated using the midactivation potential by Equation 2. ΔGact=z·F·E0.5,actEq. 2 Deactivation time constants and inactivation parameters were calculated as described in detail under supplemental “Experimental Procedures”. Statistical analyses were performed using the one-way analysis of variance fitting routine for two independent populations included in Origin 7.0. Data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.01. The coupling or interaction energy ΔΔGinteract was calculated as, ΔΔGinteract=(ΔGact,WT+ΔGact,double)-(ΔGact,S4S5+ΔGact,S6)Eq. 3 where ΔGact,wt is the free energy of activation of the wild-type channel, ΔGact,double is the free energy of activation of the double glycine mutant, ΔGact,S4S5 is the free energy of activation of the single glycine mutant in the S4S5 linker, and ΔGact,S6 is the free energy of activation of the single glycine mutant in S6. ΔΔGinteract = 0 suggests that the activation energies are purely additive hence that the residues are not functionally coupled. A value of ΔΔGinteract more positive than +1 kcal mol−1 or more negative than −1 kcal mol−1 (|ΔΔGinteract| > 1) was considered significantly different in similar studies (24Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F.S. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 717-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Kusch J. Zimmer T. Holschuh J. Biskup C. Schulz E. Nache V. Benndorf K. Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2488-2496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, given the experimental variations associated with the measurements, we used a threshold of |ΔΔGinteract| > 2 kcal mol−1. An analysis based on the SAMT02 algorithm (39Karplus K. Karchin R. Draper J. Casper J. Mandel-Gutfreund Y. Diekhans M. Hughey R. Proteins. 2003; 53: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) confirmed KV 1.2 as a suitable template to model the S4S5 linker and S6 segments of domain II of CaV2.3. The computer-based molecular model of CaV2.3, going from the IIS4 helix to the end of IIS6 was obtained with Modeler 9 version 4 using the molecular coordinates of KV1.2 (Protein Data Bank code 2A79). Details are provided under supplemental “Experimental Procedures”. A glycine scan was performed in the S4S5 linker of domain II to identify residues most likely to play a role during the activation of CaV2.3. Because of the absence of a side chain, glycine mutations most likely minimize steric constraints, whereas generally decreasing the degree of hydrophobicity of the S4S5 linker. We used the predictive SAM-T02 algorithm (39Karplus K. Karchin R. Draper J. Casper J. Mandel-Gutfreund Y. Diekhans M. Hughey R. Proteins. 2003; 53: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) to evaluate the structural impact of introducing glycine residues in the S4S5 linker of domain II in CaV2.3 channels. As seen under supplemental Fig. S1, single point mutations are not predicted to significantly alter the predicted secondary structure of this region. Glycine residues were thus introduced as single point mutations between residues 592 and 602 in the S4S5 linker of domain II (IIS4S5) (Fig. 1B). The ΔGact and ΔGinact (ΔG for the activation and inactivation, respectively) of these 11 consecutive single point mutations are reported in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, all mutant channels activated in response to membrane depolarization. From the histogram in Fig. 3A, it appears that the ΔGact and ΔGinact for most mutants (L592G, V593G, V594G, S595G, S598G, S599G, and K601G) were not significantly different from CaV2.3 wt. In contrast, the ΔGact were significantly altered by glycine residues introduced at positions 596, 600, and 602 with a clear leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation. It is noteworthy that no glycine mutants shifted ΔGact toward positive voltages. L596G experienced the most significant change in the ΔGact value from −1.0 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1 (n = 108) for CaV2.3 wt to −6.5 ± 0.7 kcal mol−1 (n = 6) for L596G yielding a ΔΔGact = −5.5 ± 0.8 kcal mol−1. This singular effect was specific for the glycine mutation. Other nonconservative mutations at this position, L596D and L596P, were activated at significantly lower membrane potentials with ΔGact = −2.5 ± 0.2 and −2.7 ± 0.2 kcal mol−1, respectively.TABLE 1Biophysical properties of IIS4S5 mutants in Cav2.3CaV2.3/α2δ/β3 10 mm Ba2+ActivationInactivationDeactivation, max τ deactE0.5,actΔGactE0.5,inactΔGinactR50 at 10 mVmVkcal mol−1mVkcal mol−1MsCaV2.3 wt−6.7 ± 0.4 (108)−1.0 ± 0.1−63.5 ± 0.6 (74)−4.3 ± 0.10.41 ± 0.02 (41)1.3 ± 0.2 (10)L592G−11 ± 1 (5)−1.2 ± 0.1−63 ± 1 (5)−3.6 ± 0.10.54 ± 0.01 (5)1.0 ± 0.1 (5)V593G−5 ± 1 (5)−0.5 ± 0.2−68 ± 1 (5)−3.8 ± 0.60.47 ± 0.03 (5)0.60 ± 0.02 (5)V594G−11 ± 1 (5)−1.3 ± 0.1−55 ± 2 (4)ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−2.5 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.73 ± 0.02 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.1.0 ± 0.1 (5)S595G−17 ± 2 (9)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−1.7 ± 0.3−39 ± 1 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−2.5 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.73 ± 0.03 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.7 ± 0.1(5)L596G−53 ± 1 (6)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−6.5 ± 0.7bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−108 ± 3 (6)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−4.7 ± 0.20.87 ± 0.03 (6)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.21 ± 2 (6)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.L596D−20 ± 1 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−2.5 ± 0.2bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−43 ± 1 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−3.0 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.78 ± 0.03 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.2.5 ± 0.5 (5)L596P−20 ± 1 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−2.7 ± 0.2bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−58 ± 1 (5)−3.4 ± 0.3ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.70 ± 0.02 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.11 ± 2 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.M597G−14 ± 1 (4)ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−1.5 ± 0.2−82 ± 1 (4)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−3.6 ± 0.20.26 ± 0.07 (4)0.8 ± 0.1 (5)S598G−4 ± 2 (5)−0.5 ± 0.2−59 ± 1 (5)−3.4 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.41 ± 0.02 (5)0.7 ± 0.2 (5)S599G−2 ± 1 (9)ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−0.3 ± 0.2−55 ± 1 (7)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−4.1 ± 0.10.49 ± 0.02 (9)0.8 ± 0.1 (8)M600G−16 ± 1 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−2.1 ± 0.2ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−65 ± 1 (5)−4.3 ± 0.10.33 ± 0.03 (5)0.8 ± 0.1 (4)K601G−5 ± 1 (5)−0.6 ± 0.2−51 ± 1 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−3.1 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.53 ± 0.03 (5)1.1 ± 0.1 (5)S602G−20 ± 1 (6)−3.1 ± 0.4ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−70 ± 1 (5)ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−4.4 ± 0.20.58 ± 0.06 (6)ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.1.7 ± 0.4 (6)I214G (IS4S5)−9 ± 1 (5)−0.7 ± 0.1−83.0 ± 0.2 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−3.3 ± 0.3ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.19 ± 0.05 (5)bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.1.1 ± 0.3 (5)V1281G (IIIS4S5)−4.6 ± 0.8 (5)−0.5 ± 0.1−67 ± 1 (5)−4.0 ± 0.10.29 ± 0.01 (5)1.1 ± 0.2 (5)F1599G (IVS4S5)−1 ± 1 (5)ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.−0.1 ± 0.1−59 ± 2 (5)−2.8 ± 0.3bp < 0.001 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.0.49 ± 0.03 (5)4 ± 2 (5)ap < 0.01 as compared with CaV2.3 wt.Biophysical parameters of CaV2.3 wild-type and mutant channels were estimated with CaVα2bδ and CaVβ3 in the presence of a 10 mm Ba2+ solution as described elsewhere (29Berrou L.

ΔGact and ΔGinact were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ΔGact of L596G, M600G, and S602G were significantly more negative than CaV2.3 wt at p < 0.001 (one-way analysis of variance).

Numerical values are found in Table 1. L596G yielded a significantly longer deactivation time constant (p < 0.001) than the CaV2.3 wt at all voltages more positive than −80 mV. D, representative tail currents for CaV2.3 wt and L596G. Currents were activated during 8-ms conditioning depolarizing voltage pulses at 0 mV for the wt and −40 mV for L596G. Deactivation was recorded during subsequent repolarization to test potentials from −120 to 0 mV (10-mV increments) as illustrated on the pulse protocol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Biophysical parameters of CaV2.3 wild-type and mutant channels were estimated with CaVα2bδ and CaVβ3 in the presence of a 10 mm Ba2+ solution as described elsewhere (29Berrou L.

The voltage dependence of inactivation was determined from the peak currents after 5-s depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −120 mV (−140 mV for L596G). Activation properties (E0.5,act and z) were estimated from the mean I–V relationships and fitted to a Boltzmann equation where z is the slope factor.

The voltage dependence of the Q/Qmax curve for L596G was also significantly shifted toward negative voltages with V0.5,Q = −17 ± 1 mV (n = 4) as compared with V0.5,Q = 6 ± 1 mV (n = 19) for CaV2.3 wt (Fig. 3B). L596G displayed slower inactivation kinetics with a R50 = 0.87 ± 0.03 as compared with R50 = 0.41 ± 0.02 for CaV2.3 wt (Table 1), a significantly slower deactivation time constant (Fig. 3, C and D) but little change in the ΔGinact.

https://openalex.org/W2067959447,"We have developed an efficient strategy for cloning of PCR products that contain an unknown region flanked by a known sequence. As with ligation-independent cloning, the strategy is based on homology between sequences present in both the vector and the insert. However, in contrast to ligation-independent cloning, the cloning vector has homology with only one of the two primers used for amplification of the insert. The other side of the linearized cloning vector has homology with a sequence present in the insert, but nested and non-overlapping with the gene-specific primer used for amplification. Since only specific products contain this sequence, but none of the non-specific products, only specific products can be cloned. Cloning is performed using a one-step reaction that only requires incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature in the presence of T4 DNA polymerase to generate single-stranded extensions at the ends of the vector and insert. The reaction mix is then directly transformed into E. coli where the annealed vector-insert complex is repaired and ligated. We have tested this method, which we call quick and clean cloning (QC cloning), for cloning of the variable regions of immunoglobulins expressed in non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumor samples. This method can also be applied to identify the flanking sequence of DNA elements such as T-DNA or transposon insertions, or be used for cloning of any PCR product with high specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1995851947,"Rieske-type oxygenases are promising biocatalysts for the destruction of persistent pollutants or for the synthesis of fine chemicals. In this work, we explored pathways through which Rieske-type oxygenases evolve to expand their substrate range. BphAE(p4), a variant biphenyl dioxygenase generated from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 BphAE(LB400) by the double substitution T335A/F336M, and BphAE(RR41), obtained by changing Asn(338), Ile(341), and Leu(409) of BphAE(p4) to Gln(338), Val(341), and Phe(409), metabolize dibenzofuran two and three times faster than BphAE(LB400), respectively. Steady-state kinetic measurements of single- and multiple-substitution mutants of BphAE(LB400) showed that the single T335A and the double N338Q/L409F substitutions contribute significantly to enhanced catalytic activity toward dibenzofuran. Analysis of crystal structures showed that the T335A substitution relieves constraints on a segment lining the catalytic cavity, allowing a significant displacement in response to dibenzofuran binding. The combined N338Q/L409F substitutions alter substrate-induced conformational changes of protein groups involved in subunit assembly and in the chemical steps of the reaction. This suggests a responsive induced fit mechanism that retunes the alignment of protein atoms involved in the chemical steps of the reaction. These enzymes can thus expand their substrate range through mutations that alter the constraints or plasticity of the catalytic cavity to accommodate new substrates or that alter the induced fit mechanism required to achieve proper alignment of reaction-critical atoms or groups."
https://openalex.org/W2091708050,"Serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (SRRPs) are a growing family of bacterial adhesins found in many streptococci and staphylococci; they play important roles in bacterial biofilm formation and pathogenesis. Glycosylation of this family of adhesins is essential for their biogenesis. A glucosyltransferase (Gtf3) catalyzes the second step of glycosylation of a SRRP (Fap1) from an oral streptococcus, Streptococcus parasanguinis. Although Gtf3 homologs are highly conserved in SRRP-containing streptococci, they share minimal homology with functionally known glycosyltransferases. We report here the 2.3 Å crystal structure of Gtf3. The structural analysis indicates that Gtf3 forms a tetramer and shares significant structural homology with glycosyltransferases from GT4, GT5, and GT20 subfamilies. Combining crystal structural analysis with site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro glycosyltransferase assays, we identified residues that are required for UDP- or UDP-glucose binding and for oligomerization of Gtf3 and determined their contribution to the enzymatic activity of Gtf3. Further in vivo studies revealed that the critical amino acid residues identified by the structural analysis are crucial for Fap1 glycosylation in S. parasanguinis in vivo. Moreover, Gtf3 homologs from other streptococci were able to rescue the gtf3 knock-out mutant of S. parasanguinis in vivo and catalyze the sugar transfer to the modified SRRP substrate in vitro, demonstrating the importance and conservation of the Gtf3 homologs in glycosylation of SRRPs. As the Gtf3 homologs only exist in SRRP-containing streptococci, we conclude that the Gtf3 homologs represent a unique subfamily of glycosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2141284133,"Background The turnover of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction is regulated in an activity-dependent manner. Upon denervation and under various other pathological conditions, receptor half-life is decreased. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate a novel approach to follow the kinetics of acetylcholine receptor lifetimes upon pulse labeling of mouse muscles with 125I-α-bungarotoxin in vivo. In contrast to previous assays where residual activity was measured ex vivo, in our setup the same animals are used throughout the whole measurement period, thereby permitting a dramatic reduction of animal numbers at increased data quality. We identified three stability levels of acetylcholine receptors depending on the presence or absence of innervation: one pool of receptors with a long half-life of ∼13 days, a second with an intermediate half-life of ∼8 days, and a third with a short half-life of ∼1 day. Data were highly reproducible from animal to animal and followed simple exponential terms. The principal outcomes of these measurements were reproduced by an optical pulse-labeling assay introduced recently. Conclusions/Significance A novel assay to determine kinetics of acetylcholine receptor turnover with small animal numbers is presented. Our data show that nerve activity acts on muscle acetylcholine receptor stability by at least two different means, one shifting receptor lifetime from short to intermediate and another, which further increases receptor stability to a long lifetime. We hypothesize on possible molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2018821098,"Secreted from intestine, human fibroblast growth factor 19 (hFGF19) is an endocrine metabolic regulator that controls bile acid synthesis in the liver. Earlier studies have suggested that hFGF19 at 10-100 nM levels signals through FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) in the presence of a co-receptor, betaKlotho, but its activity and receptor specificity at physiological concentrations (picomolar levels) remain unclear. Here we report that hFGF19 at picomolar levels require sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs), such as heparan sulfate, heparin, and chondroitin sulfates, for its signaling via human FGFR4 in the presence of human betaKlotho. Importantly, sGAGs isolated from liver are highly active in enhancing the picomolar hFGF19 signaling. At nanomolar levels, in contrast, hFGF19 activates all types of human FGFRs, i.e. FGFR1c, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 in the co-presence of betaKlotho and heparin and activates FGFR4 even in the absence of betaKlotho. These results show that sGAGs play crucial roles in specific and sensitive hFGF19 signaling via FGF receptors and suggest that hepatic sGAGs are involved in the highly potent and specific signaling of picomolar hFGF19 through FGFR4 and betaKlotho. The results further suggest that hFGF19 at pathological concentrations may evoke aberrant signaling through various FGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2075504536,"The enzymatic-silicatein mediated formation of the skeletal elements, the spicules of siliceous sponges starts intracellularly and is completed extracellularly. With Suberites domuncula we show that the axial growth of the spicules proceeds in three phases: (I) formation of an axial canal; (II) evagination of a cell process into the axial canal, and (III) assembly of the axial filament composed of silicatein. During these phases the core part of the spicule is synthesized. Silicatein and its substrate silicate are stored in silicasomes, found both inside and outside of the cellular extension within the axial canal, as well as all around the spicule. The membranes of the silicasomes are interspersed by pores of ≈ 2 nm that are likely associated with aquaporin channels which are implicated in the hardening of the initial bio-silica products formed by silicatein. We can summarize the sequence of events that govern spicule formation as follows: differential GENETIC READOUT (of silicatein) → FRACTAL ASSOCIATION of the silicateins → EVAGINATION of cells by hydro-mechanical forces into the axial canal → and finally PROCESSIVE BIO-SILICA POLYCONDENSATION around the axial canal. We termed this process, occurring sequentially or in parallel, BIO-INORGANIC SELF-ORGANIZATION."
https://openalex.org/W2009488666,"A majority of the studies examining the molecular regulation of human labor have been conducted using single gene approaches. While the technology to produce multi-dimensional datasets is readily available, the means for facile analysis of such data are limited. The objective of this study was to develop a systems approach to infer regulatory mechanisms governing global gene expression in cytokine-challenged cells in vitro, and to apply these methods to predict gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in intrauterine tissues during term parturition. To this end, microarray analysis was applied to human amnion mesenchymal cells (AMCs) stimulated with interleukin-1β, and differentially expressed transcripts were subjected to hierarchical clustering, temporal expression profiling, and motif enrichment analysis, from which a GRN was constructed. These methods were then applied to fetal membrane specimens collected in the absence or presence of spontaneous term labor. Analysis of cytokine-responsive genes in AMCs revealed a sterile immune response signature, with promoters enriched in response elements for several inflammation-associated transcription factors. In comparison to the fetal membrane dataset, there were 34 genes commonly upregulated, many of which were part of an acute inflammation gene expression signature. Binding motifs for nuclear factor-κB were prominent in the gene interaction and regulatory networks for both datasets; however, we found little evidence to support the utilization of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) signaling. The tissue specimens were also enriched for transcripts governed by hypoxia-inducible factor. The approach presented here provides an uncomplicated means to infer global relationships among gene clusters involved in cellular responses to labor-associated signals."

Interactions between the sporozoites and hepatocytes lead to a distinct, complex and coordinated cellular and systemic host response. Little is known about host liver cell response to sporozoite invasion, or whether it is primarily adaptive for the parasite, for the host, or for both. Our present study used gene expression profiling of human HepG2-A16 liver cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites to understand the host early cellular events and factors influencing parasite infectivity and sporozoite development. Our results show that as early as 30 min following wild-type, non-irradiated sporozoite exposure, the expressions of at least 742 genes was selectively altered. These genes regulate diverse biological functions, such as immune processes, cell adhesion and communications, metabolism pathways, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction. These functions reflect cellular events consistent with initial host cell defense responses, as well as alterations in host cells to sustain sporozoites growth and survival. Irradiated sporozoites gave very similar gene expression pattern changes, but direct comparative analysis between liver gene expression profiles caused by irradiated and non-irradiated sporozoites identified 29 genes, including glypican-3, that were specifically up-regulated only in irradiated sporozoites.

Elucidating the role of this subset of genes may help identify the molecular basis for the irradiated sporozoites inability to develop intrahepatically, and their usefulness as an immunogen for developing protective immunity against pre-erythrocytic stage malaria. Malaria transmission occurs when Plasmodium sporozoites from the salivary glands of female Anopheles mosquitoes are inoculated into vertebrate hosts during a blood meal. Sporozoites quickly reach the liver through the circulation and traverse through several hepatocyte cells by membrane disruption before invading and settling down in a final hepatocyte for their liver stage development. Exo-erythrocytic forms of the parasite grow within hepatocytes to produce several thousand merozoites, which exit the infected hepatocytes and invade erythrocytes to initiate clinical malaria. Infection by a pathogen triggers a complex and distinct set of cellular and systemic events, some of which may be orchestrated by the parasite to support development, and others representing a host defense response. Interactions between host and pathogens are diverse and are regulated in specific patterns by unique molecules and mechanisms involving activation of transcriptional events of innate and adaptive immunity (1Beutler B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 853-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brodsky I.E. Medzhitov R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 3Maglione P.J. Chan J.

In malaria, this complex interaction between pathogen and host is a critical factor in determining the progression and outcome of the development in liver of the parasite. Understanding global changes that occur both at the host and parasite transcriptome level will allow better understanding of the various host and parasite factors influencing infectivity and parasite development in mammalian hosts. Little is known about host liver cell response to sporozoite invasion, although considerable progress have been made in elucidating the parasite genes and proteins that are important for liver infection (5Westenberger S.J.

The few other studies on this area so far were focused on specific factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor (14Carrolo M. Giordano S. Cabrita-Santos L. Corso S. Vigário A.M. Silva S. Leirião P. Carapau D. Armas-Portela R. Comoglio P.M. Rodriguez A. Mota M.M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1363-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and CD81 (15Silvie O. Goetz K. Matuschewski K. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000086Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas studies using genome-wide microarray approaches were predominantly performed using non-human host/sporozoite pairings. Because the biology of non-human host/sporozoite combinations differs from those of human, the relevance of the findings from these studies remain to be confirmed. The development of an effective malaria vaccine has been an area of intense research in recent years. Attenuated whole sporozoites, their constituent proteins, or the genes encoding them are useful candidates for development of a malaria vaccine. These studies were aimed at discovering specific potential targets for development of a pre-erythrocytic vaccine or drug for malaria. Limited studies have been conducted on changes in hepatocyte transcriptome or proteome on the initial encounter with malaria sporozoites. The liver is a critical gateway for invading sporozoites that can be targeted for intervention before the development of malaria sporozoites into disease producing blood-stage parasites. The various hepatic factors influencing binding and invasion of sporozoites into hepatocytes have being studied in mice using Plasmodium yoelii and Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, but the biology of these sporozoites is different from human malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax. We used a cell culture model of HepG2-A16 hepatoma cells (16Hollingdale M.R. Collins W.E. Campbell C.C. Schwartz A.L. Am. J. Trop. Med.

Microarrays can identify genome-wide transcriptional events that underlie liver responses to sporozoite invasion, and provide insights into molecular events and hepatic factors related to sporozoite invasion and development. The in vitro liver cell culture system allows evaluation of much earlier and well defined stages of sporozoite invasion that are not possible in human subject studies. Although genome-wide microarray analyses have been used to study malaria sporozoite-hepatocyte interactions (18Albuquerque S.S. Carret C. Grosso A.R. Tarun A.S. Peng X. Kappe S.H. Prudêncio M.

Our present study was aimed at specifically identifying changes in human hepatocyte transcripts differentially regulated following early P. falciparum sporozoites infection. We therefore used the HepG2-A16 human hepatoma cells that have been extensively used in P. falciparum sporozoite invasion assay studies (21Hollingdale M.R. Nardin E.H. Tharavanij S. Schwartz A.L.

Differential effects on liver gene expression profiles caused by wild-type and radiation-attenuated sporozoites were also determined. Sporozoites were isolated from the same batch of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with either irradiated or non-irradiated P. falciparum (NF 54 strain) using a modified microcentrifugation technique described previously (25Ozaki L.S. Gwadz R.W. Godson G.N. J. Parasitol. 1984; 70: 831-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, mosquitoes were placed on a glass slide, head and thoraxes were separated, and the abdomens discarded. Up to 50 heads and thoraxes were placed on a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube previously perforated with a 25-gauge needle and plugged with glass wool. This tube was placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and 50 μl of buffer (PBS, pH 8, 1.5% glucose, 5% fetal bovine serum) was added and the tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Filtrates were collected, and centrifugation was repeated after the addition of another 50 μl of buffer. Pooled filtrate was adjusted to 1 ml with buffer and layered on top of a DEAE-cellulose (DE-52, Whatman) column to remove mosquito debris and microbial contaminants (26Moser G. Brohn F.H. Danforth H.D. Nussenzweig R.S. J. Protozool. 1978; 25: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The column was prepared using a 25-ml pipette plugged with glass wool and packed with 10 ml of a 50% DEAE slurry. Sporozoites were eluted from the DEAE column by gravity using 20 ml of buffer, and the initial 14–15 ml of eluate was collected and centrifuged to pellet the sporozoites. Isolated sporozoites were resuspended in DMEM and counted using a hemocytometer. Because there is the possibility that residual contaminating salivary gland proteins in the sporozoite preparations may contribute to differential gene expressions, a mock sporozoite preparation from non-infected but the same batch of mosquitoes was also made using similar scaled-down procedures. This non-sporozoite containing salivary gland extract was used at the same dilution as the sporozoite preparations. Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum (NF54 strain) sporozoites were exposed to 150 gray dose of γ-radiation using a 60Co source. The time of exposure of infected mosquitoes to achieve the target radiation doses was based on the calibration of the irradiator by dosimetry and the half-life of 60Co. HepG2-A16 human liver cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) buffered with bicarbonate and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. For infection by P. falciparum sporozoites, 1 × 106 cells were cultured in DMEM in 6-well plates at 80% confluence and exposed to freshly prepared 1 × 106 sporozoites. The use of equivalent numbers of sporozoites to HepG2-A16 cells is to ensure uniformity and consistency of infectivity across all samples. Cells were exposed to sporozoites for different time periods (30, 90, and 180 min), after which the sporozoite-containing medium was aspirated from each well. Cells were washed three times with complete DMEM medium to ensure removal of free sporozoites on the cell surfaces, and harvested for RNA extraction. For controls, uninfected cell cultures, and cell cultures exposed to salivary gland extract prepared from non-infected mosquitoes were used. All infection experiments were performed in duplicate; however, cells from these two experiments were later pooled together prior to RNA extraction to obtain sufficient hepatic RNAs for microarray analysis. In each experiment there were 4 sample groups (Fig. 1); wild-type sporozoite-infected HepG2-A16 liver cells (Spor), irradiated sporozoite-infected liver cells (IrradSpor), non-infected control liver cells (Control), and liver cells exposed to salivary gland extract from uninfected mosquitoes (SalGld). The 90-min pooled sample for IrradSpor was lost on storage, and was not included in the microarray analysis. Following infection, cell cultures were washed with PBS, lysed in 4.5 m guanidine-hydrochloride lysis buffer, and the total RNA extracted using High PureTM RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). For precaution against possible RNA degradation, all extracted RNAs were treated with 50 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (RNasin, Promega, Madison, WI) and stored at −80 °C. Extracted RNAs were quantitated by absorbance measurements at 260 nm using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). RNA fidelity was verified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and graded using RNA integrity number to assess integrity and ensure consistency across all samples. Only RNAs that conformed to the recommended quality control metrics were used for probe preparation and array hybridization. Probe labeling was performed using standard Affymetrix approved RT-PCR, in vitro transcription, and fragmentation methods. Array hybridization was performed using instrumentation consistent with the Affymetrix Integrated GeneChip System, and the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System software was used for probe intensity measurements. Probe labeling, array hybridization, and intensity measurements were performed by Asuragen (Austin, TX). Gene expression profiling was made using Affymetrix Human Genome 133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip array. This microarray contains over 54,000 probe sets representing over 47,000 transcripts and variants, including 38,500 well characterized human genes. Intensity signals from the hybridized GeneChips were analyzed using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software to generate CEL (fluorescence intensity) files. The quality of hybridization signals was assessed using the array outlier percentage as determined by the dChip (version 1.3) software (27Li C. Hung Wong W.

In addition, microarray signals were evaluated for the presence of 60 liver-specific genes (Gene Enrichment Profiler) as well as six short half-life RNA transcripts (SMAD7, IL10RA, CXCR4, GATA3, MYC, RB1) to ensure that the microarray signals were not compromised by selective loss of liver-specific transcripts. CEL files were normalized at the probe level by using the robust multichip average method (28Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar). This method fits a robust linear model to the probe level data, analyzing each hybridized chip within the context of other chips in the experiment. The average intensity of each probe was expressed as log2. Statistical analysis of gene expression data as well as gene set comparison analysis were performed using the R statistics-based BRB Array Tools (version 3.8) developed by Dr. Richard Simon and Amy Peng Lam (29Simon R. Lam A. Li M.C. Ngan M. Menenzes S. Zhao Y. Cancer Inform. 2007; 3: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), and GeneSpring software (Agilent Technologies, CA). Initial filtering and subsetting of gene expression data were performed based on a 1.5-fold change from the median in at least 25% of the arrays and showing a log intensity variation of p < 0.001. A total of 1570 probe sets, which represents 1115 genes, passed the filtering criteria and were retained for subsequent statistical analysis. Regression analysis of the time series (i.e. 30, 90, and 180 min) expression data among the four liver cell culture groups (Control, Spor (wild-type sporozoites), IrradSpor (radiation-attenuated sporozoites), and SalGld (salivary gland)) indicated that effects of sporozoite exposure time on gene expression changes within each group were minimal, and that the effects of different treatments (i.e. Control, SalGld, Spor, and IrradSpor) were the predominant contributor to gene expression changes. Therefore, in subsequent statistical analysis, we grouped datasets from the three time points for each treatment group together, and treated them as replicates within each treatment group. Hierarchical clustering analysis using these genes showed that study samples can be grouped into three broad aggregated clusters representative of treatment conditions: Control, SalGld, and Spor with IrradSpor together, indicating that gene expression changes caused by Spor and IrradSpor exposure were very similar (Fig. 2A). Gene expression changes, at least until 180 min post-infection (the longest time point studied), indicated that hepatic cell responses to malaria sporozoite infection were nearly identical, whether sporozoites were irradiated or not. Principal component analysis of the data (Fig. 2B) also clustered study samples into three well defined groups, with Spor and IrradSpor grouping together. These analyses highlighted the close similarity between liver gene transcriptional responses to Spor and IrradSpor, and their significant differences from Control and SalGld groups. Altogether, a total of 951 genes that were differentially expressed among the four treatment classes were identified using a univariate random variance model F-test. A post hoc pairwise comparison was then used to identify the subset of genes differentially regulated between different pairs of infection groups, and results are summarized in Fig. 3A. Of the 426 genes altered in the Spor group (compared with Control), 107 genes were regulated with a >2-fold change in either direction, with 36 genes up-regulated and 71 genes down-regulated. In the IrradSpor group (compared with Control), 426 genes were differentially expressed, of which 24 genes were up-regulated and 100 genes down-regulated. Sporozoite-infected groups and the SalGld group had more down-regulated genes than up-regulated genes when compared with the Control group. This showed that non-sporozoite containing salivary gland extract alone (SalGld) can induce gene expression changes when added to HepG2-A16 cell cultures (Scatterplot of 951 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 3The abbreviations used are: DEGdifferentially expressed geneCSPcircumsporozoite proteinHSPGheparin sulfate proteoglycanHCVhepatitis C virus. for each pairwise comparison; Fig. 3B, panel III). Gene expression changes induced by Spor and IrradSpor treatments were almost identical (Fig. 3B, panel V). differentially expressed gene circumsporozoite protein heparin sulfate proteoglycan hepatitis C virus. DEGs from pairwise comparisons identified regulated genes (relative to Control) that were unique to each of the three treatment groups (Spor, IrradSpor, and SalGld). Fig. 4 demonstrates that 57 genes were uniquely regulated in the Spor group (relative to Control), compared with 65 and 232 genes for IrradSpor and SalGld, respectively. Pairwise comparison between the Spor and SalGld groups identified 742 selectively altered genes from wild-type sporozoite infection alone (supplemental Table S1), 244 genes up-regulated and 227 genes down-regulated at >2-fold following sporozoite infection (Fig. 5A). DEGs were defined using Gene Ontology annotations, to infer the biological relevance of these DEGs to sporozoite invasion of liver cells, and the major Gene Ontology categories involved were those associated with mitotic cell cycle regulation, chromatin packaging and remodeling, immunity and defense, protein proteolysis, and intracellular protein trafficking. DEGs were also mapped to KEGG (30Kanehisa M. Goto S. Kawashima S. Okuno Y. Hattori M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D277-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and BioCarta pathways (supplementary Table S2) to understand their differential regulation within the context of biological pathways and functional inter-relationships. The functional families involved were those associated with antigen processing and presentation, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, glycerolipid metabolism, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, cell communication, MAPK-signaling pathway, fatty acid metabolism, cell adhesion molecules, xenobiotics metabolism by cytochrome P450 and pathways associated with immune system and defense, as well as cell cycle and DNA replication pathways (Table 1).TABLE 1Functional classification of genes differentially expressed genes between the Spor and SalGld groups using KEGG and Biocarta pathwaysPathwayPathway descriptionNumber of genesp value1hsa04612Antigen processing and presentation130.0000132hsa04120Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis50.00002033hsa00561Glycerolipid metabolism60.00002444hsa04110Cell cycle260.00015565hsa04512Extracellular matrix-receptor interaction70.0001866hsa01430Cell communication60.0001717hsa04010MAPK signaling pathway130.00000138hsa00071Fatty acid metabolism50.0000159hsa04940Type I diabetes mellitus50.000418310hsa04514Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)80.000114511hsa00010Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis80.000034912hsa04610Complement and coagulation cascades110.000172313hsa04810Regulation of actin cytoskeleton70.000026714hsa04650Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity50.000462515hsa00240Pyrimidine metabolism90.000017516hsa04640Hematopoietic cell lineage60.0000117hsa04060Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction120.000081718hsa00230Purine metabolism70.000013319hsa04510Focal adhesion70.000151120hsa04540Gap junction50.000249421hsa04350TGF-β signaling pathway80.000418422hsa00564Glycerophospholipid metabolism60.000506823hsa04310Wnt signaling pathway70.000009524h_g1PathwayCell cycle: G1/S checkpoint60.000294225h_mcmPathwayCDK regulation of DNA replication80.000369126h_pparaPathwayMechanism of gene regulation by peroxisome proliferators via PPARα80.0003646 Open table in a new tab Expressions of 18 genes were highly differentially regulated (>5-fold change) between Spor and SalGld (Fig. 5A and supplemental Table S1). Three (NDC80, SPC25, NCAPG) of the four Spor up-regulated genes encode nuclear proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle phase during mitosis. The other up-regulated gene (KIF20A) encodes for a kinesin-like motor protein that interacts with the GTP-bound forms of RAB6A and RAB6B to regulate transport of Golgi vesicles along microtubules. Interestingly, a recent study on 62 Gabonese children with varying severity of malaria (31Kalmbach Y. Rottmann M. Kombila M. Kremsner P.G. Beck H.P. Kun J.F. J. Infect. Dis. 2010; 202: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) found that 10 genes, including KIF20A, located in chromosomal region 5q31–33, were strongly correlated with malaria caused by parasites expressing specific subtypes of P. falciparum erythrocyte surface protein 1. Significantly, KIF20A expression was increased and positively correlated with the upsA P. falciparum erythrocyte surface protein 1 var. gene subtype. Of the 14 highly down-regulated genes, 10 were for secreted proteins that were either cytokines/chemokines (GDF15, CTGF, CCL20, CXCL2) or binding proteins (S100P, CP, IGFBP1, TTR, AZGP1). Another gene, SERPINE1, encodes for the serine protease inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1) of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase, and functions principally in fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, and cell migration. In addition, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 has an important anti-parasitic effector function and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1-deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to P. chabaudi blood-stage malaria (32Krücken J. Dkhil M.A. Braun J.V. Schroetel R.M. El-Khadragy M. Carmeliet P. Mossmann H. Wunderlich F. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Other highly down-regulated genes were CYP1A1, MAFF, TUBB2B, and ITIH3. The cytochrome P450 enzymes are monooxygenases that catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and the synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. Expression and activities of some of these liver enzymes are known to be differentially regulated in malaria. For example, cytochrome P450 family 1, subfamily A enzymes (CYP1A) are reduced in mouse malaria models 2–6 days following infection corresponding to the period of peak parasitemia (33Carvalho R.S. Friedrich K. De-Oliveira A.C. Suarez-Kurtz G. Paumgartten F.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 616: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34De-Oliveira A.C. Carvalho R.S. Paixão F.H. Tavares H.S. Gueiros L.S. Siqueira C.M. Paumgartten F.J. Malar. J. 2010; 9: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In our human liver infection model, down-regulation of liver CYP1A1 expression occurred very early (<30 min) after sporozoite infection, and is isoform-specific, because expression of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 remained unchanged. This discrepancy may be due to species differences in malaria parasite-host interactions. Tubulin, the product of the TUBB2B gene, is an important constituent of microtubules that act as scaffolds to determine cell shape and as a backbone for cell organelles and vesicles to move. ITIH3 is part of the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor family of structurally related plasma serine protease inhibitors involved in extracellular matrix stabilization, and may act as a carrier of hyaluronan in serum or as a binding protein between hyaluronan and other matrix proteins to regulate the localization, synthesis, and degradation of hyaluronan. MAFF is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that lacks a transactivation domain and, because it can both homodimerize with itself and heterodimerize with other leucine-zipper transcription factors, it is a transcriptional regulator. Its role in malaria is unknown. A pairwise comparison between the Spor and IrradSpor groups were made using the list of 951 DEGs obtained from the initial analysis of variance analysis (Fig. 5B), to determine the subset of hepatocyte genes whose expressions were differentially affected by wild-type sporozoites compared with irradiated sporozoites. Twenty-nine genes were differentially affected by irradiation of malarial sporozoites (Table 2); all were up-regulated in IrradSpor compared with Spor (supplemental Fig. S1). Seven of those genes (ATAD2, ZNF83, SMARCA4,"
https://openalex.org/W2034802019,"The testes of preadolescent boys appear to be dormant, as they produce only trace levels of testosterone [1]. However, they release supra-adult levels of Müllerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS, anti-Müllerian hormone) and lesser levels of inhibin B (InhB), for unknown reasons [2], [3]. Boys have a variable rate of maturation, which on average is slower than girls. The height of children relative to their parents is an index of their maturity [4], [5]. We report here that a boy's level of MIS and InhB is stable over time and negatively correlates with his height and his height relative to his parent's height. This suggests that boy's with high levels of MIS and InhB are short because they are immature, rather than because they are destined to be short men. The levels of MIS and InhB in the boys did not correlate with known hormonal modulators of growth, and were additive with age and the growth hormone/IGF1 axis as predictors of a boy's height. If MIS and InhB were causal regulators of maturity, then the inter-boy differences in the levels of these hormone produces variation in maturation equivalent to 18-months of development. MIS and InhB may thus account for most of the variation in the rate of male development. If boys lacked these hormones, then an average 5-year-old boy would be over 5 cm taller than age-matched girls, making boys almost as dimorphic as men, for height. This indicates that boys have a high growth potential that is initially suppressed by their testes. The concept of the childhood testes suppressing an adult male feature appears paradoxical. However, the growth of children requires intergenerational transfer of nutrients. Consequently, the MIS/InhB slowing of male growth may have been historically advantageous, as it would minimizes any sex bias in the maternal cost of early child rearing."
https://openalex.org/W2057309219,"Site-1 protease (S1P) is a proprotein convertase with essential functions in lipid homeostasis and unfolded protein response pathways. We previously studied a mouse model of cartilage-specific knock-out of S1P in chondroprogenitor cells. These mice exhibited a defective cartilage matrix devoid of type II collagen protein (Col II) and displayed chondrodysplasia with no endochondral bone formation even though the molecular program for endochondral bone development appeared intact. To gain insights into S1P function, we generated and studied a mouse model in which S1P is ablated in postnatal chondrocytes. Postnatal ablation of S1P results in chondrodysplasia. However, unlike early embryonic ablations, the growth plates of these mice exhibit a lack of Ihh, PTHrP-R, and Col10 expression indicating a loss of chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation and thus disruption of the molecular program required for endochondral bone development. S1P ablation results in rapid growth plate disruption due to intracellular Col II entrapment concomitant with loss of chondrocyte hypertrophy suggesting that these two processes are related. Entrapment of Col II in the chondrocytes of the prospective secondary ossification center precludes its development. Trabecular bone formation is dramatically diminished in the primary spongiosa and is eventually lost. The primary growth plate is eradicated by apoptosis but is gradually replaced by a fully functional new growth plate from progenitor stem cells capable of supporting new bone growth. Our study thus demonstrates that S1P has fundamental roles in the preservation of postnatal growth plate through chondrocyte differentiation and Col II deposition and functions to couple growth plate maturation to trabecular bone development in growing mice."
https://openalex.org/W2031241500,"Ynt1, the single high affinity nitrate and nitrite transporter of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, is regulated by the quality of nitrogen sources. Preferred nitrogen sources cause Ynt1 dephosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, endocytosis, and vacuolar degradation. In contrast, under nitrogen limitation Ynt1 is phosphorylated and sorted to the plasma membrane. We show here the involvement of the Ser/Thr kinase HpNpr1 in Ynt1 phosphorylation and regulation of Ynt1 levels in response to nitrogen source quality and the availability of carbon. In Δnpr1, Ynt1 phosphorylation does not take place, although Ynt1 ubiquitin conjugates increase. As a result, in this strain Ynt1 is sorted to the vacuole, from both plasma membrane and the later biosynthetic pathway in nitrogen-free conditions and nitrate. In contrast, overexpression of NPR1 blocks down-regulation of Ynt1, increasing Ynt1 phosphorylation at Ser-244 and -246 and reducing ubiquitinylation. Furthermore, Npr1 is phosphorylated in response to the preferred nitrogen sources, and indeed it is dephosphorylated in nitrogen-free medium. Under conditions where Npr1 is phosphorylated, Ynt1 is not and vice versa. We show for the first time that carbon starvation leads to Npr1 phosphorylation, whereas Ynt1 is dephosphorylated and degraded in the vacuole. Rapamycin prevents this, indicating a possible role of the target of rapamycin signaling pathway in this process. We concluded that Npr1 plays a key role in adapting Ynt1 levels to the nitrogen quality and availability of a source of carbon."

So far it has been commonly accepted that non-overlapping interfaces allow a given protein to bind other proteins simultaneously while no collisions occur between the binding protein structures. To test this assumption, we performed a comprehensive analysis of structural protein interactions to detect potential collisions. Our results did not indicate cases of biologically relevant collisions in the Protein Data Bank of protein structures. However, we discovered a number of collisions that originate from alternative protein conformations or quaternary structures due to different experimental conditions."
