https://openalex.org/W2001624721,"The potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is produced in the rumens of ruminant animals from hydrogen produced during microbial degradation of ingested feed. The natural animal-to-animal variation in the amount of CH4 emitted and the heritability of this trait offer a means for reducing CH4 emissions by selecting low-CH4 emitting animals for breeding. We demonstrate that differences in rumen microbial community structure are linked to high and low CH4 emissions in sheep. Bacterial community structures in 236 rumen samples from 118 high- and low-CH4 emitting sheep formed gradual transitions between three ruminotypes. Two of these (Q and S) were linked to significantly lower CH4 yields (14.4 and 13.6 g CH4/kg dry matter intake [DMI], respectively) than the third type (H; 15.9 g CH4/kg DMI; p<0.001). Low-CH4 ruminotype Q was associated with a significantly lower ruminal acetate to propionate ratio (3.7±0.4) than S (4.4±0.7; p<0.001) and H (4.3±0.5; p<0.001), and harbored high relative abundances of the propionate-producing Quinella ovalis. Low-CH4 ruminotype S was characterized by lactate- and succinate-producing Fibrobacter spp., Kandleria vitulina, Olsenella spp., Prevotella bryantii, and Sharpea azabuensis. High-CH4 ruminotype H had higher relative abundances of species belonging to Ruminococcus, other Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Catabacteriaceae, Coprococcus, other Clostridiales, Prevotella, other Bacteroidales, and Alphaproteobacteria, many of which are known to form significant amounts of hydrogen. We hypothesize that lower CH4 yields are the result of bacterial communities that ferment ingested feed to relatively less hydrogen, which results in less CH4 being formed."

Here we report that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) secrete soluble factor TGF-β1 to support BBB integrity. Firstly, we prepared conditioned media from OPC cultures and added them to cerebral endothelial cultures. Our pharmacological experiments showed that OPC-conditioned media increased expressions of tight-junction proteins and decreased in vitro BBB permeability by activating TGB-β-receptor-MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Secondly, our immuno-electron microscopic observation revealed that in neonatal mouse brains, OPCs attach to cerebral endothelial cells via basal lamina. And finally, we developed a novel transgenic mouse line that TGF-β1 is knocked down specifically in OPCs. Neonates of these OPC-specific TGF-β1 deficient mice (OPC-specific TGF-β1 partial KO mice: PdgfraCre/Tgfb1flox/wt mice or OPC-specific TGF-β1 total KO mice: PdgfraCre/Tgfb1flox/flox mice) exhibited cerebral hemorrhage and loss of BBB function. Taken together, our current study demonstrates that OPCs increase BBB tightness by upregulating tight junction proteins via TGF-β signaling. Although astrocytes and pericytes are well-known regulators of BBB maturation and maintenance, these findings indicate that OPCs also play a pivotal role in promoting BBB integrity."

It is unclear to what extent this relates to actual changes in taste function or to changes in appetite and food liking and how these changes affect dietary intake and nutritional status.This prospective, repeated measures cohort study recruited participants from three oncology clinics. Women (n = 52) prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy underwent standardised testing of taste perception, appetite and food liking at six time points to measure change from baseline. Associations between taste and hedonic changes and nutritional outcomes were examined.Taste function was significantly reduced early in chemotherapy cycles (p<0.05) but showed recovery by late in the cycle. Ability to correctly identify salty, sour and umami tastants was reduced. Liking of sweet food decreased early and mid-cycle (p<0.01) but not late cycle. Liking of savory food was not significantly affected. Appetite decreased early in the cycle (p<0.001). Reduced taste function was associated with lowest kilojoule intake (r = 0.31; p = 0.008) as was appetite loss with reduced kilojoule (r = 0.34; p = 0.002) and protein intake (r = 0.36; p = 0.001) early in the third chemotherapy cycle. Decreased appetite early in the third and final chemotherapy cycles was associated with a decline in BMI (p = <0.0005) over the study period. Resolution of taste function, food liking and appetite was observed 8 weeks after chemotherapy completion. There was no association between taste change and dry mouth, oral mucositis or nausea.The results reveal, for the first time, the cyclical yet transient effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on taste function and the link between taste and hedonic changes, dietary intake and nutritional outcomes. The results should be used to inform reliable pre-chemotherapy education."
https://openalex.org/W2045688896,"Background Visceral obesity is associated with higher occurrence of cardiovascular events. There are few studies about the accuracy of anthropometric clinical indicators, using Computed Tomography (CT) as the gold standard. We aimed to determine the accuracy of anthropometric clinical indicators for discrimination of visceral obesity. Methods Cross-sectional study with 191 adults and elderly of both sexes. Variables: area of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) identified by CT, Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), Conicity index (C index), Lipid Accumulation Product (LAP) and Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI). ROC analyzes. Results There were a strong correlation between adiposity indicators and VAT area. Higher accuracy of C index and WHtR (AUC≥0.81) than the LAP and the VAI was observed. The higher AUC of LAP and VAI were observed among elderly with areas of 0.88 (CI: 0.766–0.944) and 0.83 (CI: 0.705–0.955) in men and 0.80 (CI: 0.672–0.930) and 0.71 (CI: 0.566–0.856) in women, respectively. The cutoffs of C index were 1.30 in elderly, in both sexes, with sensitivity ≥92%, the LAP ranged from 26.4 to 37.4 in men and from 40.6 to 44.0 in women and the VAI was 1.24 to 1.45 (sens≥76.9%) in men and 1.46 to 1.84 in women. Conclusion Both the anthropometric indicators, C Index and WHtR, as well as LAP and VAI had high accuracy in visceral obesity discrimination. So, they are effective in cardiovascular risk assessment and in the follow-up for individual and collective clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2046076623,"The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is poorly understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has now been recognized as a pathogenic event in many chronic diseases. However, ER stress has not been studied in CP, although pancreatic acinar cells seem to be especially vulnerable to ER dysfunction because of their dependence on high ER volume and functionality. Here, we aim to investigate ER stress in CP, study its pathogenesis in relation to trypsinogen activation (widely regarded as the key event of pancreatitis), and explore its mechanism, time course, and downstream consequences during pancreatic injury. CP was induced in mice by repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis (AP) based on caerulein hyperstimulation. ER stress leads to activation of unfolded protein response components that were measured in CP and AP. We show sustained up-regulation of unfolded protein response components ATF4, CHOP, GRP78, and XBP1 in CP. Overexpression of GRP78 and ATF4 in human CP confirmed the experimental findings. We used novel trypsinogen-7 knock-out mice (T(-/-)), which lack intra-acinar trypsinogen activation, to clarify the relationship of ER stress to intra-acinar trypsinogen activation in pancreatic injury. Comparable activation of ER stress was seen in wild type and T(-/-) mice. Induction of ER stress occurred through pathologic calcium signaling very early in the course of pancreatic injury. Our results establish that ER stress is chronically activated in CP and is induced early in pancreatic injury through pathologic calcium signaling independent of trypsinogen activation. ER stress may be an important pathogenic mechanism in pancreatitis that needs to be explored in future studies."

The cellular and molecular mechanisms that result in increased injury in aged tendons are not well established but are thought to result in altered matrix turnover. However, little attempt has been made to fully characterize the tendon proteome nor determine how the abundance of specific tendon proteins changes with aging and/or injury. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the protein profile of normal SDFTs from young and old horses using label-free relative quantification to identify differentially abundant proteins and peptide fragments between age groups. The protein profile of injured SDFTs from young and old horses was also assessed. The results demonstrate distinct proteomic profiles in young and old tendon, with alterations in the levels of proteins involved in matrix organization and regulation of cell tension. Furthermore, we identified several new peptide fragments (neopeptides) present in aged tendons, suggesting that there are age-specific cleavage patterns within the SDFT. Proteomic profile also differed between young and old injured tendon, with a greater number of neopeptides identified in young injured tendon. This study has increased the knowledge of molecular events associated with tendon aging and injury, suggesting that maintenance and repair of tendon tissue may be reduced in aged individuals and may help to explain why the risk of injury increases with aging.

https://openalex.org/W2034706269,"The cancer stem cell (CSC) model suggests that a small subpopulation of cancer cells possesses the ability to self-renew and give rise to malignant progeny that drive cancer progression. Recent reports have also proposed the existence of certain extra- or intracellular signals that allow cancer progenitors to dynamically revert to a stem cell state. However, the mechanisms underlying cancer cell plasticity and CSC expansion are not entirely clear. Our previous studies using a hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) transgenic mouse model demonstrated that hyaluronan overproduction caused rapid development of aggressive breast carcinoma at a high incidence. Thus, we hypothesize that hyaluronan overproduction may accelerate cancer progression by expanding CSC subpopulations during cancer development. Primary cancer cells were established from mammary tumors developed in the transgenic mice and subjected to the Hoechst 33342 dye exclusion assay to sort side population (SP) from non-side population (non-SP) cells. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the enrichment of CD44high/CD24low CSC-like cells in the SP fraction of hyaluronan-overproducing cancer cells. This subpopulation exhibited several characteristics that were similar to CSCs, including cancer-initiating and mammosphere-forming abilities. Excess hyaluronan production drove the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process defined as the loss of epithelial phenotypes, up-regulation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related transcriptional factors Snail and Twist. Inhibition of TGF-β-Snail signaling or silencing of Twist expression abrogated the entrance into a stem cell state. Taken together, our findings suggest that hyaluronan overproduction allows plastic cancer cell populations to revert to stem cell states via Twist and the TGF-β-Snail signaling axis.

The existence of CSCs was first demonstrated in solid tumors by Al-Hajj et al. (3.Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

They found that this subpopulation only was highly tumorigenic when injected into immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice, whereas the remaining bulk of cancer cells had no such ability. Although recent technological advancements and putative surface markers have enabled us to identify and characterize CSCs, the fundamental aspects of the mechanisms that govern the conversion of malignant cells into CSCs are still poorly understood for most types of cancers. cancer stem cell side population epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition extracellular matrix hyaluronan conditional transgenic mice quantitative RT-PCR 4-hydroxytamoxifen delta Neo-like cell mouse mammary tumor virus 4-methylumbelliferone high molecular weight. Increasing evidence has suggested that cancer cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) acquire stem-like cell signatures, such as self-renewing ability (4.Mani S.A. Guo W.

Settleman J. EMT, cancer stem cells and drug resistance: an emerging axis of evil in the war on cancer.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 4741-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). EMT is a key biological process during embryonic morphogenesis in which cells undergo a developmental switch from a polarized epithelial phenotype to a mesenchymal phenotype (6.Acloque H. Adams M.S. Fishwick K. Bronner-Fraser M. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions: the importance of changing cell state in development and disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The onset of EMT is typically associated with the acquisition of spindle cell morphology in combination with the down-regulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Recent studies have identified several transcriptional factors as capable of regulating this process. Among them, Twist and Snail have emerged as the most promising candidates of EMT “master genes” (7.Barrallo-Gimeno A.

Microenvironmental signals provoke EMT as well, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), whose activities are dysregulated during malignant cancer progression, has also been shown to play an important role in EMT (9.Massagué J. TGFβ in cancer.Cell. 2008; 134: 215-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3040) Google Scholar). Like normal stem cells, CSCs rely on a specialized microenvironment called a CSC niche wherein they retain their exclusive abilities to self-renew and give rise to differentiated progenitor cells. The complex interplay between the cancer and host cells comprising the cancer microenvironment is orchestrated by a multitude of complex signaling networks that are mediated by cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM). Accordingly, the CSC niche is believed to play a crucial role in controlling the molecular and biological CSC profiles, and its malignant alterations have been implicated in expansion of the CSC subpopulation and cancer propagation (10.Borovski T. De Sousa E Melo F. Vermeulen L. Medema J.P. Cancer stem cell niche: the place to be.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Cancer development and progression are often accompanied with extensive remodeling of the ECM in the cancer microenvironment. Hyaluronan (HA) is a major constituent of ECM whose increased deposition within cancers has been correlated with cancer aggressiveness and adverse clinical outcome in humans (11.Anttila M.A. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Syrjänen K.J. Saarikoski S.V. Kosma V.M.

HA biosynthesis, which is critical in establishing its biological function, is regulated by three mammalian HA synthases as follows: Has1, Has2, and Has3. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the up-regulation of Has gene expression in aggressive and metastatic cancers (15.Bernert B. Porsch H. Heldin P.

Furthermore, our in vivo study using a conditional transgenic (cTg) mouse model allowing Has2 overexpression in breast cancer has demonstrated that HA overproduction by malignant cells caused rapid development of aggressive breast carcinoma at a high incidence (17.Koyama H. Hibi T. Isogai Z. Yoneda M. Fujimori M. Amano J. Kawakubo M. Kannagi R. Kimata K. Taniguchi S. Itano N.

In Has2-overexpressing tumors, cancer cells acquired an EMT phenotype characterized by the down-regulation of E-cadherin and increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Given the potential importance of EMT in CSC conversion, it would be of particular interest to study whether HA overproduction gave rise to CSCs by inducing EMT in cancer cells. Here, we utilized Has2 cTg mice to elucidate the unique HA-dependent mechanisms that govern CSC conversion. Has2 cTg breast cancer model mice were generated as described previously (17.Koyama H.

The cells were washed, resuspended in cold PBS supplemented with 1% FBS, and then filtered through cell strainers. A total of 10,000 viable cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software version 5.1. Total RNA from breast carcinoma cells was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), and cDNA was synthesized with the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time PCR for the murine Has2 gene was performed as described previously (17.Koyama H. Hibi T. Isogai Z. Yoneda M. Fujimori M. Amano J. Kawakubo M. Kannagi R. Kimata K. Taniguchi S.

TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used for the gene expression analyses of TGF-β (Mm03024053_m1), TNF-α (Mm00443260_g1), Snail (Mm00441533_g1), and Twist1 (Mm00442036_m1). The real time PCR condition for gene expression was as follows: one cycle at 94 °C for 30 s; 40 cycles at 94 °C for 3 s, and 60 °C for 25 s. Relative mRNA expression was normalized using GAPDH expression. Breast carcinoma cells were seeded into a 4-well Nunc Lab-TekII Chamber Slide (5 × 104 cells/well, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and cultured for 3 days. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by permeabilization with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA, and incubated with an anti-E-cadherin antibody (1:200 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) in PBS containing 1% BSA for 60 min. The specimens were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen) in PBS containing 1% BSA for 60 min. Each sample was mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing DAPI. Images were captured using a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Jena, Germany). The mammosphere formation assay was performed as described previously (19.Klopp A.H.

Mesenchymal stem cells promote mammosphere formation and decrease E-cadherin in normal and malignant breast cells.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of 5,000 cells were seeded into 24-well ultralow attachment plates (Corning Glass) and cultured in serum-free minimal essential medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan), 20 ng/ml EGF (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and B27 (Invitrogen). The treated cells were replenished with fresh medium every 3 days and cultured for 7 days. At the end of culturing, the number of spheres with a size of 75 µm or more was counted under a phase contrast microscope. Has2ΔNeo and Has2+Neo SP cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution and injected subcutaneously into 6-week-old female BALB/c nude mice (n = 6 per group, CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at 10-fold serial dilutions from 1 × 105 to 1 × 102 cells. Tumor incidences were calculated 22 days after inoculation. Tumor diameters were measured every 3 days with digital calipers, and the tumor volume was calculated by the formula: Volume = (width)2 × length/2. Control Has2+Neo cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and cultured for 24 h. The cells were treated with 100 µg/ml high molecular weight (HMW)-HA, HA oligosaccharides of a molecular size of 8 kDa, and tetrasaccharides for 7 and 30 days. After the treatment, the cells were analyzed for expression of EMT-related genes and CSC numbers. Has2ΔNeo parental and SP cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and cultured for 2 days. The medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.2% FBS, and the cells were treated with either 0–20 µm SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) for 30 min or 0–20 µm SB431542 (TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-βRI) inhibitor, Sigma) for 6 h. After the preparation of whole cell lysates, protein samples were analyzed for the expression and phosphorylation of Smad2 and p38 MAPK by Western blot analysis. For qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence, Has2ΔNeo parental and SP cells were treated with 10 µm SB431542 or SB202190 for 2 days. For flow cytometric analysis, Has2ΔNeo parental and SP cells were treated with 10 µm SB431542 or SB202190 for 7 days. Has2ΔNeo cells were treated with 20 µm GN25 (p53-Snail binding inhibitor, Calbiochem) for 2 days and analyzed for E-cadherin localization by immunofluorescence. qRT-PCR was performed to analyze Snail and Twist expression. For mammosphere formation assay, Has2ΔNeo cells were pretreated with 20 µm GN25 for 2 days and cultured for an additional 7 days. Has2ΔNeo cells were treated with 20 µm GN25 for 7 days and then analyzed for CD24 and CD44 expression by flow cytometry. Has2ΔNeo cells were treated with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at 300 or 600 µm for 7 days and analyzed CD44 and CD24 expression by flow cytometry. For HA measurement, Has2ΔNeo cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Cells were pretreated with 4-MU (300 or 600 µm) for 24 h to eliminate pre-existing HA and then cultured into fresh medium containing 4-MU for an additional 2 days. HA concentrations in the conditioned media were measured by a competitive ELISA-like assay. Breast carcinoma cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque, Osaka, Japan). Protein concentration was determined with a Pierce Microplate BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein samples (2 µg) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels. After protein transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica MA), the membranes were blocked with Blocking-One solution (Nacalai Tesque) at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with primary antibodies against phospho-Smad2, Smad2, phospho-p38 MAPK, or p38 MAPK (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology) at room temperature for 60 min. Afterward, the membranes were washed with TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology) for 60 min. The immunocomplexes were visualized with Western blotting detection reagents (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Detection of chemiluminescent signals was performed on an ImageQuant LAS4000 Mini Luminescent Image Analyzer (GE Healthcare). Breast carcinoma cells were seeded into 6-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) and cultured for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 0.2% FBS. Twenty four hours later, the condition medium was collected, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to pellet debris, and stored at −80 °C. TGF-β and TNF-α were measured using mouse TGF-β and TNF-α FlowCytomix Simplex kits (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant lentivirus particles were produced by co-transfecting the Lenti-X 293T cell line (Takara Bio) with Twist-siRNA3 (Addgene plasmid 1784) which carries the shRNA of murine Twist, together with packaging constructs (Lentiviral Packaging Systems, Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Control lentiviruses composed of nontargeting shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as a negative control. For viral infection, regular medium was replaced with culture medium containing 4 µg/ml Polybrene. Has2ΔNeo cells were then exposed to lentiviruses for 8 h and further cultured for 2 days. Stable clones were selected in the presence of 2.5 µg/ml puromycin dihydrochloride. Recombinant retrovirus particles were produced by co-transfecting a highly transfectable GP2-293 cell line with the MSCV CreERT2 puro (Addgene plasmid 22776) retroviral vector, together with packaging constructs (Retroviral Packaging Systems, Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Has2+Neo parental and SP cells were then exposed to retroviruses for 8 h and further cultured for 2 days. Stable clones were selected in the presence of 2.5 µg/ml puromycin dihydrochloride. Neu carcinoma cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. Cells were transfected with the pEXneo, pEXneo mHas2, or pEXneo mHas2 (W354Y) plasmids, as described previously (20.Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T.

Plasmid transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 400 µg/ml G418. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test. Results are reported as mean ± S.D. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We have previously established Has2 cTg mice that allow Cre recombinase-dependent Has2 overexpression (17.Koyama H. Hibi T.

In Has2ΔNeo mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the MMTV promoter, deletion of the Neo cassette and subsequent Has2 overexpression were successfully achieved by Cre-mediated recombination of the transgene in spontaneous mammary tumors (Fig. 1A). In contrast, Has2 gene expression from the transgene was silent in control Has2+Neo transgenic mice due to a lack of Cre recombinase expression. We observed that HA production in mammary tumors was 6-fold greater in Has2ΔNeo mice than in control Has2+Neo mice. Our in vivo studies using these transgenic mice further demonstrated that HA overproduction by cancer cells caused rapid development of aggressive breast carcinoma (17.Koyama H. Hibi T. Isogai Z. Yoneda M. Fujimori M. Amano J. Kawakubo M. Kannagi R. Kimata K. Taniguchi S. Itano N.

To assess this notion, we isolated Has2-overexpressing Has2ΔNeo and control Has2+Neo cancer cells from primary mammary tumors (18.Koyama H. Kobayashi N. Harada M. Takeoka M. Kawai Y. Sano K.

The primary cultures of these cells were then examined for breast cancer initiating CD44high/CD24low subpopulations by flow cytometric analysis. The CD44high/CD24low subpopulation accounted for 30.4 and 0.9% of whole Has2ΔNeo and Has2+Neo cancer cells, respectively (Fig. 1B). Like CD44high/CD24low cells, SP cells that have the unique capacity to efflux lipophilic fluorescent dyes have been shown to represent primitive CSC-like populations (22.Kondo T. Setoguchi T. Taga T.

Here, we isolated SP and non-SP from parental Has2ΔNeo and Has2+Neo cells using the Hoechst efflux assay to further characterize CSCs. SP cells were defined as cells that lost dye efflux ability after treatment with fumitremorgin C, a specific ABCG2 transporter inhibitor (Fig. 1C). The non-SP cells were isolated as a cell population that was strongly stained with the Hoechst dye. The proportion of the SP in Has2ΔNeo cancer cells was higher than that in Has2+Neo cancer cells (Fig. 1C). We next examined Has2 expression and HA production in these fractions. Both Has2ΔNeo SP and non-SP cells expressed higher levels of Has2 mRNA and produced a greater concentration of HA compared with control Has2+Neo SP and non-SP cells (Fig. 1D). To define the CSC characteristics of SP cells, we examined the cell surface expression of CD44 and CD24. CD44high/CD24low cells were enriched in the SP fractions of both Has2ΔNeo and Has2+Neo cells as compared with non-SP fractions (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the initially negligible proportion of CD44high/CD24low cells gradually increased after several passages in the non-SP fraction of Has2ΔNeo cells (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2111261024,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the immune system. DCs present antigens to CD8 and CD4 T cells in the context of class I or II MHC. Recent evidence suggests that autophagy, a conserved intracellular degradation pathway, regulates class II antigen presentation. In vitro studies have shown that deletion of autophagy-related genes reduced antigen presentation by APCs to CD4 T cells. In vivo studies confirmed these findings in the context of infectious diseases. However, the relevance of autophagy-mediated antigen presentation in autoimmunity remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that loss of autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) in DCs ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4 T cell-mediated mouse model of multiple sclerosis, by reducing in vivo priming of T cells. In contrast, severity of hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity, in which CD8 T cells and NK cells play major roles, was unaffected. Administration of the autophagy-lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine, before EAE onset, delayed disease progression and, when administered after the onset, reduced disease severity. Our data show that autophagy is required in DCs for induction of EAE and suggest that autophagy might be a potential target for treating CD4 T cell-mediated autoimmune conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2063747393,"The wetlands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are believed to play an important role in global nutrient cycling, but the composition and diversity of microorganisms in this ecosystem are poorly characterized. An understanding of the effects of geography and microtopography on microbial populations will provide clues to the underlying mechanisms that structure microbial communities. In this study, we used pyrosequencing-based analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences to assess and compare the composition of soil microbial communities present in hummock and hollow soils from three wetlands (Dangxiong, Hongyuan and Maduo) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the world’s highest plateau. A total of 36 bacterial phyla were detected. Proteobacteria (34.5% average relative abundance), Actinobacteria (17.3%) and Bacteroidetes (11%) had the highest relative abundances across all sites. Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes were also relatively abundant (1–10%). In addition, archaeal sequences belonging to Euryarchaea, Crenarchaea and Thaumarchaea were detected. Alphaproteobacteria sequences, especially of the order Rhodospirillales, were significantly more abundant in Maduo than Hongyuan and Dangxiong wetlands. Compared with Hongyuan soils, Dangxiong and Maduo had significantly higher relative abundances of Gammaproteobacteria sequences (mainly order Xanthomonadales). Hongyuan wetland had a relatively high abundance of methanogens (mainly genera Methanobacterium, Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta) and methanotrophs (mainly Methylocystis) compared with the other two wetlands. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) indicated that the microbial community structure differed between locations and microtopographies and canonical correspondence analysis indicated an association between microbial community structure and soil properties or geography. These insights into the microbial community structure and the main controlling factors in wetlands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau provide a valuable background for further studies on biogeochemical processes in this distinct ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2009042755,"CD56+ natural killer (NK) and CD56+ T cells, from sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are more cytotoxic to highly susceptible NK targets than those from control subjects. Whether the same is true in lung parenchyma, and if NK activity actually contributes to emphysema progression are unknown. To address these questions, we performed two types of experiments on lung tissue from clinically-indicated resections (n = 60). First, we used flow cytometry on fresh single-cell suspension to measure expression of cell-surface molecules (CD56, CD16, CD8, NKG2D and NKp44) on lung lymphocytes and of the 6D4 epitope common to MICA and MICB on lung epithelial (CD326+) cells. Second, we sequentially isolated CD56+, CD8+ and CD4+ lung lymphocytes, co-cultured each with autologous lung target cells, then determined apoptosis of individual target cells using Annexin-V and 7-AAD staining. Lung NK cells (CD56+ CD3-) and CD56+ T cells (CD56+ CD3+) were present in a range of frequencies that did not differ significantly between smokers without COPD and subjects with COPD. Lung NK cells had a predominantly ""cytotoxic"" CD56+ CD16+ phenotype; their co-expression of CD8 was common, but the percentage expressing CD8 fell as FEV1 % predicted decreased. Greater expression by autologous lung epithelial cells of the NKG2D ligands, MICA/MICB, but not expression by lung CD56+ cells of the activating receptor NKG2D, correlated inversely with FEV1 % predicted. Lung CD56+ lymphocytes, but not CD4+ or CD8+ conventional lung T cells, rapidly killed autologous lung cells without additional stimulation. Such natural cytotoxicity was increased in subjects with severe COPD and was unexplained in multiple regression analysis by age or cancer as indication for surgery. These data show that as spirometry worsens in COPD, CD56+ lung lymphocytes exhibit spontaneous cytotoxicity of autologous structural lung cells, supporting their potential role in emphysema progression.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00281229."
https://openalex.org/W2008586030,"Placental cell growth depends on an adaptable combination of an endogenous developmental program and the exogenous influence of maternal growth factors, both of which may be influenced by microRNA (miR)-dependent effects on gene expression. We have previously shown that global miR suppression in placenta accelerates proliferation and enhances levels of growth factor signaling mediators in cytotrophoblast. This study aimed to identify miRs involved in regulating placental growth. An initial array revealed 58 miR species whose expression differs between first trimester, when cytotrophoblast proliferation is rapid, and term, by which time proliferation has slowed. In silico analysis defined potential growth-regulatory miRs; among these, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-377, and hsa-let-7a were predicted to target known placental growth genes and were higher at term than in the first trimester, so they were selected for further analysis. Overexpression of miR-377 and let-7a, but not miR-145, in first trimester placental explants significantly reduced basal cytotrophoblast proliferation and expression of ERK and MYC. PCR arrays, in silico analysis, Western blotting, and 3′-UTR luciferase reporter assays revealed targets of miR-145 within the insulin-like growth factor axis. Analysis of proliferation in placental explants overexpressing miR-145 demonstrated its role as a mediator of insulin-like growth factor-induced trophoblast proliferation.

Fetal growth depends on the ability of the placenta to supply nutrients adequate to meet fetal demand, which increases as gestation progresses. Placental growth, especially in early gestation, is a prerequisite of a high-capacity transport interface. The outermost syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta has a high turnover, with terminally differentiated and apoptotic elements shedding continuously into maternal circulation. Underlying cytotrophoblast progenitor cells divide, differentiate, and fuse with the syncytium, so their proliferation is of obvious importance for placental growth, especially during the first trimester, although turnover slows as pregnancy progresses (1Arnholdt H. Meisel F. Fandrey K. Löhrs U. Proliferation of villous trophoblast of the human placenta in normal and abnormal pregnancies.Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1991; 60: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Altered rates of cytotrophoblast proliferation are associated with different pathologies; levels are enhanced with increased fetal growth (macrosomia) and diminished in fetal growth restriction (2Jansson T.

Here we profiled placentas with different rates of trophoblast proliferation (early versus late pregnancy) to uncover differentially expressed miRs. In silico network analysis identified miRs that influence the expression of components of nodal signaling pathways, and functional studies revealed a role for three of these miRs in regulating placental growth. All tissue was collected following maternal informed consent with approval from our Local Research Ethics Committee. Late first trimester (8–12-week) placentas were obtained at elective surgical or elective medical termination and dissected under sterile conditions into 5-mm3 fragments. Three pieces, selected at random, were transferred into a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine and further dissected into 5-mm3 explants for immediate use in all experimental procedures described below. Term (37–42-week) placentas were collected from elective Caesarean sections within 30 min of delivery. Three areas of each placenta were sampled using a transparent sheet bearing a systematic array of biopsy windows, and then chorionic, non-anchoring villi were dissected from these areas and carefully rinsed in sterile PBS for use in experiments to profile miR expression. Total RNA was isolated from first trimester or term tissue using a mirVANA miR isolation kit (Ambion). Quality was verified by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer profile. Aliquots of RNA from all first trimester and term samples were pooled to generate a common reference sample used to normalize data across all arrays in the study. 800 ng of total RNA from individual and reference samples was labeled with Hy3TM and Hy5TM fluorescent label, respectively, using the miRCURYTM LNA Array power labeling kit (Exiqon) following the procedure described by the manufacturer. The Hy3TM-labeled samples and a Hy5TM-labeled reference RNA sample were mixed pairwise and hybridized to the miRCURYTM LNA array version 11.0 (Exiqon), which contains capture probes targeting all human miRs registered in the miRBASE version 13.0 at the Sanger Institute (9Griffiths-Jones S.

The hybridization was performed according to the miRCURYTM LNA array manual using a Tecan HS4800 hybridization station. After hybridization, the microarray slides were scanned and stored at ozone <2.0 ppb to prevent bleaching of the fluorescent dyes. The microarray slides were scanned (Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner System, Agilent Technologies, Inc.), and image analysis was carried out using ImaGene version 8.0 software (BioDiscovery, Inc.). The quantified signals were background-corrected (Normexp with offset value of 10 (10Ritchie M.E. Silver J. Oshlack A. Holmes M. Diyagama D. Holloway A. Smyth G.K.

The data were exported to Microsoft Excel worksheets, log2-transformed, and analyzed for differentially expressed miRs using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM; version 3.01, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) in a two-class unpaired design. From SAM, the -fold change for each miR with the associated q value was determined. Only miRs with a significance of p < 0.005 between the groups (first trimester and term) were included in the heat map analysis, and these all fulfill the Bonferroni correction (a safeguard against false positives). Array data were validated by assessing the expression of individual miRs using the miRCURYTM LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR system (Exiqon) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 25 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Universal cDNA Synthesis kit (Exiqon) which allows polyadenylation and reverse transcription of all miRs within the sample into cDNA in a single reaction step. Individual miRs were then detected using LNA-enhanced miR-specific primer sets (Exiqon; Table 1). The relative amount of miR was normalized to 5 S rRNA, and -fold changes in miR expression from control (mean of all ΔCt values) were calculated as 2(−ΔΔCt), where ΔΔCt = ΔCt control − ΔCt treated sample and ΔCt = CtmiR − Ct5 S rRNA. PCRs were performed in duplicate using a Stratagene MX3000P real-time PCR machine. Data from first trimester and term placentas were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.TABLE 1miR-specific primersmiRTarget sequenceHsa-miR-29aUAGCACCAUCUGAAAUCGGUUAHsa-miR-145GUCCAGUUUUCCCAGGAAUCCCUHsa-miR-675UGGUGCGGAGAGGGCCCACAGUGHsa-miR-377AUCACACAAAGGCAACUUUUGUHsa-let-7aCUAUACAAUCUACUGUCUUUCHsa-miR-125bACGGGUUAGGCUCUUGGGAGCUHsa-miR-143UGAGAUGAAGCACUGUAGCUCHsa-miR-143-3pGGUGCAGUGCUGCAUCUCUGGU Open table in a new tab A data set containing miR expression profiles of first trimester and term placental samples (generated by miR array analysis) was uploaded into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity® Systems). The functional analysis tool identified the most relevant biological functions and the right-tailed Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the probability that each of the biological functions assigned to the data set is due to chance alone. Data were expressed as inverse log (−log) of the p value. Only biological functions with −log (p value) > 1.3 (equivalent to p < 0.05) were considered for further analysis. Differentially expressed miRs were overlaid in the Ingenuity® Knowledge Base onto a global molecular network to algorithmically generate a defined network (limited to 35 molecules) based on connectivity. Larger, merged networks were then generated using information contained in the Ingenuity® Knowledge Base. miRs, target genes, and gene products are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented by an edge (line). All edges are supported by at least one reference from the published literature or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity® Knowledge Base. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of up-regulation (red) or down-regulation (green). To assess the expression of miRs in different populations of cells within the human placenta, total RNA was extracted from placental tissue homogenates that contain all of the different cell types present in the human placenta or from a panel of different placental cell lines or primary cells. The following cells were used. BeWo, JAR, and JEG cell lines were cultured as described previously and were used as models for villous trophoblast (11Aplin J.D.

The primary cells used were cytotrophoblast and stromal cells freshly isolated from human placenta using protocols described previously (13Harris L.K. Keogh R.J. Wareing M. Baker P.N. Cartwright J.E.

Briefly, placental tissue was dissected, weighed, and washed thoroughly in MEM. Approximately 6 g of tissue was transferred to 20 ml of MEM containing 0.125% (v/v) trypsin, 1.3 mm EDTA (Invitrogen), and 0.4 mg/ml DNase I, grade I (Sigma), and incubated for 35 min at 37 °C, with occasional resuspension to remove trophoblast cells. Cells were harvested, and the enzymatic treatment was repeated. Remaining tissue pieces were removed by filtration (100 µm) and used for subsequent isolation of stromal cells. Trophoblast cells were loaded on a Percoll gradient, and after centrifugation at 1800 × g for 30 min, cytotrophoblast cells were collected from the 30–45% range. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in serum-free DMEM/F-12, and plated on Matrigel-coated flasks. For stromal cell isolations, tissue free from trophoblast was washed (3 × 5 min) in DMEM containing 2.5 mg/ml collagenase and 2 mg/ml hyaluronidase and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The suspension was allowed to settle under gravity and centrifuged for 20 min at 700 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of MEM. The cell suspension was then loaded onto 25/60% Percoll and centrifuged for 30 min at 670 × g. The band of stromal cells and aggregates was removed from the Percoll, added to 35 ml of MEM, and centrifuged for 15 min at 100 × g. The pellet was then resuspended in DMEM, and cells were plated onto flasks coated with rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences). RNA was extracted from cells, and levels of miRs were assessed by qPCR as described previously. Pre-miR precursors for hsa-miR-377, hsa-let-7a, and hsa-miR-145 (Table 2) (Ambion) were transfected into placental explants (200–500 nm) with an Amaxa Nucleofector using basic primary mammalian epithelial cell Nucleofector buffer solution and Program U007 (Amaxa Biosystems) as described previously (15Forbes K. Desforges M. Garside R. Aplin J.D. Westwood M. Methods for siRNA-mediated reduction of mRNA and protein expression in human placental explants, isolated primary cells and cell lines.Placenta. 2009; 30: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following transfection, first trimester tissue explants were cultured on 1% agarose-coated 24-well tissue culture plates for up to 96 h in 20% O2 at 37 °C. Overexpression of the pre-miRs was confirmed by qPCR using specific primers as described above. The effect of the three pre-miR sequences was compared with that of three controls: untreated tissue (control), tissue exposed to transfection procedure alone (mock), or tissue transfected with CyTM3-labeled pre-miR precursor negative control (Pre-C; 200–500 nm; Ambion), which has no identifiable effects on expression of known mammalian miRs. These controls formed the baselines for the evaluation of the effect of pre-miR precursors on protein expression and cell function.TABLE 2miR precursor mimetic sequencesmiRMature miR sequenceHsa-miR-145GUCCAGUUUUCCCAGGAAUCCCUHsa-miR-377AUCACACAAAGGCAACUUUUGUHsa-let-7aUGAGGUAGUAGGUUGUAUAGUU Open table in a new tab Placental explants transfected with pre-miR mimetics or negative controls were maintained in culture for 48 h. BrdU (100 µm) and vehicle or IGF-I (10 nm) were added, and then explants were cultured for a further 24 h. Tissue was fixed and processed for immunohistochemistry, and levels of proliferation were assessed using monoclonal anti-Ki67 (MIB-1 clone, 1:100; DakoCytomation Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK) or anti-BrdU (clone BU-33, 1:500; Sigma) antibodies followed by biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; DakoCytomation Ltd.) antibody and avidin-peroxidase. Levels of cytotrophoblast proliferation were then determined as described previously (3Forbes K. Westwood M. Baker P.N. Aplin J.D.

Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1313-C1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and expressed as a percentage of total cytotrophoblast number. Comparisons between groups were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by planned contrasts. Data were considered significant at p < 0.05. Freshly isolated placental tissue or tissue exposed to miR mimetics for up to 48 h was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunohistochemistry analysis as described previously (15Forbes K. Desforges M. Garside R. Aplin J.D. Westwood M. Methods for siRNA-mediated reduction of mRNA and protein expression in human placental explants, isolated primary cells and cell lines.Placenta. 2009; 30: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of key signaling molecules was examined using rabbit polyclonal ERK1/2 antibody (1:50; Cell Signaling Technologies Inc.) or mouse monoclonal c-MYC (1:100) followed by incubation with biotinylated swine anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DakoCytomation, Cambridgeshire, UK). Staining was visualized using the avidin-peroxidase method with hemotoxylin counterstain as described previously (3Forbes K. Westwood M. Baker P.N. Aplin J.D.

Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1313-C1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To confirm the effect of miR overexpression on protein expression, 48-h post-transfection lysates of placental explants were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (5Forbes K. West G. Garside R. Aplin J.D. Westwood M. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SRC homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2, is a crucial mediator of exogenous insulin-like growth factor signaling to human trophoblast.Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 4744-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 50 µg of protein from each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting with antiserum specific for ERK1/2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500), c-MYC (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500), p38 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000), and cyclin D1 (mouse monoclonal, 1:1000), all from Cell Signaling Technologies Inc., or IGF1R (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and InsightBio). Immune complexes were visualized by probing with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG followed by ECL. ImageJ software was used to quantitate bands. Membranes were stripped (0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 2.5) and reprobed with an antibody specific for β-actin (1:5000; Sigma clone AC-15) in order to confirm equal protein loading. Total RNA was isolated from first trimester placental explants exposed to pre-miR-145 (500 nm) for 48 h, and 200 ng of RNA was converted to cDNA using the AffinityScript cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene), as described above. cDNA from five individual experiments was pooled and then applied to a PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler PCR array (SABiosciences, Qiagen, UK) and quantified by qPCR using a Stratagene MX3000P real-time PCR machine and Stratagene Brilliant SYBR Green I qPCR Mastermix, with 5-carboxy-x-rhodamine as a passive reference dye. mRNA levels were analyzed using RT2 Profiler PCR data analysis software (version 3.5; SABiosciences, Qiagen). Data were normalized against a panel of housekeeping genes (Hprt, Hsp90aba, and Gapdh) present within the array plates, and expressed relative to control (negative pre-miR control). Changes were considered significant when they varied by ≥2-fold. Western blotting on individual samples was performed to validate the array and to confirm that changes in mRNA expression were accompanied by a change in protein expression. pmiRTarget vectors containing sense or mutated MAPK1 and MYC 3′-UTR sequences cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene and an empty vector control were purchased from OriGene Technologies. Vectors containing 3′-UTR constructs for IGF1R were not commercially available and therefore were prepared as follows. A 42-bp oligonucleotide and a complementary antisense strand were designed using TargetScan to correspond to the highly conserved region of IGF1R 3′-UTR to which miR-145 is predicted to bind (3804–3810 bp, ATTATTATTTGGGGGAACTGGAC). Control oligonucleotides containing a mutated miR-145 seed region within the IGF1R 3′-UTR (ATTATTATTTGGGGGAAAAGGA) were included as a control. piRGLO Dual Luciferase miRNA target expression vector was linearized with PmeI and XbaI (Roche Applied Science) restriction enzymes, and oligonucleotides (4 ng) were annealed to the linearized vector (50 ng) using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Following ligation, the vector was transformed into XL-10 Gold Ultra competent cells (Agilent Technologies) and then purified using a Qiagen miniprep kit (Thermo Scientific). NotI digestion was performed to confirm that the sequences had been inserted correctly. To assess interaction between miRs and their candidate target genes, 3′-UTR vectors (50 ng) and a pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega) were transfected into first trimester placental explants alone or in combination with non-targeting or miR-specific mimics (100 nm). Untreated and mock-transfected samples and the empty pmiR-GLO vector were included as controls. 24 h after transfection, tissue was washed twice in PBS and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Relative amounts of Firefly luciferase were read using the Orion L microplate luminometer (Titertek) using the luciferase reporter assay (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of β-galactosidase were assessed using the mammalian β-galactosidase assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Levels of luciferase were normalized to β-galactosidase in each sample to control for transfection efficiency. miRs with the potential for regulating growth were initially identified by array-profiling placentas from early and last pregnancy because the rate of trophoblast proliferation is known to be exponentially higher in first trimester than at term (16Heazell A.E. Lacey H.A. Jones C.J. Huppertz B. Baker P.N. Crocker I.P.

Confirmatory qPCR analysis was carried out on eight miRs showing elevated expression in term tissue and one with the opposite pattern of expression (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Validation of miRNA arrays. Total RNA was isolated from fresh first trimester and term human placental tissue, and qPCR analysis was performed, using individual miRNA primer sets for hsa-miR-29a (A), hsa-let-7a (B), hsa-miR-125b (C), hsa-miR-145 (D), hsa-miR-143 (E), hsa-miR-143–3p (F), hsa-miR-377 (G), and hsa-miR-675 (H). Data were normalized to 5 S rRNA expression and are presented as median and range mRNA and were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Data were considered significant if p < 0.05. Results shown are representative of at least five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) IPA was used to identify genetic networks involving differentially expressed miRs. Seven individual networks were identified (data not shown), but the majority of miRs within the functional headings of cell-cell signaling and interaction, cellular development, and cellular growth and proliferation (Fig. 3A) fell into three genetic networks, which, in turn, merged into a single larger interacting network (Fig. 3B). The large network is bridged by nodal molecules, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK1/ERK-2), MYC, NFκB, and AKT; MAPK1/ERK-2 and MYC (highlighted by blue squares in Fig. 3B) are recognized components of promitogenic signaling pathways (18Grandori C.

The mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK1 and ERK2.Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). Three miRs that were central to the large mitogenic signaling network (miR-377, let-7a, and miR-145) were selected for further analysis as candidate regulators of placental growth. Attempts to localize miRs in first trimester placental tissue using in situ hybridization were unsuccessful due to high levels of background staining in the trophoblast (data not shown). Therefore, to verify that these miRs are expressed in trophoblast, trophoblast cell lines and freshly isolated primary cytotrophoblasts were assessed by qPCR (Fig. 4). miR-377, let-7a, and miR-145 were detected in primary cytotrophoblast, and consistent with the array data, all three miRs were higher at term than in the first trimester. First trimester placental tissue explants, in which cytotrophoblast proliferation is sustained for >72 h, as indicated by Ki67 immunopositivity or BrdU incorporation, were then transfected with the three miR precursors (Fig. 5, A–C) to determine whether higher levels (as observed in term pl"

However, its expression and function in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the clinicopathologic significance of ATF4 in ESCC and its potential role in ESCC invasion and metastasis. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrated that ATF4 overexpression is correlated with multiple malignant characteristics and indicates poor prognosis in ESCC patients. ATF4 expression was an independent factor that affected the overall survival of patients with ESCC after surgical resection. ATF4 promoted cell invasion and metastasis by promoting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-7 expression, while its silencing significantly attenuated these activities both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions/Significance We report that ATF4 is a potential biomarker for ESCC prognosis and that its dysregulation may play a key role in the regulation of invasion and metastasis in ESCC cells. The targeting of ATF4 may provide a new strategy for blocking ESCC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2114173955,"The genus Fragaria encompasses species at ploidy levels ranging from diploid to decaploid. The cultivated strawberry, Fragaria×ananassa, and its two immediate progenitors, F. chiloensis and F. virginiana, are octoploids. To elucidate the ancestries of these octoploid species, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using intron-containing sequences of the nuclear ADH-1 gene from 39 germplasm accessions representing nineteen Fragaria species and one outgroup species, Dasiphora fruticosa. All trees from Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analyses showed two major clades, Clade A and Clade B. Each of the sampled octoploids contributed alleles to both major clades. All octoploid-derived alleles in Clade A clustered with alleles of diploid F. vesca, with the exception of one octoploid allele that clustered with the alleles of diploid F. mandshurica. All octoploid-derived alleles in clade B clustered with the alleles of only one diploid species, F. iinumae. When gaps encoded as binary characters were included in the Maximum Parsimony analysis, tree resolution was improved with the addition of six nodes, and the bootstrap support was generally higher, rising above the 50% threshold for an additional nine branches. These results, coupled with the congruence of the sequence data and the coded gap data, validate and encourage the employment of sequence sets containing gaps for phylogenetic analysis. Our phylogenetic conclusions, based upon sequence data from the ADH-1 gene located on F. vesca linkage group II, complement and generally agree with those obtained from analyses of protein-encoding genes GBSSI-2 and DHAR located on F. vesca linkage groups V and VII, respectively, but differ from a previous study that utilized rDNA sequences and did not detect the ancestral role of F. iinumae."
https://openalex.org/W1995152795,"Sleep disruption strongly influences daytime functioning; resultant sleepiness is recognised as a contributing risk-factor for individuals performing critical and dangerous tasks. While the relationship between sleep and sleepiness has been heavily investigated in the vulnerable sub-populations of shift workers and patients with sleep disorders, postpartum women have been comparatively overlooked. Thirty-three healthy, postpartum women recorded every episode of sleep and wake each day during postpartum weeks 6, 12 and 18. Although repeated measures analysis revealed there was no significant difference in the amount of nocturnal sleep and frequency of night-time wakings, there was a significant reduction in sleep disruption, due to fewer minutes of wake after sleep onset. Subjective sleepiness was measured each day using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale; at the two earlier time points this was significantly correlated with sleep quality but not to sleep quantity. Epworth Sleepiness Scores significantly reduced over time; however, during week 18 over 50% of participants were still experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Score ≥12). Results have implications for health care providers and policy makers. Health care providers designing interventions to address sleepiness in new mothers should take into account the dynamic changes to sleep and sleepiness during this initial postpartum period. Policy makers developing regulations for parental leave entitlements should take into consideration the high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness experienced by new mothers, ensuring enough opportunity for daytime sleepiness to diminish to a manageable level prior to reengagement in the workforce."
https://openalex.org/W1982818428,"X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the epigenetic transcriptional silencing of an X-chromosome during the early stages of embryonic development in female eutherian mammals. XCI assures monoallelic expression in each cell and compensation for dosage-sensitive X-linked genes between females (XX) and males (XY). DNA methylation at the carbon-5 position of the cytosine pyrimidine ring in the context of a CpG dinucleotide sequence (5meCpG) in promoter regions is a key epigenetic marker for transcriptional gene silencing. Using computational analysis, we revealed an extragenic tandem GAAA repeat 230-bp from the landmark CpG island of the human X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 RP2 promoter whose 5meCpG status correlates with XCI. We used this RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat to develop an allele-specific 5meCpG-based PCR assay that is highly concordant with the human androgen receptor (AR) exonic tandem CAG repeat-based standard HUMARA assay in discriminating active (Xa) from inactive (Xi) X-chromosomes. The RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat contains neutral features that are lacking in the AR disease-linked tandem CAG repeat, is highly polymorphic (heterozygosity rates approximately 0.8) and shows minimal variation in the Xa/Xi ratio. The combined informativeness of RP2/AR is approximately 0.97, and this assay excels at determining the 5meCpG status of alleles at the Xp (RP2) and Xq (AR) chromosome arms in a single reaction. These findings are relevant and directly translatable to nonhuman primate models of XCI in which the AR CAG-repeat is monomorphic. We conducted the RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat assay in the naturally occurring chimeric New World monkey marmoset (Callitrichidae) and found it to be informative. The RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat will facilitate studies on the variable phenotypic expression of dominant and recessive X-linked diseases, epigenetic changes in twins, the physiology of aging hematopoiesis, the pathogenesis of age-related hematopoietic malignancies and the clonality of cancers in human and nonhuman primates."
https://openalex.org/W2031719569,"Apoptosis in macrophages is responsible for immune-depression and pathological effects during malaria. Phagocytosis of PRBC causes induction of apoptosis in macrophages through release of cytosolic factors from infected cells. Heme polymer or β-hematin causes dose-dependent death of macrophages with LC50 of 132 µg/ml and 182 µg/ml respectively. The toxicity of hemin or heme polymer was amplified several folds in the presence of non-toxic concentration of methemoglobin. β-hematin uptake in macrophage through phagocytosis is crucial for enhanced toxicological effects in the presence of methemoglobin. Higher accumulation of β-hematin is observed in macrophages treated with β-hematin along with methemoglobin. Light and scanning electron microscopic observations further confirm accumulation of β-hematin with cellular toxicity. Toxicological potentiation of pro-oxidant molecules toward macrophages depends on generation of H2O2 and independent to release of free iron from pro-oxidant molecules. Methemoglobin oxidizes β-hematin to form oxidized β-hematin (βH*) through single electron transfer mechanism. Pre-treatment of reaction mixture with spin-trap Phenyl-N-t-butyl-nitrone dose-dependently reverses the β-hematin toxicity, indicates crucial role of βH* generation with the toxicological potentiation. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and DNA fragmentation analysis indicate that macrophage follows an oxidative stress dependent apoptotic pathway to cause death. In summary, current work highlights mutual co-operation between methemoglobin and different pro-oxidant molecules to enhance toxicity towards macrophages. Hence, methemoglobin peroxidase activity can be probed for subduing cellular toxicity of pro-oxidant molecules and it may in-turn make up for host immune response against the malaria parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2070288161,"Mounting evidence suggests that human pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase 1) plays important roles in vivo, ranging from regulating blood clotting and inflammation to directly counteracting tumorigenic cells. Understanding these putative roles has been pursued with continual comparisons of human RNase 1 to bovine RNase A, an enzyme that appears to function primarily in the ruminant gut. Our results imply a different physiology for human RNase 1. We demonstrate distinct functional differences between human RNase 1 and bovine RNase A. Moreover, we characterize another RNase 1 homolog, bovine brain ribonuclease, and find pronounced similarities between that enzyme and human RNase 1. We report that human RNase 1 and bovine brain ribonuclease share high catalytic activity against double-stranded RNA substrates, a rare quality among ribonucleases. Both human RNase 1 and bovine brain RNase are readily endocytosed by mammalian cells, aided by tight interactions with cell surface glycans. Finally, we show that both human RNase 1 and bovine brain RNase are secreted from endothelial cells in a regulated manner, implying a potential role in vascular homeostasis. Our results suggest that brain ribonuclease, not RNase A, is the true bovine homolog of human RNase 1, and provide fundamental insight into the ancestral roles and functional adaptations of RNase 1 in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2029901594,"Proteins can switch between different conformations in response to stimuli, such as pH or temperature variations, or to the binding of ligands. Such plasticity and its kinetics can have a crucial functional role, and their characterization has taken center stage in protein research. As an example, Topoisomerases are particularly interesting enzymes capable of managing tangled and supercoiled double-stranded DNA, thus facilitating many physiological processes. In this work, we describe the use of a cantilever-based nanomotion sensor to characterize the dynamics of human topoisomerase II (Topo II) enzymes and their response to different kinds of ligands, such as ATP, which enhance the conformational dynamics. The sensitivity and time resolution of this sensor allow determining quantitatively the correlation between the ATP concentration and the rate of Topo II conformational changes. Furthermore, we show how to rationalize the experimental results in a comprehensive model that takes into account both the physics of the cantilever and the dynamics of the ATPase cycle of the enzyme, shedding light on the kinetics of the process. Finally, we study the effect of aclarubicin, an anticancer drug, demonstrating that it affects directly the Topo II molecule inhibiting its conformational changes. These results pave the way to a new way of studying the intrinsic dynamics of proteins and of protein complexes allowing new applications ranging from fundamental proteomics to drug discovery and development and possibly to clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2079214651,"Background The emergence of community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has caused a change in MRSA epidemiology worldwide. In the Middle East, the persistent spread of CA-MRSA isolates that were associated with multilocus sequence type (MLST) clonal complex 80 and with staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV (CC80-MRSA-IV), calls for novel approaches for infection control that would limit its spread. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, the epidemiology of CC80-MRSA-IV was investigated in Jordan and Lebanon retrospectively covering the period from 2000 to 2011. Ninety-four S. aureus isolates, 63 (67%) collected from Lebanon and 31 (33%) collected from Jordan were included in this study. More than half of the isolates (56%) were associated with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), and 73 (78%) were Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) positive. Majority of the isolates (84%) carried the gene for exofoliative toxin d (etd), 19% had the Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 gene (tst), and seven isolates from Jordan had a rare combination being positive for both tst and PVL genes. spa typing showed the prevalence of type t044 (85%) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) recognized 21 different patterns. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed the prevalence (36%) of a unique resistant profile, which included resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and fusidic acid (SKF profile). Conclusions The genetic diversity among the CC80 isolates observed in this study poses an additional challenge to infection control of CA-MRSA epidemics. CA-MRSA related to ST80 in the Middle East was distinguished in this study from the ones described in other countries. Genetic diversity observed, which may be due to mutations and differences in the antibiotic regimens between countries may have led to the development of heterogeneous strains. Hence, it is difficult to maintain “the European CA-MRSA clone” as a uniform clone and it is better to designate as CC80-MRSA-IV isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2155056478,"Background Cryptococcal meningitis can best be diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid India ink microscopy, cryptococcal antigen detection, or culture. These require invasive lumbar punctures. The utility of cryptococcal antigen detection in saliva is unknown. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the point-of-care cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay (CrAg LFA) in saliva. Methods We screened HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy naïve persons with symptomatic meningitis (n = 130) and asymptomatic persons with CD4+<100 cells/µL entering into HIV care (n = 399) in Kampala, Uganda. The diagnostic performance of testing saliva was compared to serum/plasma cryptococcal antigen as the reference standard. Results The saliva lateral flow assay performance was overall more sensitive in symptomatic patients (88%) than in asymptomatic patients (27%). The specificity of saliva lateral flow assay was excellent at 97.8% in the symptomatic patients and 100% in asymptomatic patients. The degree of accuracy of saliva in diagnosing cryptococcosis and the level of agreement between the two sample types was better in symptomatic patients (C-statistic 92.9, κ-0.82) than in asymptomatic patients (C-statistic 63.5, κ-0.41). Persons with false negative salvia CrAg tests had lower levels of peripheral blood CrAg titers (P<0.001). Conclusion There was poor diagnostic performance in testing saliva for cryptococcal antigen, particularly among asymptomatic persons screened for preemptive treatment of cryptococcosis."
https://openalex.org/W2036446302,"Diffusion MRI and tractography allow for investigation of the architectural configuration of white matter in vivo, offering new avenues for applications like presurgical planning. Despite the promising outlook, there are many pitfalls that complicate its use for (clinical) application. Amongst these are inaccuracies in the geometry of the diffusion profiles on which tractography is based, and poor alignment with neighboring profiles. Recently developed contextual processing techniques, including enhancement and well-posed geometric sharpening, have shown to result in sharper and better aligned diffusion profiles. However, the research that has been conducted up to now is mainly of theoretical nature, and so far these techniques have only been evaluated by visual inspection of the diffusion profiles. In this work, the method is evaluated in a clinically relevant application: the reconstruction of the optic radiation for epilepsy surgery. For this evaluation we have developed a framework in which we incorporate a novel scoring procedure for individual pathways. We demonstrate that, using enhancement and sharpening, the extraction of an anatomically plausible reconstruction of the optic radiation from a large amount of probabilistic pathways is greatly improved in three healthy controls, where currently used methods fail to do so. Furthermore, challenging reconstructions of the optic radiation in three epilepsy surgery candidates with extensive brain lesions demonstrate that it is beneficial to integrate these methods in surgical planning."
https://openalex.org/W2023142385,"The chicken domestication process represents a typical model of artificial selection, and gives significant insight into the general understanding of the influence of artificial selection on recognizable phenotypes. Two Japanese domesticated chicken varieties, the fighting cock (Shamo) and the long-crowing chicken (Naganakidori), have been selectively bred for dramatically different phenotypes. The former has been selected exclusively for aggressiveness and the latter for long crowing with an obedient sitting posture. To understand the particular mechanism behind these genetic changes during domestication, we investigated the degree of genetic differentiation in the aforementioned chickens, focusing on dopamine receptor D2, D3, and D4 genes. We studied other ornamental chickens such as Chabo chickens as a reference for comparison. When genetic differentiation was measured by an index of nucleotide differentiation (NST) newly devised in this study, we found that the NST value of DRD4 for Shamo (0.072) was distinctively larger than those of the other genes among the three populations, suggesting that aggressiveness has been selected for in Shamo by collecting a variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In addition, we found that in DRD4 in Naganakidori, there is a deletion variant of one proline at the 24th residue in the repeat of nine prolines of exon 1. We thus conclude that artificial selection has operated on these different kinds of genetic variation in the DRD4 genes of Shamo and Naganakidori so strongly that the two domesticated varieties have differentiated to obtain their present opposite features in a relatively short period of time."
https://openalex.org/W2045985680,"The endocannabinoid ligand anandamide (AEA) is removed from the extracellular space by a process of cellular uptake followed by metabolism. In many cells, such as the RBL-2H3 cell line, inhibition of FAAH activity reduces the observed uptake, indicating that the enzyme regulates uptake by controlling the intra- : extracellular AEA concentration gradient. However, in other FAAH-expressing cells, no such effect is seen. It is not clear, however, whether these differences are methodological in nature or due to properties of the cells themselves. In consequence, we have reinvestigated the role of FAAH in gating the uptake of AEA.The effects of FAAH inhibition upon AEA uptake were investigated in four cell lines: AT1 rat prostate cancer, RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukaemia, rat C6 glioma and mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. Semi-quantitative PCR for the cells and for a rat brain lysate confirmed the expression of FAAH. No obvious expression of a transcript with the expected molecular weight of FLAT was seen. FAAH expression differed between cells, but all four could accumulate AEA in a manner inhibitable by the selective FAAH inhibitor URB597. However, there was a difference in the sensitivities seen in the reduction of uptake for a given degree of FAAH inhibition produced by a reversible FAAH inhibitor, with C6 cells being more sensitive than RBL-2H3 cells, despite rather similar expression levels and activities of FAAH. The four cell lines all expressed FABP5, and AEA uptake was reduced in the presence of the FABP5 inhibitor SB-FI-26, suggesting that the different sensitivities to FAAH inhibition for C6 and RBL2H3 cells is not due to differences at the level of FABP-5.When assayed using the same methodology, different FAAH-expressing cells display different sensitivities of uptake to FAAH inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1974468366,"To improve our ability to predict SOC mineralization response to residue and N additions in soils with different inherent and dynamic organic matter properties, a 330-day incubation was conducted using samples from two long-term experiments (clay loam Mollisols in Iowa [IAsoil] and silt loam Ultisols in Maryland [MDsoil]) comparing conventional grain systems (Conv) amended with inorganic fertilizers with 3 yr (Med) and longer (Long), more diverse cropping systems amended with manure. A double exponential model was used to estimate the size (Ca, Cs) and decay rates (ka, ks) of active and slow C pools which we compared with total particulate organic matter (POM) and occluded-POM (OPOM). The high-SOC IAsoil containing highly active smectite clays maintained smaller labile pools and higher decay rates than the low-SOC MDsoil containing semi-active kaolinitic clays. Net SOC loss was greater (2.6 g kg(-1); 8.6%) from the IAsoil than the MDsoil (0.9 g kg(-1), 6.3%); fractions and coefficients suggest losses were principally from IAsoil's resistant pool. Cropping history did not alter SOC pool size or decay rates in IAsoil where rotation-based differences in OPOM-C were small. In MDsoil, use of diversified rotations and manure increased ka by 32% and ks by 46% compared to Conv; differences mirrored in POM- and OPOM-C contents. Residue addition prompted greater increases in Ca (340% vs 230%) and Cs (38% vs 21%) and decreases in ka (58% vs 9%) in IAsoil than MDsoil. Reduced losses of SOC from residue-amended MDsoil were associated with increased OPOM-C. Nitrogen addition dampened CO2-C release. Clay type and C saturation dominated the IAsoil's response to external inputs and made labile and stable fractions more vulnerable to decay. Trends in OPOM suggest aggregate protection influences C turnover in the low active MDsoil. Clay charge and OPOM-C contents were better predictors of soil C dynamics than clay or POM-C contents."

This reaction is the second committed step in chlorophyll biosynthesis from protoporphyrin IX. Here we report the crystal structures of ChlM from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in complex with S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine at resolutions of 1.6 and 1.7 Å, respectively. The structures illustrate the molecular basis for cofactor and substrate binding and suggest that conformational changes of the two ""arm"" regions may modulate binding and release of substrates/products to and from the active site. Tyr-28 and His-139 were identified to play essential roles for methyl transfer reaction but are not indispensable for cofactor/substrate binding. Based on these structural and functional findings, a catalytic model is proposed."

Previously, we showed that the long and short forms of Aplysia PDE4 (ApPDE4), which are localized to the membranes of distinct subcellular organelles, play key roles in 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced synaptic facilitation in Aplysia sensory and motor synapses. However, the molecular mechanism of the isoform-specific distinct membrane targeting was not clear. In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism of the membrane targeting of the ApPDE4 long and short forms. We found that the membrane targeting of the long form was mediated by hydrophobic interactions, mainly via 16 amino acids at the N-terminal region, whereas the short form was targeted solely to the plasma membrane, mainly by nonspecific electrostatic interactions between their N termini and the negatively charged lipids such as the phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates PI4P and PI(4,5)P2, which are embedded in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Moreover, oligomerization of the long or short form by interaction of their respective upstream conserved region domains, UCR1 and UCR2, enhanced their plasma membrane targeting. These results suggest that the long and short forms of ApPDE4 are distinctly targeted to intracellular membranes through their direct association with the membranes via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2063026975,"Factor C, a serine protease zymogen involved in innate immune responses in horseshoe crabs, is known to be autocatalytically activated on the surface of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, but the molecular mechanism of this activation remains unknown. In this study, we show that wild-type factor C expressed in HEK293S cells exhibits a lipopolysaccharide-induced activity equivalent to that of native factor C. Analysis of the N-terminal addition, deletion, or substitution mutants shows that the N-terminal Arg residue and the distance between the N terminus and the tripartite of lipopolysaccharide-binding site are essential factors for autocatalytic activation, and that the positive charge of the N terminus may interact with an acidic amino acid(s) of the molecule to convert the zymogen into an active form. Chemical cross-linking experiments indicate that the N terminus is required to form a complex of the factor C molecules in a sufficiently close vicinity to be chemically cross-linked on the surface of lipopolysaccharides. We propose a molecular mechanism of the autocatalytic activation of the protease zymogen on lipopolysaccharides functioning as a platform to induce specific protein-protein interaction between the factor C molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2020323223,"The beneficial effects of gain-framed vs. loss-framed messages promoting health protective behaviors have been found to be inconsistent, and consideration of potential moderating variables is essential if framed health promotion messages are to be effective. This research aimed to determine the influence of highlighting autonomy (choice and freedom) and heteronomy (coercion) on the avoidance of high-calorie snacks following reading gain-framed or loss-framed health messages. In Study 1 (N = 152) participants completed an autonomy, neutral, or heteronomy priming task, and read a gain-framed or loss-framed health message. In Study 2 (N = 242) participants read a gain-framed or loss-framed health message with embedded autonomy or heteronomy primes. In both studies, snacking intentions and behavior were recorded after seven days. In both studies, when autonomy was highlighted, the gain-framed message (compared to the loss-framed message) resulted in stronger intentions to avoid high-calorie snacks, and lower self-reported snack consumption after seven days. Study 2 demonstrated this effect occurred only for participants to whom the information was most relevant (BMI>25). The results suggest that messages promoting healthy dietary behavior may be more persuasive if the autonomy-supportive vs. coercive nature of the health information is matched to the message frame. Further research is needed to examine potential mediating processes."
https://openalex.org/W2101206104,"Headache is the most common symptom associated with air pollution, but little is understood about the underlying mechanism. Nasal administration of environmental irritants activates the trigeminovascular system by a TRPA1-dependent process. This report addresses questions about the anatomical pathway involved and the function of TRP channels in this pathway. TRPV1 and TRPA1 are frequently co-localized and interact to modulate function in sensory neurons. We demonstrate here that resiniferatoxin ablation of TRPV1 expressing neurons significantly reduces meningeal blood flow responses to nasal administration of both TRPV1 and TRPA1 agonists. Accordingly resiniferatoxin also significantly reduces TRPV1 and CGRP immunostaining and TRPV1 and TRPA1 message levels in trigeminal ganglia. Sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia innervate the nasal epithelium and the meninges, but the mechanism and anatomical route by which nasal administration evokes meningeal vasodilatation is unclear. Double retrograde labeling from the nose and meninges reveals no co-localization of fluorescent label, however nasal and meningeal labeled cells are located in close proximity to each other within the trigeminal ganglion. Our data demonstrate that TRPV1 expressing neurons are important for TRPA1 responses in the nasal-meningeal pathway. Our data also suggest that the nasal-meningeal pathway is not primarily by axon reflex, but may instead result from intraganglionic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2123766672,"The 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway leads to the synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate in plastids. It is a major branch point providing precursors for the synthesis of carotenoids, tocopherols, plastoquinone and the phytyl chain of chlorophylls, as well as the hormones abscisic acid and gibberellins. Consequently, disruption of this pathway is harmful to plants. We developed an in vivo bioassay that can measure the carbon flow through the carotenoid pathway. Leaf cuttings are incubated in the presence of a phytoene desaturase inhibitor to induce phytoene accumulation. Any compound reducing the level of phytoene accumulation is likely to interfere with either one of the steps in the MEP pathway or the synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate. This concept was tested with known inhibitors of steps of the MEP pathway. The specificity of this in vivo bioassay was also verified by testing representative herbicides known to target processes outside of the MEP and carotenoid pathways. This assay enables the rapid screen of new inhibitors of enzymes preceding the synthesis of phytoene, though there are some limitations related to the non-specific effect of some inhibitors on this assay."

Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 coded by the ABCC1 gene has recently been suggested as a potential prognostic marker in breast cancer patients. This study aimed to explore tagged haplotype covering nucleotide binding domain 1 of ABCC1 in relation with corresponding transcript levels in tissues and clinical phenotype of breast cancer patients.The distribution of twelve ABCC1 polymorphisms was assessed by direct sequencing in peripheral blood DNA (n = 540).Tumors from carriers of the wild type genotype in rs35623 or rs35628 exhibited significantly lower levels of ABCC1 transcript than those from carriers of the minor allele (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively). The ABCC1 transcript levels significantly increased in the order CT-GT>CC-GT>CC-GG for the predicted rs35626-rs4148351 diplotype. Chemotherapy-treated patients carrying the T allele in rs4148353 had longer disease-free survival than those with the GG genotype (p = 0.043). On the other hand, hormonal therapy-treated patients with the AA genotype in rs35628 had significantly longer disease-free survival than carriers of the G allele (p = 0.012).Taken together, our study shows that genetic variability in the nucleotide binding domain 1 has a significant impact on the ABCC1 transcript level in the target tissue and may modify survival of breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2095211900,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted morphogen that controls the patterning and growth of various tissues in the developing vertebrate embryo, including the central nervous system. Ablation of the FK506-binding protein 38 (FKBP38) gene results in activation of the Shh signaling pathway in mouse embryos, but the molecular mechanism by which FKBP38 suppresses Shh signaling has remained unclear. With the use of a proteomics approach, we have now identified ANKMY2, a protein with three ankyrin repeats and a MYND (myeloid, Nervy, and DEAF-1)-type Zn(2+) finger domain, as a molecule that interacts with FKBP38. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that endogenous FKBP38 and ANKMY2 interact in the mouse brain. Depletion or overexpression of ANKMY2 resulted in down- and up-regulation of Shh signaling, respectively, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, combined depletion of both FKBP38 and ANKMY2 attenuated Shh signaling in these cells, suggesting that ANKMY2 acts downstream of FKBP38 to activate the Shh signaling pathway. Targeting of the zebrafish ortholog of mouse Ankmy2 (ankmy2a) in fish embryos with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide conferred a phenotype reflecting loss of function of the Shh pathway, suggesting that the regulation of Shh signaling by ANKMY2 is conserved between mammals and fish. Our findings thus indicate that the FKBP38-ANKMY2 axis plays a key role in regulation of Shh signaling in vivo."

However, its effect on the brain structure in schizophrenia is little known. We analyzed the brain structure of 36 schizophrenia patients and 18 healthy subjects with regard to rs2312147 genotype groups. Brain magnetic resonance scans for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) analysis, and genotype analysis for VRK2 rs2312147, were conducted. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Digit Symbol Test were assessed for schizophrenia patients. There was no significant difference in either GM volume or WM connectivity with regard to rs2312147 genotype in healthy subjects. In contrast, we found significant differences in the WM connectivity between rs2312147 CC and CT/TT genotype groups of schizophrenia patients. The related brain areas included the splenium of corpus callosum, the left occipital lobe WM, the internal capsule (left anterior limb and right retrolenticular part), the bilateral temporal lobe WM, the left fornix/stria terminalis, the left cingulate gyrus WM, and the left parietal lobe WM. Voxelwise correlation analysis revealed that the Digit Symbol Test scores (age corrected) correlated with the fractional anisotropy in WM tracts that previously showed significant group differences between the CT/TT and CC genotypes in the rs2312147 CT/TT genotype group, while no significant correlation was found in the CC genotype group. Our data may provide evidence for the effect of VRK2 on WM connectivity in patients with schizophrenia."

While the co-expressed and co-purified archaeal box C/D RNP was found to be fully active in a 2'-O-methylation assay, the intact human U14 box C/D RNP showed no detectable catalytic activity, consistent with the earlier findings that assembly of eukaryotic box C/D RNPs is nonspontaneous and requires additional protein factors.

https://openalex.org/W1987201769,"Ferritin is a highly-conserved iron-storage protein that has also been identified as an acute phase protein within the innate immune system. The iron-storage function is mediated through complementary roles played by heavy (H)-chain subunit as well as the light (L) in mammals or middle (M)-chain in teleosts, respectively. In this study, we report the identification of five ferritin subunits (H1, H2, M1, M2, M3) in the Atlantic salmon that were supported by the presence of iron-regulatory regions, gene structure, conserved domains and phylogenetic analysis. Tissue distribution analysis across eight different tissues showed that each of these isoforms is differentially expressed. We also examined the expression of the ferritin isoforms in the liver and kidney of juvenile Atlantic salmon that was challenged with Aeromonas salmonicida as well as in muscle cell culture stimulated with interleukin-1β. We found that each isoform displayed unique expression profiles, and in certain conditions the expressions between the isoforms were completely diametrical to each other. Our study is the first report of multiple ferritin isoforms from both the H- and M-chains in a vertebrate species, as well as ferritin isoforms that showed decreased expression in response to infection. Taken together, the results of our study suggest the possibility of functional differences between the H- and M-chain isoforms in terms of tissue localisation, transcriptional response to bacterial exposure and stimulation by specific immune factors."
https://openalex.org/W2013314533,"Background and Aims Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is induced in many forms of chronic liver disease and may promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex is a transcription factor that promotes hepatic carcinogenesis in response to cellular stress. The aim of this study was to determine the role of ER stress in the regulation of the hepatic AP-1 complex. Methods Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells and C57BL/6J mice were subjected to pharmacologic ER stress and the expression of AP-1-associated genes and proteins was assessed. To determine the role of MAPK signaling in ER stress-induced AP-1 activation, ER stress was induced in JNK- and ERK-inhibited HepG2 cells. Results Induction of ER stress promoted the activation of both Jun- and Fos-related genes and proteins of the AP-1 complex in HepG2 cells and murine liver. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in HepG2 cells completely prevented ER stress-induced activation of the fos-related components of AP-1 whereas activation of Jun-related components was only partially attenuated. Conversely, inhibition of JNK phosphorylation in HepG2 cells reduced ER stress-induced activation of Jun-related components but did not prevent activation of fos-related components. Conclusions ER stress activates the hepatic AP-1 complex via MAPK-dependent signaling pathways. ER stress-induced activation of Fos-related components is dependent primarily on ERK activation whereas ER stress-induced activation of Jun-related components is dependent primarily on JNK activation, although there is interplay between these regulatory pathways. These data implicate a novel signaling pathway by which sustained ER stress, as observed in many chronic liver diseases, may promote hepatic carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018834134,"Background Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been used to treat a variety of autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS); however its mechanism of action remains elusive. Recent work has shown that interleukin-11 (IL-11) mRNAs are upregulated by IVIg in MS patient T cells. Both IVIg and IL-11 have been shown to ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. The objective of this study was to determine whether the protective effects of IVIg in EAE occur through an IL-11 and IL-11 receptor (IL-11R)-dependent mechanism. Methods We measured IL-11 in the circulation of mice and IL-11 mRNA expression in various organs after IVIg treatment. We then followed with EAE studies to test the efficacy of IVIg in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice deficient for the IL-11 receptor (IL-11Rα−/−). Furthermore, we evaluated myelin-specific Th1 and Th17 responses and assessed spinal cord inflammation and demyelination in WT and IL-11Rα−/− mice, with and without IVIg treatment. We also examined the direct effects of mouse recombinant IL-11 on the production of IL-17 by lymph node mononuclear cells. Results IVIg treatment induced a dramatic surge (>1000-fold increase) in the levels of IL-11 in the circulation and a prominent increase of IL-11 mRNA expression in the liver. Furthermore, we found that IL-11Rα−/− mice, unlike WT mice, although initially protected, were resistant to full protection by IVIg during EAE and developed disease with a similar incidence and severity as control-treated IL-11Rα−/− mice, despite initially showing protection. We observed that Th17 cytokine production by myelin-reactive T cells in the draining lymph nodes was unaffected by IVIg in IL-11Rα−/− mice, yet was downregulated in WT mice. Finally, IL-11 was shown to directly inhibit IL-17 production of lymph node cells in culture. Conclusion These results implicate IL-11 as an important immune effector of IVIg in the prevention of Th17-mediated autoimmune inflammation during EAE."

We developed here new preclinical models for gynecologic cancers, using conditional (Cre-loxP) mice with floxed genetic alterations in Kras and Pten. The triple transgenic mice, briefly called MUC1KrasPten, express human MUC1 antigen as self and carry a silent oncogenic KrasG12D and Pten deletion mutation. Injection of Cre-encoding adenovirus (AdCre) in the ovarian bursa, oviduct or uterus activates the floxed mutations and initiates ovarian, oviductal, and endometrial cancer, respectively. Anatomical site-specific Cre-loxP recombination throughout the genital tract of MUC1KrasPten mice leads to MUC1 positive genital tract tumors, and the development of these tumors is influenced by the anatomical environment. Endometrioid histology was consistently displayed in all tumors of the murine genital tract (ovaries, oviducts, and uterus). Tumors showed increased expression of MUC1 glycoprotein and triggered de novo antibodies in tumor bearing hosts, mimicking the immunobiology seen in patients. In contrast to the ovarian and endometrial tumors, oviductal tumors showed higher nuclear grade. Survival for oviduct tumors was significantly lower than for endometrial tumors (p = 0.0015), yet similar to survival for ovarian cancer. Oviducts seem to favor the development of high grade tumors, providing preclinical evidence in support of the postulated role of fallopian tubes as the originating site for high grade human ovarian tumors."

In HD women, C variant allele of ESR1 Pvull was associated to higher vasodilatation after estradiol (1.72 vs 1.64 mm/s, p = 0.01 compared to TT homozygotes) while G894T and T-786C NOS3 polymorphisms were connected to lower increment after shear stress (15% among wild type and 10% among variant alleles, p = 0.02 and 0.04). The G variant allele of ESR1 XbaI polymorphism was associated to higher HOMA-IR (3.54 vs. 1.64, p = 0.01) in HD and higher glucose levels in healthy women (91.8 vs. 87.1 mg/dl, p = 0.01), in which increased waist and HOMA-IR were also related to the G allele in NOS3 G894T (waist 93.5 vs 88.2 cm, p = 0.02; HOMA-IR 2.89 vs 1.48, p = 0.05). ESR1 Pvull, NOS3 G894T and T-786C polymorphism analysis may be considered in HD postmenopausal women for endothelial response prediction following estrogen therapy but were not discriminatory for endothelial response in healthy women.

Lactate utilization has been implicated although no corresponding genes have been identified in the H. pylori genome. Here, we report that gene products of hp0137-0139 (lldEFG), hp0140-0141 (lctP), and hp1222 (dld) contribute to D- and L-lactate utilization in H. pylori. The three-gene unit hp0137-0139 in H. pylori 26695 encodes L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) that catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate in an NAD-dependent manner. Isogenic mutants of these genes were unable to grow on L-lactate-dependent medium. The hp1222 gene product functions as an NAD-independent D-LDH and also contributes to the oxidation of L-lactate; the isogenic mutant of this gene failed to grow on D-lactate-dependent medium. The parallel genes hp0140-0141 encode two nearly identical lactate permeases (LctP) that promote uptake of both D- and L-lactate. Interestingly an alternate route must also exist for lactate transport as the knockout of genes did not completely prevent growth on D- or L-lactate. Gene expression levels of hp0137-0139 and hp1222 were not enhanced by lactate as the carbon source. Expression of hp0140-0141 was slightly suppressed in the presence of L-lactate but not D-lactate. This study identified the genes contributing to the lactate utilization and demonstrated the ability of H. pylori to utilize both D- and L-lactate."
https://openalex.org/W1559483829,"The liberalisation of trade in services which began in 1995 under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has generated arguments for and against its potential health effects. Our goal was to explore the relationship between the liberalisation of services under the GATS and three health indicators--life expectancy (LE), under-5 mortality (U5M) and maternal mortality (MM)--since the WTO was established.This was a cross-sectional ecological study that explored the association in 2010 and 1995 between liberalisation and health (LE, U5M and MM), and between liberalisation and progress in health in the period 1995-2010, considering variables related to economic and social policies such as per capita income (GDP pc), public expenditure on health (PEH), and income inequality (Gini index). The units of observation and analysis were WTO member countries with data available for 2010 (n = 116), 1995 (n = 114) and 1995-2010 (n = 114). We conducted bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses adjusted for GDP pc, Gini and PEH. Increased global liberalisation in services under the WTO was associated with better health in 2010 (U5M: -0.358 p<0.001; MM: -0.338 p = 0.001; LE: 0.247 p = 0.008) and in 1995, after adjusting for economic and social policy variables. For the period 1995-2010, progress in health was associated with income equality, PEH and per capita income. No association was found with global liberalisation in services.The favourable association in 2010 between health and liberalisation in services under the WTO seems to reflect a pre-WTO association observed in the 1995 data. However, this liberalisation did not appear as a factor associated with progress in health during 1995-2010. Income equality, health expenditure and per capita income were more powerful determinants of the health of populations."
https://openalex.org/W1986015812,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) of metagenomic samples is becoming a standard approach to detect individual species or pathogenic strains of microorganisms. Computer programs used in the NGS community have to balance between speed and sensitivity and as a result, species or strain level identification is often inaccurate and low abundance pathogens can sometimes be missed. We have developed Taxoner, an open source, taxon assignment pipeline that includes a fast aligner (e.g. Bowtie2) and a comprehensive DNA sequence database. We tested the program on simulated datasets as well as experimental data from Illumina, IonTorrent, and Roche 454 sequencing platforms. We found that Taxoner performs as well as, and often better than BLAST, but requires two orders of magnitude less running time meaning that it can be run on desktop or laptop computers. Taxoner is slower than the approaches that use small marker databases but is more sensitive due the comprehensive reference database. In addition, it can be easily tuned to specific applications using small tailored databases. When applied to metagenomic datasets, Taxoner can provide a functional summary of the genes mapped and can provide strain level identification. Taxoner is written in C for Linux operating systems. The code and documentation are available for research applications at http://code.google.com/p/taxoner."
https://openalex.org/W2011946713,"Background Although research into the continuity and change of personality traits during a lifespan has been fairly extensive, little research has been conducted on childhood predictors of adult personality. Purpose We aimed to investigate the association between infant socioeconomic status (SES), and Eysenck personality traits in adulthood. An additional aim was to investigate whether intelligence and education may mediate this association. Methods SES of 9125 children in the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort was recorded at a 1-year examination. A subsample of this cohort, comprising 1182 individuals, participated in a follow-up at 20–34 years and was administered the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) which includes measures of neuroticism, extraversion, psychoticism and the so-called lie-scale. Associations of SES with each of the four personality traits were analysed by bivariate and partial correlations, and the mediating effects of intelligence and years of education were analysed. Results Higher SES in infancy was associated with lower neuroticism (r = −0.06; p = 0.05), lower lie-scale scores (r = −0.11; p = 0.0002), and higher psychoticism (r = 0.09; p = 0.003). However, analyses of mediation revealed no direct effect of infant SES on any of the adult personality traits, but only indirect effects mediated by intelligence and years of education, with intelligence being the main mediating factor. Conclusion Only weak associations were observed between infant SES and personality in young adulthood, and the observed associations were mediated by adult intelligence and educational level. Thus, factors associated with infant SES or family background appears to have weak direct effects on personality development."

We studied growth of the specialist aphid, Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria, and its host plant tansy, Tanacetum vulgare, under experimental addition of inorganic and organic fertilizer crossed with competition by goldenrod, Solidago canadensis. Because of evidence that competition by goldenrod is mediated by allelopathic compounds, we also added a treatment with activated carbon. Results showed that fertilization increased, and competition with goldenrod decreased, plant biomass, but this was likely mediated by resource competition. There was no evidence from the activated carbon treatment that allelopathy played a role which instead had a fertilizing effect. Aphid performance increased with higher plant biomass and depended on plant growth conditions, with fertilization and AC increasing, and plant competition decreasing aphid numbers. Feedbacks of aphids on plant performance interacted with plant growth conditions in complex ways depending on the relative magnitude of the effects on plant biomass and aphid numbers. In the basic fertilization treatment, tansy plants profited from increased nutrient availability by accumulating more biomass than they lost due to an increased number of aphids under fertilization. When adding additional fertilizer, aphid numbers increased so high that tansy plants suffered and showed reduced biomass compared with controls without aphids. Thus, the ecological cost of an infestation with aphids depends on the balance of effects of growth conditions on plant and herbivore performance. These results emphasize the importance to investigate both perspectives in plant herbivore interactions and characterize the effects of growth conditions on plant and herbivore performance and their respective feedbacks."
https://openalex.org/W2019706286,"Comorbidity among childhood mental health symptoms is common in clinical and community samples and should be accounted for when investigating etiology. We therefore aimed to uncover latent classes of mental health symptoms in middle childhood in a community sample, and to determine the latent genetic and environmental influences on those classes.The sample comprised representative cohorts of twins. A questionnaire-based assessment of mental health symptoms was used in latent class analyses. Data on 3223 twins (1578 boys and 1645 girls) with a mean age of 7.5 years were analyzed. The sample was predominantly non-Hispanic Caucasian (92.1%).Latent class models delineated groups of children according to symptom profiles--not necessarily clinical groups but groups representing the general population, most with scores in the normative range. The best-fitting models suggested 9 classes for both girls and boys. Eight of the classes were very similar across sexes; these classes ranged from a ""Low Symptom"" class to a ""Moderately Internalizing & Severely Externalizing"" class. In addition, a ""Moderately Anxious"" class was identified for girls but not boys, and a ""Severely Impulsive & Inattentive"" class was identified for boys but not girls. Sex-combined analyses implicated moderate genetic influences for all classes. Shared environmental influences were moderate for the ""Low Symptom"" and ""Moderately Internalizing & Severely Externalizing"" classes, and small to zero for other classes.We conclude that symptom classes are largely similar across sexes in middle childhood. Heritability was moderate for all classes, but shared environment played a greater role for classes in which no one type of symptom predominated."
https://openalex.org/W2037665107,"Mre11 and Rad50 form a stable complex (MR) and work cooperatively in repairing DNA double strand breaks. In the bacteriophage T4, Rad50 (gene product 46) enhances the nuclease activity of Mre11 (gene product 47), and Mre11 and DNA in combination stimulate the ATPase activity of Rad50. The structural basis for the cross-activation of the MR complex has been elusive. Various crystal structures of the MR complex display limited protein-protein interfaces that mainly exist between the C terminus of Mre11 and the coiled-coil domain of Rad50. To test the role of the C-terminal Rad50 binding domain (RBD) in Mre11 activation, we constructed a series of C-terminal deletions and mutations in bacteriophage T4 Mre11. Deletion of the RBD in Mre11 eliminates Rad50 binding but only has moderate effect on its intrinsic nuclease activity; however, the additional deletion of the highly acidic flexible linker that lies between RBD and the main body of Mre11 increases the nuclease activity of Mre11 by 20-fold. Replacement of the acidic residues in the flexible linker with alanine elevates the Mre11 activity to the level of the MR complex when combined with deletion of RBD. Nuclease activity kinetics indicate that Rad50 association and deletion of the C terminus of Mre11 both enhance DNA substrate binding. Additionally, a short peptide that contains the flexible linker and RBD of Mre11 acts as an inhibitor of Mre11 nuclease activity. These results support a model where the Mre11 RBD and linker domain act as an autoinhibitory domain when not in complex with Rad50. Complex formation with Rad50 alleviates this inhibition due to the tight association of the RBD and the Rad50 coiled-coil.

https://openalex.org/W1975482390,"Decision makers in epidemiology and other disciplines are faced with the daunting challenge of designing interventions that will be successful with high probability and robust against a multitude of uncertainties. To facilitate the decision making process in the context of a goal-oriented objective (e.g., eradicate polio by ), stochastic models can be used to map the probability of achieving the goal as a function of parameters. Each run of a stochastic model can be viewed as a Bernoulli trial in which “success” is returned if and only if the goal is achieved in simulation. However, each run can take a significant amount of time to complete, and many replicates are required to characterize each point in parameter space, so specialized algorithms are required to locate desirable interventions. To address this need, we present the Separatrix Algorithm, which strategically locates parameter combinations that are expected to achieve the goal with a user-specified probability of success (e.g. 95%). Technically, the algorithm iteratively combines density-corrected binary kernel regression with a novel information-gathering experiment design to produce results that are asymptotically correct and work well in practice. The Separatrix Algorithm is demonstrated on several test problems, and on a detailed individual-based simulation of malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2120974700,"Higher N170 amplitudes to words and to faces were recently reported for faster readers of German. Since the shallow German orthography allows phonological recoding of single letters, the reported speed advantages might have their origin in especially well-developed visual processing skills of faster readers. In contrast to German, adult readers of Hebrew are forced to process letter chunks up to whole words. This dependence on more complex visual processing might have created ceiling effects for this skill. Therefore, the current study examined whether also in the deep Hebrew orthography visual processing skills as reflected by N170 amplitudes explain reading speed differences. Forty university students, native speakers of Hebrew without reading impairments, accomplished a lexical decision task (i.e., deciding whether a visually presented stimulus represents a real or a pseudo word) and a face decision task (i.e., deciding whether a face was presented complete or with missing facial features) while their electroencephalogram was recorded from 64 scalp positions. In both tasks stronger event related potentials (ERPs) were observed for faster readers in time windows at about 200 ms. Unlike in previous studies, ERP waveforms in relevant time windows did not correspond to N170 scalp topographies. The results support the notion of visual processing ability as an orthography independent marker of reading proficiency, which advances our understanding about regular and impaired reading development."
https://openalex.org/W2063466652,"ES cells can propagate indefinitely, maintain self-renewal, and differentiate into almost any cell type of the body. These properties make them valuable in the research of embryonic development, regenerative medicine, and organ transplantation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered to have essential functions in the maintenance and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ES cells). It was reported that, strong external stimuli, such as a transient low-pH and hypoxia stress, were conducive to the formation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). AICA ribonucleotide (AICAR) is an AMP-activated protein kinase activator, which can let cells in the state of energy stress. We have demonstrated that AICAR can maintain the pluripotency of J1 mouse ES cells through modulating protein expression in our previous research, but its effects on ES cell miRNA expression remain unknown. In this study, we conducted small RNA high-throughput sequencing to investigate AICAR influence on J1 mouse ES cells by comparing the miRNA expression patterns of the AICAR-treated cells and those without treatment. The result showed that AICAR can significantly modulate the expression of multiple miRNAs, including those have crucial functions in ES cell development. Some differentially expressed miRNAs were selected and confirmed by real-time PCR. For the differently expressed miRNAs identified, further study was conducted regarding the pluripotency and differentiation associated miRNAs with their targets. Moreover, miR-134 was significantly down-regulated after AICAR treatment, and this was suggested to be directly associated with the up-regulated pluripotency markers, Nanog and Sox2. Lastly, Myc was significantly down-regulated after AICAR treatment; therefore, we predicted miRNAs that may target Myc and identified that AICAR induced up-regulation of miR-34a, 34b, and 34c can repress Myc expression in J1 mouse ES cells. Taken together, our study provide a new mechanism for AICAR in ES cells pluripotency maintenance and give insight for its usage in iPS cells generation."
https://openalex.org/W2088666792,"Efforts to improve the quality of in vitro matured oocytes by blocking germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and allowing more time for ooplasmic maturation have achieved little due to a lack of knowledge on the molecular events during GVBD blocking. Such knowledge is also important for studies aimed at regulating gene expression in maturing oocytes prior to GVBD. We studied species difference and signaling pathways leading to the carrying-over effect of GVBD blocking on post-blocking meiotic progression (PBMP). Overall, GVBD-blocking with roscovitine decelerated PBMP of mouse oocytes but accelerated that of pig oocytes. During blocking culture, whereas cyclin B of pig oocytes increased continuously, that of mouse oocytes declined first and then increased slowly. In both species, (a) whereas active CDC2A showed a dynamics similar to cyclin B, inactive CDC2A decreased continuously; (b) when oocytes were blocked in blocking medium containing cycloheximide, PBMP was decelerated significantly while cyclin B and active CDC2A decreasing to the lowest level; (c) whereas sodium vanadate in blocking medium reduced PBMP, epidermal growth factor (EGF) in blocking medium accelerated PBMP significantly with no effect on cyclin B levels. In conclusion, the EGF signaling cascade accelerated PBMP by promoting the pre-MPF (M-phase-promoting factor) to MPF conversion during GVBD blocking with roscovitine. The significant difference in PBMP observed between mouse and pig oocytes was caused by species difference in cyclin B dynamics during blocking culture as no species difference was observed in either pre-MPF to MPF conversion or the EGF signaling activity."
