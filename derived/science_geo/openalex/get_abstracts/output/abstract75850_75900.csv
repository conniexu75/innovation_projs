https://openalex.org/W1480600051,"Seven peroxidase isozymes were isolated from horseradish roots and purified to homogeneity as ascertained by chromatography, ultracentrifugation, and polyacrylamide disk electrophoresis. Purification procedures included ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography on carboxymethyl and diethylaminoethyl cellulose. Peroxidase activity in the seven isozymes accounted for 86% of the activity in the crude homogenate. No interconversions among the isozymes were detected. The two most abundant isozymes were crystallized. The seven isozymes may be segregated into two groups on the basis of their chromatographic behavior, electrophoretic migration, spectrophotometric properties, and amino acid and carbohydrate composition. Each isozyme was shown to contain protohemin IX as the prosthetic group."
https://openalex.org/W1567978295,"Chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago has been isolated in crystalline form. The prosthetic group of chloroperoxidase is ferriprotoporphyrin IX. On the basis of the heme content, the minimal molecular weight of chloroperoxidase is 40,200. On the basis of hydrodynamic measurements, the molecular weight of chloroperoxidase is approximately 42,000. Therefore, in solution at neutral pH, chloroperoxidase behaves as a monomeric species. The spectral properties of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme and also of the azide and cyanide complexes are reported. The amino acid composition of chloroperoxidase is reported. Chloroperoxidase is rich in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and serine and proline residues. These four amino acids constitute 45% of the total amino acid content. Chloroperoxidase is a glycoprotein. Approximately 25 to 30% of the molecule is carbohydrate. Chromatography of acid hydrolysates reveals that glucosamine and arabinose are major constituents."
https://openalex.org/W1601102460,"Insulin rapidly lowered intracellular cyclic adenosine 3‘,5‘-monophosphate levels in adipose tissue incubated with epinephrine or epinephrine and caffeine. This effect was not due to increased escape of cyclic AMP to the medium. Since cyclic AMP has been implicated in the lipolytic action of epinephrine, these data suggest that the antilipolytic action of insulin is due at least in part to the suppression of cyclic AMP levels."

https://openalex.org/W1504241430,"Abstract An enzyme which catalyzes sulfhydryl-disulfide interchange in proteins containing incorrect disulfide bonds has been isolated from beef liver microsomes. The purified form of this enzyme shows two bands upon electrophoresis in starch gels and polyacrylamide gels. The proteins represented by these bands are considered to be variants of the same protein because both are enzymically active after elution from starch gels and because they appear as a single band after reduction and alkylation. A contaminant of higher molecular weight was identified in the purified enzyme preparation both as a faint third band in starch and polyacrylamide gels and as a faster sedimenting component in the analytical ultracentrifuge. By the latter technique the quantity of the contaminant was estimated to be 8 to 10% that of the microsomal enzyme. The molecular weight of the enzyme was found to be 42,000 by analytical ultracentrifugation. Amino acid analyses of the enzyme disclosed the presence of 3 half-cystine residues, and 44 arginine plus lysine residues, per molecule. Peptide maps, prepared from tryptic digests of the enzyme, contained 48 ninhydrin-positive spots. The visible and ultraviolet absorption spectra of the enzyme showed no peaks other than one with a maximum at 278 mµ."

The final purification step involves column chromatography on calcium phosphate. The homogeneity of the purified protein was ascertained chromatographically and electrophoretically. 2. The purified soybean hemagglutinin was found to contain mannose (4.5%) and glucosamine (1%). 3. The carbohydrate moiety was released from the protein in the form of a glycopeptide on proteolysis of the hemagglutinin with Pronase. After purification on Sephadex and Dowex 50, the glycopeptide was found to contain aspartic acid in addition to essentially all the carbohydrate of soybean hemagglutinin. 4. The molecular weight of the glycopeptide as determined by equilibrium centrifugation (4,600) corresponds to that calculated from its aspartic acid, mannose, and glucosamine content (4,400), assuming a single aspartic acid residue per polysaccharide unit. From the size of the glycopeptide, the molecular weight of the soybean hemagglutinin (110,000), and its carbohydrate content it was concluded that the carbohydrate moiety in this glycoprotein is present as a single polysaccharide chain."

https://openalex.org/W1502592005,"Abstract Sufficient quantities of various nuclear and nucleolar ribonucleic acid fractions were obtained by repeated density gradient sedimentations for analysis of base composition determined by optical density, as well as base composition determined by labeling with 32P-orthophosphate, reaction with formaldehyde, and chromatography on methylated serum albumin columns. The base compositions determined by optical density of 45, 35, and 28 S nucleolar ribonucleic acid fractions were identical within the limits of experimental error. A similar result was obtained for base composition, determined by labeling with 32P-orthophosphate, of these fractions each of which had a ratio of adenylic plus uridylic acid to guanylic plus cytidylic acid (A + U:G + C) of approximately 0.6. These results support the conclusions of previous studies that 28 S ribonucleic acid is a product of 45 S ribonucleic acid synthesized in the nucleolus. Evidence that the hydrogen bonding of these fractions differed was obtained by studies with formaldehyde which suggest that 90% of the amino groups in 35 and 45 S ribonucleic acid are hydrogen-bonded as compared to 75% in the 28 S ribonucleic acid in the nucleolar ribonucleic acid fractions. Analyses of the extranucleolar nuclear ribonucleic acid and total nuclear ribonucleic acid indicate that a 45 S ribonucleic acid is formed in the extranucleolar ribonucleic acid which has a ratio of adenylic plus uridylic acid to guanylic plus cytidylic acid (A + U:G + C) of 1.16 by 32P base analysis. It seems possible that this ribonucleic acid may be the precursor of the 18 S ribonucleic acid and messenger ribonucleic acid which is rich in adenine and uridine."
https://openalex.org/W1589597678,"Abstract An enzyme activity which leads to the degradation of S-adenosylmethionine appears after T3 phage infection of Escherichia coli B. The purification and properties of this activity have been described. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine to thiomethyladenosine and homoserine. It has been suggested that a γ-aminobutyrolactone is an intermediate in this reaction. The enzyme appears only after infection with T3 phage. Infection with phages T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, or λ does not result in the appearance of any activity. The rate of enzyme formation and the requirement for protein synthesis de novo suggests that this activity is similar to early enzymes formed after infection with the T-even phages. The enzyme has been isolated both from normal phage T3-infected E. coli and from ultraviolet light-inactivated phage T3-infected E. coli. In the latter case, the specific activity of cell-free extracts was several-fold higher than extracts obtained from normal phage T3-infected cells. Infection of E. coli with ultraviolet light-inactivated phage T3 does not result in the cessation of host cell deoxyribonucleic or ribonucleic acid synthesis. Thus, newly synthesized DNA and RNA formed after infection with phage T3 are devoid of methylated bases. Phage T2, grown in ultraviolet light-inactivated, phage T3-infected E. coli, is likewise devoid of methylated bases. Such methyl-deficient T2 phage appears to be normal in its biological properties so far examined."
https://openalex.org/W1576306876,"Abstract A binary complex is formed between citrate-condensing enzyme and oxalacetate. Complex formation is accompanied by a change in protein conformation, as judged by changes in ultraviolet absorption, a small change in optical rotatory dispersion, and increased stability to denaturation. The stability of the complex in urea has made it possible to estimate that there is 1 oxalacetate molecule per active site on the enzyme, and that the dissociation constant of this complex is about 6 x 10-7 m. Urea treatment of the enzyme results in the exposure of sulfhydryl groups, changes in the ultraviolet absorption, changes in the optical rotatary dispersion spectrum indicative of unfolding, and changes in the sedimentation behavior. Urea treatment of the complex, however, shows essentially none of these changes. A number of analogues were tested as to their ability to bind to the oxalacetate site. On the basis of these studies it was concluded that oxalacetate was bound through both carboxyl groups, as well as through the carbonyl oxygen. It seems that once the oxalacetate site on the enzyme is occupied, then urea (or other denaturants) cannot react with the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1506329891,"Experiments were conducted to determine whether the hydrogen atoms attached to the 2 central carbon atoms of β-carotene are retained or are lost during the conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A. Doubly labeled β-carotene, uniformly labeled with 14C throughout the molecule but specifically labeled with 3H only at the central carbon atoms (C-15 and C-15'), was fed to each of two lymph fistula rats. Lymph was collected and the retinyl esters isolated. The ratio of 3H to 14C in the retinyl esters from lymph, and in the retinol obtained from these esters by saponification, was identical with the ratio of 3H to 14C in the dietary β-carotene. This indicated that there was no loss of 3H relative to 14C during the conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A. Complete retention of 3H relative to 14C was also found during the conversion in vitro of doubly labeled β-carotene to retinal with homogenates of rat intestinal mucosa. The hydrogen atoms attached to the central carbon atoms of β-carotene must therefore be retained completely during the biosynthesis of vitamin A. In order to verify that the 3H label was attached only to the central carbon atoms of β-carotene, the retinol (from lymph) was oxidized to retinoic acid by a two-step procedure. This oxidation was accompanied by a complete loss of 3H label from the molecule. The biosynthesis of vitamin A from β-carotene is most likely a dioxygenase reaction, in which molecular oxygen reacts with the 2 central carbon atoms of β-carotene, followed by the cleavage of the central double bond of β-carotene to yield 2 molecules of retinal."

Thymolytic steroids present in vitro at concentrations of 10-10 m to 10-5 m in the thymocyte suspensions caused similar inhibitions. Good correlation was found between relative potency of the steroids tested in vitro and their reported potency assessed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1698351509,"Abstract A general mechanism for the riboflavin synthetase reaction involving the addition of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine at two sites on the enzyme has been proposed. One site binds the substrate in such a way that it functions as donor of the 4-carbon moiety transferred in the riboflavin synthetase reaction, while the other binds the lumazine that serves as acceptor of the 4-carbon fragment. The rate equation derived from such a reaction mechanism contains a term second order with respect to the concentration of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, indicating a possible nonlinear relationship between the reciprocals of velocity and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine concentration. However, zero to first order kinetics were observed over a range of substrate concentration from 2 x 10-4 m to 6 x 10-7 m (compared to 1.0 x 10-5 m for the Michaelis constant) suggesting that binding of the 2 molecules of the lumazine to the enzyme occurs with widely different affinities. Riboflavin synthetase also catalyzes the conversion of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(5'-deoxyribityl)lumazine to 5'-deoxyriboflavin at a slow rate. However, rapid formation of riboflavin-14C (but not 5'-deoxyriboflavin-14C) occurs in the presence of a mixture of equimolar amounts of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine and 6,7-dimethyl-14C-8-(5'-deoxyribityl)lumazine. This implies that 6,7-dimethyl-8-(5'-deoxyribityl)lumazine is an efficient donor of the 4-carbon fragment involved in the formation of the o-xylene portion of riboflavin, but functions poorly as an acceptor of the 4-carbon moiety. Riboflavin synthetase, purified 2000-fold from an extract of bakers' yeast, forms isolatable complexes with substrate (6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine or 6,7-dimethyl-8-(5'-deoxyribityl)lumazine), riboflavin, and certain inhibitory substrate analogues (e.g. 6-methyl-7-hydroxy-8-ribityllumazine or 6,7-dimethyl-8-d-xylityllumazine). Only those substances are bound which have a kinetic effect on the enzyme; e.g. 6,7-dimethyl-8-l-xylityllumazine does not inhibit activity and is not bound. The complexes contain riboflavin, substrate, or analogues of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, respectively, in equivalent molar amounts. The binding is not due to covalent bonding since riboflavin can be removed from the protein with charcoal; the treated enzyme retains activity. Furthermore, a tightly bound compound can be rapidly and completely displaced by an excess of the same or another substance with which the enzyme can combine. Thus, displacement has been shown of bound riboflavin by the inhibitory substrate analogue 6-methyl-7-hydroxy-8-ribityllumazine and of bound 6,7-dimethyl-14C-8-ribityllumazine by unlabeled 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. The substrates are probably bound in the complex at the site which leads to donation of the 4-carbon moiety since reaction of equivalent amounts of enzyme-6,7-dimethyl-14C-8-(5'-deoxyribityl)lumazine with 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine yields riboflavin-14C only, and not 5'-deoxyriboflavin-14C. Titration of enzyme-6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine complex with free 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine resulted in further polarization of fluorescence. It was calculated that maximal polarization of fluorescence occurred upon the addition of 1 additional eq of substrate to the complex. These results suggest the occurrence of a second substrate-binding site on the enzyme which is involved in the acceptance of the 4-carbon moiety. Attempts to identify an intermediate of the riboflavin synthetase reaction were unsuccessful. No evidence could be obtained that the enzyme requires an organic cofactor for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1565330140,"Abstract l-Amino acid oxidase has been crystallized from extracts of rat kidney mitochondria. Purification involved sonic extraction, ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and gel filtration through Sephadex G-200. The enzyme revealed a single protein band on starch gel electrophoresis and exhibited a single homogeneous peak (s20, w0 = 10.5 S) in an ultracentrifuge. The enzyme is a flavoprotein in which the prosthetic group appears to be flavin mononucleotide. On the basis of the flavin mononucleotide content of the enzyme (0.92%) and its molecular weight (88,900 ± 1,100), it has been concluded that the enzyme contains 2 moles of flavin mononucleotide per mole. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of many α-aminomonocarboxylic and α-hydroxy acids (l configuration) but has no action on optically inactive acids such as glycine and α-hydroxyisobutyric acid. The turnover numbers for the oxidation of l-leucine and of l-lactic acid were 6.3 and 26 moles per min per mole of flavin mononucleotide conjugated with enzyme, respectively."

Adipose triglyceride and lipid peroxide concentrations were unaltered. Coenzyme Q(4), an effective antioxidant, significantly inhibited accumulation of liver triglyceride following ethanol intoxication and prevented the peroxidation of liver lipids. These results, which demonstrate the selective ability of ethanol to induce peroxidation of liver lipids, together with the effectiveness of antioxidants, support the previously proposed hypothesis that peroxidation of liver lipids following ethanol intoxication is a factor in the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced liver injury."

https://openalex.org/W1499805416,"Abstract Clostridium SB4 ferments lysine to acetate, butyrate, and 2 moles of ammonia. The fermenting system appears to be typical of those studied previously (1–7), except that α-ketoglutarate is required for fermentation by cell extracts rather than pyruvate. The omission of all required cofactors except α-ketoglutarate and coenzyme A results in the accumulation of a basic amino acid. The amino acid has been isolated in gram quantities and shown to be l-β,e-diaminocaproic acid (l-β-lysine). The conversion of l-lysine to l-β-lysine is readily reversible; the equilibrium constant (k = [β-lysine]/ [lysine]) is 5.7. The level of α-ketoglutarate influences both the rate and extent of conversion of lysine to β-lysine, but the system does not require substrate levels of α-ketoglutarate. Pyridoxal phosphate can be substituted for α-ketoglutarate when crude cell extracts are used, and α-ketoglutarate can be deleted from reaction mixtures without loss of activity when dialyzed extracts are used. A sulfhydryl compound, i.e. glutathione or mercaptoethanol, and coenzyme A are required for maximal rates of conversion of lysine to β-lysine when dialyzed cell extracts are used. Pyridoxal phosphate has a stimulating effect with such extracts. β-Lysine is fermented more rapidly than lysine by Clostridium SB4 extracts, and the addition of lysine does not inhibit β-lysine fermentation. Apparently β-lysine lies on or very close to the path of lysine fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W1604449834,"Abstract Cell-free homogenates prepared from thymic tissue of rats injected 3 hours prior to sacrifice with cortisol, as compared with similar preparations from control rat thymus, show an impaired capacity to incorporate amino acids into microsomal or ribosomal protein, and a diminished ribonucleic acid polymerase activity. In contrast, cell-free preparations from liver tissue of the same steroid-treated rats reveal an increase in amino acid incorporation by microsomes or ribosomes. The levels of activities of the pH 5.0 activating enzymes, cathepsin, and acid RNase are not altered significantly in thymic tissue of rats as a consequence of the cortisol treatment. In both thymus and liver, the locus of action of the steroid on amino acid incorporation is reflected at the same subcellular level, the ribosomes. Although the injection of cortisol resulted in a decrease in RNA polymerase activity of thymic homogenates, no positive evidence was obtained in preliminary studies that there was a deficiency of messenger RNA on ribosomes prepared from cortisol-treated rats."

https://openalex.org/W1491814071,"Abstract Adenylate pyrophosphorylase was purified 65-fold from Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells by a procedure involving acid treatment, carboxymethyl Sephadex, diethylaminoethyl Sephadex, and precipitation with (NH4)2SO4. The specific activity of the most highly purified preparation was more than twice that previously reported. Further purification was attempted but was unsuccessful because of the instability of this enzyme. The partially purified enzyme was stable when lyophilized, but unstable in solution unless sulfate ion was present. Sulfate ion also partially protected the enzyme from heat denaturation. Adenylate pyrophosphorylase was stable between pH 5 and pH 11 but was completely inactivated below pH 4. It was partially inhibited by sodium ion, sulfate, phosphate, and several carboxylic acids. An absolute requirement for a divalent cation was demonstrated, and Ca2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ all supported high initial rates of reaction. Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ gave lower but still substantial rates. The isoelectric point of AMP pyrophosphorylase was found to be pH 5.1."
https://openalex.org/W1972407876,Sporulation in the fungus Trichoderma viride is inducible with a short light pulse. 5-Fluorouracil applied prior to photoinduction and removed thereafter suppressed sporulation without greatly aflecting growth. This compound also halved the rate of incorporation of uracil-C(14) into RNA but did not change the ratio of uridylic to cytidylic acid. The effect of 5-fluorouracil was counteracted by uracil but not by thymidine. This supports the hypothesis that 5-fluorouracil affects RNA rather than DNA.

Incubation of this compound with homogenates of rat liver results in its conversion to cholesterol, which has been identified by a variety of chemical and chromatographic techniques.

https://openalex.org/W1600204756,"Abstract The equilibria and kinetics of the reaction of the diheme proteins cytochrome cc' derived from Rhodospirillum rubrum and Chromatium with carbon monoxide have been examined. There are wide differences in many respects. The pigment from Chromatium is half saturated by 0.2 µm CO, while that of R. rubrum requires a concentration of 400 µm. The kinetics of the combination reaction also differs. In stopped flow experiments, the rate for R. rubrum cytochrome cc' is independent of CO concentration over the range examined, while that for the Chromatium pigment is proportional to CO concentration and yielded a second order rate constant of 260 m-1 sec-1 at room temperature. Flash photochemical experiments gave biphasic recombination reactions, with rates independent of carbon monoxide concentration in both cases. The reactions are much faster than those observed by the stopped flow method. The velocity of dissociation of CO was measured for the pigment from R. rubrum by dilution and was 0.009 sec-1, at 22° and pH 7.4. The equilibrium between CO and both proteins could be displaced by steady illumination from medium intensity sources such as tungsten filaments. In the Chromatium pigment, the rates of photodissociation and recombination were independent of light intensity. They varied with CO concentration and were numerically equal at CO concentrations greater than 1 x 10-4 m. In R. rubrum cytochrome cc' the photochemical behavior was analogous to that of myoglobin in that there was the usual dependence of rate of dissociation on light intensity. Preliminary experiments on the reaction of the reduced hemoproteins with oxygen and on the reaction of the carbon monoxide complexes with oxygen have given complicated results which cannot be summarized briefly. The findings may be explained by the hypothesis that a bound carbon monoxide molecule, after dissociation from the heme as judged spectrophotometrically, retains an association with the protein molecule. The conclusions resulting from this scheme are discussed in detail."

https://openalex.org/W1582031747,"Abstract Ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S-protein have been investigated for their ability to catalyze the preparative synthesis of dinucleoside monophosphates and trinucleoside diphosphates of specific base composition and sequence. Kinetic analysis of identical reactions catalyzed by ribonuclease A and S-protein suggests that the synthetic activity of the native protein and the derivative differ with respect to rate constant, Km, and the effect of a nucleoside acceptor. Ribonuclease A has been used to prepare dinucleoside monophosphates and trinucleoside diphosphates of specific sequence by the reaction of pyrimidine 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides with a nucleoside. S-Protein has been used to prepare trinucleoside diphosphates of specific sequence by the reaction of a pyrimidine 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide with a dinucleoside monophosphate. Twenty-five trinucleoside diphosphates and four dinucleoside monophosphates have been synthesized. Isolation and purification procedures yielded products free from contaminating materials, sequence isomers, and 2',5'-phosphodiester linkages. Representative compounds were characterized by chromatographic, electrophoretic, base ratio, and sequence analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1584938268,"Abstract The incorporation of the isotope from d-glucose-1-14C, d-glucose-1-3H, d-glucose-2-14C, d-glucose-3-3H, d-glucose-3,4-14C, d-glucose-6-14C, d-glucose-6-3H, uniformly labeled d-glucose-14C, uniformly labeled d-galactose-14C, and d-mannose-1-14C into lactose by slices of mammary glands of lactating rats (14 to 20 days post partum) was studied. The lactose formed was hydrolyzed either with acid or with β-galactosidase, and the component hexoses were isolated and assayed for isotopic content. Three findings indicate that d-glucose, and not α-d-glucose 1-phosphate, acts as the galactosyl acceptor during lactose biosynthesis. (a) The extent of conversion of the label of the variously labeled glucoses to lactose was the same regardless of the site of the label and regardless of whether it was 14C or 3H. (b) The addition of unlabeled glucose to the incubation medium was required for incorporation of 14C from d-mannose-1-14C into lactose. (c) Lactose formed in the experiments with d-mannose-1-14C and unlabeled glucose as substrates was labeled almost exclusively in the galactose portion. The results of periodate degradation of the hexose moieties of lactose formed in experiments in which d-glucose-6-14C served as substrate revealed that little carbon from the triose stage enters the phosphohexose pool via reversal of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. In the presence of unlabeled d-glucose (1 x 10-2 m), the incorporation of the label of uniformly labeled d-galactose-14C into lactose was at least 10 times that into CO2, indicating that galactose probably enters the metabolic scheme in mammary gland as d-galactose 1-phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1543030033,"Abstract The relative levels of guanosine diphosphate hexose and uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylases have been measured in extracts of various tissues of the rat and in the lactating glands from several mammals. Calf liver and rat mammary gland are good sources of both pyrophosphorylases. GDP-hexose pyrophosphorylase has been purified about 500-fold from mammalian tissues. The preparation purified 500-fold is not specific for either the nucleoside or the hexose component of the nucleoside diphosphate hexose. In decreasing order of activity, guanosine, inosine, and adenosine diphosphate hexoses are substrates with either glucose or mannose as the sugar. GDP-mannose and mannose 1-phosphate inhibit the formation and cleavage of GDP-glucose, but the rate of pyrophosphorolysis of GDP-glucose alone is faster than that of GDP-mannose alone. Thus, the enzyme has a higher affinity for GDP-mannose, but apparently a higher turnover for GDP-glucose. With GDP-glucose as substrate, the equilibrium constant, optimum pH, metal requirement, and Km have been determined for the purified GDP-hexose pyrophosphorylase."
https://openalex.org/W1493668285,"A definite contribution of the glucuronic acid pathway to total glucose metabolism by rat adipose tissue in vitro in the presence of growth hormone preparations has not been found. Randomization of 14C of glucose-5-14C into glycerol and glucose-1-14C and -2-14C into glycogen on incubation of rat epididymal tissue indicates that the pathway contributes at most only a few per cent to the over-all metabolism of glucose. Results of incubations with glucose-1-14C and -6-14 are in accord with metabolism solely via the pentose cycle, Embden-Meyerhof pathway, and Krebs cycle. Thus, essentially all of the 14C utilized on incubation of glucose-1-14C and -6-14C is isolated in products formed via these pathways. Nonequilibration of dihydroxyacetone phosphate with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate occurs, and this results in a preferential oxidation to CO2 of carbon 6 as compared to carbon 1 via the Krebs cycle. This coupled with an increase in the fraction of carbon 3 of pyruvate converted to CO2 and a decreased pentose cycle contribution in the presence compared to the absence of the preparations can account for the enhanced yields of 14CO2 from glucose-6-14C as compared to -1-14C that have been reported on growth hormone addition."
https://openalex.org/W2014475308,"A method was developed for isolating large quantities of micromeres from the 16-cell stage of the sea urchin, and measurements were made of their ability to incorporate C(14)-L-valine into protein as compared with that of a mixed suspension of micromeres, mesomeres, and macromeres. Per cell, the rate of incorporation was considerably less for the micromeres than for the suspension of mixed cells. Per unit volume, however, the two types of suspensions showed no significant differences."
https://openalex.org/W1489003698,"Abstract The physicochemical properties and amino acid composition of chymotrypsinogen B have been examined. The partial specific volume has been determined as 0.733 ml per g. From sedimentation velocity measurements, s20,w0 has been found to be 2.58 S at pH 3.0. At pH values above 4, the zymogen dimerizes as indicated by both sedimentation velocity and approach to sedimentation equilibrium measurements. From light scattering and approach to sedimentation equilibrium measurements, an average molecular weight of 24,850 was calculated. Amino acid analyses performed in this laboratory are consistent with this value. The weight intrinsic viscosities of chymotrypsinogens A and B were found to be 2.18 and 2.26 ml per g, respectively. Comparison of the effective hydrodynamic volume calculated from the weight intrinsic viscosity and the viscosity increment with the value calculated from the partial specific volume of the anhydrous protein indicates that the molecule is relatively compact and sparingly hydrated in solution. Optical rotatory dispersion measurements of chymotrypsinogens A and B show that both zymogens have similar low helical contents and similar tertiary structures. An anomalous Cotton minimum at 221 mµ in chymotrypsinogen A is absent in chymotrypsinogen B and must represent some structural differences between the two proteins. Amino acid analyses have shown significant differences in the levels of several of the amino acids, including lysine, arginine, aspartic acid, threonine, serine, glutamic acid, proline, methionine, and tyrosine. The half-cystine content has been determined as 10 and is consistent with the isolation of five unique disulfide sequences from this protein (3)."
https://openalex.org/W1557096809,"Abstract Protein synthesis in rat spleens has been found to occur on polyribosomes. These structures, aggregates of two, three, four, or more ribosomes, become labeled after 1 min of incubation with radioactive amino acids. Incorporation occurs into nascent polypeptide chains which can be released by puromycin or chased off by 12C-amino acids. These polyribosomes stimulate cell-free protein synthesis in vitro in the presence of spleen or liver pH 5 fraction, an energy-generating system, and an optimal magnesium concentration. Synthesis is inhibited by puromycin and by ribonuclease, which dissociates polyribosomes into monomers. Rat spleen polyribosomes thus have properties similar to those of ribosomal aggregates studied in other biological systems."

https://openalex.org/W1530928764,Abstract Carboxypeptidase B is rapidly and irreversibly inhibited at pH 9.0 by 4-bromoacetamidobutylguanidine to give a product that has less than 10% activity. Amino acid analysis of the modified enzyme indicates that inactivation is caused by alkylation of 1 tyrosine residue.

https://openalex.org/W1483181351,"Abstract The rate of reaction of the three abnormal hemoglobins, Mkankakee, Mchicago, and Mmilwaukee, with carbon monoxide has been examined by flow and photochemical methods. In Mkankakee only one-half of the hemes become reduced and react with carbon monoxide. In the other two molecules, all of the hemes are reducible and react. Mkankakee and Mmilwaukee are similar to one another and to hemoglobin A. Mchicago reacts faster and is kinetically heterogeneous. The result with Mkankakee implies that an adjacent α chain containing ferric iron does not prevent the modification of ligand binding activity of the remaining chain which is usually described as heme-heme interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1583212199,Abstract The abnormal structure of hemoglobin Mkankakee has been determined by protein sequence studies to be different from that of hemoglobin A by the substitution of a tyrosine residue for the histidine residue at position 87 of the α chain. The abnormal structure of hemoglobin Mkankakee found in a Caucasian family appears to be identical with the structure of hemoglobin Miwate found in some Japanese families.
https://openalex.org/W1524840689,"Abstract At high substrate (fructose 1,6-diphosphate) concentrations a 6-fold augmentation of aldolase activity was observed. With freshly prepared aldolase the Michaelis constant was 3.5 x 10-3 m and the molecular activity was 9.7 x 102 at lower substrate concentrations, whereas at higher substrate concentrations, those values were 6.3 x 10-2 m and 5.8 x 103, respectively. The following equation was derived. [see PDF for equation] where n is the number of substrate molecules bound; a plot of log (1/v - 1/V') against log (S) indicated that there was a one to one substrate-enzyme interaction at low substrate concentrations but a two to one substrate-enzyme interaction at high substrate levels."
https://openalex.org/W1670003091,"Abstract A magnesium-dependent deoxyribonuclease (deoxyribonucleate oligonucleotidohydrolase), acting optimally at pH 8.5, has been purified 400-fold with respect to protein from the hepatopancreas of Octopus vulgaris. According to Laskowski's scheme of classification of nucleolytic enzymes (16), the purified enzyme is: (a) specific toward the sugar, hydrolyzing only deoxyribonucleic acid, (b) an endonuclease, (c) capable of forming products bearing the monoesterified phosphate attached to position 5', (d) specific, but not exclusively so, toward the d-pN—pC bond, in which N is any nucleoside, and (e) incapable of hydrolyzing dinucleotides. Micrococcal nuclease proved a most valuable tool in establishing base sequences of di- and trinucleotides, with a free 3'-hydroxyl group and a monoesterified phosphate at position 5'."
https://openalex.org/W2086731480,"Failure of pregnancy in newly mated female mice exposed to fresh urine from alien males is prevented by administration of reserpine, at 6.25 micrograms per day per female, on days 1 to 5 post coitum—that is, throughout the period of exposure to male urine and for 2 more days. Since reserpine is known to suppress the inhibitory center in the hypothalamus controlling the release of prolactin, inhibition by reserpine of the blockage of pregnancy provides a strong direct indication of hypothalamic mediation in the male-induced failure of pregnancy in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1522430828,"Abstract The kinetics and mechanism of action of a synergistic inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by bisulfite and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide were investigated. The inhibition, which was competitive to NADH in the forward reaction, occurred with all hybrids of the enzyme, the muscle type being the least sensitive. The mechanism of inhibition appeared to involve binding of the 3-acetylpyridine moiety of the dinucleotide to a site on the enzyme by a bisulfite molecule. Spectral evidence with the reduced coenzyme analogue and the reduced mononucleotide suggested that the site affected was on the pyridine moiety of the nucleotide."
