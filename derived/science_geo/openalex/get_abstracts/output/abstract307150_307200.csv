https://openalex.org/W2065349965,"The shuttle imaging radar (SIR-A) carried on the space shuttle Columbia in November 1981 penetrated the extremely dry Selima Sand Sheet, dunes, and drift sand of the eastern Sahara, revealing previously unknown buried valleys, geologic structures, and possible Stone Age occupation sites. Radar responses from bedrock and gravel surfaces beneath windblown sand several centimeters to possibly meters thick delineate sand- and alluvium-filled valleys, some nearly as wide as the Nile Valley and perhaps as old as middle Tertiary. The now-vanished major river systems that carved these large valleys probably accomplished most of the erosional stripping of this extraordinarily flat, hyperarid region. Underfit and incised dry wadis, many superimposed on the large valleys, represent erosion by intermittent running water, probably during Quaternary pluvials. Stone Age artifacts associated with soils in the alluvium suggest that areas near the wadis may have been sites of early human occupation. The presence of old drainage networks beneath the sand sheet provides a geologic explanation for the locations of many playas and present-day oases which have been centers of episodic human habitation. Radar penetration of dry sand and soils varies with the wavelength of the incident signals (24 centimeters for the SIR-A system), incidence angle, and the electrical properties of the materials, which are largely determined by moisture content. The calculated depth of radar penetration of dry sand and granules, based on laboratory measurements of the electrical properties of samples from the Selima Sand Sheet, is at least 5 meters. Recent (September 1982) field studies in Egypt verified SIR-A signal penetration depths of at least 1 meter in the Selima Sand Sheet and in drift sand and 2 or more meters in sand dunes."

The complexes are not sorbed well by sediment and are only partly precipitated by ferric hydroxide. These results indicate the importance of isolating radioactive waste from organic matter."
https://openalex.org/W1988741974,"The pair of peptidal sex hormones (tremerogen A-10 and tremerogen a-13) that induce conjugation tube formation in compatible type cells (A and a types) of Tremella mesenterica were isolated. Tremerogen A-10 is a dodecapeptide and tremerogen a-13, a tridecapeptide. In both peptides, the sulfiydryl group of the cysteines at the carboxyl terminus was blocked by farnesyl moieties."
https://openalex.org/W2086078556,"The shuttle imaging radar (SIR-A) acquired images of a variety of the earth's geologic areas covering about 10 million square kilometers. Structural and geomorphic features such as faults, folds, outcrops, and dunes are clearly visible in both tropical and arid regions. The combination of SIR-A and Seasat images provides additional information about the surface physical properties: topography and roughness. Ocean features were also observed, including large internal waves in the Andaman Sea."

https://openalex.org/W2038366302,"Associative learning has been demonstrated in a reduced siphon, mantle, gill, and abdominal ganglion preparation of Aplysia. The preparations learned to respond to a previously neutral stimulus as a consequence of training in a classical conditioning paradigm. Backward conditioning, presentation of the conditioned stimulus alone, or presentation of the unconditioned stimulus at some random interval after presentation of the conditioned stimulus failed to produce conditioning. This model system can be used to study the neural mechanisms underlying associative learning."

https://openalex.org/W2043366533,"Anions of many types, both organic and inorganic, familiar and exotic, can be generated in the gas phase by rational chemical synthesis in a flowing afterglow apparatus. Once formed, the rates, products, and mechanisms of their reactions with neutral species of all kinds can be studied, not only at room temperature but at higher energies in a drift field. These completely unsolvated ions undergo a large number of reactions that are analogous to those they undergo in solution, as well as some that are less familiar. New types of ions, for which there are no counterparts in solution, can be produced and their chemical reactions explored."

These varieties are not sensitive to photoperiod but require a cold treatment in order to flower. On the other hand, the varieties of Chrysanthemum which belong to the short-day group are not induced to flower by gibberellic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2021106984,"During the second flight of the space shuttle, the measurement of air pollution from satellites (MAPS) experiment in the OSTA-1 payload acquired approximately 35 hours of radiometric measurements of the carbon monoxide mixing ratio in the middle troposphere, upper troposphere, and lower stratosphere. A gas filter radiometer operating in the 4.67-micrometer band was used to acquire the data over the region from 38 degrees N to 38 degrees S during both daytime and nighttime. The performance of the measurement system was excellent. The data reduced to date indicate the presence of significant gradients in the middle tropospheric carbon monoxide mixing ratio with both latitude and longitude over the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East. On the basis of comparisons with directly measured values, the accuracy of the measurements is approximately 15 percent. Comparisons of data taken on successive orbits over the same geographic region indicate that the repeatability of the measurements is approximately 5 percent."

https://openalex.org/W1978942182,Routine access to low earth orbit provided by the space shuttle holds great potential for global studies of the earth's resources and its environment. A successful test flight of the Columbia orbiter in November 1981 demonstrated the utility and versatility of the shuttle for earth-related research. A series of remote sensing experiments is currently planned for the mid-1980's that will more fully exploit the shuttle's earth observation capabilities.

Many problems remain and in time might even get worse. The assumptions underlying the prognosis of a carefree energy future merit careful continuing scrutiny. Some do not hold up well. Moreover, in part, greater ease in energy is the mirror image of depressed economic conditions. It is reasonable to relax a little but not to relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2091643166,Cocklebur from the Los Angeles area was found to require more extensive short-day treatment for floral initiation than plants of the same species from the Chicago region. Data obtained by grafting the two regional types of cocklebur indicate that the leaves of the Los Angeles Xanthium produce a comparatively low amount of the flowering stimulus.
