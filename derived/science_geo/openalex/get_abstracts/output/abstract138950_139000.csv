https://openalex.org/W2133667940,"Many distinct signaling pathways allow the cell to receive, process, and respond to information. Often, components of different pathways interact, resulting in signaling networks. Biochemical signaling networks were constructed with experimentally obtained constants and analyzed by computational methods to understand their role in complex biological processes. These networks exhibit emergent properties such as integration of signals across multiple time scales, generation of distinct outputs depending on input strength and duration, and self-sustaining feedback loops. Feedback can result in bistable behavior with discrete steady-state activities, well-defined input thresholds for transition between states and prolonged signal output, and signal modulation in response to transient stimuli. These properties of signaling networks raise the possibility that information for ""learned behavior"" of biological systems may be stored within intracellular biochemical reactions that comprise signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2171584675,"The function of the central cannabinoid receptor (CB 1 ) was investigated by invalidating its gene. Mutant mice did not respond to cannabinoid drugs, demonstrating the exclusive role of the CB 1 receptor in mediating analgesia, reinforcement, hypothermia, hypolocomotion, and hypotension. The acute effects of opiates were unaffected, but the reinforcing properties of morphine and the severity of the withdrawal syndrome were strongly reduced. These observations suggest that the CB 1 receptor is involved in the motivational properties of opiates and in the development of physical dependence and extend the concept of an interconnected role of CB 1 and opiate receptors in the brain areas mediating addictive behavior."

Long-range, close-packed self-ordering of the micelles produced highly iridescent periodic microporous materials. Solution-cast micellar films consisted of multilayers of hexagonally ordered arrays of spherical holes whose diameter, periodicity, and wall thickness depended on copolymer molecular weight and composition. Addition of fullerenes into the copolymer solutions also regulated the microstructure and optical properties of the microporous films. These results demonstrate the potential of hierarchical self-assembly of macromolecular components for engineering complex two- and three-dimensional periodic and functional mesostructures."

https://openalex.org/W2018433273,"Fluorescent analogs of adenine that selectively oxidize guanine were used to investigate photoinduced electron transfer through the DNA π-stack as a function of reactant stacking and energetics. Small variations in these factors led to profound changes in the kinetics and distance dependences of DNA-mediated electron-transfer reactions. Values of β, a parameter reflecting the dependence of electron transfer on distance, ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 per angstrom. Strong stacking interactions result in the fastest electron-transfer kinetics. Electrons are thus transported preferentially through an intrastrand rather than interstrand pathway. Reactant energetics also modulate the distance dependence of DNA-mediated charge transport. These studies may resolve the range of disparate results previously reported, and paradigms must now be developed to describe these properties of the DNA π-stack, which can range from insulator- to “wire”-like."
https://openalex.org/W2042123414,"The mechanism by which psychostimulants act as calming agents in humans with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or hyperkinetic disorder is currently unknown. Mice lacking the gene encoding the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) have elevated dopaminergic tone and are hyperactive. This activity was exacerbated by exposure to a novel environment. Additionally, these mice were impaired in spatial cognitive function, and they showed a decrease in locomotion in response to psychostimulants. This paradoxical calming effect of psychostimulants depended on serotonergic neurotransmission. The parallels between the DAT knockout mice and individuals with ADHD suggest that common mechanisms may underlie some of their behaviors and responses to psychostimulants."
https://openalex.org/W2090878061,"Data from recent oceanographic cruises show that phytoplankton community structure in the Ross Sea is related to mixed layer depth. Diatoms dominate in highly stratified waters, whereas Phaeocystis antarctica assemblages dominate where waters are more deeply mixed. The drawdown of both carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrate per mole of phosphate and the rate of new production by diatoms are much lower than that measured for P. antarctica . Consequently, the capacity of the biological community to draw down atmospheric CO 2 and transport it to the deep ocean could diminish dramatically if predicted increases in upper ocean stratification due to climate warming should occur."

https://openalex.org/W2008065206,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation has been implicated in many cellular responses, including fibroblast growth, transformation, survival, and chemotaxis. Although PI3K is activated by several agents that stimulate T and B cells, the role of PI3K in lymphocyte function is not clear. The mouse gene encoding the PI3K adapter subunit p85alpha and its splice variants p55alpha and p50alpha was disrupted. Most p85alpha-p55alpha-p50alpha-/- mice die within days after birth. Lymphocyte development and function was studied with the use of the RAG2-deficient blastocyst complementation system. Chimeric mice had reduced numbers of peripheral mature B cells and decreased serum immunoglobulin. The B cells that developed had diminished proliferative responses to antibody to immunoglobulin M, antibody to CD40, and lipopolysaccharide stimulation and decreased survival after incubation with interleukin-4. In contrast, T cell development and proliferation was normal. This phenotype is similar to defects observed in mice lacking the tyrosine kinase Btk."

https://openalex.org/W1982070877,"Mice with a targeted gene disruption of p85α, a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, had impaired B cell development at the pro–B cell stage, reduced numbers of mature B cells and peritoneal CD5 + Ly-1 B cells, reduced B cell proliferative responses, and no T cell–independent antibody production. These phenotypes are nearly identical to those of Btk −/− or xid (X-linked immunodeficiency) mice. These results provide evidence that p85α is functionally linked to the Btk pathway in antigen receptor–mediated signal transduction and is pivotal in B cell development and functions."
https://openalex.org/W1995691453,"Localizing cell surface receptors to specific subcellular positions can be critical for their proper functioning, as most notably demonstrated at neuronal synapses. PDZ proteins apparently play critical roles in such protein localizations. Receptor tyrosine kinases have not been previously shown to interact with PDZ proteins in vertebrates. We report that Eph receptors and their membrane-linked ligands all contain PDZ recognition motifs and can bind and be clustered by PDZ proteins. In addition, we find that Eph receptors and ligands colocalize with PDZ proteins at synapses. Thus, PDZ proteins may play critical roles in localizing vertebrate receptor tyrosine kinases and/or their ligands and may be particularly important for Eph function in guidance or patterning or at the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2068437038,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is thought to involve the activity of the clathrin adaptor protein AP180. However, the role of this protein in endocytosis in vivo remains unknown. Here, we show that a mutation that eliminates an AP180 homolog (LAP) in Drosophila severely impairs the efficiency of synaptic vesicle endocytosis and alters the normal localization of clathrin in nerve terminals. Most importantly, the size of both synaptic vesicles and quanta is significantly increased in lap mutants. These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of endocytosis and reveal a role for AP180 in regulating vesicle size through a clathrin-dependent reassembly process."

In experimental populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli , the rate of evolutionary adaptation was proportional to the mutation supply rate only in particular circumstances of small or initially well-adapted populations. These experiments also demonstrate a “speed limit” on adaptive evolution in asexual populations, one that is independent of the mutation supply rate."

The mechanism for the effect remains uncertain. Mass-independent isotopic compositions have been observed in O3, CO2, N2O, and CO in Earth's atmosphere and in carbonate from a martian meteorite, which suggests a role for mass-independent processes in the atmosphere of Mars. Observed mass-independent meteoritic oxygen and sulfur isotopic compositions may derive from chemical processes in the presolar nebula, and their distributions could provide insight into early solar system evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2013050589,"The Fos and Jun oncoproteins form dimeric complexes that stimulate transcription of genes containing activator protein–1 regulatory elements. We found, by representational difference analysis, that expression of DNA 5-methylcytosine transferase ( dnmt1 ) in fos -transformed cells is three times the expression in normal fibroblasts and that fos -transformed cells contain about 20 percent more 5-methylcytosine than normal fibroblasts. Transfection of the gene encoding Dnmt1 induced morphological transformation, whereas inhibition of dnmt1 expression or activity resulted in reversion of fos transformation. Inhibition of histone deacetylase, which associates with methylated DNA, also caused reversion. These results suggest that fos may transform cells through alterations in DNA methylation and in histone deacetylation."

https://openalex.org/W2078223912,"Six rate coefficients of relative ozone formation contradict the role of molecular symmetry in the process that results in the enrichment of heavy ozone isotopomers. The results show that collisions between light atoms, such as 16 O, and heavy molecules, such as 34 O 2 and 36 O 2 , have a rate coefficient advantage of about 25 and 50 percent, respectively, over collisions involving heavy atoms and light molecules. These results suggest that the observed isotope effect for each isotopomer may be caused by the preponderance of a single reaction channel and not through molecular symmetry selection."
https://openalex.org/W2160370971,"Dopamine inhibits Na+,K+-ATPase activity in renal tubule cells. This inhibition is associated with phosphorylation and internalization of the α subunit, both events being protein kinase C-dependent. Studies of purified preparations, fusion proteins with site-directed mutagenesis, and heterologous expression systems have identified two major protein kinase C phosphorylation residues (Ser-11 and Ser-18) in the rat α1 subunit isoform. To identify the phosphorylation site(s) that mediates endocytosis of the subunit in response to dopamine, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis of these residues in the rat α1subunit and expressed the mutated forms in a renal epithelial cell line. Dopamine inhibited Na+,K+-ATPase activity and increased α subunit phosphorylation and clathrin-dependent endocytosis into endosomes in cells expressing the wild type α1 subunit or the S11A α1 mutant, and both effects were blocked by protein kinase C inhibition. In contrast, dopamine did not elicit any of these effects in cells expressing the S18A α1 mutant. While Ser-18 phosphorylation is necessary for endocytosis, it does not affectper se the enzymatic activity: preventing endocytosis with wortmannin or LY294009 blocked the inhibitory effect of dopamine on Na+,K+-ATPase activity, although it did not alter the increased α subunit phosphorylation induced by this agonist.We conclude that dopamine-induced inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in rat renal tubule cells requires endocytosis of the α subunit into defined intracellular compartments and that phosphorylation of Ser-18 is essential for this process.

Endocytosis of integral membrane proteins is initiated by selective recognition of the target protein followed by its transport, usually via clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV),1into endosomes (6Pierce B.M.

While endocytosis of membrane receptors as part of their signaling mechanism has been extensively studied, internalization of integral membrane proteins triggered by a network of signals generated after activation of G proteins-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is less well documented. Inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by activation of GPCRs (dopaminergic) in renal epithelial cells is associated with the removal of active units from the basolateral plasma membrane and their transport, via clathrin-coated vesicles, into early (EE) and late endosomes (LE) (4Chibalin A.V.

However, because in some reports investigators have failed to demonstrate an effect of PKC on the hydrolytic activity of purified preparations (16Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol.

In PCT (proximal convoluted tubule) segments phorbol esters (19Bertorello A.M. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F370-F373PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ominato M. Satoh T. Katz A.I. J. Membr.

In OK (opossum kidney) cells and Xenopus oocytes phorbol esters decrease ouabain-sensitive Rb+ transport, and this decrease is associated with phosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit (22Middleton J.P.

However, expression of a mutated form (Ser-18) alone or in combination with another mutation (Ser-11) in Xenopusoocytes revealed a variable response of Rb+ transport, depending on whether phorbol esters or purified PKC was used (23Vasilets L.A.

Moreover, phorbol esters have been also associated with stimulation of ouabain-sensitive Rb+ transport in PCT segments (24Feraille E. Carranza M.-L. Buffin-Meyer B. Rousselot M. Doucet A. Favre H.

Cell. 1997; 8: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that would affect Na+,K+-ATPase function. Using a physiologic ligand (dopamine) we have demonstrated that inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in renal proximal tubule cells was associated with phosphorylation and selective endocytosis of the α1 subunit (4Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J.

Furthermore, these two events were connected, because the rat α1 subunit carrying an amino-terminal deletion (first 28 residues) that includes the PKC target sites (Ser-11/Ser-18) was not internalized in response to dopamine (11Chibalin A.V.

While these results indicate that phosphorylation of the α subunit in response to dopamine is necessary for internalization, it remains unclear whether inhibition of the enzymatic activity in intact cells results from phosphorylation of the subunit in the plasma membrane (so that Na+,K+-ATPase undergoes a conformational change in situ that decrease its activity) or from the endocytic process, i.e. inhibition occurs only as a result of decreased Na+,K+-ATPase units in the plasma membrane. In addition, because the two residues (Ser-11 and Ser-18) phosphorylated by PKC in purified preparations (16Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) are within the NH2 terminus of the α1 subunit, in this study we have utilized site-directed mutagenesis to determine in intact cells whether Ser-11 or Ser-18, or both are phosphorylation targets involved in Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis and inhibition of its catalytic activity in response to dopamine. All chemicals were from Sigma, except bisindolylmaleimide (Bis) and LY294009, which were purchased from Calbiochem. Na+,K+-ATPase α subunit abundance in clathrin vesicles and early and late endosomes was determined using a monoclonal antibody kindly provided by Dr. M. Caplan (Yale University). Immunoprecipitation of the Na+,K+-ATPase in the phosphorylation experiments was performed using a polyclonal antibody raised against the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α subunit (25Carranza M.-L. Féraille E. Favre H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C136-C143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCT cells were prepared as described before (11Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8814-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (BK Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden) weighing between 150 and 200 g were used. After the kidneys were removed and the cortex isolated, the tissue was moistened on ice to a paste-like consistency. The cortical minceate was incubated with 0.625 mg/ml collagenase (Type I, Sigma) in 50 ml of Hanks' medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min, the solution being continuously exposed to 95% O2, 5% CO2 and was terminated by placing the tissue on ice and pouring through graded sieves (75–53–38 μm pore size) to obtain a cell suspension. The PCT cells were washed three to four times by centrifugation at 100 × g for 4 min in order to separate the remaining blood cells and traces of collagenase and were then kept on ice. Cells were resuspended to yield a protein concentration of approximately 3.5–5.0 mg/ml and were used immediately after preparation. Wild type and mutant forms of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit of rat were prepared from complementary DNA for expression by mammalian cells in culture. Wild type α1 cDNA was a gift of Dr. Jerry B. Lingrel (28Shull G.E. Greeb J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Wild type sequence was annealed with complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired change and then subjected to 10–15 cycles of amplification with Pfu polymerase, followed by restriction of the original wild type template with DpnI. The resulting mutant plasmids were then transformed into bacteria for recovery and analysis. Substitution of an alanine for the first serine, α1 (S11A), was accomplished with the oligonucleotide TATGAGCCCGCAGCTGTGGCCGAACATGGGGACAAGAAGA and its complement. Substitution of an alanine for the second serine, α1(S18A), was accomplished with the oligonucleotide AGAACATGGGGACAAGAAGGCCAAGAAGGCGAAGAAGGAA and its complement. A diagnostic HaeIII site was introduced for both mutants. Structure of the resulting mutants was evaluated by restriction with the appropriate endonuclease and confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the altered region. Mutant cDNAs were subcloned downstream from the immediate early promoter of human cytomegalovirus in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). OK cells were transfected with the various cDNA plasmids using liposomes (26Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Rose J.K. Buonocore L. Whitt M.A. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 520-525PubMed Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the cells were transferred to a medium containing 10 μm ouabain. Because the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase of OK cells is sensitive to this level of ouabain, only OK cells that express the Na+,K+-ATPase containing the rodent α subunit would be able to survive. After 10 days, resistant colonies were expanded and maintained all the time in medium containing 10 μm ouabain. Experiments were performed with a mix of at least 20 clones. Transfected cells (maintained at all times in 10 μm ouabain) were incubated in modified Hanks' medium in the presence or absence of 1 μm DA at room temperature for 2.5 min. The incubation was terminated by placing the samples on ice. Cell aliquots (approximately 5–15 μg of protein) were transferred to the Na+,K+-ATPase assay medium (final volume, 100 μl) containing in mm: 50 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 50 Tris-HCl, 10 Na2ATP (Calbiochem) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products; specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) in tracer amounts (3.3 nCi/μl). Na+,K+-ATPase activity was then determined after permeabilization of the cells as described before (4Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total Na+,K+-ATPase activity was measured in samples containing 10 μm ouabain. Thus, cells remained exposed to this ouabain concentration at all times, including after permeabilization, the magnesium-dependent ATPase activity was measured in a medium containing 4 mm ouabain. The difference between these two groups represents the activity of the “transfected” ouabain-resistant isoform. A portion of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules is located in intracellular organelles. The sum of their activities (nmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) in CCV, ∼20 and EE, ∼15, constitutes approximately 30% of total cell activity, 112 nmol of Pi/mg of protein/min (4Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because their presence in these compartments may affect the interpretation of activities obtained in whole cells, we have validated our method by comparing the Na+,K+-ATPase hydrolytic activity in PCT cells permeabilized by thermic shock (−20 °C) to a well established method for cell permeabilization, e.g. treatment with digitonin (30Erusalimsky J.D. Friedberg I. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19188-19194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In five separate experiments Na+,K+-ATPase activity (nmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) in PCT cells subjected to permeabilzation at −20 °C was 99 ± 8, not significantly different from that of PCT cells permeabilized by incubation with 50 μm digitonin during 10 min at 37 °C (116 ± 13,p = 0.313). When cells previously exposed to −20 °C for 10 min were incubated with digitonin, which now would also access the interior of the cell, the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was significantly increased (161 ± 9, n= 4, p < 0.05 versus digitonin alone). This increase (∼38%) probably reflects to a large extent the contribution of pump activity in these organelles and suggests that incubation of intact cells at −20 °C or with digitonin alone results only in permeabilization of the plasma membrane but not of membranes from intracellular organelles, such as clathrin vesicles and early endosomes. Renal PCT cells (4–6 mg of protein/3 ml) were labeled during 2 h at 32 °C in a buffer containing (in mm): 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 4 NaHCO3, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 0.2 NaH2PO4, 0.15 Na2HPO4, 5 glucose, 10 lactate, 1 pyruvate, 20 HEPES, and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.45, with the addition of 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products). OK cells (2.0–2.5 mg of protein/dish) were labeled in the same buffer (2.5 ml/dish) containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2.5 h at 37 °C. All incubations with different agonists were performed at room temperature. The incubation was terminated by removing the medium, addition of immunoprecipitation buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EGTA, 30 mm NaF, 30 mmNa4O7P2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.45) and placing the samples on ice. The cells were disrupted by gentle homogenization. Immunoprecipitation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α subunit was performed as described (11Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8814-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots (200 μg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibody (preliminary experiments demonstrated that this antibody does not immunoprecipitate the wild type α subunit) and the simultaneous addition of excess protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Laemmli buffer system (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and subjected to autoradiography. Phosphoproteins were analyzed by phosphoimaging, and quantitation was performed as described (4Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to estimate the stoichiometry of the α subunit phosphorylation we used the “back phosphorylation” technique (32Nestler E. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7479-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PCT cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm dopamine at 23 °C for 2.5 min. The incubation was terminated by addition of homogenization buffer, and immunoprecipitation of the α subunit was performed as described above. The immunoprecipitated α subunit (∼0.25 μg) was phosphorylated by purified protein kinase C (70 ng/50 μl; 30 min at 30 °C) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.25 mm EGTA, 0.32 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.03 mg/ml diacylglycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm Na2ATP, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained by Coomassie Blue. The radioactivity incorporated into the α subunit excised from the gel was counted (Cherenkov), and the number of moles of phosphate incorporated per mole of α subunit was calculated as described (13Bertorello A.M. Aperia A. Walaas I. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11359-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The amount of immunoprecipitated α subunit was calculated by scanning densitometry using bovine serum albumin as standard. OK cells in suspension (1.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated under different protocols at room temperature. Incubation was terminated by transferring the samples to ice and addition of cold homogenization buffer containing 250 mm sucrose and 3 mm imidazole, 2 mmEGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4. Cells were gently homogenized (15–20 strokes) to minimize damage of the endosomes, using a pellet pestle motor homogenizer, and the samples were subjected to a brief (5 min) centrifugation (4 °C, 3000 × g). Endosomes were fractionated on a flotation gradient as described (4Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using essentially the technique of Gorvel et al. (33Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). These fractions were not cross-contaminated, i.e. Rab5 was located exclusively in EE, whereas mannose 6-phosphate receptor immunoreactivity was located in LE (4Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of clathrin vesicles was performed as described (4Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hammond T.G. Verroust P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F554-F562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After preincubation with or without 1 μm DA (3 min at 25 °C), OK cells were homogenized using a Potter homogenizer (three strokes; 30 s) in 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 m MES, and 0.2 mg/ml NaN3, titrated to pH 6.5 with NaOH. The homogenate was centrifuged at 85,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and applied to a discontinuous sucrose gradient (w/v): 60, 50, 40, 10, and 5%. Samples were then centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 75 min and collected from the 10–40% interface; they were washed in homogenization buffer and pelleted at 85,000 × g for 1 h. Wheat germ agglutinin was added to a concentration of 1:10 mg of protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The agglutinated material was sedimented at 20,000 × g for 15 min. CCV were negatively stained for both Rab5 and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (4Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After separation of early and late endosomes, another fraction (500 μl) was collected at the 16 and 42% sucrose interface corresponding to cell ghosts, mitochondria, and plasma membranes. Basolateral plasma membranes were further purified as described (11Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8814-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined according to Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed with an ECL or ECL Plus (Amersham, Amersham, UK) detection kit. Scans were performed using a Scan Jet IIc scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Quantitation of the phosphorylated Na+,K+-ATPase α subunit was performed as described (11Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8814-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using a Fuji Bas 1000 Bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Co., Tokyo, Japan), and the data (arbitrary units) were analyzed using a software Tina 2.07 ray test (Isotopenmessyeräte GmbH, Staulenhardt, Germany). Comparison between two experimental groups were made by the nonpaired Student's t test. For multiple comparisons one way analysis of variance with Sheffe's correction was used. p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Na+,K+-ATPase α subunit is phosphorylated in response to dopamine, maximal phosphorylation (∼40%) being achieved after 2.5-min incubation at 23 °C with 1 μm dopamine. Using back phosphorylation we have observed in two independent experiments that dopamine decreased the amount of dephospho-α subunit (dephosphoprotein, percent of control: 67 (experiment 1) and 70 (experiment 2), Fig. 1 A). Because the total amount of immunoprecipitated Na+,K+-ATPase α subunit was the same, the results further demonstrated that the α subunit is phosphorylated in the presence of dopamine. The α subunit immunoprecipitated from vehicle-treated cells was phosphorylated to a stoichiometry of 0.33 (experiment 1)/0.38 (experiment 2) mol/mol, whereas that from dopamine-treated cells to 0.20 (experiment 1)/0.25 (experiment 2) mol/mol, respectively. This indicates that in intact cells dopamine phosphorylates the Na+,K+-ATPase α subunit with a stoichiometry of ∼0.15 mol/mol (∼40% of maximal). To determine the relative roles of α subunit phosphorylation and internalization during inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in PCT cells, we examined the effect of dopamine on Na+,K+-ATPase activity and α subunit phosphorylation under conditions where endocytosis was blocked. We have reported previously that preincubation with wortmannin or LY294009 prevented the endocytosis of α subunits into clathrin vesicles and early and late endosomes induced by dopamine (10Chibalin A.V. Zierath J. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study we assessed the effect of 1 μm dopamine on Na+,K+-ATPase activity and α subunit phosphorylation in PCT cells that have been treated with 100 nm wortmannin (W) or 25 μm LY 294009 (LY) for 20 min at 23 °C before incubation with the ligand (Fig. 1). Dopamine alone increased the state of phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated α subunit from the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1 A) and decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity (Fig. 1 B). Dopamine-induced phosphorylation was not altered by wortmannin or LY294009 (Fig. 1 A). However, the inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity was blocked by pretreatment with either wortmannin or LY294009 (Fig. 1 B). Wortmannin or LY294009 alone did not affect Na+,K+-ATPase activity or α subunit phosphorylation. These results suggest that phosphorylation is a necessary, but not a sufficient, event for Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition, i.e.although it triggers the endocytosis, it is the removal of the subunits from the plasma membrane, rather than the increased phosphorylationper se that decreases Na+,K+-ATPase activity in intact cells. To determine the role of putative PKC phosphorylation residues during inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by dopamine, OK cells were transfected with mutants of the rat α1 subunit in which either Ser-11 or Ser-18 were substituted by Ala residues. OK cells expressing wild type (Wt) and the mutants S11A and S18A α1 subunit expressed comparable amounts of α1 subunits as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.2 A), and the Na+,K+-ATPase activity determined in plasma membranes was also simil"

Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), accumulated in beta cells by glucose stimulation, has been postulated to serve as a second messenger for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization for insulin secretion, and CD38 is thought to be involved in the cADPR accumulation (Takasawa, S., Tohgo, A., Noguchi, N., Koguma, T., Nata, K., Sugimoto, T., Yonekura, H., and Okamoto, H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26052–26054). Here we created “knockout” (CD38−/−) mice by homologous recombination. CD38−/− mice developed normally but showed no increase in their glucose-induced production of cADPR in pancreatic islets. The glucose-induced [Ca2+]i rise and insulin secretion were both severely impaired in CD38−/− islets, whereas CD38−/− islets responded normally to the extracellular Ca2+ influx stimulants tolbutamide and KCl. CD38−/− mice showed impaired glucose tolerance, and the serum insulin level was lower than control, and these impaired phenotypes were rescued by beta cell-specific expression of CD38 cDNA. These results indicate that CD38 plays an essential role in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by cADPR for insulin secretion.

Glucose stimulates insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells of the islets of Langerhans, and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources has an important role in this process (1Prentki M.

Concerning the mechanism of Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources, it has been thought that ATP generated in the process of glucose metabolism inhibits the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, causing beta cell membrane depolarization, thereby opening the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel and resulting in Ca2+-influx from the extracellular space (4Ashcroft F.M.

Some of the newborn mice (F1) were found to carry the deleted allele (5.3-kbp BamHI-BamHI fragment; see Fig. 1,A and C) that lacks both CD38 exon 1 and neo cassette.

Four hundred islets were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and glucose (2.8 or 20 mm), followed by radioimmunoassay of cADPR (21Takasawa S.

As control, an aliquot of every islet extract was heated to 95 °C for 10 min before being neutralized and analyzed by the radioimmunoassay. The heat treatment converted the immunoreactive cADPR to ADP-ribose, resulting in no cross-reaction with the anti-cADPR antibody. The immunoreactivity of all the samples was abolished by the heat treatment. Intact islets were loaded with fura-2 by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 25 μm acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). Islets were then attached to a cover glass using Cell-Tak (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). The specimen chamber was continuously perfused with Krebs-Ringer buffer at 37 °C at a rate of 2.5 ml/min. Fura-2 dual excitation (340 and 380 nm) and fluorescence detection (510 nm) were accomplished, and the 340/380 nm fluorescent ratio was converted to [Ca2+]i using QuantiCell 900 (Applied Imaging, Sunderland, UK); the interval of recordings was 4 s. Twenty islets were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2.5 mm glucose and then incubated for another 1 h in the same medium containing various concentrations of glucose, tolbutamide (Sigma), or KCl (Sigma). The medium samples were subsequently assayed for radioimmunoassay of insulin (11Kato I. Takasawa S. Akabane A. Tanaka O. Abe H. Takamura T. Suzuki Y. Nata K. Yonekura H. Yoshimoto T. Okamoto H. J.

The significance of differences between groups was evaluated using unpaired Student's t-test. We produced chimeric mice composed predominantly of targeted embryonic stem cell-derived cells (Fig.1, A and B). A DNA fragment flanked by loxP sequences was removed by a transient expression of Cre recombinase in fertilized eggs (20Araki K. Araki M. Miyazaki J. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Newborn mice (F1) were found to carry the mutated allele that deletes both CD38 exon 1 and neo cassette (Fig. 1, A andC). Homozygotes (−/−) were yielded in the F2 generation in a distribution following Mendelian rules. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, D and E) showed that there was no detectable CD38 mRNA and protein in pancreatic islets from CD38−/− mice, suggesting that the gene disruption resulted in a null mutation of CD38. CD38 exhibits both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities, and the overall reaction is classified as an NAD+-glycohydrolase reaction (6Okamoto H. Takasawa S. Tohgo A.

As compared with CD38+/+ islet homogenates (ADP-ribosyl cyclase, 148.6 ± 30.9 pmol/min/mg; cADPR hydrolase, 398.9 ± 56.3 pmol/min/mg; NAD+-glycohydrolase, 10.9 ± 3.3 nmol/min/mg), the enzyme activities of CD38−/− islet homogenates were greatly reduced (2.7 ± 1.7 pmol/min/mg, 27.6 ± 27.6 pmol/min/mg, 0.4 ± 0.3 nmol/min/mg, respectively), indicating that CD38 is mainly responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR in pancreatic beta cells. The remaining activities presumably reflect the minor contribution of other cADPR-metabolizing enzymes (28Hirata Y. Kimura N. Sato K. Ohsugi Y. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Ishikawa J. Kaisho T.

The cADPR content in CD38+/+islets was greatly increased by high glucose stimulation (Fig.2 A). Although some amounts of cADPR were detected in CD38−/− islets when incubated in low glucose, the cADPR content was not at all increased by high glucose stimulation; this suggests the non-redundant role of CD38 in increasing the intracellular cADPR concentration upon glucose stimulation and that the cADPR detected in CD38−/− islets was produced by ADP-ribosyl cyclases other than CD38 (28Hirata Y.

Akiyama T. Nata K. Kuroki M. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Kobayashi S. Kato I. Katada T. Okamoto H. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2,B–D, the glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]i rise in CD38−/− islets was much lower than that in CD38+/+ islets in the digital imaging of fura-2 fluorescence. This attenuated response of [Ca2+]i in CD38−/−islets was reproducible in a series of experiments (increase in [Ca2+]i by glucose (2.8 mm → 20 mm) was: 243.7 ± 13.9 nm in CD38+/+ islets, n = 20; 132.2 ± 12.9 nm in CD38−/− islets,n = 36, p < 0.001), suggesting that the loss of the cADPR increase in CD38−/− islets in response to glucose stimulation (Fig. 2 A) caused this attenuated response. Although there were no significant differences in insulin secretion between CD38+/+ and CD38−/− islets at 2.5 and 10 mm glucose, insulin secretion from CD38−/−islets at 20 and 30 mm glucose was more than 50% decreased compared with CD38+/+ islets (Fig.3 A). We investigated the effects of tolbutamide (4Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Insulin: Molecular Biology to Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 97-150Google Scholar) and KCl (32Hermans M.P. Schmeer W. Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 1987; 30: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar) on insulin secretion from CD38+/+ and CD38−/− islets. CD38−/− islets responded normally to tolbutamide and KCl (Fig. 3 B), indicating that CD38 is not essential for insulin secretion by extracellular Ca2+ influx stimulants. Next, 10-h-fasted mice were subjected to glucose-tolerance tests (Fig.4 A). At 30 and 60 min after glucose injection, CD38−/− mice had much higher glucose levels than CD38+/+ mice. In CD38−/− mice, serum insulin levels at 15 min after glucose injection were significantly lower than those of CD38+/+ mice. The blood glucose levels of CD38−/− mice at 15–60 min after insulin injection were essentially similar to those of CD38+/+ mice (data not shown), suggesting that the glucose intolerance in CD38−/− mice is because of an attenuation of glucose-induced insulin secretion rather than an alteration in peripheral insulin resistance. We further tested whether the observed phenotype could be rescued by a pancreatic beta cell-specific expression of CD38 cDNA. Transgenic mice carrying a human CD38 cDNA under the rat insulin promoter (11Kato I. Takasawa S. Akabane A. Tanaka O. Abe H. Takamura T. Suzuki Y. Nata K. Yonekura H. Yoshimoto T. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30045-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were crossed with CD38−/− mice. The human CD38 transgene ameliorated the glucose intolerance and the decreased insulin secretion, suggesting that the observed phenotype was indeed caused by the absence of CD38 in pancreatic beta cells (Fig. 4 B). We have recently reported that the CD38 mRNA expression is attenuated in islets of ob/ob diabetic mice as well as in RINm5F cells, which synthesize and secrete very little insulin in response to glucose (21Takasawa S. Akiyama T. Nata K. Kuroki M. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Kobayashi S. Kato I. Katada T. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2497-2500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Likewise, the CD38 mRNA expression was attenuated in pancreatic islets of Goto-Kakizaki diabetic rats (33Matsuoka T. Kajimoto Y. Watada H. Umayahara Y. Kubota M. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Kamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which show impaired insulin secretion (34Goto Y. Kakizaki M. Masaki N. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1975; 51: 80-85Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that about 14% of the examined human diabetic patients possessed autoantibodies to CD38, which inhibited the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38, accumulation of cADPR in islets, and insulin secretion in vitro (35Ikehata F. Satoh J. Nata K. Tohgo A. Nakazawa T. Kato I. Kobayashi S. Akiyama T. Takasawa S. Toyota T. Okamoto H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). More recently, a human CD38 gene mutation (Arg 140 → Trp) that inhibits the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38 was found in four diabetic patients but not in control subjects (36Yagui K. Shimada F. Mimura M. Hashimoto N. Suzuki Y. Tokuyama Y. Nata K. Tohgo A. Ikehata F. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Makino H. Saito Y. Kanatsuka A. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Considered together with the results of the present study using knockout mice, it is reasonable to assume that there is a causal relationship between CD38 dysfunction and diabetes development in at least some patients. In this paper, we have focused on the role of CD38 in insulin secretion by glucose as one characteristic of CD38 knockout mice, but it would also be possible and important to study the physiological roles of CD38 in cADPR-mediated signaling in tissues other than pancreatic islets using CD38−/− mice. In fact, Cockayne et al.recently reported that they produced another CD38 knockout mouse line by deleting exons 2 and 3 of the CD38 gene and that the mice exhibited altered humoral immune responses (37Cockayne D.A.

Here we show that the p65 (RelA) component of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and p53 mutually repress each other's ability to activate transcription. Additionally, tumor necrosis factor-activated NF-κB is inhibited by UV light-induced p53. Both p65 and p53 depend upon the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) for maximal activity. Increased levels of the coactivator relieve p53-mediated repression of NF-κB activity and p65-mediated repression of p53-dependent gene expression. Nuclear competition for limiting amounts of CBP provides a novel mechanism for altering the balance between the expression of NF-κB-dependent proliferation or survival genes and p53-dependent genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 is an inducible transcription factor that plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression in response to inflammatory stimuli (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). It is composed of members of the Rel family (p50, p52, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB), which share a region of homology known as the Rel homology domain capable of directing DNA binding and mediating dimerization. In most cells, NF-κB is found in an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to an inhibitory protein, IκB. In response to multiple activating signals, the inhibitor is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome complex, and NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and induces gene expression. NF-κB components can interact with other DNA binding proteins, as well as with a series of non-DNA-binding coactivator proteins. Among these interactions, the p65 component of NF-κB, like a variety of signal-dependent transcriptional activators, can associate with CREB-binding protein (CBP) or its structural homolog p300 (2Gerritsen M.E.

Mice with a targeted mutation in the p65 component of NF-κB die before birth with extensive liver cell apoptosis (11Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts derived from these mice show increased apoptosis following TNFα stimulation, an effect that can be reversed by overexpression of p65 (4Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB activation increases cell death in response to multiple stimuli (7Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of constitutively active NF-κB in lymphoid cell lines causes apoptosis (8Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E.

One mechanism by which NF-κB inhibits cell death is to induce the expression of genes that promote resistance to apoptosis. These anti-apoptotic gene include A20 (12Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the immediate early response gene IEX-1L (13Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V. Wu R. Schlossman S.F.

Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Thus NF-κB can activate a set of genes that function cooperatively to suppress apoptosis. In contrast to NF-κB′s role in promoting cell survival, the p53 tumor suppressor gene plays an important role in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to various types of stress (15Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 16Levine A.J.

Dern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) and interacting with coactivators, such as CBP (18Avantaggiati M.L.

These interactions appear to be necessary for p53 to function as a transcription factor. p53 increases expression of multiple genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1/Cip and murine double minute (mdm2) (15Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 16Levine A.J.

Increased expression of the p21 gene by p53 correlates with cell cycle control by inducing G1 arrest or apoptosis (24El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis is closely regulated under normal conditions (22Lane D.P. Hall P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 10: 372-374Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Some oncogenes and stress signals regulate p53 activity through MDM2. This negative regulator of p53 functions in two ways: it binds to the activation domain of p53 and inhibits its ability to stimulate transcription, and MDM2 mediates the degradation of p53. In addition to having a role as a transcriptional activator, p53 represses the expression of multiple genes that lack p53 binding sites (25Ginsberg D. Mechta F. Yaniv M. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9979-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In contrast to activation by p53, no common consensus DNA binding site has been identified which correlates with the transcriptional repression. The biological consequences of p53-mediated repression of gene expression are not fully understood. The divergent roles played by NF-κB and p53 suggest that there might be mechanisms that integrate the activities of these regulatory factors. Some of this control may be provided by the common dependence of both NF-κB and p53-dependent gene expression on limiting levels of transcriptional coactivators. Since transactivation by both p53 and p65 involves CBP, we investigated the role of this coactivator in the p53 and NF-κB signaling pathways. We find that mutual transrepression of these diverse signaling systems results, at least in part, from competition for a limiting amount of this versatile transcriptional coactivator. Interactions between the p65 and p53 signaling pathways mediated by CBP may be an important aspect of regulating the diverse changes in gene expression associated with cell survival. SaoS2 and COS-7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). ECV-304 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom). The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium from Life Technologies, Inc. supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells were grown on 10-cm2 dishes and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The COS cells were cotransfected with −578 E-selectin promoter-CAT (26Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W.

Whole cell extracts were prepared from the transfected cells and CAT or luciferase activity determined as described previously (2Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T.

Transfected cells were treated with 100 units/ml TNFα (Endogene Sciences) for 30 min and then exposed to increasing amounts of ultraviolet light (10, 20, and 40 J/m2) using a Stratalinker (Stratagene) at 254 nm UV. Cells were harvested 4 h after exposure to UV light and whole cell extracts prepared. Aliquots from the cotransfection studies were saved prior to the freeze/thaw step in the CAT assay harvesting procedure. Cells were lysed in 5 × cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 20 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged briefly, and equivalent amounts of protein were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell), the membranes blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST buffer (containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20), and incubated with either p65 or p53 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA and PharMingen, San Diego, CA, respectively) antisera for 16 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed three times with TBST buffer, incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then washed three times in TBST. The antigen antibody interactions were visualized by incubation with ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were exposed to x-ray film for 10 s to 10 min. If CBP functions as a signal integrator for the NF-κB and p53 pathways, there might be mutual transcriptional interference between these two signal-dependent activators. To determine whether the p65 component of NF-κB alters p53 function, a p53 reporter plasmid containing the p21 promoter, a known p53 target gene associated with arrest of the cell cycle, was cotransfected with a fixed amount of p53 and increasing amounts of a p65 expression plasmid. As expected, p53 strongly activates the p21 promoter (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and3). Cotransfection of p65 resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of this reporter plasmid in SaoS2 cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–8) or in COS cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–5). p65-mediated suppression was also seen with a Bax promoter-reporter, a gene that is associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as an artificial promoter containing only multiple p53 binding sites (data not shown). In contrast to the p53-dependent genes, no repression of a Gal4-dependent promoter-reporter gene was seen (data not shown). Control studies also demonstrate that overexpressed p65 did not decrease production of p53 from the corresponding expression construct (Fig. 1, A and B, insets). To determine whether p53 could alter NF-κB-dependent gene expression, similar studies were done with a NF-κB-dependent E-selectin promoter-reporter construct (2Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 28Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a fixed amount of p65, and increasing amounts of p53. As predicted, p65 results in an induction of the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene (Fig. 1 C,lane 2). Increasing amounts of p53 resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of p65-mediated transactivation (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3–6). This effect was reversed by MDM2 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 7–9), an inhibitor of p53 transactivation. Control studies demonstrated that overexpression of MDM2 did not alter levels of p65 (Fig. 1 C,insets), although in some experiments it modestly increased p65-dependent gene expression (Fig. 1 C,lanes 7–9). MDM2 does not physically interact with p65 (data not shown). The presence of p53 had no effect on nuclear accumulation of NF-κB or DNA binding activity, and it did not physically interact with p65 (data not shown). Additionally, p53 did not increase expression of an inhibitor of NF-κB, IκB-α (data not shown). Thus p65-mediated transcriptional activation is repressed by p53, and p53-dependent gene expression is repressed by p65. One possibility suggested by the preceding findings is that the formation of complexes between either p65 or p53 and specific coactivators would reduce the amount of coactivator available for transcriptional activation. If competition for limiting amounts of CBP accounts for the inhibitory effect of p53, then increased levels of the coactivators should restore, or rescue, p65-dependent gene expression. Indeed, the inhibitory effect of p65 on p53-dependent gene expression was completely abolished by cotransfection of a vector expressing CBP (Fig.1 B, lane 6). In a similar manner, the suppression of p53 on p65-dependent gene expression was significantly decreased by CBP (Fig. 1 C, lanes 10–13). Control studies demonstrated that CBP overexpression did not alter levels of either p53 (Fig. 1, B and C, insets) or p65 (Fig. 1 C, inset). Additionally, overexpression of an irrelevant transcriptional activator, or mutated forms of CBP, did not result in rescue (data not shown). Collectively, these functional studies demonstrate that CBP is limiting for both p65- and p53-dependent transactivation and suggest that CBP can rescue the mutually repressive interaction between the two activators. The mutual transrepression of p53- and p65-dependent gene expression described above was observed with over expressed activators and might not reflect the situation with authentic levels of these transcription factors. To address this important issue, we determined whether TNFα-activated NF-κB was capable of inhibiting endogenous p53-mediated gene expression. Endothelial cells transfected with an E-selectin promoter-reporter were treated with TNFα and exposed to increasing amounts of UV irradiation. As expected, TNFα activated expression of the E-selectin promoter-reporter construct (Fig.2 A, lane 2). UV illumination resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of this activity (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–5). Cotransfection of an MDM2 expression plasmid, while significantly inhibiting a p53 transcriptional response (Fig.3 and data not shown), increased expression from the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene (Fig.2 A, lane 6). This suggests that the transcriptional activating capacity of endogenous p53 is required for the suppression of the E-selectin promoter-reporter construct. The inhibitory effect of endogenous p53 on NF-κB-dependent gene expression was completely abolished by cotransfection of a vector expressing CBP (Fig. 2 A, lane 7). In control studies, levels of β-galactosidase activity were measured in parallel with the activity of the reporter gene. In contrast to the results with the NF-κB-dependent reporter, neither the UV treatment nor cotransfection with either MDM2 or CBP altered the level of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2 B). These results are consistent with the possibility that the coactivator rescues endogenous p53-suppressed NF-κB-dependent gene expression.Figure 3UV-induced NF-κB activity is suppressed following irradiation. A, UV exposure induces expression of a p53-dependent reporter construct. ECV-304 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of a p21-promoter-luciferase construct in the presence or absence of 1 μg of an MDM2 expression vector. Treated cells were exposed to 40 J/m2 UV ultraviolet light and cells were harvested at the times indicated following stimulation. B, NF-κB activity induced by UV is stimulated by MDM2. ECV-304 cells were transfected with 2 μg of an E-selectin promoter-CAT reporter construct (−578-CAT) in the presence or absence of 1 μg of an MDM2 expression vector. Transfected cells were treated with UV as described above and harvested at the times indicated. The results shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The findings described above predict that if endogenous NF-κB and p53 are induced simultaneously they would inhibit each other's transcriptional activity. Because UV irradiation activates both transcription factors (29Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we used it as a stimulus to examine the effect of the signaling pathways on each other. UV exposure strongly induces expression of a p21 promoter-reporter construct (Fig. 3 A) in a time-dependent manner. In parallel, UV also activated expression of an E-selectin promoter-reporter gene (Fig.3 B). Cotransfection of an MDM2 expression plasmid blocked the p53 transcriptional response (Fig. 3 A), while increasing expression of the NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid (Fig.3 B). These results are consistent with the proposal that the transcriptional activity of endogenous NF-κB is regulated by p53. From these studies we suggest that cross-talk between the p53 and NF-κB signaling cascades is mediated by CBP. These findings are consistent with observations that the levels of p300 are limiting relative to those of p65 (30Hottigen M.O. Felzien L.K. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3124-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and that developmental processes are sensitive to the overall gene dosage of either CBP or its homolog, p300 (31Yao T.-P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.-D. Ch'ng L.-E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The common dependence of both p65 and p53 on CBP/p300 suggests that the coactivators may integrate multiple signaling pathways that converge on these transcription factors. For example, p53 inhibits AP-1-dependent transcription, and overexpression of p300 abolished the ability of p53 to inhibit AP-1 activity (18Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Garner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Similar interplay was observed between p53 and E2F through the coactivator p300 (32Lee C.W. Sorensen T.S. Shikama N. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1998; 28: 2695-2710Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). NF-κB-dependent gene expression is also regulated by coactivator competition. The p65 component of NF-κB and the glucocorticoid receptor mutually repress each other's ability to activate transcription (33Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased levels of CBP relieve the inhibition of glucocorticoid-mediated repression of NF-κB activity and the NF-κB mediated repression of GR activity (27Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29291-29294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The results described here indicate that NF-κB and p53 mutually repress each other's transcription, not only in vitro, but also in intact cells, and suggest that these signaling systems converge on the coactivators. Collectively, these studies are consistent with proposals that coactivator sequestration can function as a selection mechanism to determine patterns of gene expression (34Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Sheng-Cai L. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). This control process may be important in determining the fate of cells in which both NF-κB and p53 are activated. In settings where NF-κB is acting as a survival factor, NF-κB would induce several genes that promote resistance to apoptosis and entry into cell cycle. Indirectly, through coactivator competition, NF-κB would also suppress p53's ability to stimulate genes involved in cell death, such as Bax (35Miyashit T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1998; 80: 293-299Google Scholar), which might block the survival effect. In the context of cell death, p53 would activate expression of genes involved in apoptosis and suppress the survival signals generated by NF-κB-dependent gene expression. This control process could be dysregulated during formation of tumors (36Giles R.H. Peters D.J.M. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Key to understanding this level regulation is determining how CBP can simultaneously integrate the functions of these diverse transcriptional activators. The context in which the transcription factors are positioned in the various target gene promoters may determine their ability to compete for the coactivators and synergistically activate transcription (37Merika M. Williams A.J. Chen G. Collins T. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 227-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Additionally, CBP-associated proteins, such as p/CAF, may generate a series of distinct coactivator complexes (38Parvin J.D. Young R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These assemblies could be used differentially by specific groups of transcription factors, limiting cross-talk between signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2070503276,"We have explored whether the desensitization of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis affects the role that they play in modulating glutamate release. In hippocampal nerve terminals, the agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) facilitated evoked glutamate release, but a second stimulation 5 min later reduced rather than facilitated release. After a 30 min interval between stimulations, DHPG again facilitated glutamate release. In hippocampal slices, DHPG caused an inhibition of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded from CA1 neurons. However, when the effects of ambient glutamate were prevented, mGluR activation initially induced a facilitation of synaptic transmission, followed by an inhibition. We conclude that group I mGluRs have a dual action on glutamate release, switching from facilitatory to inhibitory upon receptor desensitization triggered by low concentrations of glutamate."

The impermeant reagents MTSES and MTSET react with residues at each end of the domain (A395C and A414C), supporting a model that places these residues near the extracellular surface.

Cells were treated with ionizing radiation at room temperature using a Gammacell 1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada) with a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.21 Gy/min. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (27Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W.

Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-p300 (RW128; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-CBP (06–294; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-MDM2 (Ab-1; Oncogene Science) for 1 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h.

Proteins were detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were cotransfected with: (i) pNF-κB-Luc and pFC-MEKK (Stratagene 219077), (ii) pCRE-Luc and pFC-PKA (Stratagene 219075), (iii) mdm2NA-Luc (28Barak Y. Gottlieb E. Juven-Gershon T. Oren M.

Empty vectors were used to control DNA amount. Luciferase activities were assayed at 24 h with an enhanced luciferase assay kit (1800K; Analytical Luminescence). Cells were harvested 24 h after IR exposure. BrdUrd was added 30 min before collection. Cells were stained for DNA content with propidium iodide and for DNA synthesis with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). Other cells were transfected with pEGFP-Ci by LipofectAMINE. After 24 h, the cells were exposed to IR. At 24 h after IR, the cells were harvested, fixed, and the GFP-positive cells were sorted for two-dimensional FACS analysis. Expression of the inactive p300 ribozyme (p300-RI) had no detectable effect on p300 levels (Fig.1 A). By contrast, the active p300 ribozyme (p300-R) markedly decreased p300, and not CBP, expression (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained in two independently selected cell clones (Fig. 1 A). Conversely, expression of the active CBP ribozyme (CBP-R) decreased CBP, but not p300, levels (Fig. 1 B). These findings supported specificity of the ribozymes for selective depletion of p300 or CBP. Also, none of the ribozymes had detectable effects on basal levels of p53 expression (Fig. 1, A and B). The effects of deficiency in p300 or CBP were investigated by assessing activation of the NF-κB and CRE transcription factor pathways. NF-κB activation by MEKK was significantly compromised in the p300-, but not in the CBP-, deficient cells (Fig. 1 C). By contrast, although stimulation of CRE activity by protein kinase A was partially affected by deficiency in p300, CRE activation was markedly attenuated in the CBP-deficient cells (Fig. 1 D). These findings confirm that transcriptional coactivation functions are selectively abrogated in cells deficient in p300 or CBP (18Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chirivia J.C. Richards A. Bachinger H.P.

Gottlieb E. Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Despite similar basal levels of p53 in the cell clones, the transactivation function of p53 was markedly decreased in the p300-deficient cells (Fig.2 A). By contrast, there was no apparent effect of CBP deficiency on p53 transcriptional activity (Fig.2 A). Similar results were obtained in the two independently selected p300- and CBP-deficient clones (data not shown). To confirm that the deficiency in p300 is responsible for the defect in p53-mediated transactivation, the p300-deficient cells were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter and a vector expressing HA-p300. The results demonstrate that the luciferase activity is restored in a dose-dependent manner by expression of p300 (Fig. 2 B). Cotransfection of p300 with a similar reporter driven by an MDM2 promoter with a mutated p53 binding site was associated with little if any induction of luciferase activity (data not shown). Whereas IR induces activation of p53, we asked whether p300-mediated p53 transactivation is involved in the responses to IR. The results demonstrate that exposure of p300-RI cells to IR results in activation of p53 transcriptional activity in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 2 C). By contrast, IR-induced p53 transactivation was significantly attenuated in p300-R cells. In concert with the basal transcriptional activity, deficiency in CBP did not appear to have any effect on IR-induced p53 activation. To determine whether p53 associates with the p300/CBP proteins, lysates from wild-type MCF-7 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p300 or anti-CBP. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates demonstrated binding of p53 to p300 and not CBP (Fig. 2 D). To define the functional consequences of the defect in p53-mediated transactivation in p300-deficient cells, we tested the ability of IR to induce a G1 arrest response. Using BrdUrd labeling and bivariate FACS analysis, we found less irradiated p300-deficient cells arrested in G1 phase compared with similarly treated control cells expressing the inactive ribozyme (Fig.3 A). Over 30% of the p300-deficient cells were in S phase 24 h after receiving 5 Gy IR compared with untreated controls. By contrast, irradiated CBP-deficient cells were less affected, with the S phase population being approximately 10% of untreated samples (Fig. 3, A andB). Similar results were obtained with the independently isolated p300- and CBP-deficient clones (data not shown). To confirm that p300 deficiency is responsible for the defective G1arrest response, the p300-deficient cells were transfected with the empty vector or HA-p300. The results demonstrate that the response to irradiation was restored by expression of p300 (Fig. 3 C). These findings indicate that p300, and not CBP, is necessary for the G1 arrest response to IR. Whereas IR-induced G1 growth arrest is impaired in p300-deficient cells, we asked whether this defect is due to a decrease in the transactivation function of p53. The results demonstrate that both the accumulation of p53 and the induction of p21 and MDM2 in response to IR are attenuated in the p300-deficient cells, but not in the CBP-deficient or control cells (Fig.4 A). To confirm that the deficiency in p300 is responsible for the impaired p53 response to IR, we transfected the p300-deficient cells with HA-p300. Transfection of HA-p300, but not the empty vector, restored IR-induced accumulation of p53 and the transactivation of p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 4 B). These findings suggest that the attenuated accumulation of p53 and the impaired induction of p21 in p300-deficient cells are responsible for the defect in IR-induced G1 arrest. Because DNA damage-induced accumulation of p53 is regulated by a post-translational mechanism (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar), the attenuated induction of p53 in irradiated p300-deficient cells prompted studies on p53 stability. FLAG-tagged p53 was cotransfected with a control vector or HA-p300 into p300-deficient cells. Stability of the FLAG-tagged p53 was assessed after the addition of cycloheximide. Comparison of the declines in p53 levels under the different experimental conditions demonstrates that p300 stabilizes the p53 protein (Fig. 4 C). MDM2 binds to p53 in the transactivation domain and promotes p53 degradation (32Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2797) Google Scholar, 33Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar, 34Bottger A. Bottger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To determine whether p300 affects the formation of p53-MDM2 complexes, anti-MDM2 immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-p53. The results demonstrate that the association between p53 and MDM2 is similar before and after irradiation in the p300-RI and p300-R cells (Fig. 4 D). These findings suggest that p300 stabilizes p53 by a mechanism that is not involved in disassociation of the p53-MDM2 complex. Our results obtained with cells deficient in p300 or CBP indicate that p53-dependent transactivation is mediated by a p300-dependent, CBP-independent mechanism. Whereas our findings in CBP-deficient cells suggest that CBP is not involved in induction of MDM2 expression, other studies have shown that transient overexpression of CBP potentiates activation of the mdm2gene by p53 (21Gu W. Shi X.-L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Indeed, we also found that transient overexpression of CBP in the p300-deficient cells restores in part the transcriptional coactivation of p53 (data not shown). These findings suggest that results obtained in transient overexpression or gain of function studies may confound interpretation of events observed in cells with loss or deficiency of function. In this context, p300-, but not CBP-, deficient cells exhibit defects in induction of p21 and MDM2 in the response to DNA damage. These results are in concert with the observation that p300, and not CBP, associates with p53 in cells. We show that p300, and not CBP, is required for the IR-induced accumulation of p53. The results indicate that p300 functions in the stabilization of p53. Thus, our findings collectively support a model in which p300 stabilizes p53 and contributes to the p53 transactivation function in the growth arrest response to DNA damage.

However, AGM CCR5 is a weak coreceptor for tested macrophage-tropic (R5) isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Correspondingly, gp120 envelope glycoproteins derived from R5 isolates of HIV-1 bind poorly to AGM CCR5. We focused on a unique extracellular amino acid substitution at the juncture of transmembrane helix 4 (TM4) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) (Arg for Gly at amino acid 163 (G163R)) as the likely source of the weak R5 gp120 binding and HIV-1 coreceptor properties of AGM CCR5. Accordingly, a G163R mutant of human CCR5 was severely attenuated in its ability to bind R5 gp120s and to mediate infection by R5 HIV-1 isolates. Conversely, the R163G mutant of AGM CCR5 was substantially strengthened as a coreceptor for HIV-1 and had improved R5 gp120 binding affinity relative to the wild-type AGM CCR5. These substitutions at amino acid position 163 had no effect on chemokine binding or signal transduction, suggesting the absence of structural alterations. The 2D7 monoclonal antibody has been reported to bind to ECL2 and to block HIV-1 binding and infection. Whereas 2D7 antibody binding to CCR5 was unaffected by the G163R mutation, it was prevented by a conservative ECL2 substitution (K171R), shared between rhesus and AGM CCR5s. Thus, it appears that the 2D7 antibody binds to an epitope that includes Lys-171 and may block HIV-1 infection mediated by CCR5 by occluding an HIV-1-binding site in the vicinity of Gly-163. In summary, our results identify a site for gp120 interaction that is critical for R5 isolates of HIV-1 in the central core of human CCR5, and we propose that this site collaborates with a previously identified region in the CCR5 amino terminus to enable gp120 binding and HIV-1 infections.

However, it is not known if 2D7 exerts its inhibitory effects by attaching to a site on CCR5 required for HIV-1 binding or if its binding globally alters CCR5 conformation or sterically interferes with gp120 interaction with another region of the receptor. Therefore, outside of an interaction with the amino terminus of the receptor, other interactions between HIV-1 and CCR5 critical to viral infection are incompletely delineated. Recently, we found a high frequency of heterozygosity for CCR5 substitution polymorphisms in African green monkeys (AGMs), a group of primate species believed to have been infected by immunodeficiency viruses since ancient times (28Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8642-8656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These initially identified substitutions predominantly cluster in the amino terminus (D13N and Y14N) and in ECL1 (Q93R and Q93K), and they partially inhibit infections by multiple SIVagmisolates. 2S. E. Kuhmann and D. Kabat, manuscript in preparation. 2S. E. Kuhmann and D. Kabat, manuscript in preparation. Infectivities of R5 HIV-1 isolates were also inhibited by the Y14N and Q93R substitutions in the context of the wild-type AGM CCR5 and by Y14N in the context of human CCR5 (28Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8642-8656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although wild-type AGM CCR5 is a strong coreceptor for SIV isolates, it is a relatively weak coreceptor for R5 HIV-1 isolates (28Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8642-8656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation was surprising because rhesus macaque CCR5 is a strong coreceptor for R5 HIV-1 isolates (37Chen Z. Zhou P. Ho D.D. Landau N.R. Marx P.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but differs from AGM CCR5 in only three amino acids. Indeed, the only extracellular amino acid substitution that is unique to AGM CCR5 and absent from rhesus and human CCR5s is G163R, which occurs at the juncture of TM4 and ECL2. We now describe evidence that this site is critical for gp120 binding and for infections by all tested R5 isolates of HIV-1. HeLa and HEK293T cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). HeLa-CD4 (clone HI-J) and HeLa-CD4-CCR5 (clone JC.37) cells were described previously (38Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kabat D. Kozak S.L. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2570-2577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa and HeLa-derived cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293T cells were maintained in the same medium supplemented with glucose (4.5 g/liter). The SF162, JRFL, ADA, and BaL R5 isolates of HIV-1 were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. HIV-1 viruses were passaged in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Medium was harvested at times of peak reverse transcriptase release, passed through a 0.45-μm pore size filter, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The JRCSF isolate was obtained as an infectious molecular clone, pYK-JRCSF, from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, and transfected into HeLa cells. Culture medium was harvested after 72 h and used to infect HeLa-CD4-CCR5 cells (clone JC.37). Viral supernatants were harvested and filtered as above, and the supernatant from day 3 after infection was used in this study. The rhesus macaque CCR5 expression plasmid was the generous gift of Zhiwei Chen and Preston Marx (Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center) (37Chen Z. Zhou P. Ho D.D. Landau N.R. Marx P.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs containing human and AGM CCR5 were previously described (28Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8642-8656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments, the human and AGM CCR5 plasmids were mutagenized to create the AGM (R163G) and human (G163R) CCR5s by the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as directed by the manufacturer; for the remaining experiments, mutants with identical coding sequences were created by swapping the BclI to BglII restriction fragment between AGM and human CCR5s. In either case, the entire coding sequence of CCR5 was sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutation was introduced. The chimeric CCR5s were created by splicing AGM and human CCR5 at either the BclI or BglII restriction site as described (28Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8642-8656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human (Y14N) site-directed mutant was described and characterized previously (28Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8642-8656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular clone pYU2 was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, and the molecular clone SF162 was from Cecelia Chang-Meyer. The expression and purification of YU2 gp120 are described, with similar procedures used for expression and purification of SF162 gp120. Briefly, the YU2 envelope glycoprotein gp120 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from proviral DNA using synthetic oligonucleotides designed according to the published sequence. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into pSC11 (40Li Y. Hui H. Burgess C.J. Price R.W. Sharp P.M. Hahn B.H. Shaw G.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6587-6600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), modified to contain a multilinker sequence, to generate pJL23, and was sequence verified. The 3′-antisense primer design appended a FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.) epitope to the gp120 viral envelope protein following position Arg-498. Plasmid pJL23 was used to generate recombinant vaccinia virus Venv-4 using standard techniques (41Cooper N. Earl P.L. Elroy-Stein O. Moss B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 16.15.1-16.19.9Google Scholar) for large scale expression of soluble gp120-FLAG. 16 T-225 flasks of CV-1 cells were seeded to contain approximately 1–2 × 107 cells/flask on the day of infection. Cells were infected with Venv-4 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 2 h in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. After infection, cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with 50 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) per flask. After approximately 68 h, supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Clarified supernatants were supplemented with Triton X-100 (Boehringer Mannheim) to 0.5%, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Soluble gp120-FLAG proteins were purified by fast protein liquid affinity chromatography using M2-anti-FLAG affinity gel (Kodak) in an HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, bed volume ∼1 ml) equilibrated in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). Culture supernatants (500–1000 ml) were thawed at 37 °C, supplemented to 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim), filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and then passed continuously over the M2 column at 1 ml/min at 4 °C for 24–28 h. The resin was washed extensively with TBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 100 μm synthetic FLAG peptide (Kodak) in TBS. Fractions (1 ml) containing gp120-FLAG were identified by Colloidal Blue staining of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Peak fractions were pooled, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Pooled fractions were separated from synthetic FLAG peptide and TBS by C4 reverse phase chromatography. Samples were loaded onto a 5-cm Vydac C4 analytical column at 1 ml/min in 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Using a 25–50% gradient, gp120 eluted at approximately 36–38% acetonitrile. Samples were collected on dry ice and were immediately lyophilized. Dried samples were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Relative protein concentration determinations were made using a modified gp120 capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Intracel, Issaquah, WA) using anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody A32 from James Robinson at Tulane. Fractions with peak activity according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were subjected to amino acid analysis for final concentration determinations. BaL gp120 was purified as described previously from the culture medium of Schneider 2 Drosophila cells that were generously donated by Dr. Raymond Sweet (SmithKline Beecham) (42Ivey-Hoyle M. Culp J.S. Chaikin M.A. Hellmig B.D. Matthews T.J. Sweet R.W. Rosenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 125I-MIP1α (2200 μCi/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Conditions for competition binding assays using chemokines are similar to those described previously (43Van Riper G. Siciliano S. Fischer P.A. Meurer R. Springer M.S. Rosen H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). YU2 gp120 was iodinated by the chloramine-T method according to the procedure of Rollins et al. (44Rollins T.E. Siciliano S. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 520-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assay conditions for measurement of direct binding of 125I-YU2 gp120 to CCR5-expressing cells, in the presence of 10 nm soluble CD4, and inhibition of binding of 125I-MIP1α to CCR5-expressing cells by YU2 gp120·sCD4 complexes have also been described previously (11Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Nature. 1996; 384: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). 3S.

For gp120 binding assays done using cells expressing transmembrane-bound CD4, pcDNA3 expression vectors for CD4 and CCR5 were cotransfected into HEK293T cells by the standard DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (45Chen C.A.

Cells were seeded 48 h after transfection at 2 × 105cells/well in poly-l-lysine-treated 24-well tissue culture cluster plates. 24 h later cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of BaL gp120 in DMEM, 10% FBS for 30 min at 37 °C.125I-MIP1β (2200 μCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 nm, and cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. The cells were washed, solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH, and counted in a gamma counter. Background counts were determined on vector-transfected cells and subtracted from the values obtained on CCR5-transfected cells. Counts were then expressed as percent binding by normalizing to values obtained with no added gp120. The assay to determine infectivities by R5 HIV-1 isolates was performed as described previously (28Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8642-8656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, coreceptors were transiently expressed in HeLa-CD4 (clone HI-J) cells by the calcium phosphate transfection method (45Chen C.A. Kingston R.E. Okayama H. Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.1.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection the cultures were trypsinized and plated at 1.5 × 104 cells/well of a 24-well cluster plate for HIV-1 infection. 72 h post-transfection cells were pretreated with DEAE-dextran (8 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min and then incubated with 0.2 ml of virus diluted in DMEM, 0.1% FBS at 37 °C. After 2 h the cells were fed with 1 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. The cells were then fixed in ethanol, and infected foci were visualized by an immunoperoxidase assay (46Chesebro B. Wehrly K. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using as primary antibody the 0.45-μm filtered supernatant from the anti-p24 hybridoma 183-H12–5C (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health). Stained foci were counted with a dissecting microscope under diffuse illumination, and values were normalized to those obtained using the same virus stock in the same experiment on cells transfected with wild-type human CCR5. Xenopus laevis oocytes were collected and prepared as described previously (47Madani N. Kozak S.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8005-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CCR5 cDNAs were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pOG-1 at a site between 5′- and 3′-untranslated Xenopus β-globin sequences. Kir 3.1 and CCR5 cRNAs were prepared as described previously, and oocytes were microinjected with 5–50 ng of capped cRNA (47Madani N. Kozak S.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8005-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological recording was done by two-electrode voltage clamp 2–5 days after cRNA injection as described (47Madani N. Kozak S.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8005-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocytes were clamped in a small chamber continually perfused with high K+ Ringer's solution (100 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), and recombinant human chemokines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) were applied by bath perfusion. The holding potential was set at −30 mV, and current-voltage records were obtained during 250-ms voltage jumps to potentials between +40 and −100 mV. Desensitization kinetics were determined by least squares fit to single exponential functions. Binding of the mouse monoclonal antibody 2D7 was determined on HEK293T cells transfected as for gp120 binding (above). 72 h post-transfection cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml 2D7 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) in DMEM, 10% FBS for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG serum (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) at a 1:400 dilution for 45 min, followed by125I-protein A (0.4 μCi/ml, 2 to 10 μCi/μg; NEN Life Science Products) for 45 min.

https://openalex.org/W1584931216,"Almost with clairvoyance, Charles and Francis Darwin in Power of Movement in Plants described in the last century a growth-promoting “influence” which, by its asymmetric distribution in plant organs, causes asymmetrical growth (tropism) after stimulation by gravity or light (1). Fifty years later, this “influence” was identified as indole-acetic acid (IAA), an endogenous member of the class of growth hormones called auxins (2). Auxins are actually morphogens, not hormones, because they are distributed in spatial gradients within plant organs. This gradient conveys to the developing cells their location within the morphogenic field—and their fate. The different concentrations of auxin along this gradient, in combination with other signals, trigger different responses—elongation at one position and differentiation at another, for example (3)."

IL-121 is a heterodimeric cytokine secreted from antigen presenting cells in response to bacteria and intracellular parasites and thus plays an important role in host defense against bacterial pathogens (1Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). IL-12 promotes the proliferation of T cells and NK cells and is required for the differentiation of T cells into the Th1 subset of T helper cells. Th1 cells are critical for cell-mediated immune responses, because they secrete IFN-γ, which enhances the activity of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells (1Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 2Hsieh C. Macatonia S.E. Tripp C.S. Wolf S.F. O'Garra A. Murphy K.M.

In addition to these essential functions, Th1-dominated responses are associated with pathologic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (4Romagnani S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Given this potential for immunopathology, it is important to understand the mechanisms that control the Th1 response to develop possible therapeutic interventions.IL-12 signals through the IL-12 receptor, which is composed of at least two subunits designated β1 and β2 (5Chua A.O. Chizzonite R. Desai B.B. Truitt T.P. Nunes P. Minetti L.J. Warrier R.J. Presky D.H. Levine J.F. Gately M.K. Gubler U. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar, 6Presky D.H. Yang H.

Both IL-12 receptor subunits are members of the hemapoietin receptor superfamily and have strong homology to the gp130 receptor (5Chua A.O. Chizzonite R. Desai B.B. Truitt T.P. Nunes P. Minetti L.J. Warrier R.J. Presky D.H. Levine J.F. Gately M.K. Gubler U. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar). The β1 receptor, although a low affinity binder of IL-12, is not capable of transducing an IL-12-mediated signal (6Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). A second subunit of the IL-12 receptor was subsequently identified that when coexpressed with the β1 subunit forms a high affinity receptor for IL-12 and confers IL-12 signaling (6Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). IL-12R β2 expression is differentially regulated in Th1versus Th2 cells (7Szabo S.J. Dighe A.S. Gubler U. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Th1 cells but not Th2 cells express the β2 subunit of the IL-12 receptor (8Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Following T cell activation, IL-12 and IFN-γ treatment induces β2 expression, whereas IL-4, a cytokine produced by Th2 cells, inhibits β2 expression resulting in loss of IL-12 signaling (7Szabo S.J. Dighe A.S. Gubler U. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 8Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of the β2 subunit of the IL-12 receptor is a crucial determinant of Th1 versus Th2 development.Cytokine binding to its receptor leads to activation of JAK kinases that phosphorylate the receptor on tyrosines located in the intracellular domain. The phosphorylated regions are binding sites for signal transduction molecules called STATs that are rapidly recruited to the receptor and tyrosine phosphorylated by JAK kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins induces their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate transcription. IL-12 stimulation results in TYK2 and JAK2 phosphorylation and interaction of TYK2 with the β1 subunit of the IL-12 receptor and interaction of JAK2 with the β2 subunit (9Bacon C.B. McVicar D.W.

Unlike STAT4, whose expression is limited to lymphoid and spermatogonia cells, JAK2 and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed (11Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 12Yamamoto K. Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

In addition, it has been reported that STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 can be activated in response to IL-12 (13Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Murphy K.M. J. Exp.

McKnight S.L. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the phosphotyrosine binding sites of all the other known STAT proteins have been identified, the tyrosine docking site of STAT4 has not previously been reported. The β2 subunit of the IL-12 receptor contains three tyrosines in its cytoplasmic domain, whereas the β1 subunit contains no tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain (5Chua A.O. Chizzonite R. Desai B.B. Truitt T.P. Nunes P. Minetti L.J. Warrier R.J. Presky D.H. Levine J.F. Gately M.K. Gubler U. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar, 6Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J.

Therefore, given the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in cytokine signaling pathways, we focused on the three tyrosines of the β2 subunit as possible docking sites for the STAT4 signaling protein in response to IL-12.We determined that STAT4 is activated through interaction with the tyrosine at amino acid 800 in the IL-12 receptor β2 subunit. STAT4 activation depends on interaction with the peptide sequence pYLPSNID (where pY represents phosphotyrosine), thus providing evidence for the specificity of the STAT4 SH2 domain for a unique binding site in the IL-12 receptor. In addition, we show that neither STAT1 nor STAT3 is activated directly through the IL-12 receptor.DISCUSSIONIL-12 stimulation results in activation of STAT4 through interaction with the IL-12 receptor (13Jacobson N.G.

In response to IL-12 stimulation, STAT4 is tyrosine phosphorylated and is competent for DNA binding and transcriptional activation of target genes. STAT4 function is necessary for mediating the IL-12 response and is crucial for Th1 development and efficient IFN-γ production as shown by STAT4 knock-out studies (25Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T.

Nature. 1996; 382: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar).Receptor binding by STAT proteins has been shown to be specific and dictated by the SH2 domain of the STAT proteins (reviewed in Refs. 18Dignam J.D.

STAT interaction with cytokine receptors depends on the phosphotyrosine residue in the receptor and the amino acid residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine that mediate specificity. In this paper, we demonstrate that STAT4 is activated by interacting with the IL-12 receptor and that the interaction of the STAT4 SH2 domain is specific for the peptide sequence pYLPSNID, the peptide at tyrosine 800 in the IL-12R β2 subunit. This tyrosine at amino acid 800 in the IL-12R β2 subunit is required for STAT4 DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation of the IRF-1 gene. STAT4 is not capable of binding the other peptide sequences at tyrosine residues 678 or 767 of the IL-12 β2 subunit, and these peptide sequences are not required for the activation of STAT4. The IL-12R peptide sequence pYLPSNID appears to be a specific protein binding site for STAT4. Other STATs, including STAT1, which has a closely related SH2 domain, cannot recognize the IL-12R pYLPSNID peptide. 3J. McKinney, unpublished results. STAT1 and STAT3 are activated by a number of cytokines (28Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 29Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that STAT1 and STAT3 are activated in response to IL-12. Jacobson et al. (13Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) reported that IL-12 induced weak tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and DNA binding activity of STAT3 in addition to STAT4. They showed that STAT3 was part of a IL-12-induced DNA complex that included STAT4, suggesting that STAT3 and STAT4 form heterodimers. Yu et al. (14Yu C.-R. Lin J.-X. Fink D.W. Akira S. Bloom E.T. Yamauchi A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 126-137PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated DNA-protein complexes containing STAT4, STAT1α, and STAT3 following treatment of NK cells with IL-12. These reports, however, did not address the issue of whether STAT1, STAT3, or STAT4 directly interacts with the IL-12 receptor. Interestingly, in our experiments, neither STAT1 nor STAT3 was activated by IL-12 through the transfected IL-12 receptor subunits under conditions in which STAT4 was phosphorylated. Perhaps STAT1 and STAT3 could be recruited to the IL-12 receptor through another factor that functions as an adaptor protein and is not present in 293 cells.For certain SH2-containing proteins, the +1 and +3 positions in phosphotyrosine peptides have been shown to confer binding specificity (30Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). All the known docking sites for STAT3, for instance, have a glutamine residue at the +3 position relative to tyrosine. None of the three tyrosine peptides in the IL-12 β2 receptor contain a glutamine in the +3 position, nor do they share amino acid sequence similarities to the STAT1 docking site in the IFN-γ receptor, pYDKPH (31Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 32Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our results that STAT1 and STAT3 are not activated directly by contact with the IL-12 receptor.The specificity of the various STAT protein SH2 domains for different tyrosine-containing peptides results in activation of specific cytokine signaling pathways and the induction of distinct gene expression patterns. We conclude that STAT4 has a unique peptide binding specificity among the STAT family and binds to the peptide sequence pYLPSNID. The unique specificity of STAT4 for its tyrosine-containing peptide sequence helps explain the distinct effects of IL-12 signaling.STAT binding peptides derived from cytokine receptors have the ability to disrupt STAT dimers and inhibit STAT tyrosine phosphorylationin vivo (19Hou J.

It may be possible to develop therapeutically useful compounds that, analogous to the receptor-derived peptides, will block the STAT-receptor interaction, thus preventing STAT activation and subsequent signaling.The ability to reconstitute IL-12 signaling by transfecting the β1 and β2 subunits of the IL-12 receptor will facilitate the analysis of IL-12 receptor structure and function. In addition to activation of the JAKs resulting in STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, IL-12 also stimulates STAT4 serine phosphorylation possibly by mitogen-activated protein kinase or Lck (21Cho S.S.

Immunol. 1995; 165: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine which regions of the receptor are required for triggering these signaling pathways. IL-121 is a heterodimeric cytokine secreted from antigen presenting cells in response to bacteria and intracellular parasites and thus plays an important role in host defense against bacterial pathogens (1Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). IL-12 promotes the proliferation of T cells and NK cells and is required for the differentiation of T cells into the Th1 subset of T helper cells. Th1 cells are critical for cell-mediated immune responses, because they secrete IFN-γ, which enhances the activity of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells (1Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 2Hsieh C. Macatonia S.E. Tripp C.S. Wolf S.F. O'Garra A. Murphy K.M.

Med. 1993; 177: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). In addition to these essential functions, Th1-dominated responses are associated with pathologic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (4Romagnani S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Given this potential for immunopathology, it is important to understand the mechanisms that control the Th1 response to develop possible therapeutic interventions. IL-12 signals through the IL-12 receptor, which is composed of at least two subunits designated β1 and β2 (5Chua A.O. Chizzonite R. Desai B.B. Truitt T.P. Nunes P. Minetti L.J. Warrier R.J. Presky D.H. Levine J.F. Gately M.K. Gubler U. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar, 6Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Both IL-12 receptor subunits are members of the hemapoietin receptor superfamily and have strong homology to the gp130 receptor (5Chua A.O. Chizzonite R. Desai B.B. Truitt T.P. Nunes P. Minetti L.J. Warrier R.J. Presky D.H. Levine J.F. Gately M.K. Gubler U. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar). The β1 receptor, although a low affinity binder of IL-12, is not capable of transducing an IL-12-mediated signal (6Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). A second subunit of the IL-12 receptor was subsequently identified that when coexpressed with the β1 subunit forms a high affinity receptor for IL-12 and confers IL-12 signaling (6Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). IL-12R β2 expression is differentially regulated in Th1versus Th2 cells (7Szabo S.J. Dighe A.S. Gubler U. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Th1 cells but not Th2 cells express the β2 subunit of the IL-12 receptor (8Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Following T cell activation, IL-12 and IFN-γ treatment induces β2 expression, whereas IL-4, a cytokine produced by Th2 cells, inhibits β2 expression resulting in loss of IL-12 signaling (7Szabo S.J. Dighe A.S. Gubler U. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 8Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of the β2 subunit of the IL-12 receptor is a crucial determinant of Th1 versus Th2 development. Cytokine binding to its receptor leads to activation of JAK kinases that phosphorylate the receptor on tyrosines located in the intracellular domain. The phosphorylated regions are binding sites for signal transduction molecules called STATs that are rapidly recruited to the receptor and tyrosine phosphorylated by JAK kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins induces their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate transcription. IL-12 stimulation results in TYK2 and JAK2 phosphorylation and interaction of TYK2 with the β1 subunit of the IL-12 receptor and interaction of JAK2 with the β2 subunit (9Bacon C.B. McVicar D.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6073-6077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Unlike STAT4, whose expression is limited to lymphoid and spermatogonia cells, JAK2 and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed (11Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 12Yamamoto K. Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

In response to IL-12, STAT4 has been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in Th1 lymphocytes and NK cells (9Bacon C.B. McVicar D.W. Ortaldo J.R. Rees R.C. O'Shea J.J. Johnston J.A. J.

Med. 1995; 181: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 can be activated in response to IL-12 (13Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 14Yu C.-R. Lin J.-X. Fink D.W. Akira S. Bloom E.T. Yamauchi A. J.

STAT proteins, by way of their SH2 domains, interact with specific phosphotyrosine residues on cytokine receptors (16Schindler U. Hoey T. McKnight S.L. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the phosphotyrosine binding sites of all the other known STAT proteins have been identified, the tyrosine docking site of STAT4 has not previously been reported. The β2 subunit of the IL-12 receptor contains three tyrosines in its cytoplasmic domain, whereas the β1 subunit contains no tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain (5Chua A.O. Chizzonite R. Desai B.B. Truitt T.P. Nunes P. Minetti L.J. Warrier R.J. Presky D.H. Levine J.F. Gately M.K. Gubler U. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar, 6Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J.

Therefore, given the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in cytokine signaling pathways, we focused on the three tyrosines of the β2 subunit as possible docking sites for the STAT4 signaling protein in response to IL-12. We determined that STAT4 is activated through interaction with the tyrosine at amino acid 800 in the IL-12 receptor β2 subunit. STAT4 activation depends on interaction with the peptide sequence pYLPSNID (where pY represents phosphotyrosine), thus providing evidence for the specificity of the STAT4 SH2 domain for a unique binding site in the IL-12 receptor. In addition, we show that neither STAT1 nor STAT3 is activated directly through the IL-12 receptor. DISCUSSIONIL-12 stimulation results in activation of STAT4 through interaction with the IL-12 receptor (13Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Murphy K.M. J. Exp.

In response to IL-12 stimulation, STAT4 is tyrosine phosphorylated and is competent for DNA binding and transcriptional activation of target genes. STAT4 function is necessary for mediating the IL-12 response and is crucial for Th1 development and efficient IFN-γ production as shown by STAT4 knock-out studies (25Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T.

STAT interaction with cytokine receptors depends on the phosphotyrosine residue in the receptor and the amino acid residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine that mediate specificity. In this paper, we demonstrate that STAT4 is activated by interacting with the IL-12 receptor and that the interaction of the STAT4 SH2 domain is specific for the peptide sequence pYLPSNID, the peptide at tyrosine 800 in the IL-12R β2 subunit.

STAT4 is not capable of binding the other peptide sequences at tyrosine residues 678 or 767 of the IL-12 β2 subunit, and these peptide sequences are not required for the activation of STAT4. The IL-12R peptide sequence pYLPSNID appears to be a specific protein binding site for STAT4. Other STATs, including STAT1, which has a closely related SH2 domain, cannot recognize the IL-12R pYLPSNID peptide. 3J. McKinney, unpublished results.

Interestingly, in our experiments, neither STAT1 nor STAT3 was activated by IL-12 through the transfected IL-12 receptor subunits under conditions in which STAT4 was phosphorylated. Perhaps STAT1 and STAT3 could be recruited to the IL-12 receptor through another factor that functions as an adaptor protein and is not present in 293 cells. For certain SH2-containing proteins, the +1 and +3 positions in phosphotyrosine peptides have been shown to confer binding specificity (30Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). All the known docking sites for STAT3, for instance, have a glutamine residue at the +3 position relative to tyrosine. None of the three tyrosine peptides in the IL-12 β2 receptor contain a glutamine in the +3 position, nor do they share amino acid sequence similarities to the STAT1 docking site in the IFN-γ receptor, pYDKPH (31Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 32Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our results that STAT1 and STAT3 are not activated directly by contact with the IL-12 receptor. The specificity of the various STAT protein SH2 domains for different tyrosine-containing peptides results in activation of specific cytokine signaling pathways and the induction of distinct gene expression patterns. We conclude that STAT4 has a unique peptide binding specificity among the STAT family and binds to the peptide sequence pYLPSNID. The unique specificity of STAT4 for its tyrosine-containing peptide sequence helps explain the distinct effects of IL-12 signaling. STAT binding peptides derived from cytokine receptors have the ability to disrupt STAT dimers and inhibit STAT tyrosine phosphorylationin vivo (19Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.Z. Brasseur M.

It may be possible to develop therapeutically useful compounds that, analogous to the receptor-derived peptides, will block the STAT-receptor interaction, thus preventing STAT activation and subsequent signaling. The ability to reconstitute IL-12 signaling by transfecting the β1 and β2 subunits of the IL-12 receptor will facilitate the analysis of IL-12 receptor structure and function. In addition to activation of the JAKs resulting in STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, IL-12 also stimulates STAT4 serine phosphorylation possibly by mitogen-activated protein kinase or Lck (21Cho S.S.

Our studies demonstrate that the addition of calyculin A blocks platelet adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen, responses that depend on integrin αIIbβ3 signaling. We hypothesized that this reflects a change in αIIbβ3 structure caused by a specific state of phosphorylation. We show that addition of calyculin A leads to increased phosphorylation of the β3 subunit, and phosphoamino acid analysis reveals that only threonine residues become phosphorylated; sequence analysis by Edman degradation established that threonine 753 became stoichiometrically phosphorylated during inhibition of platelet phosphatases by calyculin A. This region of β3 is linked to outside-in signaling such as platelet spreading responses. The effect of calyculin A on platelet adhesion and spreading and on the phosphorylation of T-753 in β3 is reversed by the calcium ionophore A23187, demonstrating that these effects of calyculin A are not generally toxic ones.

Effective hemostasis depends on three basic platelet responses (1Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. McIntire L.V. Schafer A.I. Moake J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1525-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, adhesion, which includes attachment and spreading reactions, initiates events that lead to formation of a hemostatic plug. Second, secretion of factors aid in the activation of additional platelets and in the repair of the damaged vessel wall. Third, aggregation of recruited platelets to each other and to adhered platelets results in growth of the hemostatic plug. Both adhesive and aggregatory responses are controlled by the coordinate actions of cell surface glycoprotein receptors. Many of these receptors are dimers of two different subunits (2Rosenfeld S.J. Gralnick H.R. Acta Haematol. 1997; 97: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These include selective members of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules such as α2β1 (collagen-binding), α6β1(laminin), α5β1 (fibronectin), and αIIbβ3 (fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor) (for review, see Ref. 1Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. McIntire L.V. Schafer A.I. Moake J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1525-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The αIIbβ3 complex (glycoprotein IIb–IIIa) is unique among integrin molecules expressed on platelets; it functions as a binary switch. On resting platelets, αIIbβ3 exists in an inactive conformation in which the binding pocket for soluble forms of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor is cryptic. Thus, before activation, the interaction of αIIbβ3 is limited to surface-bound fibrinogen, which supports adhesion under low shear forces (2Rosenfeld S.J. Gralnick H.R. Acta Haematol. 1997; 97: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 3Zaidi T.N. McIntire L.V. Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11227-11233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of platelet activation, αIIbβ3converts to an active conformation (via a process referred to as inside-out signaling) and becomes capable of binding other surface-bound molecules and soluble forms of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (6Goto S. Salomon D.R. Ikeda Y. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23352-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This latter activity facilitates platelet aggregation. The molecular events that switch αIIbβ3 into a high affinity state are not known. Structural correlations have identified potential cytoplasmic motifs in β3 that regulate its activation. First, a naturally occurring mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of αIIbβ3 negatively modulates its activity: serine 752 to proline mutation in the cytoplasmic portion of β3, a variant associated with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, inhibits αIIbβ3 signaling (7Chen Y.-P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.-M. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10169-10173Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 8Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Rosa J.-P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, site-directed mutagenesis of Asp723 in β3 effectively disrupts potential salt bridges between the α and β subunits and results in a constitutively active integrin molecule (9Hughes P.E.

Thus, it appears that changes in charge in the cytoplasmic portion of β3 may have important consequences with respect to integrin structure and function. Phosphorylation of β3 on a threonine residue, which would change the charge in β3, has been implicated in exposing binding sites on αIIbβ3 (10Parise L.V. Criss A.B. Nannizzi L. Wardell M.R. Blood. 1990; 75: 2363-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11van Willigen G. Hers I. Gorter G. Akkerman J.-W.N. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although the role that this phosphorylation plays in integrin function is unknown (12Hillery C.A. Smyth S.S. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14663-14669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Suggesting that a phosphorylation event controls αIIbβ3 activation is in accordance with protein phosphorylation events regulating numerous platelet responses, including adhesion and aggregation (13Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of proteins on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is controlled by the competing activities of protein kinases and phosphatases. Thus, increased phosphorylations can represent increased kinase activity or decreased phosphatase activity. Platelets contain numerous protein kinases (13Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and protein seryl/threonyl phosphatase types 1, 2A, and 2B (14Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6819-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Tallant E.A. Wallace R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7744-7751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases are active in resting and stimulated platelets (14Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6819-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) whereas type 2B, a Ca2+-dependent, calmodulin-stimulated enzyme, is only active after platelet activation (15Tallant E.A. Wallace R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7744-7751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the physiological significance of these enzymes in platelets, membrane-permeable inhibitors have been used. Type 1 and 2A phosphatases have been implicated in controlling platelet responses including aggregations (16Lerea K.M.

Previous studies have shown that calyculin A, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, inhibits platelet aggregation, which is dependent on αIIbβ3 function. The present study tests whether calyculin A affects other αIIbβ3 functions and tests the hypothesis that altered αIIbβ3 function is linked to altered structure of this integrin. The data show that, in addition to an effect on aggregation, calyculin A blocks platelet adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen, reactions that depend on αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Biochemical analysis links calyculin A effects to β3 phosphorylation. Sequence analysis demonstrates that threonine 753, which is in the intracellular segment of β3, becomes stoichiometrically phosphorylated. These data suggest that structural modification of β3, through phosphorylation, may regulate outside-in, and perhaps inside-out, signaling through the αIIbβ3 integrin. Prostaglandin E1, apyrases, aprotinin, leupeptin, benzamidine, protein A-Sepharose, human fibrinogen, low molecular weight heparin (M raprox. 3,000), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium vanadate, and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma. [32P]Orthophosphate was purchased from DuPont NEN. LC Services supplied calyculin A. Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Boehringer Mannheim supplied sequencing grade AspN protease and trypsin. Hirudin (BKHV recombinant) was obtained from Calbiochem. The C18 reverse phase TSK-GEL ODS-120T column was purchased from Toso Haas (Montgomeryville, PA). Anti-β3 polyclonal antiserum (E8) was a gift from Drs. David Phillips and Debbie Law (COR Therapeutics, San Francisco, CA). Human blood (10 parts) was drawn into acid-citrate-dextrose (1 part). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained after centrifugation at 210 × g for 10 min at 21 °C. After the addition of prostaglandin E1 (0.4 μm) and apyrases (12.5 milliunits/ml), platelets were removed by centrifugation at 1100 × g for 15 min at 21 °C. Platelets were resuspended in a modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 6.4, containing 5 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.2 μm prostaglandin E1, and apyrases (6 milliunits/ml), recentrifuged at 1100 × g, and suspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, and 12 mm NaHCO3 at a concentration of 2 × 109/ml. Platelet suspensions (4 ml) were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C before treatment with calyculin A (100 nm) for 5 min. Platelets were directly solubilized using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate. Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting soluble fraction was incubated with anti-β3 (10 μg/mg of lysate) for 16 h at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and solubilized with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE,1 stained using Coomassie Blue, destained, and either dried for autoradiography or maintained hydrated for efficient extraction of β3 for identification of phosphorylation sites. Phosphoproteins extracted from SDS gels were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C, and phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on cellulose plates using 2.5% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid, pH 1.9, in the first dimension and 0.5% pyridine and 5% acetic acid, pH 3.5, in the second dimension (24Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated32P-labeled β3 was reduced and alkylated by the method of Talmadge et al. (29Talmadge K. Kaufman J. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3988-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) before SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained β3 was cut from the gel using a scalpel and digested with AspN in situ and extracted (25Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). The extracts were concentrated under vacuum, resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 6 m guanidine-HCl, and fractionated on a 120T C18 reverse phase column (reverse phase HPLC), collecting fractions by peak detection (30Deshpande K.L. Fried V.A. Ando M. Webster R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Isolated peptides were sequenced by automated Edman degradation on a model 477/120A pulse liquid sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using standard chemistry. Washed platelets (5 × 108/ml) were treated with either buffer or 100 nm calyculin A for 5 min at 21 °C. After the addition of buffer or A23187 (0.25 μm), the platelets were added to fibrinogen-coated slides and allowed to settle for 20–30 min. In some experiments, apyrase (0.5 units, Sigma) or ADP (10 μm, Sigma) were included in the incubations before adding the cells to the slides. Adhered platelets were processed for confocal microscopy as described below. Perfusions were conducted using one of three parallel plate perfusion chambers as described previously (26Sakariassen K.S. Joss R. Muggli R. Kuhn H. Tschopp T.B. Sage H. Baumgartner H.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 276-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blood was drawn into acid-citrate-dextrose at a ratio of 1:10 (acid-citrate-dextrose:blood), hirudin (200 units/ml), or low molecular weight heparin (6 units/ml). Under the flow conditions described below, platelets adhered poorly in the presence of low molecular weight heparin, an anticoagulant that does not chelate calcium (n = 3), 2R. I. Kirk and K. M. Lerea, unpublished observation. precluding its use in subsequent studies. This is analogous to its effect on platelet adhering to fibronectin (32Beumer S. Ijsseldijk M.J.W. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 3724-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blood (4 ml) was prewarmed at 37 °C for 10 min before the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, 0.001% final) or varying concentrations of calyculin A. After an additional 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the blood was perfused through the chamber containing a fibrinogen-coated coverslip positioned 70 mm from the inlet valve. Whole blood was used within 3 h of withdrawal. Flow was conducted using two different approaches. In one approach, blood was allowed to recirculate for 10 min at 10 ml/min through an eight-roller precalibrated peristaltic pump (Cole Parmer). Under these conditions, wall shear rates of 650 and 100/s were achieved. Alternatively, whole blood passed through the chambers one time at a constant flow rate for 1–2 min. Flow rates of 1 and 2 ml/min produced 65 and 520/s wall shear rates, respectively, which corresponds to flow in veins and small arteries. When indicated, platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 1100 ×g for 3 min at 21 °C. Platelet counts in the platelet-rich plasma were standardized to 350,000/μl using a modified Tyrode's buffer. Calyculin A treatment and perfusion of platelet-rich plasma through the chamber were conducted as described for whole blood. For preparation of surfaces for flow studies, suspensions of 0.1 mg/ml fibrinogen, prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, were sprayed onto plastic coverslips using a retouching airbrush (model 100; Badger, Franklin Park, IL) at a nitrogen pressure of 1 atm as described previously (26Sakariassen K.S. Joss R. Muggli R. Kuhn H. Tschopp T.B. Sage H. Baumgartner H.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 276-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips (18 × 22 mm) were spray-coated with ∼300 ul to a final surface density of ∼5 μg/cm2. The coverslips were kept at 21 °C for up to 12 h. Before perfusion with whole blood or platelet-rich plasma, coverslips were washed for 5 min with a modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4. For static adhesions, drops of the fibrinogen solution were pipetted onto glass slides and dried at room temperature. The matrix was washed with the modified Tyrode's buffer before the adhesion assay. After perfusion with blood, the coverslips were immediately washed under flow conditions with the modified Tyrode's buffer for 1 min. The coverslips were removed, fixed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 min, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, platelets were washed twice with TBS, blocked for 3 min with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Adhered platelets were imaged using a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 confocal microscope. Platelets were viewed after excitation with an argon laser beam using either an inverted- or upright-staged microscope equipped with a 60× oil immersion or 40× dry objective and an epifluorescent illumination attachment. The percentage of area covered by platelets was determined using a digitized palette and Sigmascan software. Previous studies have shown that calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein seryl/threonyl phosphatase types 1 and 2A, markedly reduces platelet aggregation induced by collagen (18Chiang T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and low doses of thrombin (17Hoyt C.H. Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9565-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These data support the idea that calyculin A blocks inside-out signaling linked to αIIbβ3. In the presence of high thrombin doses, calyculin A does not inhibit aggregation but does block cytoskeletal assembly that is usually coupled to an aggregatory response (17Hoyt C.H. Lerea K.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9565-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This indicates that calyculin A blocks outside-in signaling by activated αIIbβ3. To further test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of calyculin A on platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, a process that depends on outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling. Platelet adhesion was measured in both flow and static assays. To determine the effect of calyculin A on platelet adhesion in a physiological setting, we used flow conditions. Citrated blood was treated with either vehicle or 100 nm calyculin A and recirculated through a parallel plate perfusion chamber at a wall shear rate of 650/s. The percent area covered by vehicle-treated platelets was ∼40% (n = 5) on fibrinogen-coated surfaces (Fig.1 A). Adhesion was blocked by 80 ± 5% (mean ± S.E.; n = 4) by preincubating the blood with 100 nm calyculin A (Fig.1 B). Similarly, calyculin A added directly to platelet-rich plasma inhibited platelet deposition to fibrinogen, establishing that the drug was directly affecting platelets. As seen in Fig. 1, substantial aggregation occurred when a recirculating system was used. This likely reflects the activation of platelets as a consequence of being exposed to the fibrinogen matrix and to activating agents release from adhered cells. To minimize this aggregatory response, whole blood was passed through the chambers one time at wall shear rates of 65 and 520/s. Under these conditions platelets adhered as singlets (Fig. 2,A and C). Regardless of the flow rate, a decrease in deposition by >90% (n = 4) was observed by pretreating whole blood with calyculin A (Fig. 2, B andD). The decrease in platelet adhesion in citrated blood occurred in the presence of 100 nm calyculin A. As discussed later, the response to calyculin A occurs at a very sharp concentration threshold. These findings were confirmed using varying preparations of calyculin A. The dramatic effect of phosphatase inhibitors on the adhesive properties of platelets observed in citrated blood might possibly be exaggerated by the effects of citrate itself in the experimental system. It is known that divalent cations modulate the binding of αIIbβ3 to fibrinogen, and it is possible that citrate, as a divalent cation chelator, is modifying platelet interactions that are exaggerating the effect of calyculin A (31Kirchhofer D. Gailit J. Ruoshlahti E. Grzesiak J. Pierschbacher M.D. J Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18525-18530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect of phosphatase inhibition was dependent on citrate, we repeated the adhesion studies using the anticoagulant hirudin, which is not an ion chelator. Platelets from hirudin-treated blood adhered as singlets in the absence of calyculin A (Fig.2 E; n = 2), and, as with the citrated blood, adhesion was reduced by 90% in the presence of calyculin A (Fig.2 F; n = 2). Therefore, the effect of phosphatase inhibition by calyculin A on platelet adhesion is not dependent on the anticoagulant, strongly suggesting that phosphorylation plays a direct role in regulating platelet adhesion under physiological conditions. Adhesion represents the attachment and spreading of platelets on matrices. This latter response confers tight adhesion, allowing platelets to withstand high shear forces associated with arterial and venous flow. To test whether the effect of calyculin A on platelet adhesion seen under flow conditions correlates with decreased platelet spreading, we monitored the effect of calyculin A on platelet spreading to fibrinogen. On adherence, >90% nontreated platelets spread (Fig.3 A). In contrast, calyculin A-treated platelets adhered, but only as singlets (Fig. 3 B). Thus, under conditions in which type 1 and 2A phosphatases are inhibited, platelets attach but do not spread. Their ability to attach was further demonstrated by Western analysis of adhered “control” and “calyculin A-treated” platelets using β3antibodies; similar levels of protein were found, indicating that equal numbers of platelets adhered (data not shown). Increased spreading of calyculin A-treated platelets can be restored by applying calcium ionophore (A23187) to the platelet suspension before they settle onto fibrinogen. The addition of 0.25 μm A23187 to a suspension of calyculin A-treated platelets resulted in increased platelet spreading (Fig. 3 C). The reversal of calyculin A inhibition by A23187 demonstrates that inhibition of phosphatases has a specific effect on platelet functions. The apparent effect of A23187 did not result from the release of ADP; the addition of apyrases did not reverse the ionophore effect, and the addition of 10 μm ADP did not overcome the effect of calyculin A. The effect of the calcium ionophore appears to be calmodulin-dependent; trifluoperazine prevents the effect of A23187 (Fig. 3 D). Because the platelet responses affected by calyculin A are mediated by αIIbβ3, we hypothesized that hyperphosphorylation of αIIbβ3 could be the structural change that modifies αIIbβ3function. Thus, studies were undertaken to determine the phosphorylation state of αIIbβ3 in calyculin A-treated platelets. The cytoplasmic portion of β3 (residues 716–762) contains 8 potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites: 7 threonines and 1 serine (27Fitzgerald L.A. Steiner B. Rall S.C. Lo S. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3936-3939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine its phosphorylation state, β3 was immunoprecipitated from platelets that had been labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with calyculin A. Immunoprecipitated β3 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. As seen in Fig. 3, little β3 was phosphorylated in the absence of calyculin A (Fig. 3 A), whereas a loss of phosphatase activity by calyculin A treatment led to increased phosphorylation of β3 (Fig. 3 B). This correlated with a decrease in spreading. The addition of a calcium ionophore, which partially restores spreading, caused a corresponding dephosphorylation in β3 (Fig. 3 C). The major protein band that becomes phosphorylated by calyculin A treatment is β3, as identified by Western analysis (Fig.4 A). Maximal phosphorylation occurred at 100 nm calyculin A (Fig.5; n = 3), a concentration that inhibits adherence to fibrinogen (as shown in Figs.1, 2, and 5) and collagen-induced aggregations (18Chiang T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The same concentration of ionophore that reversed the effect of calyculin A on platelet spreading decreased the phosphorylation of β3(shown in Fig. 3), which is likely attributable to the activation of the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2B. Together, the data indicate that an inverse relationship exists between β3 phosphorylation and platelet adhesion reactions.Figure 5Dose responsiveness of β3phosphorylation and platelet adhesion to calyculin A. Washed32P-labeled platelets and whole blood were treated with varying concentrations of calyculin A before phosphorylation studies or adhesion assays, respectively. In both cases, calyculin A treatment lasted 5 min. Bands corresponding to immunoprecipitated β3 are shown and are representative of three different experiments. For platelet adhesions, perfusions were conducted for 2–8 min using both recirculating and single pass conditions and chambers that mimic arterial flow.

The sites of phosphorylation of β3 were determined directly by a two-dimensional peptide isolation and sequencing approach. β3 was immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled platelets exposed to 100 nm calyculin A, reduced, alkylated, and separated from coprecipitating polypeptides by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained β3 band was excised and digested in situ with AspN. Proteolytic fragments were separated by reverse phase HPLC. Peptide peaks (and gaps between peaks) were collected, and their content of 32P was determined by Cerenkov counting. Two prominent 32P-labeled peptides were recovered (Fig. 6 A,N-1 and N-2). Approximately 40% of the32P was recovered in N-1, and 60% was recovered in N-2. These radiolabeled peptide fractions were digested with trypsin and refractionated by reverse phase HPLC. All the radioactivity from each digest was recovered in single peaks, indicating the presence of only one phosphopeptide from each digest. Both of these phosphopeptides were sequenced, and the resulting analysis revealed that both peptides were residues 749–760 of β3 (Fig. 6 A). The sequences of these peptides differed in that the peptide generated from N-1 was missing a detectable signal at threonine 753, whereas the peptide generated from N-2 was missing the threonine residues at positions 751 and 753. Because a phosphorylated residue is not released for detection in the Applied Biosystems protein sequencers, the absence of a signal at these positions is consistent with these threonine residues being the sites of phosphorylation. Using quantitative regression to extrapolate the initial yield of each peptide (Fig.6 B), the singly (Thr753) phosphorylated peptide, N-1, was ∼ 3 pmol, and the doubly (Thr751 and Thr753) phosphorylated peptide, N-2, was ∼2 pmol. The amount of peptide 32P sequenced was initially 160 cpm for N-1 peptide and 230 cpm for N-2 peptide, and, assuming equal efficiencies for initial coupling during sequencing of these samples, the specific activity for N-1 is 53 cpm/pmol, and that for N-2 is 115 cpm/pmol. These results are consistent with one phosphorylation site in peptide N-1 and two in peptide N-2; this independently confirms the phosphothreonine assignment derived from direct Edman sequencing. Direct sequence analyses of other peptide peaks obtained from the same AspN digests gave recoveries of ∼5–8 pmol (data not shown). Because these peptides represented extracellular regions of β3not related to phosphorylation, the recovery of phosphorylated peptides (∼5 pmol) is consistent with a nearly stoichiometric phosphorylation (63–100%) of platelet β3. Thus, inhibiting protein seryl/threonyl phosphatase activity in platelets results in the phosphorylation of almost all β3 molecules at Thr753 and the phosphorylation at Thr751 in ∼50% of β3 molecules. The present study tests the hypothesis that decreased type 1 and 2A phosphatase activity affects platelet responses by altering the structure of αIIbβ3. Indeed, the addition of calyculin A decreases platelet adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen. A major finding of these studies is that phosphatase inhibition leads to increased phosphorylation of β3 on threonine residues, linking this phosphorylation event to decreased outside-in signaling. These data suggest that protein phosphatases are critical for regulating αIIbβ3 activity. The phosphorylation of β3 occurs on threonine residues adjacent to serine 752. Given that a point mutation of this serine to proline adversely affects αIIbβ3 function and is linked to reduced aggregation (7Chen Y.-P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.-M. Caen J.P.

Finally, being that threonine 753 in β3 is conserved in the other β-integrin subunits (28Pasqualini R. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that phosphorylation of this conserved residue may be a common mechanism to negatively modulate integrin adhesiveness to ligands. In support of this, preliminary studies indicate that calyculin A blocks platelet adhesion to collagen and laminin, which bind via integrins that contain β1 subunits."

Cbl phosphorylation was dependent on Fc receptor engagement. An association of Cbl with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) occurred in parallel with Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation.

A deletion in the c-cbl sequence (62% of the C-terminal domain) involving functional domains, such as the leucine zipper motif and proline-rich region, converts this protooncogene into the transforming one (4Savage P.D.

Cbl phosphorylation on serine residues has also been reported in phorbol ester-activated T cells, allowing its interaction with 14.3.3 protein (34Liu Y.C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Finally, Cbl contains a phosphotyrosine binding domain in the N-terminal region that directly binds to phosphorylated ZAP-70 in activated T cells (35Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).A regulator activity has recently been described for Cbl when overexpressed in mast cells, in which it regulates p72sykactivity (36Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Cbl is also proposed to regulate the T cell receptor-mediated Ras pathway activation via its association with Grb2 in T cells (37Rellahan B.L. Graham L.J. Stoica B. DeBell K.E. Bonvini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30806-30811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In interleukin 4-treated B cells, Cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with p85/PI 3-K, and overexpression of Cbl enhances PI 3-K activity, mitogenic activity, and cell survival (38Ueno H. Sasaki K. Honda H. Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Miyagawa K. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1998; 91: 46-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggest a role for Cbl in multiple signaling pathways of different cell types.In human platelets, Cbl has been identified and shown to be constitutively associated with the Grb2 adaptor protein and tyrosine-phosphorylated after thrombopoietin activation (27Hunter S. Koch B.L. Anderson S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, Cbl seems to be implicated in signal transduction after thrombopoietin binding to c-mpl. However, the role of Cbl or its possible involvement in platelet signal transduction mediated by other receptors has not yet been documented. Platelet activation is mediated by a wide variety of agonists, including thrombin, thromboxane A2, ADP, and adhesion molecules such as von Willebrand factor and collagen. Some antibodies directed against antigens on the platelet membrane (e.g. the tetraspanin CD9, glycoprotein IV, and the integrin αIIb-β3) are also able to induce platelet activation. In most cases, the activation induced by IgGs is dependent on the binding of their Fc domain on the specific receptor, FcγRIIa (39Rubinstein E. Boucheix C. Worthington R.E. Carroll R.C. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1995; 21: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have investigated the involvement of Cbl in platelet signaling after FcγRIIa engagement. Two models of platelet activation involving the Fc receptor were used: the cross-linking of FcγRIIa and bridging of the CD9 antigen with FcγRIIa by an activating monoclonal antibody (mAb) (anti-CD9, Syb). Our results demonstrate that after FcγRIIa engagement, Cbl was heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated. In parallel with Cbl phosphorylation, we found that Cbl was associated with p85/PI 3-K. Moreover, the use of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-K, abolished platelet aggregation and release induced by antibodies, underlining the crucial role of PI 3-K during immunological activation. The results suggest an important role for Cbl in FcγRIIa-mediated platelet activation, possibly through the regulation of PI 3-K activity.DISCUSSIONThe adaptor protein Cbl has been identified in a variety of cells, including platelets, but its involvement in platelet signaling remains uncharacterized. The present work was devoted to studying the involvement of Cbl in signal transduction after platelet activation induced by FcγRIIa cross-linking or Syb antibody (anti-CD9), which activates platelets via FcγRIIa. We demonstrated strong and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in platelets activated through FcγRIIa. In addition, we showed that after platelet activation, p85/PI 3-K association with Cbl correlates with the intensity of Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, we showed that the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin abolished antibody-mediated platelet responses, indicating a crucial role for PI 3-K in antibody-induced platelet activation.Cbl was not significantly tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting platelets, but it became phosphorylated during platelet activation depending on the agonist used. After activation by FcγRIIa cross-linking, Cbl was strongly and rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated. To a lesser extent, Syb induced a similar Cbl phosphorylation to that obtained after FcγRIIa cross-linking. The former difference in the Cbl phosphorylation was probably attributable to distinct modes of platelet activation induced by Syb and FcγRIIa cross-linking, as suggested by others (47Qi R. Ozaki Y. Kuroda K. Asazuma N. Yatomi Y. Satoh K. Nomura S. Kume S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5638-5645PubMed Google Scholar). That specific binding of Syb antibody to its antigen (CD9), in the presence of IV.3 (anti-FcγR), did not induce Cbl phosphorylation indicates that Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation occurred after FcγRIIa engagement. These results suggest that, unlike thrombin, which induced a faint and slow Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation, Fc receptor engagement strongly involves Cbl at the first steps of platelet signaling. Another protein involved in the first steps of FcγRIIa-mediated signal transduction is the tyrosine kinase Syk (48Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The latter could be a potential candidate to phosphorylate Cbl in platelets, because it was previously demonstrated to participate in Cbl phosphorylation in activated T cells (49Feshchenko E.A. Langdon W.Y. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8323-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We could not, however, detect any Cbl association with Syk after platelet activation. Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation was transient, suggesting an action of tyrosine phosphatase(s) on phosphorylated Cbl. This is supported by the fact that in the presence of the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor phenylarsine oxide, Cbl phosphorylation remained stable for up to 10 min of platelet activation (data not shown).Because Cbl association with p85/PI 3-K has been suggested to increase PI 3-K activity in a number of cell systems (14Sattler M. Salgia R. Durstin M.A. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Hunter S. Koch B.L. Anderson S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Ueno H. Sasaki K. Honda H. Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Miyagawa K. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1998; 91: 46-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the association of Cbl with PI 3-K in platelets. We found that Cbl/PI 3-K association was negligible in resting and thrombin-activated platelets. In contrast, Cbl was strongly associated with PI 3-K after FcγRIIa-mediated platelet activation. In in vitroexperiments, using GST fusion proteins, we did not find any association between the N-SH2 or C-SH2 domains of p85 and Cbl in resting or Syb-activated platelets. In contrast, full p85 and the p85 SH3 domain precipitated Cbl from resting and Syb-activated platelet lysates. It is thus most likely that Cbl and p85 associate via the SH3 domain of p85 and the proline-rich region of Cbl.We could not exclude, however, that in vivo Cbl/PI 3-K association may require tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. Indeed, our experiments favor a relationship between these two events. In Nb2 cells, constitutive Cbl/PI 3-K association is mediated by the Cbl proline-rich region and the p85 SH3 domain, whereas increased Cbl/p85 association was proposed to occur through both the p85 SH2 and SH3 domains after cell activation and Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation (27Hunter S. Koch B.L. Anderson S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In fact, both SH2 and SH3 domains of p85 interact with Cbl in other cells (19Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Ojaniemi M. Martin S.S. Dolfi F. Olefsky J.M. Vuori K. J. Biol.

Interestingly, Soltoff and Cantley (19Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) suggested that engagement of the p85 SH2 domain exposes the SH3 domain, which can then further interact with Cbl and increase the affinity of p85 for Cbl. The authors proposed that Cbl could act as an adaptor protein that recruits PI 3-K in the epidermal growth factor-mediated activation of PC12 cells (19Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cbl has a Tyr-X-X-Met motif, which could associate with a p85 SH2 domain if phosphorylated on tyrosine (51Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl could be necessary for its relocalization near PI 3-K. In that respect, Tanaka et al. (25Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) showed that in epidermal growth factor-activated macrophages and fibroblasts, Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation may be accompanied by its subcellular translocation. A last hypothesis could be that in resting platelets, the Cbl proline-rich region may not be in a conformation that allows its association with the p85 SH3 domain. After platelet activation and Cbl phosphorylation, a conformational change in Cbl would render possible the association between the two proteins. By analogy, in stimulated fibroblasts, a phosphotyrosine-dependent conformational change of Cbl was proposed to transiently expose the Cbl N-terminal region, permitting interaction with platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (52Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To determine whether Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and association with PI 3-K occurred before PI 3-K activation, we used wortmannin to inhibit PI 3-K activity. We found that wortmannin had no effect on Cbl phosphorylation or on Cbl/PI 3-K association induced by different agonists, which indicates that the two events occurred upstream of the lipid kinase activation (data not shown). However, a noncovalent association between PI 3-K and FcγRIIa has been previously shown (53Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl would play a role in FcγRIIa-mediated platelet signaling by linking PI 3-K with the Fc receptor pathway, possibly by enhancing PI 3-K activity.That the level of Cbl/p85 association was stronger after Fc receptor engagement than after thrombin addition suggests a differential role for PI 3-K in the signaling induced by the two types of platelet activation. In the presence of wortmannin, platelet aggregation mediated through FcγRIIa was abolished. In contrast, and as previously demonstrated with thrombin receptor activating peptide (54Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11358-11366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,55Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), platelet aggregation induced by thrombin was only partly inhibited and became reversible. These data indicate that PI 3-K participates in the control of platelet aggregation, especially that which occurs after Fc receptor engagement. The crucial role of PI 3-K in FcγRIIa-mediated platelet activation was also confirmed by the demonstration that wortmannin strongly inhibited antibody-induced serotonin release from dense granules but only weakly inhibited serotonin release induced by thrombin. These results demonstrated that in platelets, PI 3-K activation was required to initiate platelet responses after FcγRIIa engagement. Thus, if Cbl increases PI 3-K activity as previously proposed, Cbl would also play a crucial role in platelet activation mediated through FcγRIIa .In conclusion, Cbl was strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated during FcγRIIa-mediated platelet activation, and levels of Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled levels of Cbl/PI 3-K association. Because PI 3-K activity appeared crucial in platelet responses dependent on FcγRIIa engagement, we suggest that Cbl participates in signal transduction mediated through the Fc receptor by enhancing PI 3-K activity. Thus, Cbl could be one of the key adaptor and regulator proteins in this system. The Cbl protein is the product of the c-cblprotooncogene, the cellular homologue of the v-cbl oncogene present in the Cas-NS-1 retrovirus, which induces pre-B cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemias (1Langdon W.Y.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). Cbl is found in a wide range of hemopoietic cell lineages and some nonhemopoietic tissues such as lung, brain, and testis (3Langdon W.Y. Hyland C.D. Grumont R.J. Morse III, H.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5420-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A deletion in the c-cbl sequence (62% of the C-terminal domain) involving functional domains, such as the leucine zipper motif and proline-rich region, converts this protooncogene into the transforming one (4Savage P.D. Shapiro M. Langdon W.Y. Geurts van Kessel A.D. Seuanez H.N. Akao Y. Croce C. Morse III, H.C. Kersey J.H. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1991; 56: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Unlike the product of v-cbl localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, the c-cbl product (p120cbl) is exclusively cytoplasmic (5Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A tumorigenic form of Cbl was detected in the 70Z/3 pre-B cell lymphoma, in which Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation is increased as a result of a deletion of 17 amino acids in the Cbl sequence (6Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cbl is also heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-src-transformed hemopoietic cells (7Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar).

The acidic, calmodulin-binding PKC substrate RC3 (also called neurogranin), is a likely substrate for PKCγ because the two proteins colocalize in the dendrites of excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum and are expressed at the same stages of development (4Watson J.B.

M. Wehner).For Western blotting, the forebrain of each mouse was homoginized in 10 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% SDS. We equalized the protein concentrations of the homogenates based on three independent protein assays performed in triplicate prior to adding SDS and dithiothreitol using the BCA method and then immuno-blotted serial dilutions of each homogenate. The blotts were probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-RC3 (Affinity Research Products Ltd., Exeter, UK) at a dilution of 1:1000 and then developed with a horseradish peroxidase-based, enhanced chemiluminescence protocol.Hippocampal slices of wild-type (n = 8) and knockout (n = 8) mice were prepared as described (8Ramakers G.M. De Graan P.N.E. Urban I.J.A. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol.

After 30 min slices were transferred to reaction tubes containing 900 μl of carbogenated phosphate-free ACSF at 30 °C, and 45 min later 100 μCi of 32PO4(specific activity, 40 mCi/ml; ICN Pharmaceuticals) was added. Slices were labeled for 90 min, and the medium was changed to phosphate-free ACSF containing 30 mm K+, 1 mmglutamate (Fluka), or 0.1 μm PDB (Sigma).32PO4 incorporation into RC3, GAP-43/B-50, and MARCKS was determined using a quantitative immunoprecipitation as described (8Ramakers G.M. De Graan P.N.E. Urban I.J.A. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein homogenate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit antibodies 8420 (final dilution for RC3, 1:100), 9727 (final dilution for GAP-43/B-50, 1:200), or a polyclonal rat antibody to the MARCKS protein (final dilution, 1:200; gift of Drs. Lenox and McNamara). Antigen complexes were precipitated with Pansorbin® (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and solubilized, and immunoprecipitates were separated using 15% (RC3) or 11% (GAP-43/B-50 and MARCKS) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.32PO4 incorporation into proteins was detected using a Fuji BAS1000 imaging system (Raytest, Germany) and quantified using TINA analysis software. The total 32PO4incorporation into proteins was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described previously, and32PO4 incorporation into RC3, GAP-43/B-50, and MARCKS was normalized accordingly.All experiments were performed blind with regard to the genotype of the animals. Statistical analysis were carried out using a Student'st test.RESULTSProtein levels of RC3 were not different between wild-type, heterozygous, and PKCγ knockout mice (Fig.1 A), showing that there was no up- or down-regulation of RC3 levels induced by the PKCγ knockout. Basal in situ phosphorylation of RC3 and MARCKS in hippocampal slices from mice lacking PKCγ did not differ significantly from those observed in wild-type littermate controls (102.3 ± 8.1% (mean ± S.E.) and 99.3 ± 9.2% of basal phosphorylation in controls for RC3 and MARCKS respectively,p > 0.1, n = 8, and n= 4). However, increased basal phosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 was observed in the null mutant (148.9 ± 17.8% (mean ± S.E.) of basal phosphorylation in controls, p < 0.05,n = 8). As expected, depolarization with potassium, excitation with glutamate, or activation of PKC with PDB induced phosphorylation of RC3 in wild-type controls (Fig. 1, B andC). Strikingly, none of the treatments induced an increase in RC3 phosphorylation in slices from PKCγ-deficient mice. Thus, RC3 is a highly specific substrate for PKCγ during excitation. PDB increased the phosphorylation of MARCKS and GAP-43/B-50 in slices derived from knockout (147.4 ± 6.6% (n = 4) and 162.7 ± 14.2% (n = 8)), as well as the wild-type (173.7 ± 14.5% (n = 4) and 288.2 ± 35.2% (n = 8)) mice (Fig. 1 B). However, GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation was significantly attenuated in the former compared with the latter (43.5 ± 4.4% of wild type,p < 0.01, n = 8). Decreased incorporation of 32PO4 into GAP-43/B-50 in knockout mice upon direct stimulation of PKC was probably due to higher initial levels of phospho-GAP-43/B-50 because the two appear to offset each other, although the possibility that GAP-43/B-50 could be a substrate for PKCγ cannot be ruled out.DISCUSSIONThe experiments described here demonstrate that depolarization with potassium, activation with glutamate, or direct stimulation of PKC with a phorbol ester leads to phosphorylation of RC3 solely by PKCγ. Thus, the results unequivocally delineate the following biochemical pathway: activation of a postsynaptic (metabotropic) glutamate receptor stimulates PKCγ, which in turn phosphorylates RC3. Basal levels of phospho-RC3 appear to be dictated by a calcium and diacylglycerol-independent atypical isoform of PKC, possibly λ or ζ. Basal levels of phospho-GAP-43/B-50 are higher in the PKCγ knockout mouse, and this might be a presynaptic mechanism to compensate for the inability to phosphorylate RC3 in dendrites, perhaps by increasing neurotransmitter release in response to decreased postsynaptic gain (6Gerendasy D.D.

The acidic, calmodulin-binding PKC substrate RC3 (also called neurogranin), is a likely substrate for PKCγ because the two proteins colocalize in the dendrites of excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum and are expressed at the same stages of development (4Watson J.B.

RESULTSProtein levels of RC3 were not different between wild-type, heterozygous, and PKCγ knockout mice (Fig.1 A), showing that there was no up- or down-regulation of RC3 levels induced by the PKCγ knockout. Basal in situ phosphorylation of RC3 and MARCKS in hippocampal slices from mice lacking PKCγ did not differ significantly from those observed in wild-type littermate controls (102.3 ± 8.1% (mean ± S.E.) and 99.3 ± 9.2% of basal phosphorylation in controls for RC3 and MARCKS respectively,p > 0.1, n = 8, and n= 4). However, increased basal phosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 was observed in the null mutant (148.9 ± 17.8% (mean ± S.E.) of basal phosphorylation in controls, p < 0.05,n = 8). As expected, depolarization with potassium, excitation with glutamate, or activation of PKC with PDB induced phosphorylation of RC3 in wild-type controls (Fig. 1, B andC). Strikingly, none of the treatments induced an increase in RC3 phosphorylation in slices from PKCγ-deficient mice. Thus, RC3 is a highly specific substrate for PKCγ during excitation. PDB increased the phosphorylation of MARCKS and GAP-43/B-50 in slices derived from knockout (147.4 ± 6.6% (n = 4) and 162.7 ± 14.2% (n = 8)), as well as the wild-type (173.7 ± 14.5% (n = 4) and 288.2 ± 35.2% (n = 8)) mice (Fig. 1 B). However, GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation was significantly attenuated in the former compared with the latter (43.5 ± 4.4% of wild type,p < 0.01, n = 8). Decreased incorporation of 32PO4 into GAP-43/B-50 in knockout mice upon direct stimulation of PKC was probably due to higher initial levels of phospho-GAP-43/B-50 because the two appear to offset each other, although the possibility that GAP-43/B-50 could be a substrate for PKCγ cannot be ruled out. Protein levels of RC3 were not different between wild-type, heterozygous, and PKCγ knockout mice (Fig.1 A), showing that there was no up- or down-regulation of RC3 levels induced by the PKCγ knockout.

DISCUSSIONThe experiments described here demonstrate that depolarization with potassium, activation with glutamate, or direct stimulation of PKC with a phorbol ester leads to phosphorylation of RC3 solely by PKCγ. Thus, the results unequivocally delineate the following biochemical pathway: activation of a postsynaptic (metabotropic) glutamate receptor stimulates PKCγ, which in turn phosphorylates RC3. Basal levels of phospho-RC3 appear to be dictated by a calcium and diacylglycerol-independent atypical isoform of PKC, possibly λ or ζ. Basal levels of phospho-GAP-43/B-50 are higher in the PKCγ knockout mouse, and this might be a presynaptic mechanism to compensate for the inability to phosphorylate RC3 in dendrites, perhaps by increasing neurotransmitter release in response to decreased postsynaptic gain (6Gerendasy D.D.

https://openalex.org/W1990743117,"Regulation of glucose metabolism is a key aspect of metabolic homeostasis, and insulin is the dominant hormone influencing this regulatory system. One of the major effects of insulin is to enhance overall glucose disposal, and this is achieved by stimulation of glucose uptake into target tissues. In mammalian systems there are currently five distinct hexose transport proteins that have been identified, each derived from a separate gene. The mammalian glucose transporters are quite similar in sequence and overall structure but are unique in their tissue distribution. One of them, GLUT4 or the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, is uniquely expressed in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissue. Insulin stimulates glucose transport into these tissues by causing the recruitment, or translocation, of GLUT4 proteins from an intracellular vesicular compartment to the plasma membrane. Once GLUT4 recruitment occurs, the transporter inserts into the plasma membrane, allowing uptake of glucose into the cell. However, tissue-specific expression of GLUT4 is not the only factor conferring insulin-stimulated glucose transport into these tissues because heterologous expression of GLUT4 in other tissues by various transfection strategies does not confer insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to non-muscle, non-adipocyte cells. Therefore, it follows that additional factors in muscle and adipose tissue, related to insulin signaling or vesicle trafficking, must exist. Thus, the genetic program endowing the cell with the ability to exhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is complex and most likely involves a number of specific components. Skeletal muscle accounts for the bulk of insulin-stimulated glucose disposalin vivo (70–80%), with adipose tissue and other organs playing a lesser role. In this way, insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation in muscle and, to a lesser extent, adipose tissue becomes the key biologic event regulating overall in vivo glucose disposal in the normal state.In addition to the importance of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in normal physiology, this process is of heightened importance because of its critical role in human pathophysiologic states such as insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. For example, in patients with Type 2 diabetes, decreased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal is a major metabolic defect, and evidence exists to indicate that it is the earliest abnormality that can be detected in this condition. Because under most conditions that prevail in vivo glucose transport is rate-limiting for glucose disposal and because insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation is the way insulin stimulates glucose transport, understanding the mechanisms of this process will be key to our understanding of this important human disease.Although incompletely understood, the signaling events that lead to GLUT4 translocation have been the subject of intense investigation. The first article of this minireview series entitled “Signaling Mechanisms That Regulate Glucose Transport” by Michael P. Czech and Silvia Corvera summarizes this complex and interesting field. This chapter points out what is known about the molecular and cellular events leading to insulin-stimulated glucose transport and also highlights the important questions for future investigation. In integrating the complex information already available, this review points out that insulin simulates the GLUT4 translocation pathway by interacting at multiple points that involve targeting of effector proteins to their proper subcellular location, as well as protein activation (or deactivation) events. This review also expands the complexity of GLUT4 translocation regulation by pointing out that insulin engages multiple signaling pathways and that there are other stimulants (e.g. exercise, osmotic shock, and other agonists), which can mediate GLUT4 translocation.GLUT4 proteins translocate from intracellular vesicular pools to the plasma membrane by a process of targeted exocytosis and then return to the intracellular environment via endocytotic events. The amount of GLUT4 that is distributed between the intracellular and cell surface compartments represents the balance between the rates of exocytosis and endocytosis. The specialized compartments through which the GLUT4 proteins traverse represent a specific functional aspect of the general cell biologic system of vesicular trafficking, cargo movement, and protein targeting. With respect to the itinerary of GLUT4 proteins, once the insulin signal arrives at its proper intracellular locus, it must productively engage the intracellular vesicular trafficking machinery. This involves a complex, and expanding, list of proteins, specialized vesicular compartments and sub-compartments, and regulatory events. The second minireview in the series entitled “Molecular Basis of Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 Vesicle Trafficking: Location! Location! Location!” by Jeffrey E. Pessin and colleagues examines this fast moving area. This minireview highlights what is known about the endocytotic and exocytotic events involved in GLUT4 trafficking. Although both are subject to insulin regulation, the major effect of insulin is on exocytosis. The two dominant theories of GLUT4 exocytosis are reviewed. One involves a specialized GLUT4 vesicular compartment that is segregated within the cell in the basal state because of a retention receptor mechanism and is released upon insulin stimulation, allowing the GLUT4 vesicles to enter the constitutively cycling vesicular pathway. The other involves a system analogous to synaptic vesicle movement, in which insulin may regulate the specific interactions between v- and t-SNARE protein complexes.The use of transgenic and knock-out mice has been a powerful tool to push forward our understanding of a number of biological processes, and several investigators have applied these approaches to elucidate important aspects of the biology of GLUT4 and insulin signaling. The final article in this minireview series is entitled “GLUT4 Gene Regulation and Manipulation” by Maureen Charron and colleagues, whose laboratory has generated some of the most important insights in this area. This article reviews what is known about in vivophysiologic regulation of GLUT4 gene expression in adipose tissue and muscle and then moves to the molecular level for a discussion of cis-acting regulatory elements and what is known about transcription factors that interact with these regulatory domains. Finally, this minireview summarizes what we have learned from transgenic and knock-out technology of the GLUT4 gene, particularly with respect to the role of GLUT4 expression in insulin resistance and diabetes.Given the importance of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation for both normal human physiology and human disease, it is clear that a detailed understanding of the events that underlie this process could have major implications, not only for our knowledge about glucose homeostasis but also for the development of new treatment strategies and therapeutics for Type 2 diabetes.

Growth-blocking peptide (GBP)1was originally isolated from the larval hemolymph of the host armywormPseudaletia separata whose development is halted in the last larval instar stage from parasitization by the parasitoid waspCotesia kariyai (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10813-10816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7982-7984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hayakawa Y. Yasuhara Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 225-231Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The fact that injection of 20 pmol of GBP into early last instar larvae of the armyworm retards larval growth and causes more than a few days delay in pupation clearly shows its growth blocking activity (2Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7982-7984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hayakawa Y. Yasuhara Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 225-231Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have since determined that GBP is a host gene product and that the change of titers of this peptide correlate well with the growth rate of insect larvae (4Ohnishi A. Hayakawa Y. Matsuda Y. Kwon K.W. Takahashi T.A. Sekiguchi S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Noguchi H. Hayakawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, injection studies of GBP indicated that low concentrations (lower than 1 pmol/larva) stimulated larval growth, whereas high concentrations (higher than 10 pmol/larva) retarded growth (6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bioassay data revealed that several pmol/ml of GBP stimulated DNA synthesis of SF-9 insect cells and human keratinocyte cells, although several nmol/ml of GBP did not stimulate cell proliferation at all. Therefore, it is thought that GBP can act as a growth factor controlling the proliferation of a broad range of cells and the growth rate of whole larvae.To examine structural features of GBP, NMR was used in this study. The solution structure that we report here was obtained by two-dimensional1H NMR spectroscopy with the aid of distance geometry and simulated annealing. The three-dimensional structure of GBP contains a short double-stranded β-sheet and a β-turn in the C-terminal region, while six residues in the N terminus and three residues in the C terminus are highly disordered.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe GBP molecule was soluble in water and monomeric as determined by NMR spectroscopy. At various peptide concentrations (3, 0.3, and 0.06 mm), there were no concentration-dependent changes that indicate dimerization or aggregation in the chemical shifts or peak line widths of one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of GBP. In addition, no NOE cross-peaks indicative of dimeric or multimeric structure were detected.The proton NMR signals were identified according to the standard procedure of sequential assignment (14Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The sequential assignment of the residues was achieved by first identifying spin systems by a combination of DQF-COSY spectra and TOCSY spectra acquired with different mixing times. This procedure was followed by assigning identified spin systems to particular residues in the peptide by the observation of sequential NH-NH (dNN), CαH-NH (dαN), and CβH-NH (dβN) NOEs. A nearly complete assignment of the proton NMR signals of GBP was obtained. The NMR signals of the backbone protons for Glu1and Asn2 were either not observed or not resolved. The fingerprint region of the NOESY is shown in Fig.1.Fig. 2 shows the pattern of sequential and short range NOE cross-peaks, the3 J HN-Hα coupling constants, and the slowly exchanging amide protons for GBP. Elements of the secondary structure were deduced from the pattern of sequential and medium range NOE connectivities. Additional information was obtained from the H-D exchange study and the values of3 J HN-Hα coupling constants. Slowly exchanging amide protons due to the formation of hydrogen bonds were identified from a series of one-dimensional NMR spectra. In these spectra, three backbone amide proton signals remained intensely after more than 30 min and were classified as slowly exchanging amide protons. From the DQF-COSY spectrum, nine residues were determined to have 3 J HN-Hα greater than 8.0 Hz. The secondary structures that were identified from these data are summarized in Fig. 3. The secondary structure elements of GBP consist of a double-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that involves Tyr11–Arg13 and Cys19–Pro21 and a β-turn that involves Val8–Tyr11. The regions of the β-sheet were further confirmed by the interstrand dαα NOEs between Tyr11 and Pro21 and between Arg13and Cys19 (Fig. 4). The type-II β-turn (Val8–Tyr11) is identified by patterns of NOE, a strong dαN NOE between Ala9 and Gly10, a strong dNN NOE between Gly10 and Tyr11, and a weak dαN NOE between Ala9 and Tyr11, which is held together by a hydrogen bond between Val8 and Tyr11. Position 3 of this β-turn is Gly10, the preferred residue here in a type-II β-turn.Figure 2Diagram of NOE connectivities between protons of neighboring (dαN, dβN, and dNN), J-coupling constants (3 J HN-Hα), and slowly exchanging amide protons in D2O.

A family of 20 accepted three-dimensional structures were used to represent the solution structure of GBP (Fig.5 and TableI). The N-terminal and C-terminal residues, Glu1–Gly6 and Phe23–Gln25, are not well defined in the NMR structure because the NOE data are insufficient to ascertain a single conformation. The mean pairwise RMSD of the well defined region (Cys7–Thr22) is 0.89 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.72 Å for all heavy atoms. The core structure of GBP, the small antiparallel β-sheet and the β-turn were further confirmed by the conformation. The β-sheet is twisted in a right-handed manner. The loop region, which is composed of five residues (Thr14–Arg18) with no secondary structure, is less converged than the β-turn (Val8–Tyr11). The mean pairwise RMSDs of the loop region are 0.88 and 1.80 Å for the backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively. On the other hand, those values of the β-turn are lower, 0.71 Å for the backbone and 1.01 Å for all heavy atoms. However, the disulfide bond between Cys7 and Cys19 appears to contribute significantly to the stability of the loop region, as well as to establish important conformational constraints for defining a single conformation. Side chains in the β-turn were well defined, having RMSD values lower than 1.50 Å. The side chains of Cys7 and Cys19, and Pro21 also had low RMSD values. The other side chains were not well resolved. In particular, the charged side chains of Arg13, Arg18, Lys20, and Asp16 had high RMSD values. However, it is uncertain whether this result is due to conformational flexibility or a lack of distance restraints of these residues.Figure 5Three-dimensional structure of GBP.

Open table in a new tab We recently reported that GBP and human EGF (epidermal growth factor) induce an almost equivalent increase in DNA synthesis of a human keratinocyte cell line (6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GBP induces a higher and more persistent increase in SF-9 insect cell proliferation than does EGF. These results suggest that GBP has an ability to stimulate cell proliferation more broadly than does EGF. Fig.6 compares the overall structure of GBP with that of mouse EGF (15Kohda D. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The general folding of GBP, with the exception of the N-terminal disordered region, clearly conforms to the C-terminal domain of EGF with weak primary structural similarity (Fig.7). The backbone RMSD between the average GBP structure and the average mouse EGF structure over the region of the β-sheet and the β-turn is 1.98 Å. In particular, the type II β-turn exists in GBP and EGF, is composed of Val8–Tyr11 in GBP, and corresponds to Val34–Tyr37 in EGF with high amino acid sequence conservation. The three-dimensional structural similarity of backbone between GBP and EGF raises the possibility that these two growth factors may stimulate the same receptor. Moreover, some highly conserved amino acid residues in EGF family are conserved in GBP. It is known that these residues are very important in EGF receptor-ligand association. For example, substitution of the highly conserved Arg41 and Leu47 of EGF resulted in a marked reduction in the affinity of the EGF receptor, which suggests that these residues are essential for receptor affinity (16Engler D.A. Montelione G.T. Niyogi S.K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Dudgeon T.J. Cooke R.M. Baron M. Campbell I.D. Edwards R.M. Fallon A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is likely that Arg18 of GBP corresponds to Arg41of EGF in light of their alignments and three-dimensional structures. On the other hand, GBP does not have a Leu residue that corresponds to Leu47 of EGF, although it is thought that the hydrophobicity of Leu47 is important for interaction with the EGF receptor. Thus, it is possible that Phe23 and/or Tyr24 of GBP may act instead of Leu47 of EGF. In fact, elimination of Phe23 leads to a reduction in the growth blocking activity of GBP (18Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Matsumoto S. Kataoka H. Suzuki A. Molecular Mechanisms of Insect Metamorphosis and Diapause. Industrial Publishing and Consulting, Inc., Tokyo1995: 55-64Google Scholar), suggesting that Phe23of GBP may play an important role just as Leu47 of EGF does. To our knowledge, such a small peptide as stimulates EGF receptor at high level has not been found. If further studies elucidate the interaction of GBP with EGF receptor clearly, the structure of GBP may offer clues to the interaction between EGF and EGF receptor, which is still not very clear.Figure 6Comparison of the three-dimensional structures of mouse EGF (A) and GBP (B).The disulfide bonds, Cys33–Cys42 in EGF and Cys7–Cys19 in GBP, are shown withballs and sticks.

GBP cDNAs have been cloned from three lepidopteran species, P. separata, Mamestra brassicae, andSpodoptera litura, and the amino acid sequences of GBP in these three species are highly homologous (6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Yamanaka A. Izumi S. Tomino S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino acid sequences of paralytic peptides and plasmatocyte-spreading peptide isolated from insect hemolymph have been shown to be highly homologous to those of GBP. Each of seven paralytic peptides found in hemolymph of Manduca sexta, Spodoptera exigua, and Heliothis virescens causes a temporary paralysis when injected into larvae (20Skinner W.S. Dennis P.A.

On the other hand, plasmatocyte-spreading peptide from the larvae of Pseudoplusia includens induces the adhesion and spreading of plasmatocytes to foreign surfaces (21Clark K.D. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that all these GBP and GBP-like peptides vary in function, they share at least 14 completely conserved amino acids. This is the first report on the three-dimensional structure of these insect peptides. In addition, there has been no report on the three-dimensional structure of a peptiderigic growth factor in insects. Knowledge of the structure of GBP is important not only for elucidating the mechanism of its activity but also for clarifying the physiological roles of these homologous peptides and growth factors in insects. Endoparasitic wasps can alter the development of their hosts from larvae to pupae. This developmental disturbance allows the wasps to complete their larval growth and to emerge while the host is still in the larval stage, otherwise the wasp larvae would be trapped in the sclerotized pupal cuticles.

GBP cDNAs have been cloned from three lepidopteran species, P. separata, Mamestra brassicae, andSpodoptera litura, and the amino acid sequences of GBP in these three species are highly homologous (6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Yamanaka A. Izumi S. Tomino S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino acid sequences of paralytic peptides and plasmatocyte-spreading peptide isolated from insect hemolymph have been shown to be highly homologous to those of GBP. Each of seven paralytic peptides found in hemolymph of Manduca sexta, Spodoptera exigua, and Heliothis virescens causes a temporary paralysis when injected into larvae (20Skinner W.S. Dennis P.A. Li J.P. Summerfelt R.M. Carney R.L. Quistad G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12873-12877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, plasmatocyte-spreading peptide from the larvae of Pseudoplusia includens induces the adhesion and spreading of plasmatocytes to foreign surfaces (21Clark K.D. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that all these GBP and GBP-like peptides vary in function, they share at least 14 completely conserved amino acids. This is the first report on the three-dimensional structure of these insect peptides. In addition, there has been no report on the three-dimensional structure of a peptiderigic growth factor in insects. Knowledge of the structure of GBP is important not only for elucidating the mechanism of its activity but also for clarifying the physiological roles of these homologous peptides and growth factors in insects. The GBP molecule was soluble in water and monomeric as determined by NMR spectroscopy. At various peptide concentrations (3, 0.3, and 0.06 mm), there were no concentration-dependent changes that indicate dimerization or aggregation in the chemical shifts or peak line widths of one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of GBP. In addition, no NOE cross-peaks indicative of dimeric or multimeric structure were detected. The proton NMR signals were identified according to the standard procedure of sequential assignment (14Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The sequential assignment of the residues was achieved by first identifying spin systems by a combination of DQF-COSY spectra and TOCSY spectra acquired with different mixing times. This procedure was followed by assigning identified spin systems to particular residues in the peptide by the observation of sequential NH-NH (dNN), CαH-NH (dαN), and CβH-NH (dβN) NOEs. A nearly complete assignment of the proton NMR signals of GBP was obtained. The NMR signals of the backbone protons for Glu1and Asn2 were either not observed or not resolved. The fingerprint region of the NOESY is shown in Fig.1. Fig. 2 shows the pattern of sequential and short range NOE cross-peaks, the3 J HN-Hα coupling constants, and the slowly exchanging amide protons for GBP. Elements of the secondary structure were deduced from the pattern of sequential and medium range NOE connectivities. Additional information was obtained from the H-D exchange study and the values of3 J HN-Hα coupling constants. Slowly exchanging amide protons due to the formation of hydrogen bonds were identified from a series of one-dimensional NMR spectra. In these spectra, three backbone amide proton signals remained intensely after more than 30 min and were classified as slowly exchanging amide protons. From the DQF-COSY spectrum, nine residues were determined to have 3 J HN-Hα greater than 8.0 Hz. The secondary structures that were identified from these data are summarized in Fig. 3. The secondary structure elements of GBP consist of a double-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that involves Tyr11–Arg13 and Cys19–Pro21 and a β-turn that involves Val8–Tyr11. The regions of the β-sheet were further confirmed by the interstrand dαα NOEs between Tyr11 and Pro21 and between Arg13and Cys19 (Fig. 4). The type-II β-turn (Val8–Tyr11) is identified by patterns of NOE, a strong dαN NOE between Ala9 and Gly10, a strong dNN NOE between Gly10 and Tyr11, and a weak dαN NOE between Ala9 and Tyr11, which is held together by a hydrogen bond between Val8 and Tyr11. Position 3 of this β-turn is Gly10, the preferred residue here in a type-II β-turn. A total of 130 NMR-derived distance and angle constraints were used as input for distance geometry and simulated annealing calculations using the program X-PLOR. A family of 20 accepted three-dimensional structures were used to represent the solution structure of GBP (Fig.5 and TableI). The N-terminal and C-terminal residues, Glu1–Gly6 and Phe23–Gln25, are not well defined in the NMR structure because the NOE data are insufficient to ascertain a single conformation. The mean pairwise RMSD of the well defined region (Cys7–Thr22) is 0.89 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.72 Å for all heavy atoms. The core structure of GBP, the small antiparallel β-sheet and the β-turn were further confirmed by the conformation. The β-sheet is twisted in a right-handed manner. The loop region, which is composed of five residues (Thr14–Arg18) with no secondary structure, is less converged than the β-turn (Val8–Tyr11). The mean pairwise RMSDs of the loop region are 0.88 and 1.80 Å for the backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively. On the other hand, those values of the β-turn are lower, 0.71 Å for the backbone and 1.01 Å for all heavy atoms. However, the disulfide bond between Cys7 and Cys19 appears to contribute significantly to the stability of the loop region, as well as to establish important conformational constraints for defining a single conformation. Side chains in the β-turn were well defined, having RMSD values lower than 1.50 Å. The side chains of Cys7 and Cys19, and Pro21 also had low RMSD values. The other side chains were not well resolved. In particular, the charged side chains of Arg13, Arg18, Lys20, and Asp16 had high RMSD values. However, it is uncertain whether this result is due to conformational flexibility or a lack of distance restraints of these residues. Represents the structural statistics for the 20 energy minimized structures obtained through the refinement protocol in X-PLOR.E impr, E VDW, andE NOE are improper energy of torsion angles, van der Waals' repulsion energy, and the square well NOE potential energy, respectively. All energies and RMSD values were calculated using the programs X-PLOR and MOLMOL. We recently reported that GBP and human EGF (epidermal growth factor) induce an almost equivalent increase in DNA synthesis of a human keratinocyte cell line (6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GBP induces a higher and more persistent increase in SF-9 insect cell proliferation than does EGF. These results suggest that GBP has an ability to stimulate cell proliferation more broadly than does EGF. Fig.6 compares the overall structure of GBP with that of mouse EGF (15Kohda D. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The general folding of GBP, with the exception of the N-terminal disordered region, clearly conforms to the C-terminal domain of EGF with weak primary structural similarity (Fig.7). The backbone RMSD between the average GBP structure and the average mouse EGF structure over the region of the β-sheet and the β-turn is 1.98 Å. In particular, the type II β-turn exists in GBP and EGF, is composed of Val8–Tyr11 in GBP, and corresponds to Val34–Tyr37 in EGF with high amino acid sequence conservation. The three-dimensional structural similarity of backbone between GBP and EGF raises the possibility that these two growth factors may stimulate the same receptor. Moreover, some highly conserved amino acid residues in EGF family are conserved in GBP. It is known that these residues are very important in EGF receptor-ligand association. For example, substitution of the highly conserved Arg41 and Leu47 of EGF resulted in a marked reduction in the affinity of the EGF receptor, which suggests that these residues are essential for receptor affinity (16Engler D.A. Montelione G.T. Niyogi S.K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Dudgeon T.J. Cooke R.M. Baron M. Campbell I.D. Edwards R.M. Fallon A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is likely that Arg18 of GBP corresponds to Arg41of EGF in light of their alignments and three-dimensional structures. On the other hand, GBP does not have a Leu residue that corresponds to Leu47 of EGF, although it is thought that the hydrophobicity of Leu47 is important for interaction with the EGF receptor. Thus, it is possible that Phe23 and/or Tyr24 of GBP may act instead of Leu47 of EGF. In fact, elimination of Phe23 leads to a reduction in the growth blocking activity of GBP (18Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Matsumoto S. Kataoka H. Suzuki A. Molecular Mechanisms of Insect Metamorphosis and Diapause. Industrial Publishing and Consulting, Inc., Tokyo1995: 55-64Google Scholar), suggesting that Phe23of GBP may play an important role just as Leu47 of EGF does. To our knowledge, such a small peptide as stimulates EGF receptor at high level has not been found. If further studies elucidate the interaction of GBP with EGF receptor clearly, the structure of GBP may offer clues to the interaction between EGF and EGF receptor, which is still not very clear. GBP was initially identified as a hemolymphal peptide that delays the normal development of the host insect larvae parasitized by parasitic wasps (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1576499008,"The β-R1/I-TAC (interferon-inducible T-cell α-chemoattractant) gene encodes an α-chemokine that is a potent chemoattractant for activated T-cells. We previously reported that β-R1 was selectively induced by interferon (IFN)-β compared with IFN-α and that the canonical type I IFN transcription factor interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) was necessary but not sufficient forβ-R1 induction by IFN-β. These findings suggested that β-R1 induction by IFN-β required an accessory component. To begin characterizing this signaling pathway, we examined the function of TYK2 protein in the IFN-β-mediated induction of β-R1. This study was motivated by the observation that β-R1 could not be induced in TYK2-deficient U1 cells by IFN-β (Rani, M. R. S., Foster, G. R., Leung, S., Leaman, D., Stark, G. R., and Ransohoff, R. M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 22878–22884), an unexpected result because IFN-β evokes substantial expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in U1 cells through a TYK2-independent pathway. We now report β-R1expression patterns in U1 cells complemented with wild-type or mutant TYK2 proteins. Complementation with wild-type TYK2 rescued IFN-β-inducible expression of β-R1. Cells expressing kinase-deficient deletion or point mutants of TYK2 were refractory to induction of β-R1 by IFN-β despite robust expression of other ISGs. Transient transfection analysis of a β-R1promoter-reporter confirmed that transcriptional activation ofβ-R1 by IFN-β required competent TYK2 kinase. These studies indicate that the catalytic function of TYK2 is required for IFN-β-mediated induction of β-R1. Catalytic TYK2 is the first identified component in an accessory signaling pathway that supplements ISGF3/interferon-stimulated response element signaling for gene induction by type I IFNs."

Cell. 1996; 86: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The chromatin organization of telomeres is believed to be essential for their function and is currently receiving great attention. In particular, the chromatin structure of yeast telomeres is probably the best known among all eukaryotes because of their heterochromatic nature, required for transcriptional silencing in both artificial (3Gottschling D. Aparicio O. Billington B. Zakian V. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) and natural (4Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) contexts. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomeric sequence is composed of about 350 base pairs containing the (C1–3A)n repeats. This element is followed by two main subtelomeric sequences: the X and the Y′ elements (5Louis E. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1553-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). X elements are present at all telomeres and can exist in two main forms, a complete form containing the X core and the STR-A, B, C, D elements or a short form containing the X core or part of it (5Louis E. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1553-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Chan C. Tye B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 505-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Chan C. Tye B.-K.

Y′ elements are highly conserved and are present in about 70% of the telomeres (5Louis E. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1553-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Chan C. Tye B. J. Mol.

Thus, yeast telomeres contain tandem repetitions of the (C1–3A)n motif flanked by subtelomeric, middle repetitive sequences (reviewed in Ref. 9Zakian V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 579-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), internally followed by unique sequences. As for the primary sequence, the chromatin structure of yeast telomeres is also organized in different domains. The terminal (C1–3A)n repeats are organized into a nuclease-resistant structure called the telosome (10Wright J. Gottschling D. Zakian V. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 11Wright J. Zakian V. Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 23: 1454-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that does not contain nucleosomes and is firmly associated with the protein Rap1 (10Wright J. Gottschling D. Zakian V.

Kornberg R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 14Longtime M. Wilson N. Petracek M. Berman J. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and interacts with other proteins including Rif1p, Rif2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p (15Roth S.Y. Shimizo M. Johnson L. Grunstein M. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Hardy C. Sussel L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 17Wotton D. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition, Sir3p and Sir4p interact among them and with nucleosomes located in subtelomeric regions through the N termini of histones H3 and H4. The nature of the available evidence obtained so far for Sir3p-histone H4 interactions is genetic and biochemical (reviewed in Ref. 18Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle has been recently resolved at 2.8 Å of resolution (19Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). This structure shows that the highly basic N-terminal tail of histone H4 (amino acids 1–25) potentially binds as an extended chain to a region of extreme acidity on the exposed face of the H2A-H2B dimer of a neighboring particle. The H4 residues involved in the interparticle contact are the amino acids 16–24, which are also involved in the binding to the silencing protein Sir3p. These data predict that Sir3p interacts with histone H4 at telomeres and alters nucleosomes interactions while participating in the formation of telomeric heterochromatin. The complex interplay of telomeric proteins has been summarized in a model for telomeric heterochromatin (18Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This general model applies to all the 32 telomeres of S. cerevisiae and takes into account homotypic and heterotypic protein interactions. In summary, in a telomeric region, a telosome is internally followed by subtelomeric heterochromatin, then by “normal” chromatin. Comprehensive reviews of structural, genetic and functional yeast telomere organization are available (18Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In addition to the growing body of general information described above, the chromatin structure of a natural telomeric region from S. cerevisiae has been recently described. This region corresponds to the terminal 1.4 kilobases of the left arm of chromosome III (LIII) (21Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In LIII, the terminal (C1–3A)n repetitive sequences are followed by a complete X element and by the single copy Ty5–1 retrotransposon (see map in Fig. 1). Both the telosome and the X element are characterized by a tight chromatin structure organization. The X element contains protein complexes and irregularly distributed but well localized nucleosomes, whereas a regular array of phased nucleosomes is associated with the promoter region of Ty5–1. The lack of Sir3p causes a nucleosome rearrangement within the promoter region of Ty5–1 and releases Ty5–1 silencing. In contrast, Sir3p is not required to keep the overall tight organization of the X element (21Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This previous analysis of LIII has focused the study of the structural complexity at telomeres to the level of specific nucleosomes and of the distribution of protein complexes. In addition, it has providedin vivo evidence linking the modification of heterochromatin structure with the loss of transcriptional telomeric silencing (4Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We describe in this report that the deletion of residues 4–28 of histone H4 disrupts the heterochromatin structure of LIII. This disruption mimics the rearrangement of heterochromatin caused by the absence of Sir3p (21Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A previous report has shown that the 4–28 N-terminal domain of histone H4 contains residues that are required for Sir3p-H4 in vitro interaction (22Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In addition, H4 residues 4–28 are required for the recruitment of Sir3p to telomeres and for telomeric silencing (4Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the establishment of repressive heterochromatin structures at LIII requires the recruitment of Sir3p through interaction with the N terminus of histone H4. The establishment of such structures does not require acetylation of any of the four lysines located in the H4 N terminus (lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16). All strains were provided by M. Grunstein.

Strains PKY501, PKY813, and LDY722 were grown similarly on SC medium lacking uracil. Cells from 50-ml cultures were collected by centrifugation, treated with zymolyase, and digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase)1 as described previously (27Venditti S. Camilloni G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 3811-3812Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After digestions of chromatin or naked DNA, the sensitivity to the enzyme was analyzed by the indirect end-labeling technique (28Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The DNA samples were purified, digested withBamHI, resolved in agarose gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The cutting profile generated by MNase was visualized after hybridization with the probe indicated in the map in Fig. 1. This probe abuts the BamHI site selected for the analyses and extends in an outer direction from position 1495 to 1725 of S. cerevisiae chromosome III. Nucleosomal spacing analyses were performed with MNase. After digestion of chromatin with MNase, the purified DNA samples were directly resolved in agarose gels, generating a nucleosome ladder that could be visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The DNA samples were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and hybridized with the probe indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. The chromatin structure of S. cerevisiae left telomeric region of chromosome 3 (LIII) has been analyzed in different wild type and mutant strains. Permeabilized cells were digested with increasing concentrations of MNase, and the sensitivity to the enzyme was monitored by indirect end-labeling using the probe indicated in Fig. 1. This figure shows the MNase digestion profiles of chromatin from the parental strain (PKY501) and from two derived H4 mutants (PKY813 and LDY722). PKY813 is isogenic to PKY501 and bears a deletion of residues 4–28 of histone H4 (termed ΔNtH4). LDY722 (termed Ac−NtH4) has the lysine residues 5, 8, 12, and 16 changed into arginine, thus preventing acetylation in these positions. The chromatin organization of LIII in the wild type strain has been previously reported (21Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The digestion profile of this strain is shown in lanes 3–6. One fuzzy telomeric band is observed in thelane containing undigested chromatin from PKY501. Fuzziness is expected from the fact that the yeast population is length-heterogeneous for the (C1–3A)n repeat (29Shampay J. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The X element shows low accessibility to MNase, reflecting a closed overall chromatin structure organization. Inside the X element, this overall protection extends from the STRA sequences to the ACS binding site, a silenced origin of replication. Protein complexes and irregular, but well positioned nucleosomes coexist inside the X element. In contrast, the 5′ region of the Ty5–1 retrotransposon accommodates a regular array of nucleosomes that are associated with specific DNA sequences. The map at the sides of the gel images schematically depicts such organization both in the wild type (filled half-circles) and in the ΔNtH4 mutant (empty half-circles). Lanes 7–10 and 11–14 show the MNase digestion profiles of the two histone H4 mutants (PKY813 and LDY722, respectively). In PKY813 the length of the band detected in the absence of MNase digestion is higher (lane 7) than in the wild type strain (lane 3). This is because of the fact that the subpopulation of cells from PKY813 used in this study bears a 5.5 kilobase Y′-short subtelomeric element inserted into the (C1–3A)nrepeat at ∼150 base pairs from the X element border (to be detailed elsewhere; see the map on the right side of Fig. 1). This insertion is favored by the ΔNtH4 mutation, 2S. Venditti, M. A. Vega-Palas, and E. Di Mauro, unpublished results. is stable (being constantly observed for at least 100 generations), and is not present in all the subpopulations derived from the original mutated clone (see below). The digestion profiles in lanes 7–10 show that the Y′-short element inserted into the (C1–3A)n repeat of PKY813 has a complex MNase digestion pattern, too distant from the probe to allow any detailed analysis. Two separate (C1–3A)n tracts are present in LIII in these cells: one terminal and one internal, between the Y′ and X elements. The terminal (C1–3A)n repeat is organized into the so-called telosomic structure and is expected to be MNase-inaccessible, as actually observed. In addition, also the internal 150-base pairs long (C1–3A)n tract is MNase-inaccessible, thus suggesting a closed heterochromatic and telosome-like organization. Moving inward from the internal (C1–3A)n repeat, the X element of the ΔNtH4 mutant (lanes 7–10) shows, as in the wild type strain, overall protection against MNase. Thus, the 4–28 residues from the N terminus of histone H4 are not essential to keep the closed overall organization of the X element. In addition, the digestion pattern of the X element is quite similar in the wild type and the ΔNtH4 strains (see also next sections), suggesting that the lack of H4 N terminus does not cause major changes in the specific chromatin structure of the X element. The digestion pattern generated by MNase inside the X element is in general more smeared in the ΔNtH4 mutant than in the wild type strain. This can be explained assuming that most nucleosomes and protein complexes within the X element are in a more relaxed conformation in the mutant. The digestion pattern generated by MNase in the promoter region of Ty5–1 is altered in the ΔNtH4 mutant, suggesting a change of nucleosome distribution. To analyze whether the insertion of Y′S element had any effect on the chromatin structure of LIII, the MNase digestion profiles of Y′-short-bearing and Y′-less subpopulations of the PKY813 strain were analyzed. The analysis was made possible by the existence of subpopulations bearing or devoid of Y′ elements that are stable for a sufficient number of generations. The digestion profiles in both the X elements and in the Ty5–1 sequences were essentially indistinguishable in the various subpopulations analyzed, pointing to the independence of the heterochromatin organization of these sequences upon proximity of the telosome structure that characterizes the C1–3A tracts. The digestion profile of these tracts is always the same, independently on the presence (see the profile shown in Fig. 1,lanes 7–10, and in Fig. 2, lanes 7–9) or absence of Y′ elements in distal position. Our restriction analyses of LIII (Refs. 4Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 21Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, this paper, and unpublished results2) have revealed no differences between the sequence of the parental and of the mutant strains analyzed in this work for the region encompassed between the (C1–3A)n repeat/X element border and theBamHI site. The last three lanes in Fig. 1 show the MNase digestion profiles of the Ac−NtH4 mutant. They are similar to the wild type digestion profiles, indicating that the heterochromatin organization of LIII in this mutant does not undergo major changes. This result prompted us to check the level of Ty5–1 expression in the Ac−NtH4 mutant. As in the wild type strain, the expression of Ty5–1 was completely repressed in this mutant (data not shown), whereas it was derepressed in the ΔNtH4 mutant strain, as previously reported (4Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the deletion of the 4–28 N-terminal residues of histone H4 causes derepression of Ty5–1 and disruption of LIII heterochromatin structures. On the contrary, mutations that mimic the hypoacetylated state of histone H4 N terminus do not significantly alter LIII chromatin structure nor Ty5–1 silencing. Fig.2 compares the MNase digestion profiles of LIII in two different mutant strains: LJYl55 (lacking Sir3p) and PKY813 (ΔNtH4). The digestion profiles of the respective parental strains (LJY153 and PKY5O1) are also shown as a control. The results indicate that the chromatin organization of LIII is similar in the two mutant strains and that they differ from the wild-type parental organization. The major changes in the mutants consist of a shift of MNase cutting in the region that contains the 5′ long terminal repeat of Ty5–1 (where the promoter of the retrotransposon is located). In the strain lacking Sir3p, this shift corresponds to a change of the nucleosome positioning previously reported (21Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, these results prompt us to propose that a similar change of nucleosome distribution occurs in the ΔNtH4 mutant (see vertical schematic maps on both sides of Fig. 2). Interestingly, the MNase digestion pattern of the STR A-D and X core regions remains unaffected by either mutation. This pattern (extending from the STR-A sequences to the ABF1 and the ACS binding sites, a silenced origin of replication (8Louis E. Naumova E. Lee A. Naumov G. Haber J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) is characterized by an overall lower accessibility. The indirect end-labeling analyses shown in Fig. 2 do not absolutely demonstrate that the change of MNase digestion pattern observed for the ΔNtH4 mutants is because of a shift of nucleosomes positions. Such conclusions can be further sustained by a “nucleosomal spacing” analysis in vivo, as already reported for the wt LJY153 (21Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), to show that nucleosomes are actually present on the Ty5–1 promoter region of the ΔNtH4 mutant. Fig.3 shows the results obtained performing the nucleosomal spacing analyses on all the strains studied in the present report. Chromatin from these strains was digested with increasing concentrations of MNase. The purified DNA was resolved on an agarose gel, blotted and hybridized with the probe indicated in Fig. 1. The nucleosomal ladder generated on whole-genome chromatin (that is, stained with ethidium bromide) is shown for comparison (Fig. 3,panel B). This procedure reveals whether the DNA used as a probe is associated with nucleosomal particles or with complexes of different nature. By its very nature, nucleosomal spacing analysis complements the indirect end-labeling data. In Fig. 3, probe 1 displays a normal nucleosomal array in all the strains, thus corroborating that the shift of MNase cutting detected around the 5′ long terminal repeat of Ty5–1 in the ΔNtH4 mutant actually corresponds to a shift of nucleosome positioning. The model derived from the 2.8-Å crystal structure of the nucleosome suggests that an H4-based internucleosome connection in the higher order structure is replaced in heterochromatin by an interaction with Sir3p (19Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar, 30Rhodes D. Nature. 1997; 389: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The region of histone H4 that binds to the silencing factor localizes in its N terminus and is also required for telomeric silencing. Consequently, it has been suggested (30Rhodes D. Nature. 1997; 389: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that the binding of Sir3p to telomeric areas and the establishment of telomeric silencing would require the disruption of nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. These considerations highlight the interest of analyzing the direct in vivointeraction between Sir3p and the H4 N-terminal tail and its structural consequences. Studies on natural, nonengineered telomeres often yield population-averaged data because they rely on probes for repetitive sequences; hence, the difficulty of establishing precise boundaries among the various structural compartments of the chromosomal extremities and precise mapping of nucleosomes and other proteins. We compare in this report the in vivo structural consequences of mutations that affect two different heterochromatin components (histone H4 and Sir3p). The deletion of residues 4–28 of histone H4 cause modifications of LIII heterochromatin that are similar to those caused by the absence of Sir3p. Interestingly, both kinds of mutations release Ty5–1 silencing and silencing at the HMloci (4Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In addition, the 4–28 N-terminal domain of histone H4 is required for the recruitment of Sir3p to the telomeres and contains residues required for Sir3p-H4 in vitro interaction (22Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 23Johnson L. Kayne P. Kahn E. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6286-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, the present data show that the establishment of repressive heterochromatin structures at LIII requires the recruitment of Sir3p through interaction with the N terminus of histone H4. The most interesting attribute of the structural alterations caused by the lack of Sir3p and by the deletion of histone H4 N terminus is that they are undistinguishable. The major changes observed in both mutant strains is an alternate localization of nucleosomes on the Ty5–1 sequences. To our knowledge, this is an unprecedented observation. Nucleosomes are known to undergo in vivo destabilization or loss, but not displacement. Their structural modification can reach various degrees of severity and occurs in different genetic processes, the most thoroughly analyzed being the activation of transcription (31Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 240-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 33Svaren J. Hörz W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A limited ability of translational displacement has been described in vitro, in artificial conditions (34Meerssman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Multiple alternate positions on the same rotational phase (reviewed in Ref. 35Caserta M. Di Mauro E. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 947-955Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) can be occupied in vivo, ranging usually from 1 to 5 different positions (an extreme case of 15 different positions occupied being provided by the 5 S rDNA gene (36Buttinelli M. Di Mauro E. Negri R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9315-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the occupation of different positions is documented both as a static possibility in vivo by alternate locations along the same rotational frame and as a temperature-driven dynamic process in vitro in the “mobile nucleosomes” experiments (34Meerssman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), not as an actual processin vivo. Interestingly, two among the mutations known to relieve transcriptional silencing at telomeres (4Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 38Kyrion G. Boakye K. Lustig A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5159-5173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Thompson J.S. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) cause the differential localization of in vivo nucleosomes (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). A possible explanation for the shift of nucleosome positioning caused by the lack of Sir3p or the deletion of histone H4 N terminus is that, in the absence of a staple-like function provided by the Sir3p or by its H4 amino-tail counterpart, the tight structure of heterochromatin (in which nucleosomes are constrained in certain positions) does not occur. Under these unconstrained conditions, a more accessible unrepressed configuration (with differently located nucleosomes) is organized that allows transcription to start. In addition, the recruitment of the transcriptional preinitiation complex to the Ty5–1 promoter region could also favor the shift of nucleosome positioning in the absence of Sir3p-H4 interaction. One of the features defined by the 2.8-Å resolution model of the nucleosome structure is that one H4 N-terminal tail segment has the potential to make a strong interparticle connection, perhaps relevant to the higher-order structure of chromatin (19Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). Because this H4 domain is also required for the binding of Sir3p, the similarity of the effects caused by the lack of Sir3p or of its reacting counterpart in histone H4 is coherent, with the possibility that binding of Sir3p locks down nucleosomes by changing the normal nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. It was suggested that the R1 domain of histone H4 is involved in stabilizing the bend caused on DNA by the interaction with the histone octamer (25Ebralidse K.K. Grachev S.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) at the site defined as dyad. The R1 domain is functionally defined as a basic region spanning residues 16–19 (23Johnson L. Kayne P. Kahn E. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6286-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 40Kayne P.S. Kim U.J. Han M. Mullen J.R. Yoshizaki F. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 27-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), very sensitive to mutations that alter charge and lead to derepression atHML and at telomeres (37Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 38Kyrion G. Boakye K. Lustig A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5159-5173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Thompson J.S. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). R1 was also shown to be necessary for nucleosome positioning by the α2 repressor (15Roth S.Y. Shimizo M. Johnson L. Grunstein M. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the lack of these residues weakens the DNA-H4 tail interactions, allowing a more relaxed and accessible heterochromatin configuration. In conclusion, the similarity of the modifications caused by the lack of Sir3p and by the deletion of H4 N-terminal tail supports thein vivo interaction of these components at LIII, which agrees with the nucleosome high resolution model. This interaction is required to keep the repressed heterochromatin configuration of the Ty5–1 retrotransposon (4Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the establishment of heterochromatic repressive structures at LIII requires the N terminus of histone H4. In contrast, the simultaneous mutation of the four acetylatable lysines (5Louis E. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1553-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 8Louis E. Naumova E. Lee A. Naumov G. Haber J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Conrad M. Wright J. Wolf A. Zakian V. Cell. 1990; 63: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar,16Hardy C. Sussel L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) of histone H4 to arginines does not significantly affect it. Previous in vitro binding analyses suggest that the K to R mutation of the four H4 N-terminal lysines does not impair Sir3p-histone H4 interaction (22Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on the HMloci have demonstrated that, as in other eukaryotes, heterochromatin in yeast is hypoacetylated at the H4 lysines 5, 8, and 16 but not at lysine 12 (41Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, lysine 12 is not required for the interaction with Sir3p or for the establishment of functional heterochromatin (22Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 23Johnson L. Kayne P. Kahn E. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6286-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We have shown that the K to R mutation of the four acetylatable lysines does not affect Ty5–1 silencing. In addition, although these mutations moderately inhibit mating (42Laurenson P. Rine J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 543-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they do not lead to derepression of theHMLα locus, as analyzed by Northern hybridization (data not shown), which suggests that they exert a minimal effect of HMrepression. Taken together, these data prompt us to propose that the recruitment of Sir3p to telomeres and the consequent establishment of heterochromatic-epressive structures do not require acetylation of any of the H4 N-terminal lysines. It is interesting to note that the two mutations of histone H4 analyzed in this report (ΔNtH4 and Ac−NtH4) exert a negative effect on the activation of regular non-telomeric polymerase II genes (26Durrin K.L. Mann R.K. Kayne P.S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1023-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Such gene activation failing has been correlated with the establishment of a closed chromatin structure (43Fisher-Adams G. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the N terminus of histone H4 has been shown to be required for α2 to position nucleosomes and repress gene expression (15Roth S.Y. Shimizo M. Johnson L. Grunstein M. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In summary, the N terminus of histone H4 plays an essential role in gene activation and silencing through the establishment of specific chromatin structure organizations. The role of the acetylatable lysines differs depending on the specific process and probably on the proteins with which they interact. The support of G. P.
