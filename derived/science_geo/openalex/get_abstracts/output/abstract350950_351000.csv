An analysis of climate risks for crops in 12 food-insecure regions was conducted to identify adaptation priorities, based on statistical crop models and climate projections for 2030 from 20 general circulation models. Results indicate South Asia and Southern Africa as two regions that, without sufficient adaptation measures, will likely suffer negative impacts on several crops that are important to large food-insecure human populations. We also find that uncertainties vary widely by crop, and therefore priorities will depend on the risk attitudes of investment institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2092390808,"Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites is an accurate method of identifying the location of genetic regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. We employed high-throughput sequencing and whole-genome tiled array strategies to identify DNase I HS sites within human primary CD4+ T cells. Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16%-21% of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression, motif, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells. In addition, and unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of nucleosome structure."

Using mice carrying a deletable mutant gene, diminished mutant expression in astrocytes did not affect onset, but delayed microglial activation and sharply slowed later disease progression. These findings demonstrate that mutant astrocytes are viable targets for therapies for slowing the progression of non-cell autonomous killing of motor neurons in ALS."

However, whether or not adult β cell progenitors exist is one of the most controversial issues in today's diabetes research. Guided by the expression of Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), the earliest islet cell-specific transcription factor in embryonic development, we show that β cell progenitors can be activated in injured adult mouse pancreas and are located in the ductal lining. Differentiation of the adult progenitors is Ngn3 dependent and gives rise to all islet cell types, including glucose responsive β cells that subsequently proliferate, both in situ and when cultured in embryonic pancreas explants. Multipotent progenitor cells thus exist in the pancreas of adult mice and can be activated cell autonomously to increase the functional β cell mass by differentiation and proliferation rather than by self-duplication of pre-existing β cells only.

Gene regulatory factors in pancreatic development.Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 176-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) but our knowledge on the existence of precursors and generation of islet cells in the postnatal pancreas depends merely on descriptive data and indirect proof (Bonner-Weir and Weir, 2005Bonner-Weir S.

None of these studies, however, was conclusive in demonstrating the existence and origin of a bona fide β cell progenitor in postnatal pancreas. The elusiveness of this cell type reached a summit when genetic lineage tracing provided evidence that pre-existing β cells, rather than stem/progenitor cells, are the major source of new β cells in adult mice both under normal physiological conditions and after 70% or 50% pancreatectomy (Dor et al., 2004Dor Y.

Two major problems are at the basis of this ambiguous scenario: the slow turnover of adult β cells and the lack of specific markers to trace their origin. We overcame these hurdles by (1) forcing the generation of new β cells through partial duct ligation (PDL) in the pancreas of adult mice and (2) using transgenic reporter mice that allow tracing of the promoter activity of Ngn3 as a marker of adult progenitor cell recruitment. PDL stimulates doubling of the β cell mass in rats (Wang et al., 1995Wang R.N. Kloppel G. Bouwens L.

Direct evidence for the pancreatic lineage: NGN3+ cells are islet progenitors and are distinct from duct progenitors.Development. 2002; 129: 2447-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pancreatic β cells have a slow turnover under normal physiological conditions but expand rapidly under certain experimental conditions like PDL (Wang et al., 1995Wang R.N. Kloppel G. Bouwens L. Duct- to islet-cell differentiation and islet growth in the pancreas of duct-ligated adult rats.Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In Balb/c mice, the duct leading to the pancreatic tail was closed while the organ's head located adjacent to the stomach and duodenum remained unaffected. Within 1 week far most of the acinar exocrine cells underwent apoptosis (Figure S1A) and likely were scavenged by CD45+ cells recruited to the ligated tail part of pancreas (Figure S1C) (Scoggins et al., 2000Scoggins C.R. Meszoely I.M. Wada M. Means A.L. Yang L. Leach S.D. p53-dependent acinar cell apoptosis triggers epithelial proliferation in duct-ligated murine pancreas.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G827-G836PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, duct cell-cycle activity was strongly elevated (Figures S1B and S2E), and consequently, the density of duct structures significantly increased (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). The weight of the pancreatic tail decreased (Figure S2A), while body weight and glycemia remained unaffected (Figures S2B and S2C). The total insulin+ cell mass in the ligated part of pancreas increased more than 2-fold within 1 week following surgery (Figures 1B and S1D), and the absolute amount of immunoreactive insulin had doubled 1 week later, a lag period likely needed for β cell maturation (Figure 1C). The individual β cell size remained similar under all conditions tested (Figure S2D), meaning that the treatment induced an increase in cell number rather than in cell size. During this period, the number of β cells in active cell cycle increased 10-fold as established by incorporation of the nucleotide analog BrdU (Figures 1D and S1E). As PDL robustly induced generation of new β cells, we investigated the importance of progenitor cell activation and β cell proliferation in doubling of the β cell mass. A strong activation of expression of Ngn3, a well-established marker for embryonic islet cell progenitors, was observed specifically in the ligated part of adult mouse pancreas within 3 days following injury. Maximal levels of Ngn3 transcript were reached within 1 week and subsequently decreased slowly (Figure 1E). Besides neo-formation of β cells, the number of apoptotic β cells increased significantly (Figure S1F). Apoptotic β cells were not preferentially in active cell cycle (Figure S1G). To investigate the causal relationship between the doubling of β cell mass and the activation of Ngn3 gene expression, the latter was knocked down during PDL-induced formation of endocrine pancreas. Recombinant lentiviruses that encode 2 Ngn3-specific short hairpin (sh) interfering RNA molecules (Le-sh1Ngn3 and Le-sh2Ngn3), or a control, scrambled sequence (Le-scr) (Baeyens et al., 2006Baeyens L. Bonne S. German M.S. Ravassard P. Heimberg H. Bouwens L. Ngn3 expression during postnatal in vitro beta cell neogenesis induced by the JAK/STAT pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1892-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were injected into the pancreatic duct via the papilla Vateri, followed by ligation of the tail duct. The viruses constitutively express the reporter protein eGFP that allowed us to evaluate the efficiency and specificity of infection in the whole organ and in tissue sections. Injection of reporter virus in sham-treated pancreas transduced 62% of total cells (Figure S3). When virus injection was combined with duct ligation, 18% ± 10% of total cells expressed detectable levels of eGFP 1 week after surgery (Figure 2A). Following infection with lentivirus expressing shRNA, acinar cells disappeared similarly as in control PDL pancreas, and no off-target effects on differentiation and proliferation of duct cells were observed (Figures S4A–S4C). In Le-shNgn3-injected pancreas the Ngn3 transcript abundance was 70% ± 11% (sh1) and 49% ± 4% (sh2) lower than in sham- and Le-scr-injected PDL pancreas at day 7 (Figures 2B, upper and S5). PDL-induced increase of the β cell mass was prevented by 66% ± 17% (sh1) and 26% ± 10% (sh2) following infection with Le-shNgn3 (Figure 2B, middle). These data strongly suggest that β cell formation following PDL depends at least partly on Ngn3 activity. The induced BrdU labeling index of insulin+ cells decreased with 77% ± 10% (sh1) and 32% ± 12% (sh2) by Le-shNgn3 versus Le-scr injection (Figure 2B, lower), indicating that an important fraction of BrdU+ β cells (Figure 1D) were derived from differentiated Ngn3+ cells. Given the activated Ngn3 expression in injured pancreas of adult mouse, we attempted to track these islet progenitor cells in transgenic Ngn3-nLacZ mice, expressing a nuclear β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter protein under control of a 6.9 kb genomic sequence that includes the Ngn3 promoter and faithfully recapitulates the spatial expression of Ngn3 in the embryonic as well as in the adult pancreas (G.M. and G.G., unpublished data). Histochemistry for β-gal activity revealed blue nuclei in adult mouse duodenum (data not shown), known to constitutively express Ngn3 in enteroendocrine progenitor cells (Jenny et al., 2002Jenny M. Uhl C. Roche C. Duluc I. Guillermin V. Guillemot F. Jensen J. Kedinger M. Gradwohl G. Neurogenin3 is differentially required for endocrine cell fate specification in the intestinal and gastric epithelium.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6338-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, Schonhoff et al., 2004Schonhoff S.E. Giel-Moloney M. Leiter A.B. Neurogenin 3-expressing progenitor cells in the gastrointestinal tract differentiate into both endocrine and non-endocrine cell types.Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The Ngn3 reporter was also detected in the ligated tail of PDL pancreas but not in the unligated head or in the pancreatic tail of sham-operated mice. The localization of 785 β-gal+ cells was examined in six mice, 7 days following PDL (Figure 3A). Of all β-gal+ cells 15% ± 1% were immunoreactive for duct cell-specific cytokeratins (CK) (Figure 3B) and half of the β-gal+CK+ cells were lining the duct lumen as shown by confocal scanning microscopy (Figure 3C). Furthermore, Ngn3 was expressed in duct-lining cells that activated Pdx1 expression following PDL (Figure 3I). No marker typical for any pancreatic cell type was expressed on 51% ± 2% β-gal+ cells (Figure 3D), one-third of which were still in contact with CK+ duct cells (Figure 3B). Immunohistochemical staining with a Ngn3-specific antibody showed that the Ngn3+ cells in duct-ligated pancreas were devoid of islet cell-specific hormones (Figures 3E–3F). On the other hand, the long half-life of the reporter protein β-gal (Gonda et al., 1989Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wunning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. Universality and structure of the N-end rule.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16700-16712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) allowed tracing the fate of Ngn3+ cells to their endocrine descendants. Indeed, 34% ± 4% of β-gal+ cells contained transcripts encoding islet hormones at day 7 following PDL (Figures 3G and 3H). Half the number of hormone-expressing βGal+ cells was still in contact with duct cells but none of these were part of the luminal lining. No β-gal+ cells costained for amylase (not shown). While these lineage-tracing data strongly suggest that the observed Ngn3+ cells originate from islet hormone− cells among the lining of ducts and migrate to become hormone+ cells within the islet structures in adult mice, they do not fully exclude the alternative possibility that endocrine cells dedifferentiated to Ngn3+ cells. Therefore, we traced permanently labeled β cells from INS-Cre/R26R mice with PDL and found the label absent from Ngn3+ cells (Figure S6B) supporting differentiation of Ngn3+-to-islet cells. Based on the number of β-gal+ cells in 30 tissue sections from the PDL pancreas of three mice, approximately 5000 β-gal+ cells were present in the ligated tail, a sufficiently high number to endeavor their isolation. By flow cytometry, Ngn3+ cells were isolated from the PDL pancreas of reporter mice that express eGFP under control of the same 6.9 kb Ngn3 promoter fragment as used in the Ngn3-nlacZ mice. As for β-gal, the half-life of eGFP (Corish and Tyler-Smith, 1999Corish P. Tyler-Smith C. Attenuation of green fluorescent protein half-life in mammalian cells.Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) exceeds that of Ngn3 (Lee et al., 2001Lee J.C. Smith S.B. Watada H. Lin J. Scheel D. Wang J. Mirmira R.G. German M.S. Regulation of the pancreatic pro-endocrine gene neurogenin3.Diabetes. 2001; 50: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and consequently the reporter protein was still present in a fraction of the hormone-positive descendants of the preendocrine cells (data not shown). These GFP+ cells with hormone-containing vesicles were excluded, and only nongranulated GFP+ cells were considered as endocrine progenitors. Seven days following partial duct ligation, PI−/GFP+/TSQ−/LowSSC cells (termed GFP/LSSC cells from hereon) that were viable, green fluorescent, and contained only few granules could be isolated from PDL pancreas of Ngn3-eGFP mice (Figure 4A). The transcript encoding Ngn3 was 200-fold enriched, and those encoding insulin and glucagon were very rare in the progenitor population as compared to nonsorted PDL pancreas cells (Figure 4B). A similar cell population was isolated from the pancreas of Ngn3eYFP/+ knock add-on mice (Mellitzer et al., 2004Mellitzer G. Martin M. Sidhoum-Jenny M. Orvain C. Barths J. Seymour P.A. Sander M. Gradwohl G. Pancreatic islet progenitor cells in neurogenin 3-yellow fluorescent protein knock-add-on mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), corroborating faithful recapitulation of Ngn3 expression in the Ngn3-eGFP mice (Figure 4D) (data not shown). The GFP/LSSC cell population represented 0.04% of the total number of sorted pancreatic cells. Of this sorted population, 93% ± 4% immunostained GFP+, 90.1% ± 5% Ngn3+, and none were insulin+ (Figure 4E). As expected, the fraction of insulin+ cells was high in the GFP+/TSQ+/HSSC (termed GFP/HSSC from hereon) cell population (85% ± 10%) and in total pancreas (3.0% ± 0.8%). GFP/LSSC cells, sorted from GCG-Cre/R26R/Ngn3-eGFP mice pancreas (Figure S6C) 7 days following PDL, lacked β-gal (800 cells counted), while the reporter was expressed in 5% of islet cells (Figure S6D). In addition to the differentiation of Ngn3+-to-β cells (Figure S6B) and the similar amount of Ngn3 transcripts in islets isolated from the tail of ligated and sham-treated pancreas (lower than in total PDL pancreas) (Figure 4C), these data provide strong evidence against islet-to-Ngn3+ cell dedifferentiation. Due to the controversial aspect of progenitor cells in adult pancreas, we compared these GFP/LSSC cells with Ngn3+ cells isolated from E13.5 embryonic pancreas and from adult duodenal crypt region, as these Ngn3+ cell types are generally accepted to be genuine endocrine progenitors (Gu et al., 2002Gu G. Dubauskaite J. Melton D.A.

Uhl C. Roche C. Duluc I. Guillermin V. Guillemot F. Jensen J. Kedinger M. Gradwohl G.

Giel-Moloney M. Leiter A.B. Neurogenin 3-expressing progenitor cells in the gastrointestinal tract differentiate into both endocrine and non-endocrine cell types.Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). While 99.8% of the sorted cells from embryonic pancreas and adult duodenum were GFP-positive, none immunostained positive for insulin. The abundance of Ngn3 transcripts in these cells was more than 100-fold higher than in the nonsorted cell populations (data not shown). Electron micrographs of GFP/LSSC cells isolated from embryonic and adult PDL pancreas showed rounded cells that were 3-fold smaller than adult mouse β cells (985 ± 112 μm3 versus 3052 ± 178 μm3) and had relatively large nuclei (695 ± 98 μm3 versus 565 ± 76 μm3) with a remarkable amount of heterochromatin in the periphery of the nuclei (Figure 4F). The ultrastructural features of Ngn3+ cells isolated from adult duodenum were similar to those of the pancreatic GFP/LSSC cells (data not shown). In contrast to the many dark secretory granules containing mature insulin that are present in all differentiated β cells, most GFP/LSSC cells from embryonic or adult pancreas were nongranulated and few granules were found in only 5% ± 1% of them. The latter had inclusions of low electron density, without a halo (Figure 4F), typical for cells with unprocessed hormone (Orci et al., 1985Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Vassalli J.D. Perrelet A. Direct identification of prohormone conversion site in insulin-secreting cells.Cell. 1985; 42: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and another indication of the immature cell state. Ngn3 cells isolated from adult regenerating pancreas thus strongly resemble progenitors of endocrine cells in embryonic pancreas and adult duodenum. More extensive gene-expression profiling revealed that transcription factors expressed upstream of Ngn3 in early pancreas epithelium (Ptf1a, Sox9, HNF6, and Nkx6.1) were also enriched in GFP/LSSC cells, while the ones that continue to be expressed in mature islet cells (Hlxb9 and Pdx1) were higher in GFP/HSSC than LSSC cells. Transcription factors acting downstream of Ngn3 (IA1, Pax4, Arx, Nkx2.2, NeuroD1, Pax6) were overall low in GFP/LSSC cells, also illustrating their early endocrine differentiation status (Figure 4G). When cultured in 1% or 10% serum, either in suspension, as monolayer, or in 3D collagen gel, over 90% of the GFP/LSSC cells died after 1 day (data not shown). All factors required for endogenous Ngn3+ cells to survive and differentiate into islet cells should, however, be present in the embryonic pancreas in situ but also in embryonic organ culture (Miralles et al., 1998Miralles F. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Follistatin regulates the relative proportions of endocrine versus exocrine tissue during pancreatic development.Development. 1998; 125: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures S7A–S7C). We therefore considered the ex vivo cultured embryonic mouse pancreas as an appropriate microenvironment to investigate the capacity of the Ngn3+ cells isolated from adult mouse pancreas to differentiate into mature islet cells (Figure 5A). In wild-type (WT) E12.5 pancreatic explants, the differentiating endocrine cells derived from endogenous Ngn3-expressing cells, since no islet hormone+ cells appeared in explants from Ngn3 homozygous null mutant embryos (Figure 5B). To exclude interference with these endogenous embryonic Ngn3+ cells, the isolated GFP/LSSC cells from normal embryonic and ligated adult pancreas of Ngn3-eGFP mice were microinjected in embryonic Ngn3−/− pancreas. No insulin or glucagon peptide or transcript could be detected in the engrafted Ngn3−/− explants following 1 day of culture (Figure 5B,C). After 7 days of culture, WT explants as well as engrafted—but not sham-injected—Ngn3−/− explants contained transcripts encoding the four islet hormones as well as their corresponding peptides (Figures 5B and 5C). No cell expressed more than one hormone simultaneously (data not shown). We further examined whether the observed endocrine differentiation was cell autonomous or whether fusion or signaling between injected adult Ngn3+ cells and explanted embryonic pancreas was involved. First, when GFP/LSSC cells were preincubated with CellTracker Orange (CMTMR) and injected in explanted pancreas of Ngn3−/− embryonic mice, the injected GFP/LSSC cells differentiated since some of them expressed insulin already at day 4 of culture (Figure S8A). Second, when mouse GFP/LSSC cells were cultured in explants of rat embryonic pancreas and differentiating β cells were immunostained by species-specific antibodies directed against insulin C peptide (Blume et al., 1990Blume N. Madsen O.D. Kofod H. Dyrberg T. Production of peptide antisera specific for mouse and rat proinsulin C-peptide 2.Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1990; 49: 1247-1251PubMed Google Scholar), both mouse and rat cells independently differentiated to C peptide+ cells (Figure S8B). Finally, when GFP/LSSC cells isolated from Ngn3-eGFP mice that constitutively express β-gal were cultured in pancreas explants from embryonic Ngn3−/− mice, all differentiated, hormone+ cells were β-gal+ (Figure S8C). Consequently, the endocrine cells originate directly from the injected GFP/LSSC cells without cell fusion. When explants were labeled with BrdU during the last 16 hr of culture, the injected GFP/LSSC cells did not enter the cell cycle after 1 day, while 22% ± 6.2% of the newly differentiated insulin+ cells were active in S phase at day 7 (Figure 5D). WT explants contained 137 ± 37 ng of insulin following 7 days of culture (versus 1.2 ± 0.8 ng at day 1) and Ngn3−/− explants supplemented with adult GFP/LSSC cells had 35 ± 7 ng insulin (versus 0.2 ± 0.2 at day 1). To evaluate the degree of differentiation of the GFP/LSSC cells, we measured glucose responsiveness of the insulin release. Glucose induced a 1.5-fold increase of insulin secretion from explanted E12.5 pancreas of WT mice at day 7 of culture (Figure 5E). Embryonic pancreas from Ngn3−/− mice acquired glucose responsiveness when injected with GFP/LSSC cells from adult Ngn3-eGFP mice (PDL D7), since their insulin release increased 2.6-fold when stimulated with 20 mmol/L glucose (Figure 5E). Our study demonstrates convincingly that the adult mouse pancreas contains islet cell progenitors and that expansion of the β cell mass following injury induced by ligation of the pancreatic duct depends at least partly on the activation of Ngn3 gene expression and the ensuing differentiation of endogenous progenitor cells in a cell-autonomous, fusion-independent manner. Partial duct ligation induces a strong inflammatory response and a loss of acinar cells. Both processes may be important in signaling for increase of the β cell mass under these conditions of injury, but it is unclear at this moment whether they play a role in the normal physiology of a healthy pancreas where the importance of self-duplication rather than stem cell differentiation is well documented (Dor et al., 2004Dor Y. Brown J. Martinez O.I. Melton D.A. Adult pancreatic beta-cells are formed by self-duplication rather than stem-cell differentiation.Nature. 2004; 429: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar, Teta et al., 2007Teta M.

Cell. 2007; 12: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Activation of Ngn3 and doubling of the β cell mass could be prevented up to 66% by Ngn3-specific RNA interference, suggesting a considerable contribution of progenitor cells to the observed β cell hyperplasia. In nonligated pancreas 67% of the cells were transduced compared to only 18% in ligated pancreas. This difference is due to the disappearance of acinar cells, the most abundant cell type of the infected pancreas and to a massive recruitment of uninfected immune response cells to the pancreas affected by inflammation following PDL. The efficient Ngn3 knockdown can be explained by (1) the infection of 67% of pancreas cells before PDL is carried out, (2) the specific location of an important fraction of Ngn3-expressing cells, targets of the interfering RNA, among or in contact with duct cells that line the site of injection and therefore are exposed directly to the virus, and (3) a near 100% knockdown of Ngn3 expression by Le-sh1Ngn3 (Baeyens et al., 2006Baeyens L.

The remaining increase in β cell mass in spite of Ngn3 knockdown likely is due to cycling of (1) pre-existing β cells and/or (2) progenitor cells that were uninfected or that had differentiated beyond the Ngn3+ stage before being infected. While under normal physiological conditions the slow course of β cell proliferation is sufficient to compensate for their low turnover and expansion (Dor et al., 2004Dor Y. Brown J. Martinez O.I.

https://openalex.org/W2035787181,"α-Synuclein, a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD), is thought to affect mitochondrial functions, although the mechanisms of its action remain unclear. In this study we show that the N-terminal 32 amino acids of human α-synuclein contain cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal, which is important for mitochondrial targeting of α-synuclein. Mitochondrial imported α-synuclein is predominantly associated with the inner membrane. Accumulation of wild-type α-synuclein in the mitochondria of human dopaminergic neurons caused reduced mitochondrial complex I activity and increased production of reactive oxygen species. However, these defects occurred at an early time point in dopaminergic neurons expressing familial α-synuclein with A53T mutation as compared with wild-type α-synuclein. Importantly, α-synuclein that lacks mitochondrial targeting signal failed to target to the mitochondria and showed no detectable effect on complex I function. The PD relevance of these results was investigated using mitochondria of substantia nigra, striatum, and cerebellum of postmortem late-onset PD and normal human brains. Results showed the constitutive presence of ∼14-kDa α-synuclein in the mitochondria of all three brain regions of normal subjects. Mitochondria of PD-vulnerable substantia nigra and striatum but not cerebellum from PD subjects showed significant accumulation of α-synuclein and decreased complex I activity. Analysis of mitochondria from PD brain and α-synuclein expressing dopaminergic neuronal cultures using blue native gel electrophoresis and immunocapture technique showed the association of α-synuclein with complex I. These results provide evidence that mitochondrial accumulated α-synuclein may interact with complex I and interfere with its functions. α-Synuclein, a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD), is thought to affect mitochondrial functions, although the mechanisms of its action remain unclear.

One of the pathological hallmarks of PD and related synucleinopathies is the presence of intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies that consist of aggregates of the presynaptic soluble protein called α-synuclein.(1Bennett M.C.

In addition, it is well known that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of PD (4Abou-Sleiman P.M. Muqit M.M. McDonald N.Q. Yang Y.X. Gandhi S.

Triplication of α-synuclein gene and point mutations in the coding region has been associated with early onset of familial forms of PD. The familial PD represents only a minor proportion of all PD cases, whereas the majority of cases belong to sporadic form of the disease. However, some forms of familial PD have also been linked to mutations in PINK1 and DJ1 (2Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 3Shults C.W.

Studies from our laboratory demonstrated the mitochondrial targeting of several endoplasmic reticulum-destined cytochrome P450 isoforms, cytosolic glutathione S-transferase, and Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein with a noncanonical, cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal (16Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These atypical signals require activation either by proteolytic processing or protein modifications. Recently, using postmortem human AD brains and human cortical neuronal cell cultures, we showed that the progressive accumulation of amyloid precursor protein into mitochondrial import channels was associated with the impairment of mitochondrial function (21Devi L. Prabhu B.M. Galati D.F. Avadhani N.G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9057-9068Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified the cryptic mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N terminus of α-synuclein. Mitochondrial targeting of α-synuclein under in vivo and in vitro conditions and also mitochondrial electron transport chain defects in α-synuclein accumulating neuronal cell systems led us to hypothesize that mitochondrial accumulation of α-synuclein may be an important cause of mitochondrial dysfunction as seen in the pathogenesis of PD. This possibility was further investigated in human brains affected by PD. Our results show that mitochondria are one of the direct targets of α-synuclein during the pathogenesis of PD. Cloning of α-Synuclein cDNAs—Human α-synuclein cDNA containing a 5′ HindIII site and a 3′ XbaI site was generated by reverse transcriptase-based PCR using total RNA from human brain tissue. Various N-terminal deletions were generated by PCR amplification of the parent cDNA using the appropriate sense primers containing an ATG codon and upstream Kozak consensus (22Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar) for translation initiation. A53T/synuclein construct was generated by overlap PCR using wild-type synuclein as a template. All constructs were engineered to contain 5′ HindIII site and a 3′ Xbal site, and these cDNAs were cloned into pCR TOPO vectors. Simultaneously, α-synuclein constructs containing a 5′ HindIII site and a 3′ XhoI site were generated, and these constructs were cloned into the mammalian 3 FLAG pcDNA3 vector (gift from Dr. Serge Fuchs). The sequence properties of all the plasmid constructs were verified prior to use. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Subcellular Localization of Proteins—Human fetal dopaminergic primary neuronal (DAN) cultures (Clonexpress, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) were grown as according to the supplier's instructions. Cells at 60% confluence were transfected with wild-type and N-terminal truncated α-synuclein FLAG-tagged cDNA constructs (5 μg/plate) using FuGENE. Cells were harvested and homogenized (25–30 strokes) in four volumes of H medium using a Teflon-fitted glass hand homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and the 2000 × g supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min to obtain mitochondrial pellet. The resultant post mitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain cytosol and microsomes. The pellet (mitochondrial fraction) was resuspended in H medium and layered onto 1 m sucrose and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in suspension buffer and used for biochemical analysis without further delay. Cross-contamination of mitochondrial fractions with other subcellular organelles was investigated by Western blotting with antibodies to mitochondrial, cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum markers. Knockdown of α-Synuclein in DAN Cells—Knockdown of α-synuclein in DAN cells was carried out by using α-synuclein siRNA (h) kit from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Transfection of human α-synuclein-specific siRNA (consists of three target-specific 20- to 25-nucleotide siRNAs), and control siRNA (contains scrambled sequence) was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following the 48 h of transfection, cells were subjected to mitochondrial isolation to assay complex activities. In Vitro Mitochondrial Import—Fresh mitochondria from rat liver were isolated essentially as described (18Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Using cDNAs encoding the wild-type, familial, and N-terminal truncated α-synuclein, 35S-labeled translation products were generated in a transcription-coupled translation system (Promega, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Import of the in vitro-synthesized proteins was carried out in a 200-μl reaction volume as described previously (17Robin M.-A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Naresh Babu V. Sepuri. Gordon D.M.

The incubation mixture was subjected to limited trypsin treatment (150 μg/ml reaction), and mitochondria were re-isolated by layering through 0.8 m sucrose and subsequent centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Mitochondrial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to fluorography. The mitochondrially imported radioactive bands were visualized using the STORM (Molecular Dynamics) system. In another set of experiments, α-synuclein translation product was generated in the presence of unlabeled methionine. Mitochondrial import of unlabeled α-synuclein was carried out as described above, and the resulting mitochondrial pellet was subjected to immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to α-synuclein. Double Immunofluorescence Microscopy—DAN cells grown on coverslips were transfected with WT/syn FLAG and +33/syn FLAG cDNA constructs for 40 h and processed for antibody staining as previously described (20Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Robin M.A. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Cells permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 were stained with mouse monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope (Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal antibody to TOM20. The cells then were stained with appropriate fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Postmortem Human Subjects—Twenty-two autopsy brain hemispheres belonging to both genders were procured from the National Disease Resource Interchange (NDRI, Philadelphia, PA) of which eleven were clinically diagnosed with PD (PD subjects, n = 11) and eleven were normal brains with no neurological disorders (normal subjects, n = 11). These subjects had a postmortem time and ages ranging from 6 to 13 h and 52 to 93 years, respectively (supplemental Table S1). All procedures used to collect postmortem human brains from NDRI were approved by the institutional review board committee. The PD cases used in the study were late-onset. All studies were carried out on the fresh specimen without any further delay. Brains were dissected into various regions, and the subcellular fractions were isolated for biochemical analysis. For immunoelectron microscopy and immunohistochemistry analysis a portion of tissue from each region was fixed for 48 h in 20 mm phosphate buffer containing 4% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde immediately. PD subjects used in the study were positive for the presence of Lewy bodies, whereas controls showed no Lewy body staining. Isolation of Subcellular Fractions from Fresh Postmortem Brain Tissue—Approximately 1 g of brain tissue was homogenized in four volumes of homogenization medium containing 70 mm sucrose, 210 mm mannitol, 2 mm HEPES, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (H medium). Homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. Mitochondrial, microsomal and cytosolic fractions from the resulting supernatant were isolated as described (21Devi L. Prabhu B.M. Galati D.F. Avadhani N.G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9057-9068Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Isolated subcellular fractions were subjected to biochemical analysis without further delay. Protein concentration was measured by the Lowry assay (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-contamination of mitochondrial fractions with other subcellular organelles was investigated by Western blotting with antibodies to mitochondrial anti-rabbit TOM20 (1:1500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-mouse nuclear P97 (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-goat cytosolic marker actin (1:1500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-rabbit endoplasmic reticulum marker Sec 61(1:1000, Upstate), and anti-mouse Golgi marker TGN 38 (1:1500, Affinity Bioreagents). Treatments, Immunoblots, and Quantitative ELISA—Mitochondria (50 μg) were suspended in H medium and were subjected to trypsin, digitonin, and sodium carbonate treatments separately as described (24Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with ant rabbit α-synuclein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-mouse mitochondrial mtHSP70 (1:1000, Ab cam), anti-mouse cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (1;1500, Mitosciences), and anti-rabbit TOM20 (1;1500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were immunostained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and the bands were developed using the Pierce West Femto Super Signal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrate kit and a Versa Doc (Bio-Rad) imaging system with Quantity One software. Quantitative ELISA of α-synuclein in cytosol and mitochondria (100 μg each in triplicates) from PD subjects, and controls was carried out using the “Human α-Synuclein ELISA kit” (BioSource) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunoelectron microscopy was carried out in the “Biomedical Imaging Core Laboratory” at the University of Pennsylvania as described (20Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Robin M.A. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 21Devi L. Prabhu B.M. Galati D.F. Avadhani N.G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9057-9068Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections from freshly fixed tissue were incubated with primary antibody to α-synuclein at 4 °C for 24 h. The grids were rinsed with TBST for 15 min and incubated with anti-rabbit colloidal gold-conjugated IgG. The sections were examined and imaged using an electron microscope (JEOL JEM-1010). Measurement of Mitochondrial Complex Activities—Mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV activities were measured essentially as described (25Wang Y Biswas G Prabu S.K. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The activity of Rotenone sensitive complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), in the mitochondria was assayed by following the decrease in absorbance due to the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm (ϵ = 6.81 mm-1 cm-1) using 50 μg of mitochondria. Complex II activity was measured by following the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol at 600 nm (e = 19.1 mm-1 cm-1) in the presence of succinate. Complex IV activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring the decrease in absorbance of ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm. Activities of ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase (complex III) and NADH cytochrome c reductase (complex I–III link) was measured essentially as described (26Ellis C.E. Murphy E.J. Mitchell D.C. Golovko M.Y. Scaglia F. Barcelo′-Coblijn G.C. Nussbaum R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10190-10201Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In another set of experiments, mitoplast (50 μg) isolated from substantia nigra of normal subject #9 was suspended in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% lauryl maltoside and incubated with varying amounts of purified human α-synuclein (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 30 min simultaneously. Control reactions containing mitoplast and varying concentration of α-synuclein dilution buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm, Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm MgCl2) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the preincubation, the samples were assayed for mitochondrial complex activities as described (25Wang Y Biswas G Prabu S.K. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Ellis C.E. Murphy E.J. Mitchell D.C. Golovko M.Y. Scaglia F. Barcelo′-Coblijn G.C. Nussbaum R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10190-10201Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Measurement of ROS in Isolated Mitochondria—ROS was measured in the freshly isolated mitochondrial fractions from DAN cells transfected with wild-type and mutant α-synuclein constructs using hydroxyphenyl fluorescein. Mitochondria (50 μg) were incubated with hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (1 μm) in 1 ml of a medium containing 70 mm sucrose, 210 mm mannitol, 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm glutamate, 2 mm malate, and 2 mm ADP at 37 °C for 60 min in the dark. Fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorometer utilizing excitation at 488 nm and emission at 515 nm. Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis-coupled Western Blot— Freshly isolated mitochondrial samples (striatum) were solubilized in 0.2% lauryl maltoside and were subjected to blue native gel electrophoresis coupled Western blot as described (21Devi L. Prabhu B.M. Galati D.F. Avadhani N.G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9057-9068Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The blots were immunostained with antibodies to 39-kDa subunit of complex I (NDUFA9, Mitosciences) and α-synuclein. Immunocapture of Complex I—Immunocapture of complex I was carried out using “Complex I Immunocapture Kit” from Mitosciences according to the manufacturer's protocol from 5 mg of mitochondrial fraction. The final elution of complex I was carried out using glycine buffer (0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, containing 0.05% lauryl maltoside). Eluted complex I was subjected to 14% SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblot analysis using antibodies to α-synuclein and NDUFA9. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using Origin 7.5 software (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). The correlation among mitochondrial α-synuclein content and complex I activity was statistically analyzed using scatter plots. Statistical analysis and the level of significance were assessed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. In some instances statistical significance was tested by Student's t test. Mitochondrial Import Signals of Human α-Synuclein—As seen from Fig. 1A the N terminus of α-synuclein is rich in positively charged amino acids (lysine). Furthermore, this region can also form an α-helical structure (27Ulmer T.S. Bax A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43179-43187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) thus elucidating the physico-chemical characteristics of mitochondrial targeting signals (28Von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 29Rehlin P. Katrin Brandner K. Pfanner N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We also used the Bioinformatics program, WoLFPSORT, which predicts the signal targeting activities of proteins. The analysis suggests a multi subcellular localization of α-synuclein, including mitochondria (Table 1). The percent distribution of α-synuclein to mitochondria was 16.5% when the whole protein sequence was used for analysis. Interestingly, the mitochondrial distribution of α-synuclein increased to 25.5% when the N-terminal 40-amino acid sequence was used for analysis, suggesting that the N terminus of human α-synuclein may function as mitochondrial targeting signal. These results prompted a detailed investigation on the mitochondrial transport of human α-synuclein using in vitro mitochondrial import and in vivo expression in neuronal cell system.TABLE 1Prediction of distribution of α-synuclein into various subcellular organellesSubcellular organelle% distribution of α synucleinComplete protein sequence used for predictionN-terminal 40 amino acids sequence used for predictionMitochondria16.225.5Cytosol32.222Nucleus16.212.5Secretory vesicles35.440 Open table in a new tab Mitochondrial Import of α-Synuclein Is Energy-dependent and Requires Import Channel—We investigated whether the α-synuclein protein localizes to the mitochondria using an in vitro mitochondrial import assay, in which protection against limited proteolytic digestion was used as a criterion for the import of 35S-labeled synuclein protein. The cDNA constructs (Fig. 1A) were translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the Quick Gold TNT system and incubated with freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria. Trypsin treatment of in vitro 35S-labeled wild-type α-synuclein (WT/syn) incubated with mitochondria resulted in the protection of the full-length ∼14-kDa 35S-labeled protein. This result suggests a complete translocation of this protein to mitochondria. In contrast, α-synuclein in reaction without added mitochondria was completely degraded by trypsin (data not shown). Further characterization of the mitochondrial import of α-synuclein is shown in Fig. 1B. Results showed that digitonin treatment (75 μg/mg of protein), which strips off the mitochondrial outer membrane, had no effect on mitochondrial import of α-synuclein protein suggesting the intramitochondrial localization of α-synuclein. The import of 35S-labeled α-synuclein into the mitochondria was markedly inhibited by carbonyl cyanide-m-lorophenylhydrazone, which disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 1B), and also by oligomycin, which inhibits mitochondrial ATP synthase leading to the depletion of the ATP pool (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the established views on energy requirements for mitochondrial protein transport, our results show that the transport of α-synuclein requires membrane potential and that it is dependent on the mitochondrial ATP pool. Furthermore, mitochondrially imported α-synuclein was mostly associated with pellet (P) fraction following the sodium carbonate extraction of digitonin treated mitochondria (mitoplast) (Fig. 1B, right panel). We further investigated the requirement of mitochondrial outer membrane receptor system for the import of α-synuclein in the presence of antibodies to TOM40 an import channel forming protein. As shown in the Fig. 1C, mitochondria preincubated with antibodies to porin, an outer membrane poreforming protein, were able to import 35S-labeled α-synuclein. However, antibodies to TOM40 inhibited the mitochondrial import of 35S-labeled α-synuclein. Collectively, these results suggest that the mitochondrial import of α-synuclein is physiological and requires outer membrane protein import channel. Next, we investigated the mitochondrial localization of imported α-synuclein by immunoelectron microscopy. In vitro translated α-synuclein in the presence of unlabeled methionine was incubated with mitochondria in the presence of an energy-generating system as described under “Materials and Methods.” Following import mitochondria were pelleted through 1 m sucrose and subjected to immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to α-synuclein. In support of results from carbonate extraction (Fig. 1B), immunoelectron micrograph presented in the Fig. 1D showed that most of α-synuclein-reactive gold particles were localized inside the mitochondrial compartment mostly in close proximity to the inner membrane suggesting the association of imported α-synuclein predominantly with inner membrane of mitochondria. Antibodies pre-adsorbed to α-synuclein antigenic peptide failed to show any gold labeling in the mitochondria indicating the specificity of α-synuclein antibody used in the present study (Fig. 1E). Positively Charged Residues at N Terminus Are Required for Mitochondrial Targeting of α-Synuclein—Next we evaluated the sequence requirements for the targeting of α-synuclein to the mitochondria by generating N-terminal progressive deletion constructs. Deletion of first four amino acids (+5/syn) did not reduce the mitochondrial import efficiency of α-synuclein (Fig. 1F). However, the deletion of first 32 amino acids (+33/syn) markedly reduced the mitochondrial import of α-synuclein as no detectable 35S-labeled protein was protected in trypsin treated mitochondria (Fig. 1F).

Menopause, or the end of female reproductive life, occurs when the primordial follicle pool is exhausted. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying follicle activation are poorly understood. We provide genetic evidence that in mice lacking PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) in oocytes, a major negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the entire primordial follicle pool becomes activated. Subsequently, all primordial follicles become depleted in early adulthood, causing premature ovarian failure (POF). Our results show that the mammalian oocyte serves as the headquarters of programming of follicle activation and that the oocyte PTEN-PI3K pathway governs follicle activation through control of initiation of oocyte growth."

Here, we present concentration, and stable and radiocarbon isotope, data from hydrocarbons dissolved in hydrogen-rich fluids venting at the ultramafic-hosted Lost City Hydrothermal Field. A distinct “inverse” trend in the stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic composition of C 1 to C 4 hydrocarbons is compatible with FTT genesis. Radiocarbon evidence rules out seawater bicarbonate as the carbon source for FTT reactions, suggesting that a mantle-derived inorganic carbon source is leached from the host rocks. Our findings illustrate that the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons in nature may occur in the presence of ultramafic rocks, water, and moderate amounts of heat."

https://openalex.org/W2036066742,"During photosynthesis, two photoreaction centers located in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast, photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII), use light energy to mobilize electrons to generate ATP and NADPH. Different modes of electron flow exist, of which the linear electron flow is driven by PSI and PSII, generating ATP and NADPH, whereas the cyclic electron flow (CEF) only generates ATP and is driven by the PSI alone. Different environmental and metabolic conditions require the adjustment of ATP/NADPH ratios and a switch of electron distribution between the two photosystems. With the exception of PGR5, other components facilitating CEF are unknown. Here, we report the identification of PGRL1, a transmembrane protein present in thylakoids of Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants lacking PGRL1 show perturbation of CEF, similar to PGR5-deficient plants. We find that PGRL1 and PGR5 interact physically and associate with PSI. We therefore propose that the PGRL1-PGR5 complex facilitates CEF in eukaryotes."

Although CyD1 is also strongly up-regulated at sites of inflammation, its exact roles in this context remain uncharacterized. To address this question, we developed a strategy for selectively silencing CyD1 in leukocytes in vivo. Targeted stabilized nanoparticles (tsNPs) were loaded with CyD1–small interfering RNA (siRNA). Antibodies to β 7 integrin (β 7 I) were then used to target specific leukocyte subsets involved in gut inflammation. Systemic application of β 7 I-tsNPs silenced CyD1 in leukocytes and reversed experimentally induced colitis in mice by suppressing leukocyte proliferation and T helper cell 1 cytokine expression. This study reveals CyD1 to be a potential anti-inflammatory target, and suggests that the application of similar modes of targeting by siRNA may be feasible in other therapeutic settings."

Here we present the crystal structures of the complete set of type I (IL-4R alpha/gamma(c)/IL-4) and type II (IL-4R alpha/IL-13R alpha1/IL-4, IL-4R alpha/IL-13R alpha1/IL-13) ternary signaling complexes. The type I complex reveals a structural basis for gamma(c)'s ability to recognize six different gamma(c)-cytokines. The two type II complexes utilize an unusual top-mounted Ig-like domain on IL-13R alpha1 for a novel mode of cytokine engagement that contributes to a reversal in the IL-4 versus IL-13 ternary complex assembly sequences, which are mediated through substantially different recognition chemistries. We also show that the type II receptor heterodimer signals with different potencies in response to IL-4 versus IL-13 and suggest that the extracellular cytokine-receptor interactions are modulating intracellular membrane-proximal signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W2064081765,"Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a congenital disorder of craniofacial development arising from mutations in TCOF1, which encodes the nucleolar phosphoprotein Treacle. Haploinsufficiency of Tcof1 perturbs mature ribosome biogenesis, resulting in stabilization of p53 and the cyclin G1-mediated cell-cycle arrest that underpins the specificity of neuroepithelial apoptosis and neural crest cell hypoplasia characteristic of TCS. Here we show that inhibition of p53 prevents cyclin G1-driven apoptotic elimination of neural crest cells while rescuing the craniofacial abnormalities associated with mutations in Tcof1 and extending life span. These improvements, however, occur independently of the effects on ribosome biogenesis; thus suggesting that it is p53-dependent neuroepithelial apoptosis that is the primary mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of TCS. Our work further implies that neuroepithelial and neural crest cells are particularly sensitive to cellular stress during embryogenesis and that suppression of p53 function provides an attractive avenue for possible clinical prevention of TCS craniofacial birth defects and possibly those of other neurocristopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2139867317,"Quiescent adult stem cells reside in specialized niches where they become activated to proliferate and differentiate during tissue homeostasis and injury. How stem cell quiescence is governed is poorly understood. We report here that NFATc1 is preferentially expressed by hair follicle stem cells in their niche, where its expression is activated by BMP signaling upstream and it acts downstream to transcriptionally repress CDK4 and maintain stem cell quiescence. As stem cells become activated during hair growth, NFATc1 is downregulated, relieving CDK4 repression and activating proliferation. When calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling is suppressed, pharmacologically or via complete or conditional NFATc1 gene ablation, stem cells are activated prematurely, resulting in precocious follicular growth. Our findings may explain why patients receiving cyclosporine A for immunosuppressive therapy display excessive hair growth, and unveil a functional role for calcium-NFATc1-CDK4 circuitry in governing stem cell quiescence."

In motor cortex, the laminar organization of cortical circuits has not been resolved, although their input-output operations are crucial for motor control. Here, we developed a general approach for estimating layer-specific connectivity in cortical circuits and applied it to mouse motor cortex. From these data we computed a laminar presynaptic --> postsynaptic connectivity matrix, W(post,pre), revealing a complement of stereotypic pathways dominated by layer 2 outflow to deeper layers. Network modeling predicted, and experiments with disinhibited slices confirmed, that stimuli targeting upper, but not lower, cortical layers effectively evoked network-wide events. Thus, in motor cortex, descending excitation from a preamplifier-like network of upper-layer neurons drives output neurons in lower layers.

Furthermore, cathepsin K –/– mice were resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Pharmacological inhibition or targeted disruption of cathepsin K resulted in defective Toll-like receptor 9 signaling in dendritic cells in response to unmethylated CpG DNA, which in turn led to attenuated induction of T helper 17 cells, without affecting the antigen-presenting ability of dendritic cells.

Protein O-glucosylation is a rare modification that occurs on EGF repeats of a few proteins including coagulation factors VII and IX, protein Z, Delta-like protein, and Thrombospondin (Shao et al., 2002Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.

Even though an enzymatic activity able to O-glucosylate EGF repeats is present in cell extracts from a variety of species (Shao et al., 2002Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. O-glycosylation of EGF repeats: identification and initial characterization of a UDP-glucose: protein O-glucosyltransferase.Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), no specific protein has been identified that O-glucosylates Notch or any other protein. Although Drosophila Notch carries 19 putative O-glucosylation sites, many of which are evolutionarily conserved (Haines and Irvine, 2003Haines N. Irvine K.D. Glycosylation regulates Notch signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, Moloney et al., 2000bMoloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R.

We have isolated a gene named rumi that causes a temperature-sensitive (ts) loss of bristles. Loss of rumi affects Notch signaling in all tissues tested. rumi encodes a soluble, ER protein with a CAP10 domain, which is involved in capsule formation and virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans (Chang and Kwon-Chung, 1999Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Isolation, characterization, and localization of a capsule-associated gene, CAP10, of Cryptococcus neoformans.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5636-5643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rumi has highly conserved homologs in species from yeast to human, but its role is unknown (Chang and Kwon-Chung, 1999Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Isolation, characterization, and localization of a capsule-associated gene, CAP10, of Cryptococcus neoformans.J.

Our data indicate that Rumi regulates Notch signaling by modifying Notch in the ER, and that Rumi is a protein O-glucosyltransferase (Poglut). We propose that lack of O-glucosylation of Notch in rumi mutants results in a ts defect in Notch folding and signaling. We performed a chemical mutagenesis screen to identify novel genes that affect adult bristle development (Jafar-Nejad et al., 2005Jafar-Nejad H. Andrews H.K. Acar M. Bayat V. Wirtz-Peitz F. Mehta S.Q. Knoblich J.A. Bellen H.J. Sec15, a component of the exocyst, promotes notch signaling during the asymmetric division of Drosophila sensory organ precursors.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 351-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). One of the complementation groups, named rumi (after a 13th century poet), showed bristle loss in mitotic clones when raised at 25°C (Figure 1B). However, when grown at 18°C, mutant clones did not show bristle loss (Figure 1C) but exhibited an increase in bristle density, suggesting a mild lateral inhibition defect (Figure 1D). To determine the cause of bristle loss, we stained rumi pupae raised at 25°C or 18°C for Cut, a protein that marks the nuclei of all cells of sensory clusters, and for ELAV, which marks neurons. As shown in Figures 1E and 1E′, all cells in a rumi sensory cluster raised at 25°C express ELAV, indicating a Notch-like cell-fate specification defect. However, rumi pupae raised at 18°C contain a single neuron in each sensory cluster (Figures 1F and 1F′), similar to wild-type (wt) pupae. To provide a more direct link between rumi and Notch signaling, we performed genetic interaction experiments. Some rumi mutant animals reach adulthood at 25°C. These flies show a severe loss of microchaetae (Figure 1G). Adding one copy of Notch+ restores most microchaetae at 25°C, indicating that the phenotype is sensitive to Notch dosage (Figure 1H). When raised at 18°C, rumi mutant animals do not show a bristle loss (Figure 1I), but removing a copy of Notch in these females results in a loss of microchaetae (Figure 1J). These data indicate that increasing the temperature results in a worsening of the Notch phenotype in rumi animals. Indeed, a complete loss of microchaetae in rumi animals raised at 29°C during early pupal stage cannot be rescued with an additional copy of Notch (Figure S1 available online). To demonstrate that rumi affects lateral inhibition, we performed temperature shift experiments. Pupae harboring rumi clones were raised at room temperature, shifted to 28°C during lateral inhibition, and shifted back to 18°C during the asymmetric divisions (Figure 1K). Under this regimen, flies show a large excess of sensory bristles in mutant clones (Figure 1K). Hence, rumi regulates Notch signaling during lateral inhibition and asymmetric divisions of sensory precursors. As shown in Figures 2A–2D, embryos lacking maternal and zygotic Rumi raised at 28°C have a neurogenic phenotype, similar to Notch embryos. Clonal analysis in the wing showed that “inductive signaling” (Lai, 2004Lai E.C. Notch signaling: control of cell communication and cell fate.Development. 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) is also affected (Figure 2F, asterisks; Figures 2G–2J′). Moreover, genetic studies reveal a strong dosage-sensitive interaction between rumi and Delta in wing, eye, and leg development (Figures 2K–2M and S2). These data indicate that Rumi is a general regulator of Notch signaling. We mapped rumi to CG31152 (Figure 3A) (Zhai et al., 2003Zhai R.G. Hiesinger P.R. Koh T.W. Verstreken P. Schulze K.L. Cao Y. Jafar-Nejad H. Norga K.K. Pan H. Bayat V. et al.Mapping Drosophila mutations with molecularly defined P element insertions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 10860-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which encodes a conserved protein (Figure 3C) with a signal peptide, a CAP10 domain, and a C-terminal KDEL ER-retention motif (Figure 3B). Allele 44 contains an in-frame deletion and allele 79 harbors a missense mutation, G189E (Figure 3B). All homo- and transheterozygous combinations of these alleles in combination with Df(3R)Exel6192 produce viable progeny and exhibit a ts Notch phenotype. The temperature sensitivity of the rumi alleles may be due to an abnormal Rumi protein that fails to function at high temperatures. Alternatively, rumi's neighbor, CG31139 (Figure 3A)—the only other fly gene encoding a CAP10 domain protein—may compensate in part for the lack of rumi, resulting in a ts phenotype. We therefore excised P element EY00249 inserted 238 bp upstream of CG31152 (Bellen et al., 2004Bellen H.J. Levis R.W. Liao G. He Y. Carlson J.W. Tsang G. Evans-Holm M. Hiesinger P.R. Schulze K.L. Rubin G.M. et al.The BDGP gene disruption project: single transposon insertions associated with 40% of Drosophila genes.Genetics. 2004; 167: 761-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). All deletions generated by imprecise excisions lack most of the rumi ORF (Figure 3A), and an antibody raised against Rumi failed to detect the protein in Δ26/Δ26 animals, indicating that Δ26 is a null allele (Figure 3D). All allelic combinations exhibit the ts phenotype and can be rescued with a UAS-CG31152 or a genomic transgene only containing CG31152 (Figure 3E and data not shown). These data indicate that the partner of rumi (CG31139) is not redundant. Hence, loss of CG31152 is the cause of the loss-of-function phenotypes of rumi mutants and Rumi regulates a ts aspect of Notch signaling. To assess whether rumi is required in the signal-sending and/or receiving cell, we used the MARCM system (Lee and Luo, 2001Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) for Drosophila neural development.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 251-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) to overexpress Delta, Serrate, and Notch in rumi clones (28°C). If Rumi is essential for Delta or Serrate to induce Notch signaling in the neighboring cells, then expression of Delta and Serrate should not be able to induce Cut expression in cells along the border of the MARCM clones, as reported for epsin mutations (Wang and Struhl, 2004Wang W. Struhl G. Drosophila Epsin mediates a select endocytic pathway that DSL ligands must enter to activate Notch.Development. 2004; 131: 5367-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures S3A–S3B′, overexpression of Delta or Serrate in rumi clones results in expression of Cut, suggesting that the signal-sending cell does not require Rumi. Moreover, wing imaginal discs harboring rumi clones raised at 28°C and stained with anti-Delta or anti-Serrate show no alteration in the expression of these proteins (Figures S3C–S3D′). These data argue against a role for Rumi in the signal-sending cell and against a requirement for rumi for the function of Delta or Serrate. To assess the function of Rumi in the signal-receiving cell, we performed similar experiments with full-length Notch (NFL). When overexpressed in clones homozygous for a wt chromosome, NFL induces Cut expression in proximity of the wing margin (Figures 4A and 4A′) , as reported (Sasamura et al., 2003Sasamura T. Sasaki N. Miyashita F. Nakao S. Ishikawa H.O. Ito M. Kitagawa M. Harigaya K. Spana E. Bilder D. et al.neurotic, a novel maternal neurogenic gene, encodes an O-fucosyltransferase that is essential for Notch-Delta interactions.Development. 2003; 130: 4785-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, NFL failed to induce Cut expression in rumi clones (Figures 4B and 4B′). These observations indicate a requirement for Rumi in signal-receiving cells. Binding of ligands to the NECD induces S2 cleavage of Notch by ADAM/TACE/Kuzbanian proteases (Brou et al., 2000Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A.

Young M.W. kuzbanian-mediated cleavage of Drosophila Notch.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This generates an active membrane-bound form of Notch, which undergoes S3 cleavage mediated by Presenilin and its binding partners (De Strooper, 2003De Strooper B. Aph-1, Pen-2, and Nicastrin with Presenilin generate an active gamma-Secretase complex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, Struhl and Greenwald, 1999Struhl G. Greenwald I. Presenilin is required for activity and nuclear access of Notch in Drosophila.Nature. 1999; 398: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). To refine the step in the Notch transduction cascade in which Rumi is required, we overexpressed a membrane-bound, active version of Notch called NECN (Struhl et al., 1993Struhl G. Fitzgerald K. Greenwald I. Intrinsic activity of the Lin-12 and Notch intracellular domains in vivo.Cell. 1993; 74: 331-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) in rumi clones raised at 28°C and observed a robust induction of downstream targets (Figures 4C and 4C′). Since the activity of NECN depends on the Presenilin function, these data place the function of rumi upstream of the S3 cleavage of Notch in the signal-receiving cell and suggest that the NECD is the target of Rumi. To address if Notch processing is impaired in rumi mutants, we performed western blots by using an anti-NICD antibody (Hu et al., 2002Hu Y. Ye Y. Fortini M.E. Nicastrin is required for gamma-secretase cleavage of the Drosophila Notch receptor.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Pan and Rubin, 1997Pan D. Rubin G.M. Kuzbanian controls proteolytic processing of Notch and mediates lateral inhibition during Drosophila and vertebrate neurogenesis.Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Reduction of Kuzbanian (Kuz) or Presenilin function alters the pattern of the Notch cleavage products detected by western blots of protein extracts prepared in a hypotonic, detergent-free lysis buffer. We tested protein extracts from wing discs and brains of late third instar wt and rumi mutant larvae reared at 18°C. One set was shifted to 28°C (third instars), whereas the other set was maintained at 18°C for 10 hr. The Notch cleavage product was detectable in wing disc extracts of both wt and rumi larvae kept at 18°C (see arrow in Figure 4D) but not in wing disc extracts of rumi mutants at 28°C (Figure 4D). Note that the full-length Notch protein serves as an internal control for protein loading. This is similar to what has been observed in wing discs that express a dominant-negative form of kuz (Pan and Rubin, 1997Pan D. Rubin G.M. Kuzbanian controls proteolytic processing of Notch and mediates lateral inhibition during Drosophila and vertebrate neurogenesis.Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Defects in Notch processing were also observed in brain extracts (Figure 4D). These results provide strong evidence that the rumi function is important for Notch processing. We also performed RNAi experiments in Drosophila S2 cells raised at 28°C. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rumi or Kuz results in loss of the upper cleavage product (Figure 4E, arrow) normally observed in wt and control cells. Adding a Furin inhibitor does not alter the cleavage product pattern, consistent with the observation that the Furin-mediated S1 cleavage is not required for Notch signaling in flies (Kidd and Lieber, 2002Kidd S. Lieber T. Furin cleavage is not a requirement for Drosophila Notch function.Mech. Dev. 2002; 115: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that Rumi is required for the function of Kuz at the restrictive temperature. Our data indicate that Rumi is retained in the ER by its C-terminal KDEL sequence and that ER retention is required for the function of Rumi in vivo (Supplemental Data and Figure S4) and that Rumi is required for proper folding of the NECD. Loss of Rumi may lead to accumulation of Notch in the ER or an inability of Notch to be recognized by proteins like Fringe, Delta, Serrate, or Kuz. Indeed, staining of third instar discs with anti-NECD shows an accumulation of Notch in rumi clones raised at 25°C but not at 18°C (Figures 5A–5B′). This increase is not due to an increase in Notch transcription (Figure S5). To examine the subcellular localization of Notch in rumi clones, we stained with an α-NICD antibody. Notch accumulates throughout the cell in a cell-autonomous manner in rumi mutant cells (Figures 5C and 5C′). To ensure that rumi mutations do not disrupt apical-basal polarity, we examined the distribution of adherens junction marker E-Cadherin (Tepass et al., 1996Tepass U. Gruszynski-DeFeo E. Haag T.A.

Obtaining stably attenuated vaccine strains has traditionally been an empirical process, which greatly restricts the number of effective vaccines for viral diseases. Here we describe a rational approach for engineering stably attenuated viruses that can serve as safe and effective vaccines. Our approach exploits the observation that restricting viral population diversity by increasing replication fidelity greatly reduces viral tissue tropism and pathogenicity. We show that poliovirus variants with reduced genetic diversity elicit a protective immune response in an animal model of infection. Indeed, these novel vaccine candidates are comparable in efficacy to the currently available Sabin type 1 vaccine strain, but have the added advantage of being more stable, as their increased replication fidelity prevents reversion to the pathogenic wild-type phenotype. We propose that restricting viral quasispecies diversity provides a general approach for the rational design of stable, attenuated vaccines for a wide variety of viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2148807789,"Maintenance of chromosomal stability relies on coordination between various processes that are critical for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis. Here we show that monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) kinase, which is essential for the mitotic checkpoint, also controls correction of improper chromosome attachments. We report that Borealin/DasraB, a member of the complex that regulates the Aurora B kinase, is directly phosphorylated by Mps1 on residues that are crucial for Aurora B activity and chromosome alignment. As a result, cells lacking Mps1 kinase activity fail to efficiently align chromosomes due to impaired Aurora B function at centromeres, leaving improper attachments uncorrected. Strikingly, Borealin/DasraB bearing phosphomimetic mutations restores Aurora B activity and alignment in Mps1-depleted cells. Mps1 thus coordinates attachment error correction and checkpoint signaling, two crucial responses to unproductive chromosome attachments."

https://openalex.org/W2104979060,"DNA damage results in activation or suppression of transcription of a large number of genes. Transcriptional activation has been well characterized in the context of sequence-specific DNA-bound activators, whereas mechanisms of transcriptional suppression are largely unexplored. We show here that DNA damage rapidly reduces histone H3 Threonine 11 (T11) phosphorylation. This correlates with repression of genes, including cyclin B1 and cdk1. H3-T11 phosphorylation occurs throughout the cell cycle and is Chk1 dependent in vivo. Following DNA damage, Chk1 undergoes rapid chromatin dissociation, concomitant with reduced H3-T11 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we find that loss of H3-T11 phosphorylation correlates with reduced binding of the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 at cyclin B1 and cdk1 promoters and reduced H3-K9 acetylation. We propose a mechanism for Chk1 as a histone kinase, responsible for DNA-damage-induced transcriptional repression by loss of histone acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2024301095,"Copper plays a fundamental role in regulating cell growth. Many types of human cancer tissues have higher copper levels than normal tissues. Copper can also induce gene expression. However, transcription factors that mediate copper-induced cell proliferation have not been identified in mammals. Here we show that antioxidant-1 (Atox1), previously appreciated as a copper chaperone, represents a novel copper-dependent transcription factor that mediates copper-induced cell proliferation. Stimulation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with copper markedly increased cell proliferation, cyclin D1 expression, and entry into S phase, which were completely abolished in Atox1(-/-) MEFs. Promoter analysis and EMSA revealed that copper stimulates the Atox1 binding to a previously undescribed cis element in the cyclin D1 promoter. The ChIP assay confirms that copper stimulates Atox1 binding to the DNA in vivo. Transfection of Atox1 fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 demonstrated a copper-dependent transactivation in various cell types, including endothelial and cancer cells. Furthermore, Atox1 translocated to the nucleus in response to copper through its highly conserved C-terminal KKTGK motif and N-terminal copper-binding sites. Finally, the functional role of nuclear Atox1 is demonstrated by the observation that re-expression of nuclear-targeted Atox1 in Atox1(-/-) MEFs rescued the defective copper-induced cell proliferation. Thus, Atox1 functions as a novel transcription factor that, when activated by copper, undergoes nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transactivation, thereby contributing to cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2093797379,"Numerous cell surface receptors, including tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors, play critical roles in endothelial cell function and blood vessel development. These receptors share the ability of stimulating an intricate network of intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of members of the Ras and Rho family of small GTPases. However, the contribution of these signaling molecules to the numerous biological activities performed by endothelial cells is still not fully understood. Here, we have used a conditional Cre/Flox approach, enabling the deletion of the Rac1 gene in endothelial cells, to examine the role of the Rho-related GTPase Rac1 in endothelial cell function and vascular development. Rac1 excision in primary endothelial cells in vitro revealed that Rac1 plays a central role in endothelial cell migration, tubulogenesis, adhesion, and permeability in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is likely due to the inability of Rac1-deficient endothelial cells to form lamellipodial structures and focal adhesions, and to remodel their cell-cell contacts. Importantly, endothelial-specific excision of Rac1 results in embryonic lethality in midgestation (around E9.5), and defective development of major vessels and complete lack of small branched vessels was readily observed in these endothelial Rac1-deficient embryos and their yolk sacs. These findings provide direct evidence that the activity of Rac1 in endothelial cells is essential for vascular development and suggest that Rac1 and its downstream targets may represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of numerous human diseases that involve aberrant neovascularization."

We present a structure-derived model for dual GTPase membrane attachment that highlights the potential ability of Rab GTPases to reach binding partners at a significant distance from the membrane via their unstructured and membrane-anchored, hypervariable domains. Vesicle-mediated transport between membrane bound compartments is essential for protein secretion, cell signaling and cell growth. Transport involves the collection of specific cargo molecules into vesicles, movement of vesicles by motors along cytoskeletal tracks, and tethering, docking and fusion of vesicles at the target membrane (Pfeffer, 1999Pfeffer S.R. Transport-vesicle targeting: tethers before SNAREs.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). GTPases of the Rab and Arf families play central roles in the regulation of these processes by recruiting specific partner (“effector”) proteins to the membranes upon which they are bound (Grosshans et al., 2006Grosshans B.L.

The GTPases interconvert between active, GTP bound forms that are capable of effector interactions, and inactive, GDP-bound forms; interconversion is catalyzed by GTPase-specific enzymes. Among GTPase effectors are proteins that have been demonstrated to function as transport vesicle tethers. Tethers function to bring partner membranes into close proximity before membrane fusion (Sztul and Lupashin, 2006Sztul E. Lupashin V. Role of tethering factors in secretory membrane traffic.Am. J.

GCC185 is a putative coiled-coil tether of 185 kDa that belongs to the Golgi-localized Golgin family of proteins. GCC185 is required for Rab9-dependent transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN; Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J.V. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I.G.

A recent study demonstrated that GCC185 is also required for the attachment of noncentrosomal microtubules to the TGN via CLASPs, proteins that stabilize microtubule plus ends and prolong their elongation from the TGN (Efimov et al., 2007Efimov A.

Since GCC185 is a key player in both membrane traffic and cytoskeletal organization, it is important to determine how GCC185 is localized to the TGN. GCC185 is one of four human Golgins (Golgin-245, Golgin-97, GCC88, and GCC185) that contain a GRIP domain. The ∼45 residue GRIP domain represents an Arl1 GTPase-binding unit and is sufficient to specify Golgi-targeting of Golgin-97 and Golgin-245 via Arl1 binding (Gillingham and Munro, 2007Gillingham A.K.

Surprisingly, despite its relatively well conserved GRIP domain, we and others found that GCC185 binds very poorly to Arl1, and mutation of the invariant GRIP domain tyrosine residue interfered only weakly with GCC185's Golgi localization (Lu and Hong, 2003Lu L.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5865-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, attempts to re-localize GCC185 in cells expressing an early endosome-targeted Arl1 were not successful, despite efficient re-localization of Golgin-97 and Golgin-245 (Derby et al., 2004Derby M.C. van Vliet C. Brown D. Luke M.R. Lu L. Hong W. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. Mammalian GRIP domain proteins differ in their membrane binding properties and are recruited to distinct domains of the TGN.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5865-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggested that GCC185 is localized to the TGN by a mechanism that is distinct from that used by Golgin-245 and Golgin-97. In this study we define an independent Rab GTPase-binding site near the C terminus of GCC185. We show that Rab6 binds to this site and we present the three dimensional crystal structure of the Rab6:Rab-binding domain complex. Analysis of mutant proteins revealed that the Rab-binding domain regulates both Golgi association and Arl1 binding to the GCC185 GRIP domain. Thus, two members of distinct GTPase families cooperate to localize GCC185 to the Golgi. We tested the Golgi associated, Rab6 GTPase for its possible interaction with GCC185. Rab6 was an obvious candidate, as it localizes to the Golgi and both yeast (Ypt6p) and human proteins interact with several putative tethering proteins, including the yeast VFT/GARP complex (Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2001Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. An effector of Ypt6p binds the SNARE Tlg1p and mediates selective fusion of vesicles with late Golgi membranes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the yeast protein Sgm1 and its mammalian homolog, TMF (Fridmann-Sirkis et al., 2004Fridmann-Sirkis Y. Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. TMF is a golgin that binds Rab6 and influences Golgi morphology.BMC Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, there is strong genetic interaction between the genes encoding Ypt6p and the sole, yeast GRIP domain protein, Imh1p (Li and Warner, 1996Li B. Warner J.R. Mutation of the Rab6 homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, YPT6, inhibits both early Golgi function and ribosome biosynthesis.J. Biol.

For these experiments, a construct of GST fused to the GCC185 C terminus was employed that includes a ∼45 residue GRIP domain, plus ∼40 amino acids upstream of this domain and ∼20 amino acids that extend to the C terminus (C-110; Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1B (left panel), C-110 bound Rab6-GTP with a 5-fold preference over Rab6-GDP, which defines GCC185 as a Rab6 effector. This interaction was specific in that the C-110 fragment did not bind Rab1 (Figure 1C), Rab5 (Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J.V. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I.G. Nottingham R.M. Pfeffer S.R. A functional role for the GCC185 golgin in mannose 6-phosphate receptor trafficking.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or Arl1-GTP (Figure 1C) at comparable concentrations. However Arl1 binding is observed when a higher (approximately 3-fold) C-110 concentration is used (see below). A somewhat larger, 158 residue construct did not yield a higher bound fraction of Rab6 protein (data not shown), demonstrating that an entire Rab-binding site lies within the 110 C-terminal residues of GCC185. A specific, conserved GRIP domain tyrosine residue was previously shown to be critical for Arl1-binding and Golgi recruitment of Golgin-245 and Golgin-97 (Barr, 1999Barr F.A. A novel Rab6-interacting domain defines a family of Golgi-targeted coiled-coil proteins.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Kjer-Nielsen et al., 1999Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. A novel Golgi-localisation domain shared by a class of coiled-coil peripheral membrane proteins.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mutation of the corresponding tyrosine residue in GCC185 (Y1618A) had no influence on Rab6 (Figure 1C) or Rab9 binding (Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J.V. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I.G. Nottingham R.M. Pfeffer S.R. A functional role for the GCC185 golgin in mannose 6-phosphate receptor trafficking.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; Figure 1C), consistent with a different mode of interaction for Rabs with GCC185. As a construct comprised of the 72 C-terminal residues of GCC185 (C-72; Figure 1A) failed to bind Rab6 or Rab9 (Figure 1C), we conclude that the GRIP domain is dispensible for Rab binding. Residues just upstream of the GRIP domain (1575–1613; RBD in Figure 1A) comprise a Rab-binding domain. As shown in Figure 1B (right panel), the so-called RBD-87 polypeptide that includes this region but lacks the GRIP domain was sufficient for full Rab6 binding. In contrast, the RBD-87 construct bound only about 25% of Rab9 as compared to C-110 (Figure 1B, right panel), suggesting that Rab9 interacts at least in part with the GRIP domain. Interestingly, Rab6 and Rab9 C-terminal hypervariable domains contributed to GCC185 binding, as a chimeric Rab9 protein containing the hypervariable domain of Rab1 (Rab9/1; Aivazian et al., 2006Aivazian D. Serrano R.L. Pfeffer S. TIP47 is a key effector for Rab9 localization.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or a Rab6 construct lacking the hypervariable domain (Rab6 1–174) failed to bind C-110 (Figure 1C). Thus, residues 1575–1613 comprise a region in GCC185 that is necessary for Rab binding, and additional downstream sequences are needed for Rab9 but not Rab6. An anti-Rab9 immunoblot-based binding assay was used to test whether Rab6 and Rab9 compete for interaction with GCC185. Briefly, the C-110 fragment was incubated with Rab9, either alone or with excess Rab6 or Rab1. When a 10-fold excess Rab6 competitor was added to the preformed Rab9-GCC185 complex, Rab9 binding was reduced to background levels (Figure 1D, upper panel; compare lanes 7 and 8 with 5 and 6). An equal amount of Rab6 competitor decreased the Rab9-bound fraction to 50% (data not shown). In contrast, a ten-fold excess of Rab1 did not compete with Rab9 for GCC185 binding (Figure 1D, lanes 9 and 10). In addition, Rab9 could compete for Rab6 binding, although it was a less potent competitor (Figure 1D, lower panel). Thus, Rab6 and Rab9 compete for GCC185 binding both specifically and efficiently. Together, these data confirm that Rab6 and Rab9 bind to at least partially overlapping sites on GCC185. The binding affinities for GCC185 with Rab6 and Rab9 were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Figures S1A and S1B (available online) show representative, isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) raw data for nucleotide-preloaded, Rab6-GTP and Rab9-GTP upon injection into a cell containing GST-C-110 (upper panels). Peak size was diminished with each injection as the binding reaction reached saturation. As expected, titrations of Rab6-GTP and Rab9-GTP into buffer (upper-panel insets) or into GST (lower panel insets) resulted in heats comparable to baseline values in the GCC185 binding reaction. The affinities of C-110 for Rab6-GTP and Rab9-GTP are 2.3 ± 0.3 μM SD and 4.5 ± 1.2 μM SD, respectively, with equimolar stoichiometry. Since GST-C-110 is dimeric as determined by gel filtration in conjunction with multiple angle light scattering (data not shown), we conclude that the Rab6/Rab9:C-110 complexes have 2:2 stoichiometry in solution. Structure prediction of the GCC185 C terminus using the Paircoil algorithm (Berger et al., 1995Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Predicting coiled coils by use of pairwise residue correlations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) revealed a short dimeric, coiled coil that precisely spans the Rab-binding domain (shaded area, Figure 2A). This region and the GRIP domain were free of predicted unstructured loops (Linding et al., 2003Linding R. Jensen L.J. Diella F. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Russell R.B. Protein disorder prediction: implications for structural proteomics.Structure. 2003; 11: 1453-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar; Figure 2A). In addition, flexible regions were detected downstream of the GRIP domain (∼20 residues), and spanning ∼40 residues upstream of residue 1527 (Figure 2A). The RBD-87 Rab-binding domain-containing polypeptide (Figure 1A and top of Figure 2A) was predicted to be ∼33% helical by the coiled-coil prediction algorithm. The α-helix content of the RBD-87 polypeptide was determined by circular dichroism to be 40% (Figure 2B). Gel filtration coupled to direct mass measurement by multiple angle static light scattering showed that untagged RBD-87 eluted in a single peak, with a mass of 21.9 kDa, and is therefore a dimer (Figure 2C). Consistent with this finding, chemical crosslinking of RBD-87 yielded efficient conversion to a dimer in solution (Figure 2D). Full-length GCC185 is also dimeric (Luke et al., 2005Luke M.R. Houghton F. Perugini M.A. Gleeson P.A. The trans-Golgi network GRIP-domain proteins form α-helical homodimers.Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), consistent with the RBD-87 polypeptide forming a helical dimer. A helical wheel projection of the predicted coiled coil spanning the Rab-binding domain identified the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic helix, with residues at heptad positions ‘a’ and ‘d’ expected to reside at the interface of a dimeric coiled coil (Harbury et al., 1993Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. A switch between two-, three-, and four-stranded coiled coils in GCN4 leucine zipper mutants.Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar; Figure 3A). Close inspection of the hydrophilic surface revealed two hydrophobic residues (I1588 and L1595), both at heptad position (‘c’), that would be solvent-exposed if this model is correct (residues boxed in Figure 3A). Such residues were outstanding candidates to mediate hydrophobic protein-protein interactions. I1588 and L1595 were therefore mutated to alanine within the C-110 polypeptide; binding of these mutant proteins to Rab6 and Rab9 was then tested. The I1588A mutant bound ∼50% less to Rab9 than its wild-type counterpart (Figure 3B). The L1595A mutation abolished Rab9 binding completely; a double mutant was also binding incompetent, as expected. I1588 and L1595 were also critical for Rab6 binding (Figure 3C). The I1588A mutant showed slightly less (14%) binding than the wild-type polypeptide; L1595A was decreased about 50%, and the double mutant was the most severely impaired (88%). Because the double mutant was more impaired than either single mutant, we conclude that both residues contribute to a Rab-binding interface. The lower affinity of Rab9 for the C-110 fragment (Figure S1) may explain why Rab9 is more sensitive to mutations at these positions. Dimer formation was not disrupted in the RBD-87 I1588A/L1595A protein, as it behaved as a 20.4 kDa, mono-disperse dimer upon gel filtration and multiple angle static light scattering (Figure 3D), nearly identical to wild-type RBD-87 (Figure 2C). In addition, untagged C-110 I1588A/L1595A yielded a circular dichroism spectrum that was indistinguishable from its wild-type counterpart (data not shown), thus the mutant protein did not appear to be misfolded. Together, these data confirm that Rab9 and Rab6 overlap in their interaction with a coiled-coil Rab-binding domain in GCC185. The complex of human GCC185 (residues 1547-1612) and the constitutively active mutant of Rab6 (Q72L) was crystallized in the presence of GTP and Mg2+ (Table 1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of GTP-bound Rab6 (Bergbrede et al., 2005Bergbrede T. Pylypenko O. Rak A. Alexandrov A. Structure of the extremely slow GTPase Rab6A in the GTP bound form at 1.8 resolution.J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; PDB ID 2gil) as the search model. A large portion of the Rab-binding domain of GCC185 was clearly visible in difference electron density maps, allowing unambiguous placement of sidechains at the binding interface (Figure S2). The sidechain register was verified with an anomalous difference Fourier map of selenomethionine substituted GCC185 in complex with Rab6 (Figure 4B). The final model refined to Rfree = 26.8 and R = 22.8 at dmin = 3 Å (Table 1); it includes Rab6 residues 14–174, GCC185 residues 1570–1607, bound GTP and Mg2+.Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsNative (PDB ID 3BBP)Seleno-MethionineData CollectionSpace groupP6422P6422Unit Cella (Å)168.6167.4c (Å)169.0167.6Stoichiometry in asymmetric unit3 Rab6:3 GCC1853 Rab6:3 GCC185X-ray sourceSSRL beamline 7-1SSRL beamline 11-1DetectorADSC Q315Marmosaic 325Wavelength (Å)0.97850.9791Resolution range (Å)50–3.050–3.4dmin (I/σ > = 2[Å])3.23.6Completeness (%)99.799.9Rmerge (%)25.022.6I/σ (highest resolution shell)10.1 (0.5)10.3 (0.8)Refinement StatisticsRwork/Rfree (%)22.8/26.8Rmsd bond length (Å)0.003Rmsd bond angles (°)0.46NCS rmsd (Å, Rab6)0.36NCS rmsd (Å, GCC185)0.5% residues in Ramachandran: Most favored region90.7 Additionally allowed8.7 Generously allowed0.7 Disallowed0CrystallizationMethodVapor diffusion at 20°C.

Each GCC185 helix bridges two opposing Rab6 molecules (Figure 4B), and conversely, each Rab6 molecule interacts with both helices that comprise the coiled coil. This strongly suggests that Rab binding will stabilize a dimeric GCC185 structure. Extensive contacts comprise a buried interface of 1250 Å2 for a single Rab6 with the GCC185 dimer. For comparison, a similar area is buried in the single Arl1:GRIP dimer interface (PDB ID 1UPT; 1310 Å2; our calculations). As expected from the nucleotide dependence of Rab interaction (Figure 1), the Rab-binding interface is contributed by switch I and II regions (Figure 4) whose different conformations in the GDP and GTP bound forms primarily reflect the state of the GTPase on its surface (Stroupe and Brunger, 2000Stroupe C. Brunger A.T. Crystal structures of a Rab protein in its inactive and active conformations.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Gratifyingly, the two GCC185 hydrophobic residues required for Rab binding (I1588 and L1595, Figure 3) are part of the interface between Rab6 and the GCC185 Rab-binding domain (Figure 4B, bold; Figure S3). Moreover, two of the three invariant, hydrophobic triad residues of Rabs (F50, W67, and Y82) proposed to be important for Rab:effector interactions (Merithew et al., 2001Merithew E. Hatherly S. Dumas J.J. Lawe D.C. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D.G. Structural plasticity of an invariant hydrophobic triad in the switch regions of Rab GTPases is a determinant of effector recognition.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13982-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) interact directly with I1588 (Figure S3), and the third residue also contacts GCC185. No major conformational changes of Rab6 are observed upon binding to GCC185; Rab6-GTP (Bergbrede et al., 2005Bergbrede T. Pylypenko O. Rak A. Alexandrov A. Structure of the extremely slow GTPase Rab6A in the GTP bound form at 1.8 resolution.J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; PDB ID 2gil) superimposes with Rab6 in our complex with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.55 Å. This is in contrast to the complexes of Rab11:FIP3 (Eathiraj et al., 2006Eathiraj S. Mishra A. Prekeris R. Lambright D.G. Structural basis for Rab11-medated recruitment of FIP3 to recycling endosomes.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Sec4p:Sec2p (Dong et al., 2007Dong G. Medkova M. Novick P. Reinisch K.M. A catalytic coiled-coil: structural insights into the activation of the Rab GTPase Sec4 by Sec2p.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 455-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) where Rab binding to the coiled-coil domains induces major conformational changes in the Rabs. To explore the importance of Rab-binding determinants in GCC185 localization, we expressed wild-type or I1588A/L1595A, C-110 proteins in cultured cells and monitored their localization. Myc-tagged, wild-type C-110 was localized to the Golgi complex as determined by its co-localization with Rab6 protein by confocal microscopy (Figures 5A and 5D). In contrast, the C-110 I1588A/L1595A protein that did not bind Rab6 or Rab9 in vitro (Figures 3B and 3C) failed to localize to the Golgi complex (Figures 5A and 5D). As expected, exogenously expressed, full-length GCC185 was Golgi localized (Figure 5A, top far-right); in contrast, full-length GCC185 containing the I1588A/L1595A substitutions was not (Figure 5A, bottom far-right). The requirement for residues I1588 and L1595 in Golgi localization showed that Rab-binding domain-determinants dominate the Golgi association process. Consistent with this, a myc-tagged fragment (“C-82”) comprised of the 82 C-terminal-most residues of GCC185 (and lacking I1588 and L1595) also failed to associate with the Golgi complex (Figure 5B middle panel), in contrast to C-110 under identical conditions (Figure 5B, left). All transfected cells counted (n = 100) displayed these phenotypes. This differs from a report of Luke et al., 2003Luke M.R. Kjer-Nielsen L. Brown D.L. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. GRIP domain-mediated targeting of two new coiled-coil proteins, GCC88 and GCC185, to subcompartments of the trans-Golgi network.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4216-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar who showed Golgi localization of a similar, GFP-tagged construct. The two studies likely differ because of expression levels (see below). As shown in Figure 5C, loss of Rab6 (but not Rab9) using siRNA abolished the Golgi localization of the wild-type C-110 fragment. Quantitation showed that > 80% of depleted cells displayed this phenotype (Figure 5D). These data demonstrate that Rab6 is important for Golgi association of GCC185. Although not sufficient, the GRIP domain in C-82 could still participate in Golgi association. Thus, we tested localization of C-110 Y1618A, which is predicted to not bind Arl1. C-110 Y1618A was less concentrated on the Golgi than wild-type C110 (Figure 5B, right), suggesting that the GRIP domain also contributes to Golgi localization. Indeed, siRNA depletion of Arl1 confirmed a requirement for this GTPase in C-110 localization in living cells (Figure 5C). As expected, Golgin-97 and Golgin-245 also lost Golgi association in Arl1 depleted cells (Figure S4), however global TGN organization remained intact as determined by TGN46 localization (Figure S4). Yet the Y1618A mutation did not completely abolish Golgi localization, from which we conclude that C-110 associates predominantly via Rab-binding domain interactions. The localization studies strongly suggested that both Rab-binding and GRIP domains contribute to GCC185 localization. Yet initial binding experiments failed to detect Arl1 binding to the GCC185 GRIP domain (Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J.V. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I.G. Nottingham R.M. Pfeffer S.R. A functional role for the GCC185 golgin in mannose 6-phosphate receptor trafficking.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; Figure 1C). We therefore explored the possibility that Rab association with GCC185 may promote Arl1 binding. Untagged Arl1 GTPase was preloaded with radioactive GTP and desalted to remove unbound nucleotide. Arl1 was then incubated with increasing concentrations of the GST-C-110 fragment, in the presence or absence of Rab6 or Rab9-GTPγS; GST-C-110-bound Arl1 was measured directly in a scintillation counter. Addition of Rab6 enhanced the ability of GCC185 to bind Arl1 (Figure 6A). In reactions containing < 5 μM C-110 polypeptide, very low levels of Arl1 binding were detected, as shown earlier (Figure 1C; Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J.V. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I.G.

For comparison, the GRIP domain of Golgin 245 binds efficiently at 2 μM C-110 (cf. Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J.V. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I.G. Nottingham R.M. Pfeffer S.R. A func"

https://openalex.org/W2115507762,"Advanced cancers acquire resistance to chemotherapy, and this results in treatment failure. The cellular mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance are not well understood. Here, for the first time, we show that ceramide contributes to cellular resistance to doxorubicin through up-regulating the gene expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS). Ceramide, a cellular lipid messenger, modulates doxorubicin-induced cell death. GCS catalyzes ceramide glycosylation, converting ceramide to glucosylceramide; this process hastens ceramide clearance and limits ceramide-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we evaluated the role of the GCS gene in doxorubicin resistance using several paired wild-type and drug-resistant (doxorubicin-selected) cancer cell lines, including breast, ovary, cervical, and colon. GCS was overexpressed in all drug-resistant counterparts, and suppressing GCS overexpression using antisense oligonucleotide restored doxorubicin sensitivity. Characterizing the effect mechanism showed that doxorubicin exposure increased ceramide levels, enhanced GCS expression, and imparted cellular resistance. Exogenous C(6)-ceramide and sphingomyelinase treatments mimicked the influence of doxorubicin on GCS, activating the GCS promoter and up-regulating GCS gene expression. Fumonisin B(1), an inhibitor of ceramide synthesis, significantly suppressed doxorubicin-up-regulated GCS expression. Promoter truncation, point mutation, gel-shift, and protein-DNA ELISA analysis showed that transcription factor Sp1 was essential for ceramide-induced GCS up-regulation. These data indicate that ceramide-governed GCS gene expression drives cellular resistance to doxorubicin."

TGF-beta is a potent inducer of lung fibrosis, and it regulates the ATII cell phenotype; however, direct TGF-beta target genes controlling the ATII cell phenotype remain elusive. Here, we identified the transgelin (tagln) gene as a novel immediate target of TGF-beta/Smad3-dependent gene expression in ATII cells using a Smad3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) screen. Direct ChIP confirmed the rapid and specific binding of Smad3 to the tagln promoter. Luciferase assays demonstrated transactivation of the tagln promoter by activin-like kinase (Alk) 5-mediated TGF-beta signaling. TGF-beta treatment resulted in rapid up-regulation of tagln, but not tagln2, mRNA and protein expression, assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. In vivo, tagln expression was significantly increased in ATII cells of mice during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, as well as in lung specimen obtained from IPF patients, as assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of tagln using siRNA inhibited TGF-beta-induced migration of lung epithelial A549 cells, as well as primary ATII cells. We thus identified tagln as a novel target of TGF-beta/Smad3-dependent gene expression in ATII cells. Increased ATII cell expression of tagln in experimental and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may contribute to TGF-beta-dependent ATII cell injury, repair, and migration in lung fibrosis."

Here we show how the interplay of protein and DNA activates TnpA, the Helicobacter pylori IS608 transposase, for catalysis. First, transposon end binding causes a conformational change that aligns catalytically important protein residues within the active site. Subsequent precise cleavage at the left and right ends, the steps that liberate the transposon from its donor site, does not involve a site-specific DNA-binding domain. Rather, cleavage site recognition occurs by complementary base pairing with a TnpA-bound subterminal transposon DNA segment. Thus, the enzyme active site is constructed from elements of both protein and DNA, reminiscent of the interdependence of protein and RNA in the ribosome. Our structural results explain why the transposon ends are asymmetric and how the transposon selects a target site for integration, and they allow us to propose a molecular model for the entire transposition reaction.

DNA transposition is a ubiquitous phenomenon occurring in all kingdoms of life during which discrete segments of DNA called transposons move from one genomic location to another. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, DNA transposition has been a significant part of evolution. Many eukaryotic genomes are littered with transposons or their inactive remnants (Lander et al., 2001Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. et al.Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16517) Google Scholar), primarily scattered between genes. In bacteria, transposable elements can carry antibiotic resistance genes and, when combined with conjugation, are major drivers of broad genome remodeling and the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. The discovery and engineering of DNA transposons active in vertebrate cells (Miskey et al., 2005Miskey C. Izsvák Z. Kawakami K. Ivics Z. DNA transposons in vertebrate functional genomics.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have led to their use in identifying oncogenes and tumor suppressors and characterizing genes of unknown function, through their ability to disrupt genes or regulatory regions. They also have exciting potential as gene delivery systems for gene therapy applications. A variety of structurally and mechanistically distinct transposase enzymes have evolved to carry out transposition by several different pathways (Curcio and Derbyshire, 2003Curcio M.J. Derbyshire K.M. The outs and ins of transposition: From Mu to kangaroo.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 1-13Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In all cases, these enzymes possess a nuclease activity that allows them to cleave DNA in order to excise transposon DNA which is subsequently spliced it into a new location. Depending on the system (Dyda et al., 1994Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R.

Whiteson K.L. Rice P.A. Mechanisms of site-specific recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 567-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), different types of nucleophiles can be used by transposases to cleave DNA by attacking a phosphorus atom of a backbone phosphate group: water, generally activated by enzyme-bound metal ions; a hydroxyl group at the 5′ or 3′ end of a DNA strand; or a hydroxyl-group bearing amino acid in the active site of the transposase itself, such as serine or tyrosine. When a catalytic serine or tyrosine is used, the enzyme becomes attached to DNA through a covalent phosphoserine or phosphotyrosine bond. One group of transposases that use catalytic tyrosines consists of the Y1 transposases (Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R. Guynet C. Ton-Hoang B. Perez Z.N. Ghirlando R. Chandler M. Dyda F.

These are members of a vast superfamily of nucleases characterized by a conserved His-hydrophobic-His (HUH) motif (Koonin and Ilyina, 1993Koonin E.V. Ilyina T.V. Computer-assisted dissection of rolling circle DNA replication.Biosystems. 1993; 30: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that provides two ligands to a divalent metal ion cofactor. HUH nucleases always cut a DNA strand with a polarity resulting in a 5′ phosphotyrosine linkage and a free 3′ OH group. In contrast to many HUH superfamily members, which are monomeric and have two catalytic tyrosines, Y1 transposases have only one catalytic tyrosine and form obligatory dimers (Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R.

We have recently determined the structure of a Y1 transposase from the insertion sequence IS608 (Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R. Guynet C. Ton-Hoang B. Perez Z.N. Ghirlando R. Chandler M. Dyda F.

Mukhopadhyay A.K. Ito Y. Cahuayme L. Parkinson A.J. Gilman R.H. Berg D.E.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 992-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a bacterium that causes gastric inflammation leading to ulcers and occasionally to stomach cancer. ISs are the simplest autonomous transposable elements. While they tend to be short (<2.5 kb) and carry only those genes needed for transposition, if placed flanking a DNA segment, many are able to mobilize the intervening genes (Mahillon and Chandler, 1998Mahillon J. Chandler M. Insertion sequences.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 725-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to dispersing antibiotic resistance genes, IS transposition can indirectly lead to antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. For example, a metronidazole-resistant strain of H. pylori has arisen because the nitroreductase gene needed for prodrug activation has been disrupted by an IS605-related transposition event (Debets-Ossenkopp et al., 1999Debets-Ossenkopp Y.J. Pot R.G.J. van Westerloo D.J. Goodwin A. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Berg D.E. Hoffman P.S. Kusters J.G. Insertion of mini-IS605 and deletion of adjacent sequences in the nitroreductase (rdxA) gene cause metronidazole resistance in Helicobacter pylor NCTC11637.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2657-2662PubMed Google Scholar). ISs can be classified into groups or families based on the general features of their DNA sequences and associated transposases (http://www-is.biotoul.fr). A particularly interesting family consists of the IS200/IS605 elements (Kersulyte et al., 2002Kersulyte D. Velapatino B. Dailide G. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Ito Y. Cahuayme L. Parkinson A.J. Gilman R.H. Berg D.E. Transposable element ISHp608 of Helicobacter pylori: nonrandom geographic distribution, functional organization, and insertion specificity.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 992-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which do not have inverted sequences at their ends characteristic of many prokaryotic and eukaryotic transposons. Rather, imperfect palindromic (IP) sequences are located close to the transposon ends (Figure 1A). In the case of one family member IS608, the left end (LE) and right end (RE) have almost identical IP sequences that form DNA stem loop structures (Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R. Guynet C. Ton-Hoang B. Perez Z.N. Ghirlando R. Chandler M. Dyda F. Active site sharing and subterminal hairpin recognition in a new class of DNA transposases.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these IPs are asymmetrically located: the IP at RE (IPRE) is closer to the RE cleavage site at the transposon end than the IP at LE (IPLE) is to the LE cleavage site, and the nucleotide sequences between the IPs and the cleavage sites at the two ends are unrelated (Figure 1A). Among IS608 copies from different H. pylori strains, the sequence between IPRE and the RE cleavage site is completely conserved, whereas it is variable between IPLE and the LE cleavage site. Another curious feature of IS200/IS605 family members is that, unlike many DNA transposons, which integrate essentially randomly, they always insert just 3′ of a specific four or five nucleotide (nt) sequence. The form of IS608 that is inserted is an excised circular intermediate (also known as a transposon junction) (Figure 1B) in which the RE is linked directly to the LE (Guynet et al., 2008Guynet C. Hickman A.B. Barabas O. Dyda F. Chandler M. Ton-Hoang B. Single-stranded transposition of IS608: In vitro reconstitution of a new transposition mechanism.Mol. Cell. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Upon excision, IS608 precisely reseals the gap left behind in the donor DNA, and insertion occurs without target site duplications (Ton-Hoang et al., 2005Ton-Hoang B. Guynet C. Ronning D.R. Cointin-Marty B. Dyda F. Chandler M. Transposition of ISHp608, member of an unusual family of bacterial insertion sequences.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3325-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, these seamless reactions proceed without loss or gain of nucleotides or the need for host cell DNA repair factors. All IS608 cleavage and rejoining steps are carried out by a single 155 amino acid transposase, TnpA (Guynet et al., 2008Guynet C. Hickman A.B. Barabas O. Dyda F. Chandler M. Ton-Hoang B. Single-stranded transposition of IS608: In vitro reconstitution of a new transposition mechanism.Mol. Cell. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the TnpA dimer, there are two active sites, assembled in trans, in which the tyrosine nucleophile of one monomer is near the HUH motif of the other. TnpA recognizes and cleaves only the top strand of each transposon end (Ton-Hoang et al., 2005Ton-Hoang B. Guynet C. Ronning D.R. Cointin-Marty B. Dyda F. Chandler M. Transposition of ISHp608, member of an unusual family of bacterial insertion sequences.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3325-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), resulting in yet another level of asymmetry: due to the conserved polarity of cleavage, after nucleophilic attack by the active site tyrosine on the phosphodiester backbone of DNA at LE, TnpA is covalently linked to the transposon 5′ end, whereas cleavage at RE results in the attachment of TnpA to flanking donor DNA (Figure 1B). We have previously shown how TnpA recognizes and pairs its transposon ends (Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R. Guynet C. Ton-Hoang B. Perez Z.N. Ghirlando R. Chandler M. Dyda F. Active site sharing and subterminal hairpin recognition in a new class of DNA transposases.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a necessary prelude to the cycle of coordinated DNA strand cleavage and rejoining steps that constitute transposition. Here, based on five different crystal structures of complexes between TnpA and various IS608 LE and RE sequences, and associated biochemical experiments, we describe the entire transposition cycle—activation of TnpA upon end binding, recognition of the cleavage sites at the very edges of the transposon, and target site selection—and the absolute dependence of these steps on the inherent asymmetry of the transposon ends. We have previously described the crystal structures of TnpA alone and complexed with a 22-mer hairpin (RE22) representing IPRE (Figure 2A; Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R. Guynet C. Ton-Hoang B.

Cell. 2005; 20: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). While these were informative, in both structures, the catalytic tyrosine, Y127, was tucked away from the HUH motif and hydrogen-bonded to S110, where it could not act as a nucleophile. As there are several crystal structures of HUH nucleases with fully assembled active sites (Guasch et al., 2003Guasch A. Lucas M. Moncalian G. Cabezas M. Perez-Luque R. Gomis-Ruth F.X. de la Cruz F.

Inter- and intramolecular determinants of the specificity of single-stranded DNA binding and cleavage by the F factor relaxase.Structure. 2005; 13: 1533-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it was clear that a conformational change was required. The other puzzling aspect of active site assembly was how the catalytically required metal ion would bind. In other HUH nuclease crystal structures, the metal cofactor (Mg2+ or Mn2+) is coordinated by three protein ligands: the two HUH histidines and either a third histidine or a glutamate, depending on the nuclease. Neither of our structures suggested an obvious candidate for the third metal ion ligand. To shed light on these issues, we crystallized TnpA with a series of longer DNA substrates that contained the IPs and extended toward the transposon ends. (In our base-numbering convention [Figure 1], the cleavage site at each transposon end is between base −1 and base +1. Base numbers increase with distance from the cleavage site with negative numbers on the 5′ side of each cleavage site. Nucleotides [nt] flanking LE are italicized, and the last four nt on RE are in bold.) We first cocrystallized and solved the 2.1 Å resolution structure of TnpA complexed with a 26-mer hairpin DNA (LE26) representing IPLE with a 4 nt 5′ extension (Table S1 and Figure 2B). In the TnpA/LE26 complex, IPLE binds precisely as seen for IPRE. The only difference between IPLE and IPRE, an extra T in the LE hairpin loop, is turned toward the solvent and does not contact TnpA. However, as a consequence of adding 4 nt in the direction of the transposon end, there has been a major conformational change affecting both TnpA monomers in which helix αD carrying Y127 has swung across the face of the β sheet to adopt a completely new location (Movie S1 and Figure 2). The pivot point for the movement is around two residues, G117 and G118, in the loop immediately preceding helix αD (Figure S1). As a result of the helix movement, the nucleophilic -OH group of Y127 shifts 12 Å to a position now consistent with active site arrangements of other HUH nucleases. The element of LE26 that appears to drive the conformational change in helix αD is base A+18 in the 4 nt 5′ extension. In the TnpA/LE26 complex, the previously observed hydrogen bond between Y127 and S110 has been disrupted, and the space that had been occupied by Y127 in the TnpA/RE22 structure is now occupied by A+18 (Figure 2). The new hydrogen bond between A+18 and S110 is the only additional base-specific interaction that TnpA makes with LE26 when compared with RE22. The ability of A+18 to evict helix αD from its previous location is due in part to the dearth of interactions between helix αD and the rest of TnpA. In the TnpA/RE22 complex, helix αD is held in place by only one hydrogen bond and some scattered van der Waals contacts between hydrophobic groups. As a result of the intrusion of base A+18 in the TnpA/LE26 complex, the hydroxyl group of Y127 is no longer hydrogen bonded to anything and thus is ready to attack the scissile phosphate. Another residue of interest located on helix αD is Q131, which is highly conserved among IS200 transposases and whose mutation to alanine dramatically reduces transposition in vivo (Figure S2). As a consequence of the conformational change in helix αD, Q131 is now close to the HUH histidines, where it appears appropriately placed to complete the divalent metal ion binding site. To test this, we soaked preformed TnpA/LE26 crystals overnight in buffer containing 5 mM MnCl2 (Table S1). The anomalous difference Fourier electron density calculated from data measured on these crystals in the neighborhood of the active site indeed shows Mn2+ coordinated by H64, H66, and Q131 (Figure S2). We also compared the metal ion binding affinity of TnpA/RE22 and TnpA/LE26 complexes using isothermal titration calorimetry. The experiments were performed with Mn2+, as our previous experience with an HUH nuclease suggested that Mn2+ might bind with higher affinity than Mg2+(Hickman et al., 2002Hickman A.B. Ronning D.R. Kotin R.M. Dyda F. Structural unity among viral origin binding proteins: crystal structure of the nuclease domain of adeno-associated virus Rep.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure S2, TnpA/RE22 has no detectable affinity for Mn2+, whereas the divalent metal ion is clearly bound by TnpA/LE26. Consistent with the role of Q131 as the crucial third metal ion ligand, we cannot detect Mn2+ binding by the TnpA(Q131A)/LE26 complex. Taken together, these data indicate that the 4 nt 5′ extension of LE26 relative to RE22 causes a rearrangement in TnpA leading to active site assembly in which Y127 and the third metal ion ligand are simultaneously transported to where they are needed for catalysis. Our observation that a short 5′ extension of IPLE causes a conformational change in TnpA that appears to assemble the active site led us to ask if, in the LE26-bound form, TnpA was competent for catalysis. We have previously shown that TnpA cleaves 70- and 80-mer ssDNA RE and LE substrates, which span the IPs and the cleavage sites (Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R. Guynet C. Ton-Hoang B. Perez Z.N.

Transposition of ISHp608, member of an unusual family of bacterial insertion sequences.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3325-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of adding the 4 nt to IP sequences, we modified the cleavage reaction by providing the IPs and the cleavage sites on separate oligonucleotides. TnpA was first bound to oligonucleotides containing the IP sequences, with or without the 4 nt 5′ extensions, and substrates that spanned the cleavage sites from bases −4 to +4 were then added. Upon cleavage, TnpA forms a phosphotyrosine link to the 4 nt on the 5′ phosphate at the break (Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R. Guynet C. Ton-Hoang B. Perez Z.N. Ghirlando R. Chandler M. Dyda F.

Transposition of ISHp608, member of an unusual family of bacterial insertion sequences.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3325-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the resulting covalent complexes can be detected by SDS-PAGE on the basis of the increase in the molecular weight of TnpA. As shown in Figure 5A, on both LE (lanes 5 and 6) and RE (lanes 3 and 4), formation of covalent complexes between TnpA and the cleavage substrates is dependent on the 4 nt 5′ extension. This is consistent with the crucial role of the additional nucleotides in inducing active site assembly. Furthermore, cleavage is dependent on the “correct” combination of LE and RE oligonucleotides: when IPLE with the 4 nt 5′ extension was mixed with the RE cleavage substrate (lane 9), or IPRE with the 4 nt 5′ extension was mixed with the LE cleavage substrate (lane 11), covalent complexes were not detected. This indicates that TnpA is able to differentiate between the LE and RE cleavage sites in a manner that depends on the particular IP bound. To address how the transposon ends reach the TnpA active sites, we determined the 2.9 Å resolution structure of TnpA cocrystallized with a RE 31-mer (RE31) that contains IPRE and the 10 nt in the 3′ direction reaching the end of the transposon (Table S1). In marked contrast to the effect seen on LE where extending the IP sequence toward the LE cleavage site leads to TnpA activation, in the TnpA/RE31 complex, each TnpA monomer is in the inactive conformation. Although IPRE is bound as seen in the TnpA/RE22 complex, the nucleotides 3′ of IPRE protrude out into solvent and become completely disordered after a few residues (Figure S3). We therefore extended RE31 by adding 4 nt in the 5′ direction. Cocrystals of TnpA bound to RE35 diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution (Table S1), and the structure revealed two important differences when compared to that of TnpA/RE31 (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3). First, the active site has been assembled: helix αD has undergone the conformational change seen in the TnpA/LE26 complex and Mn2+ that was included in the crystallization buffer is bound. Second, all RE35 nucleotides are ordered and the conformation is such that its 3′ end, the last nt of RE, is now located in the active site. In the TnpA/RE35 complex, RE35 resembles a distorted letter “C” in which IPRE is bound on one side of TnpA, and the 4 nt 5′ extension and the 10 nt that lead to the cleavage site both curl around the protein surface into the active site of the same monomer on the opposite face (Figure 3C). Furthermore, there are specific base-pairing interactions between the 4 nt 5′ extension of the IPRE and 3 nt at the 3′ end of the transposon that direct the terminal 3′ OH group, whose oxygen would be part of the scissile phosphate, into the active site (Figure 3B). The resulting arrangement of active site elements resembles the cocrystal structure of TraI, an HUH protein, bound to ssDNA that spans the F plasmid nic site in which the scissile phosphate was captured in the active site (Larkin et al., 2005Larkin C. Datta S. Harley M.J. Anderson B.J. Ebie A. Hargreaves V. Schildbach J.F. Inter- and intramolecular determinants of the specificity of single-stranded DNA binding and cleavage by the F factor relaxase.Structure. 2005; 13: 1533-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A second important role of the 4 nt 5′ extension of IPRE is now clear: the last 4 nt of the transposon RE, TCAA, that immediately precede the cleavage site are held in place by a set of Watson-Crick base pairs with the 5′ extension of IPRE (Figure 3C). The base pairs (A-1:T-32, C-3:G-35, and T-4:A-34) do not match up linearly in the transposon sequence, and the resulting twisted structure was unexpected. One base of the 5′ extension, A-33, recapitulates the role of A+18 in the TnpA/LE26 complex in that it has displaced Y127 during the transition from the inactive to the active conformation and is now tucked into the pocket previously occupied by Y127. Another surprising aspect of the way in which the 3′ end of the transposon is brought into the active site is that two base pairs, C-3:G-35 and T-4:A-34, are, in fact, part of base triplets (Figures 3C and S4). G-9, G-35, and C-3 form a G-G·C triplet, which is stacked on the A-A·T triplet formed by A-10, A-34, and T-4. Although base triples have been frequently observed in RNA structures, to our knowledge, this is the first time DNA base triplets have been observed bound to a protein in a biologically relevant context. An interesting question is whether RE folds by itself to achieve the observed configuration or it is induced by TnpA. Attempts to cocrystallize TnpA with longer LE sequences that extend 5′ from IPLE to the LE cleavage site have thus far been unsuccessful, due to the poor biophysical properties of these complexes. However, the observation that IS608 always integrates precisely 3′ of TTAC led us to explore the possibility that this sequence might somehow be recognized by TnpA. Although short TTAC-containing oligonucleotides do not bind to TnpA on their own, they do so in the presence of LE26 (data not shown), and we obtained crystals of TnpA bound to LE26 and the 6-mer TATTAC (denoted D6) that diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution (Table S1). In the ternary LE complex, we observe the TTAC bases of D6 in the same position and orientation as the TCAA bases at the very end of RE35 in the TnpA/RE35 complex. The TTAC tetranucleotide is located in the active site, where it is held in place by the 4 nt 5′ extension of IPLE (Figure 4). In this case, base pairs occur between A+16:T-3, A+17:T-4, and G+19:C-1 (Figure 4B). These orient the scissile phosphate (whose position can be inferred from the terminal 3′ OH group of D6) for nucleophilic attack by Y127. The overall DNA conformation is very similar to that seen in TnpA/RE35, except that the nucleotides between the cleavage site and LE26 are missing; the analogous regions of the TnpA/LE26/D6 and TnpA/RE35 complexes are virtually superimposable. The observation that the LE ternary complex structurally echoes the TnpA/RE35 complex is explained by the conserved polarity of the cleavage reactions. Although the interactions are similar on both ends, the flanking TTAC sequence recognized by the 4 nt 5′ extension of IPLE differs from the transposon 3′ end TCAA sequence that is recognized by the IPRE 5′ extension. The key is that the compensating changes to retain Watson-Crick base pairing are present in the 5′ extensions of the IPs. In the TnpA/LE26/D6 complex, helix αD appears in yet another inactive position away from the active site. We suspect this is a crystallization artifact, as the activated position of helix αD is blocked by a crystal lattice contact, and we know that, in solution, helix αD is able to adopt the activated conformation in LE ternary complexes as TnpA prebound to LE26 can cleave an 8-mer that spans the cleavage site (Figure 5A). The previously seen inactive conformation (Ronning et al., 2005Ronning D.R. Guynet C. Ton-Hoang B. Perez Z.N. Ghirlando R. Chandler M. Dyda F. Active site sharing and subterminal hairpin recognition in a new class of DNA transposases.Mol.

Finally, the relevance of the observed position of helix αD in the TnpA/LE26/D6 complex is suspect as any extension of D6 in the 3′ direction (i.e., uncleaved LE) would immediately be in steric conflict with helix αD. This variability in the position of helix αD adds to the body of data that suggests it is a mobile structural element that tends to wander (Figure S5). We note that the TnpA/LE26/D6 structure represents not only how TnpA recognizes its LE cleavage site but also how a TTAC-containing target site is captured. Since the circular transposon intermediate that can be integrated into target DNA, a transposon junction (Guynet et al., 2008Guynet C. Hickman A.B. Barabas O. Dyda F. Chandler M. Ton-Hoang B. Single-stranded transposition of IS608: In vitro reconstitution of a new transposition mechanism.Mol. Cell. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), contains the LE26 sequence but not the LE TTAC flank (Figure 1B), TnpA bound to the transposon junction is capable of binding (and subsequently cleaving) a TTAC-containing target. Therefore, recognition of TTAC of the target and of the LE flank is identical. The recognition of the integration target DNA sequence by protein-bound transposon DNA, rather than by TnpA directly, raises the obvious possibility that TnpA-catalyzed insertions might readily be retargeted to other tetranucleotide sequences. This seems possible in principle, as three of the four nucleotides in the 5′ extensions of the IPs do not appear to play any role beyond recognizing TTAC on LE or TCAA on RE. Thus, their repl"

More recently the observation that anaerobically grown E. coli nrf mutants were more sensitive to NO· than the parent strain led to the proposal that NrfA might also participate in NO· detoxification. Here we describe protein film voltammetry that presents a quantitative description of NrfA NO· reductase activity. NO· reduction is initiated at similar potentials to NrfA-catalyzed reduction of nitrite and hydroxylamine. All three activities are strongly inhibited by cyanide. Together these results suggest a common site for reduction of all three substrates as axial ligands to the lysine-coordinated NrfA heme rather than nonspecific NO· reduction at one of the four His-His coordinated hemes also present in each NrfA subunit. NO· reduction by NrfA is described by a Km of the order of 300 μm. The predicted turnover number of ∼840 NO· s–1 is much higher than that of the dedicated respiratory NO· reductases of denitrification and the flavorubredoxin and flavohemoglobin of E. coli that are also proposed to play roles in NO· detoxification. In considering the manner by which anaerobically growing E. coli might detoxify exogenously generated NO· encountered during invasion of a human host it appears that the periplasmically located NrfA should be effective in maintaining low NO· levels such that any NO· reaching the cytoplasm is efficiently removed by flavorubredoxin (Km ∼ 0.4 μm).

Bredt D.S. Sci. Am. 1992; 266: 68Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In humans it serves as a signaling molecule and vasodilator and in Bacteria and Archaea it can provide a substrate for anaerobic respiration. However, NO· is also a potent cytotoxin that forms part of the innate response of hosts to the infective invasion of pathogens. For this purpose NO· is produced from l-arginine by inducible NO· synthase and from nitrite in response to intragastric acidity (2Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem.

Nature. 1994; 368 (502): 502Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). As a consequence, enteric food-borne pathogens such as Escherichia coli have developed mechanisms for NO· detoxification to ensure their survival in the range of oxic, micro-oxic, and anoxic environments encountered in their animal hosts. E. coli lacks genes homologous to those encoding the dedicated respiratory NO· reductases found in bacteria such as Paracoccus denitrificans and Pseudomonas stutzeri (4Heiss B. Frunzke K. Zumft W.G.

Alternative enzymes must be employed for NO· management, and three in particular have been implicated in the removal of NO·, flavohemoglobin, flavorubredoxin, and cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA) (6Poock S.R.

In the presence of oxygen flavohemoglobin converts NO· to nitrate at a rate that has been reported to range from 10 to 670 NO· s–1. In the absence of oxygen, flavohemoglobin converts NO· to nitroxyl (NO–). However, the rates of NO· reduction are significantly lower than those of NO· oxidation and may not be sufficient for effective NO· detoxification. Under such anoxic conditions flavorubredoxin and NrfA could provide alternative catalysts for NO· removal (6Poock S.R. Leach E.R. Moir J.W.B. Cole J.A. Richardson D.J. J. Biol.

Flavorubredoxin is a cytoplasmic protein that reduces ∼15 NO· s–1 with a Michaelis constant (Km) of ∼0.4 μm. However, there is relatively little kinetic information available regarding NO· removal by the periplasmically located NrfA that may represent the first line of defense toward exogenously generated NO·. A possible role for NrfA in NO· detoxification emerged only recently with the observation that an E. coli nrf strain had much greater sensitivity to NO· than the parent strain under anaerobic conditions (6Poock S.R.

The nrf gene products have a well established role coupling quinol oxidation to nitrite reduction during anoxic and micro-oxic growth in the presence of nitrate or nitrite (14Simon J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 285-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quinol oxidation is catalyzed by NrfD and electrons are transferred, most likely via NrfC and NrfB, to NrfA, a homodimeric, deca-heme-containing cytochrome c nitrite reductase (15Bamford V.A.

NrfA homologs are present in a wide range of bacteria, and in vitro they have been shown to reduce not only nitrite but also NO· and hydroxylamine to ammonium without releasing detectable intermediates (15Bamford V.A.

As a consequence, it was proposed that NO· reduction by NrfA, rather than nonspecific reduction by another Nrf component, was responsible for providing E. coli with resistance toward NO· under anaerobic conditions (6Poock S.R.

E. coli NrfA has been reported to reduce ∼450 NO· s–1 whereas the enzyme from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans reduces only 30 NO· s–1 under comparable conditions (16Costa C. Macedo A. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Legall J. Berlier Y. Liu M.Y. Payne W.J. FEBS Letts. 1990; 276: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been noted that D. desulfuricans NrfA exhibits similar rates of NO· and nitrite reduction whereas the enzyme from Sulfurospirilum deleyianum reduces NO· at one hundredth the rate of nitrite reduction (16Costa C.

Given these diverse observations and the proposed role for E. coli NrfA in NO· detoxification, we have set about providing a more complete and quantitative description of the NO· reductase activity of this enzyme. Our previous studies employed protein film voltammetry (PFV) to quantitate the nitrite and hydroxylamine reductase activities of E. coli NrfA (19Angove H.C. Cole J.A. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. J.

In this approach graphite electrodes substituted for NrfB to deliver electrons directly to NrfA that had been adsorbed on the electrode surface. Michaelis-Menten parameters were deduced for each catalytic cycle from the variation of catalytic current (rate) with substrate concentration. In addition, enzyme activities were resolved across the electrochemical potential domain, revealing multiple modulations of the catalytic rate in response to the application of an increased driving force for the reaction being catalyzed. Because these modulations of activity were independent of the nature of the electrode surface, they were proposed to reflect intrinsic properties of NrfA nitrite and hydroxylamine reduction. Thus, to facilitate comparison with the other reductase activities of this enzyme we have chosen to define the NO· reductase activity of E. coli NrfA by PFV. Protein Purification—E. coli cytochrome c nitrite reductase NrfA was purified and quantitated as described previously (15Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The enzyme had a specific activity of 1500 μmol nitrite consumed min–1 mg–1 measured by enzyme-dependent oxidation of dithionite-reduced methyl viologen (1 mm) in 1 mm nitrite, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, at 20 °C. Samples of the enzyme in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, were stored as aliquots frozen in liquid nitrogen (15Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Reagent Preparation and NO· Quantification—All solutions were prepared with “Trace-SELECT-Ultra” water (Sigma-Al-drich). The buffer-electrolyte was 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, or 25 mm each of Hepes, Mes, Taps, and acetate with 2 mm CaCl2 for studies from pH 4 to 9. Stock solutions for each substrate were prepared daily. For nitrite (50 mm) the appropriate mass of NaNO2 was dissolved in ice-cold buffer-electrolyte and the pH confirmed to be that desired. For hydroxylamine (2 m) the appropriate mass of NH2OH.HCl was dissolved in ice-cold buffer-electrolyte and brought to the desired pH with aliquots of 10 m NaOH. Buffer-electrolyte solutions saturated with NO· were prepared from NO· gas (98.5%; Aldrich) that had been bubbled through an anaerobic aqueous solution of 100 mm NaOH. The NO· concentration in the resultant solution was determined by titration against a defined quantity of horse heart myoglobin. Here ferric myoglobin, ϵ410 nm = 186 mm–1 cm–1 (27Seward, H. E. (1999) Magneto-optical Spectroscopy of Hemoproteins Ph.D. thesis, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UKGoogle Scholar), was reduced with sodium ascorbate and phenazine ethosulfate (final concentrations 1 mm and 5 μm, respectively) in a sealed anaerobic cuvette. Addition of aliquots of NO· caused a decrease in the peak intensity at 434 nm with concomitant appearance of a peak at 421 nm that was indicative of formation of the ferrous myoglobin-NO· complex (28Millar S.J. Moss B.W. Stevenson M.H. Meat Sci. 1996; 42: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The concentrations of NO· and myoglobin in the cuvette were considered equal when NO· addition failed to perturb the spectrum. Stock solutions prepared and quantitated as described above contained between 1.7 and 2 mm NO·. Because of the volatility of NO· its concentration in the electrochemical cell was measured immediately after each experiment. Calibration against myoglobin proved too time consuming to allow effective experimentation, so a modified version of the acidified Griess reaction was adopted to allow rapid analysis in triplicate (29Ridnour L.A. Sim J.E. Hayward M.A. Wink D.A. Martin S.M. Buettner G.R. Spitz D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, aerobic cuvettes containing 1.9 ml of 17 mm sulfanilic acid, 0.4 mm N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, were sealed and taken into the anaerobic chamber where voltammetry was performed. Each cuvette was injected with 50 μlofthe solution to be assayed, shaken for 1 min, and removed from the anaerobic chamber where 50 μl of phosphoric acid (85%) was added. The cuvettes were left for 15 min and the absorbance measured at 540 nm. NO· concentrations were calculated using ϵ540 nm = 42.2 (mm NO·)–1 cm–1 determined by calibration of the modified Griess reaction with NO· solutions whose concentrations have been determined by titration against ferrous myoglobin. Protein Film Voltammetry—Experiments employed a three-electrode cell configuration placed inside a Faraday cage housed in a N2-filled chamber with atmospheric O2 < 2 ppm as described previously (30Anderson L.J. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11294-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The jacketed sample chamber was incubated at the desired temperature by connection to a thermostatted water bath. The cell employed an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode, and potentials are reported with respect to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode following addition of 197 mV to the measured potential. Pyrolytic graphite edge working electrodes of 3-mm diameter were polished immediately prior to use with an aqueous slurry of 0.3 μmAl2O3, sonicated, rinsed, and dried with a tissue. The freshly polished electrode was then taken into the anaerobic chamber together with a frozen aliquot of NrfA (0.17 μm). Immediately the NrfA sample had thawed, 3 μl was placed on the electrode surface and after ∼20 s excess solution was removed from the electrode with a tissue. The electrode was then rinsed with buffer-electrolyte and placed into the electrochemical cell. During experiments with NO· a rubber O-ring was placed around the shaft of the working electrode to form a light seal to the electrochemical cell. To define the variation of catalytic rate with nitrite or hydroxylamine concentration, sequential additions of substrate were made to the electrochemical cell while cyclic voltammetry was performed. Each titration employed a freshly prepared NrfA film with electrode rotation at 3000 rpm where the response suffered no limitation from substrate mass transport (19Angove H.C. Cole J.A. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23374-23381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Gwyer J.D. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14964-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To define the catalytic current due to NrfA-specific substrate reduction, the current recorded with a “bare” electrode was subtracted from that recorded with the NrfA film in place. Prior to determination of Km and imax the catalytic currents were adjusted for a first order loss of signal magnitude (t½ ∼ 70 min) that occurred during the course of each experiment. For direct comparison of nitrite and NO· reduction rates a freshly prepared NrfA film was placed in nitrite and two voltammograms were measured with electrode rotation at 3000 rpm. The film was then transferred to a solution of approximately equimolar NO·. Two voltammograms were measured with electrode rotation at 100 rpm, and aliquots of the NO· solution were immediately analyzed by the Griess reaction. A rotation rate of 100 rpm gave steady state voltammetry without rapid loss of NO· from solution as occurred at higher rotation rates. Catalytic currents for nitrite reduction were calculated as above. Those for NO· reduction were obtained after subtraction of the response from a bare electrode in NO·-containing buffer-electrolyte and adjustment for a reproducible 10 (±2) % loss of magnitude due to film transfer that was identified in control experiments. Catalytic current magnitudes were calculated at two potentials. At –0.3 V NrfA NO· reduction was detected with little or no interference from electrodic NO· reduction. At –0.4 V the current due to NrfA NO· reduction was subject to greater error due to its superposition on a contribution from electrodic NO· reduction but closer to the catalytic rate that would be achieved when the response becomes independent of further increase of driving force, i.e. at sufficiently negative electrode potentials. For all substrates the values of Km and maximum catalytic current magnitude (imax) determined from Hanes and Lineweaver-Burk plots were within 15% of those determined by direct fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Activation enthalpies were determined from plots of ln imax versus T–1 by fit to a modification of the Eyring equation as shown in Equation 1 lnimax=lnkbTh-ΔS‡R-ΔH‡RT(Eq. 1) where ΔS‡ is the activation entropy and ΔH‡ the activation enthalpy, kb the Boltzmann constant, h the Planck constant, R the gas constant, and T the temperature. Fitting was performed with MicroCal Origin. Detection of NO· Reduction by NrfA Using PFV—Previous studies have established that electrocatalytically active NrfA films are formed when freshly polished pyrolytic graphite edge electrodes are exposed to ice-cold NrfA solutions (19Angove H.C.

Trans. 2006; 34: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Featureless cyclic voltammograms were observed when films of NrfA prepared in this way were placed in 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at 4 °C with electrode rotation at 100 rpm (Fig. 1A, triangles). However, the voltammogram changed after the addition of NO·-saturated buffer-electrolyte to give 20 μm NO· in the electrochemical cell (Fig. 1A, heavy solid line). Reductive (negative) catalytic currents were detected below approximately –0.1 V. Control experiments performed with bare electrodes placed in 20 μm NO· showed evidence of catalytic reduction at potentials below approximately –0.4 V (Fig. 1A, circles). Thus, the sigmoidal catalytic response initiated just below –0.1 V can be attributed to NrfA-specific NO· reduction. Confirmation of the voltammetric detection of NrfA NO· reduction was provided by experiments in the presence of cyanide. Cyanide is a potent inhibitor of NrfA nitrite and hydroxylamine reductase activities that is expected to inhibit NrfA-specific NO· reduction (Fig. 1B) (21Gwyer J.D. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15086-15094Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Gwyer J.D. Angove H.C. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Bioelectrochemistry. 2004; 63: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sigmoidal catalytic feature just below –0.1 V arising from a NrfA film in 20 μm NO· disappeared on addition of cyanide whereas catalysis below –0.4 V, due predominantly to electrodic NO reduction, persisted with only a small drop in magnitude (Fig. 1A, light solid line). A comparison of the PFV from NrfA in 20 μm NO· with that in 20 μm nitrite showed reduction of both substrates occurred over a similar potential range (Fig. 1). NO· reduction was repeatedly described by much smaller catalytic currents than those due to nitrite reduction. The distinct rotation rate dependences of the catalytic responses for nitrite and NO· reduction confirmed that trace levels of nitrite were not responsible for the catalytic response detected in the NO· experiments (Fig. 2). Voltammetry performed at 100 rpm in nitrite solutions showed a peak of current on scans to more negative potentials that was absent on the return to more positive potentials (Fig. 2). This form of response is indicative of substrate, i.e. nitrite, depletion in the vicinity of the adsorbed enzyme, and for this reason quantitative studies of nitrite reduction are performed at 3000 rpm where the response of the forward and reverse scans overlay (e.g. Fig. 1B) (25Gwyer J.D. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14964-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). By contrast, the voltammetry in NO· solutions was essentially independent of electrode rotation rate above 90 rpm with no indication of substrate depletion at the electrode surface (Fig. 2). Below –0.2 V the catalytic current had slightly different magnitudes for the scans to positive and negative potentials but control experiments showed this arose from electrodic NO· reduction. Importantly, the response just below –0.1 V that most clearly defined NrfA NO· reduction was in good agreement for both scan directions and so indicative of a steady-state catalytic response. Having ruled out the possibility that detectable levels of nitrite were present in the NO· experiments, it was concluded that NrfA is a NO· reductase with distinct kinetic parameters for the reduction of NO· and nitrite. Quantitation of Steady-state NrfA Reduction of NO·, Nitrite, and Hydroxylamine—Initial experiments to define the relationship between catalytic rate and NO· concentration involved titration of NO· into the electrochemical cell. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the catalytic rate increased as the NO· concentration increased (Fig. 3A). However, colorimetric quantitation of NO· at the end of the experiment showed its concentration was only 86% of that expected. Similar behavior was observed in a number of titrations, but the final NO· level ranged from 40 to 86% of that expected. Because this prevented reliable assessment of the NO· concentration at intermediate points in the titrations, an alternative experimental approach was adopted. After NO· addition to the cell a reproducible (3%) drop in concentration was found to have occurred after measuring two cyclic voltammograms. Thus, film transfer experiments were conducted with this restriction to assess the relative rates of nitrite and NO· reduction at a number of substrate concentrations. The relationship between nitrite concentration and reduction rate was defined under comparable conditions by a nitrite titration. The two sets of results were combined and the resultant plots fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 4, Table 1. The catalytic currents recorded at –0.3 and –0.4 V showed similar trends. Maximum catalytic rates for nitrite reduction were approached above 200 μm substrate, but NO· concentrations up to 340 μm provided little indication that the maximal rate of NO· reduction was being approached.)TABLE 1Comparison of the kinetic parameters for NrfA reduction of nitrite, NO·, and hydroxylamine at pH 7.4 and 4 °CAnalysis at -0.3 VAnalysis at -0.4 VKmimaxKmimaxμm%μm%Nitrite12 ± 210030 ± 4100NO·304 ± 30131 ± 10283 ± 3050 ± 5Hydroxylamine60,400 ± 4,000226 ± 5125,000 ± 3,000268 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Here we note that two steps were taken to facilitate quantitation of the NrfA NO· response as distinct from electrodic NO· reduction. The first step was to perform experiments at 4 °C rather than 20 °C as used for previous PFV of NrfA because lower temperatures were found to improve the ratio of enzymatic to electrodic currents (not shown). The second step was to subtract the response of a freshly polished bare electrode recorded in a solution of given NO· concentration from that of the NrfA-coated electrode prior to analysis (Fig. 3B). Quantitative experiments were still restricted to NO· concentrations below 350 μm because the decreased ratio of enzymic to electrodic current detected at higher NO· concentrations introduced unacceptable uncertainty into quantitation of the NrfA-specific currents. The Michaelis constants (Km) and maximum catalytic currents (imax) describing NO· and nitrite reduction are compared in Table 1 where, for completeness, values for hydroxylamine reduction under comparable conditions are included. The Km values increased in the order nitrite <NO· <<hydroxylamine and differed by at least an order of magnitude. The values obtained here for nitrite and hydroxylamine reduction are comparable with those of ∼25 and 127,000 μm, respectively, at 20 °C, pH 7.0, (19Angove H.C. Cole J.A. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23374-23381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We considered that the fits to the NO· data might be less reliable because the experimentally attained rates approached only 50% of imax whereas those for nitrite and hydroxylamine reduction approached 90% of their respective maxima. Analysis of the nitrite reduction data for rates less than 50% of imax yielded Km values twice as large and imax values within 30% of those from the full data set. However, the kinetic parameters for NrfA substrate reduction are such that this possible error does not alter the major conclusions drawn from Table 1, namely that at 4 °C and pH 7 all three substrates are reduced with similar maximal velocities but with significantly different Kmvalues. The higher Km for NO· than nitrite reduction was confirmed experimentally when it was found that the mass transport limited response from reduction of 2 μm nitrite observed at 100 rpm was only lost on addition of ∼10-fold more NO· to the solution. Catalytic waves for NrfA reduction of NO·, nitrite, and hydroxylamine are compared in Fig. 5. To facilitate their comparison these waves are presented at substrate concentrations corresponding to ∼100, 75, 25, and 5% of their respective Km values at –0.4 V because this encompassed the range of NO· concentrations from which data could be confidently ext"
https://openalex.org/W1978527450,"Recent studies have identified a novel family of oxidized phosphatidylcholines (oxPC(CD36)) that serve as highly specific ligands for scavenger receptor CD36. oxPC(CD36) accumulate in vivo and mediate macrophage foam cell formation as well as promote platelet hyper-reactivity in hyperlipidemia via CD36. The structural basis of oxPC(CD36) binding to CD36 has not been elucidated. We used liquid-phase binding to glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing various regions of CD36 to initially identify the region spanning CD36 amino acids 157-171 to contain a major binding site for oxPC(CD36). A bell-shaped pH profile and salt concentration dependence suggest an electrostatic mechanism of the binding. Two conserved, positively charged amino acids in the region 157-171 (lysines at positions 164 and 166) were identified as critical for oxPC(CD36) and oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) binding to CD36. Lysine neutralization with chemical modifier or site-directed mutagenesis of lysine 164/166 to alanine or glutamate, but not to arginine, abolished binding. Cells expressing full-length CD36 with mutated lysines (164 and 166) failed to recognize oxPC(CD36) and oxLDL. Synthetic peptides mimicking the CD36 binding site, but not mutated or scrambled peptides, effectively prevented: (i) oxLDL binding to CD36, (ii) macrophage foam cell formation induced by oxLDL, and (iii) platelet activation by oxPC(CD36). These data indicate that CD36 (160-168) represents the core of the oxPC(CD36) binding site with lysines 164/166 being indispensable for the binding."
https://openalex.org/W1966941449,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is associated with familial autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia and is a natural inhibitor of the LDL receptor (LDLr). PCSK9 is degraded by other proprotein convertases: PC5/6A and furin. Both PCSK9 and the LDLr are up-regulated by the hypocholesterolemic statins. Thus, inhibitors or repressors of PCSK9 should amplify their beneficial effects. In the present study, we showed that PPARalpha activation counteracts PCSK9 induction by statins by repressing PCSK9 promoter activity and by increasing PC5/6A and furin expression. Quantification of mRNA and protein levels showed that various fibrates decreased PCSK9 and increased PC5/6A and furin expression. Fenofibric acid (FA) reduced PCSK9 protein content in immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) as well as its cellular secretion. FA suppressed PCSK9 induction by statins or by the liver X receptor agonist TO901317. PCSK9 repression is occurring at the promoter level. We showed that PC5/6A and furin fibrate-mediated up-regulation is PPARalpha-dependent. As a functional test, we observed that FA increased by 30% the effect of pravastatin on the LDLr activity in vitro. In conclusion, fibrates simultaneously decreased PCSK9 expression while increasing PC5/6A and furin expression, indicating a broad action of PPARalpha activation in proprotein convertase-mediated lipid homeostasis. Moreover, this study validates the functional relevance of a combined therapy associating PCSK9 repressors and statins."
https://openalex.org/W2133083191,"Amyloid fibrils are aggregated and precipitated forms of protein in which the protein exists in highly ordered, long, unbranching threadlike formations that are stable and resistant to degradation by proteases. Fibril formation is an ordered process that typically involves the unfolding of a protein to partially folded states that subsequently interact and aggregate through a nucleation-dependent mechanism. Here we report on studies investigating the molecular basis of the inherent propensity of the milk protein, κ-casein, to form amyloid fibrils. Using reduced and carboxymethylated κ-casein (RCMκ-CN), we show that fibril formation is accompanied by a characteristic increase in thioflavin T fluorescence intensity, solution turbidity, and β-sheet content of the protein. However, the lag phase of RCMκ-CN fibril formation is independent of protein concentration, and the rate of fibril formation does not increase upon the addition of seeds (preformed fibrils). Therefore, its mechanism of fibril formation differs from the archetypal nucleation-dependent aggregation mechanism. By digestion with trypsin or proteinase K and identification by mass spectrometry, we have determined that the region from Tyr25 to Lys86 is incorporated into the core of the fibrils. We suggest that this region, which is predicted to be aggregation-prone, accounts for the amyloidogenic nature of κ-casein. Based on these data, we propose that fibril formation by RCMκ-CN occurs through a novel mechanism whereby the rate-limiting step is the dissociation of an amyloidogenic precursor from an oligomeric state rather than the formation of stable nuclei, as has been described for most other fibril-forming systems.

Amyloid fibrils are ordered aggregates of a normally soluble peptide or protein. Their formation results from the ordered association of partially folded protein intermediates that have a propensity to adopt a β-sheet conformation. These intermediates expose greater hydrophobicity to solution, which encourages their mutual association. Fibril nucleation and elongation may then occur through the sequential addition of intermediates due to β-sheet stacking via a nucleation-dependent mechanism (1Dobson C.M. Methods. 2004; 34: 4-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar, 3Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). Typically, the fibrils formed are long, straight, threadlike structures that are unbranched and 6-12 nm in diameter and may consist of 2-6 “protofilaments” twisted around a central core. They are often rigid, stable, and resistant to degradation (e.g. from proteases and denaturants). Amyloid fibril formation is often associated with disease, and the misfolding process is believed to be causative of, or at least linked to, disease onset and progression (e.g. in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and various amyloidoses) (reviewed in Refs. 2Chiti F.

However, amyloid fibril formation is not confined to disease-related proteins. Studies have shown that non-disease-related proteins, even those that have a high α-helix content in their native state (5Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). Although it may be true that all proteins are capable of forming fibrils given the right conditions, the composition and amino acid sequence of a protein profoundly affects its propensity to adopt such structures. Moreover, the tendency of a polypeptide chain to aggregate rather than fold correctly depends on a number of intrinsic factors, including the propensity for it to form β-strands, its hydrophobicity, and its overall net charge (10Chiti F.

Dobson C.M. Wilson M.R. Carver J.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17027-17036Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that native (nonreduced) κ-casein is also capable of forming fibrils under the same conditions (13Thorn D.C. Meehan S. Sunde M. Rekas A. Gras S.L. MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. Wilson M.R. Carver J.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17027-17036Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which is not surprising, since reduction and carboxymethylation of the protein does not significantly alter its secondary or tertiary structure (12Farrell Jr., H.M. Cooke P.H. Wickham E.D. Piotrowski E.G. Hoagland P.D. J. Protein Chem. 2003; 22: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). From our previous studies, we concluded that κ-casein has an inherent susceptibility toward fibril formation; however, under physiological conditions in milk, this is kept in check by the action of the other caseins (αs and β), which are able to inhibit its fibrillation (13Thorn D.C. Meehan S. Sunde M. Rekas A. Gras S.L. MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. Wilson M.R. Carver J.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17027-17036Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Of physiological relevance, amyloid-like deposits have been found in bovine mammary glands within calcified stones known as corpora amylacea (14Reid I.M. J. Comp.

Casein is the principal component of milk micelles and is a heterogeneous mix of proteins that include αS1-, αS2-, β-, and κ-casein. These proteins have been classified as intrinsically disordered (18Dunker A.K. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Iakoucheva L.M. Obradovic Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6573-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 19Syme C.D. Blanch E.W. Holt C. Jakes R. Goedert M. Hecht L. Barron L.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), since they are extremely flexible, essentially unfolded, and have relatively little secondary or tertiary structure under physiological conditions. Although the caseins themselves are relatively small, ranging in mass between 19 and 25 kDa, they are usually associated, with calcium and other ions, in milk micelles that have molecular masses from 1 × 103 to 3 × 106 kDa (20Fox P.F. Fox P.F. McSweeney P. Advanced Dairy Chemistry. Springer, New York2003: 1-48Google Scholar). When purified from the other casein proteins, κ-casein in aqueous solution forms large spherical polymers with an average molecular mass of 1.18 MDa (21Groves M.L. Wickham E.D. Farrell Jr., H.M. J. Protein Chem. 1998; 17: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These polymers are formed from smaller multimeric subunits (ranging from monomers to decamers) that result from intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonding (22Rasmussen L.K. Hojrup P. Petersen T.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When completely reduced, κ-casein forms a self-associating polymeric species (comprising 31 monomers) in equilibrium with the monomeric form (23Vreeman H.J. Brinkhuis J.A. van der Spek C.A. Biophys. Chem. 1981; 14: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the monomeric form of the protein is a precursor for amyloid fibril formation (13Thorn D.C. Meehan S. Sunde M. Rekas A. Gras S.L. MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. Wilson M.R. Carver J.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17027-17036Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The inherent propensity for κ-casein to form amyloid fibrils may be reflective of the relatively unstructured nature of its monomeric form in solution. A theoretical energy-minimized three-dimensional model of κ-casein proposed by Kumosinski et al. (24Kumosinski T.F. Brown E.M. Farrell Jr., H.M. J. Dairy Sci. 1993; 76: 2507-2520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggests that the monomeric form of the protein can adopt a “horse and rider” configuration in which the legs of the horse are two sets of antiparallel β-sheets (from Lys21 to Phe55), which are rich in hydrophobic side chains. It has been speculated that the putative antiparallel β-sheet legs, due to their high degree of hydrophobicity and exposure to solution, may facilitate amyloid fibril formation by κ-casein (12Farrell Jr., H.M. Cooke P.H. Wickham E.D. Piotrowski E.G. Hoagland P.D. J. Protein Chem. 2003; 22: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The capacity of RCMκ-CN to form fibrils in a short time frame under conditions of physiological temperature and pH and without the need for denaturants make it an ideal system in which to study amyloid fibril formation. Moreover, the link between casein amyloid fibril formation, corpora amylacea, and the intracellular fibril-like bundles identified in cells surrounding these deposits indicates that a more detailed understanding of the mechanism by which κ-casein forms fibrils is required. Here, we show that fibril formation by RCMκ-CN occurs through a unique mechanism whereby the rate-limiting step is the dissociation of an amyloidogenic precursor from an oligomeric state. Furthermore, we have identified the region of the protein incorporated into the core of the amyloid fibrils formed by RCMκ-CN and show that this region encompasses that predicted to adopt an antiparallel β-sheet structure in the native form of the protein (24Kumosinski T.F. Brown E.M. Farrell Jr., H.M. J. Dairy Sci. 1993; 76: 2507-2520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), thereby providing the basis of its unique fibril-forming mechanism. These results help to explain how fibril formation by κ-casein is largely prevented in vivo. Similar mechanisms involving dissociation of an amyloidogenic precursor from its natural binding partner/oligomeric state are also likely to be important in other fibril-forming systems in vivo. Materials—Bovine milk κ-casein (Swiss-Prot accession number P02668), without the N-terminal 21-amino acid leader peptide, was purchased from Sigma. The homogeneity of this protein was typically above 90%, as assessed by gel electrophoresis and ion exchange chromatography. Further purification of the protein by ion exchange chromatography showed that there was no change in the rate or degree of fibril formation in this sample compared with the protein supplied directly from Sigma (data not shown), indicating that the other minor components present did not influence the ability of reduced κ-casein to form fibrils. As such, we used the κ-casein without further purification in these studies. For the experiments described here, the protein was reduced and carboxymethylated as described previously (12Farrell Jr., H.M. Cooke P.H. Wickham E.D. Piotrowski E.G. Hoagland P.D. J. Protein Chem. 2003; 22: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The vector pRSETB (Invitrogen), containing the human α-synuclein A53T gene, was a kind gift from Dr. Roberto Cappai (University of Melbourne, Australia), and the α-synuclein A53T protein was expressed and purified as described previously (25Cappai R. Leck S.L. Tew D.J. Williamson N.A. Smith D.P. Galatis D. Sharples R.A. Curtain C.C. Ali F.E. Cherny R.A. Culvenor J.G. Bottomley S.P. Masters C.L. Barnham K.J. Hill A.F. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1377-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T (ThT), 1,4-dithiothreitol, proteinase K (molecular biology grade), and β-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Sigma. Trypsin (proteomics grade) was also purchased from Sigma and prepared at 1 mg/ml in HCl. Uranyl acetate was purchased from Agar Scientific (Stansted, UK). The concentration of κ-casein was determined by spectrophotometric methods using a Cary 5000 UV-visible NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Melbourne, Australia) and an extinction coefficient of 0.95 ml·mg-1 cm-1 (26Fox P.F. McSweeney P.L.H. Dairy Chemistry and Biochemistry. Blackie Academic and Professional, London1998: 165-185Google Scholar). Thioflavin T and Light Scattering Assays—The formation of amyloid fibrils by RCMκ-CN was monitored using an in situ ThT binding assay (27Ecroyd H. Meehan S. Horwitz J. Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L. Robinson C.V. Macphee C.E. Carver J.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The protein was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, unless stated otherwise. Samples were incubated with 10 μm ThT in black μClear 96-microwell plates (Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, UK). The plates were sealed to prevent evaporation, and the fluorescence levels were measured with a Fluostar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Melbourne, Australia) with a 440/490-nm excitation/emission filter set. Fibril formation was also monitored by light scattering at 340 nm using a Fluostar Optima plate reader. For each assay, samples were prepared in duplicate, and the change in ThT fluorescence at 490 nm or light scattering at 340 nm is presented in the figures. In the seeding experiments, RCMκ-CN (0.2-2.5 mg/ml) was incubated under the same conditions as described above; however, prior to the start of the incubation, an aliquot of freshly prepared fibrils was added to the reaction such that both the amount and the concentration of RCMκ-CN in each sample was maintained. In some experiments, the fibrils were sonicated for 10 min prior to use. As a control for these experiments, α-synuclein A53T was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 10 μm ThT in a microtiter plate. Single time point ThT readings were taken for α-synuclein A53T during incubation, and the microtiter plate was subjected to constant shaking (700 rpm) using a Thermostar microplate shaker (BMG Labtechnologies) between readings. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—Formvar and carbon-coated nickel electron microscopy grids (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA) were prepared by the addition of 2 μl of protein sample, washed with 3 × 10 μl of milli-Q, and negatively stained with 10 μl of uranyl acetate (2% w/v). Samples were viewed using a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at a magnification range of 10,500-96,000 using an 80-kV excitation voltage. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra over a wavelength range of 190-250 nm were acquired for samples of RCMκ-CN before and after fibril formation using a Jasco J-180 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Victoria, Canada) connected to a Jasco water bath using a cell with a 0.1-mm optical path length. Samples were prepared in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and diluted with the same buffer to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml before obtaining the spectra. The spectra were obtained at 37 °C. Solvent spectra were subtracted from the measured protein spectra, and the results shown are the average of five scans. FTIR Spectra and Deconvolution Procedures—Samples of RCMκ-CN before and after fibril formation were analyzed in a Bruker BioATRCell II using a Bruker Equinox 55 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector and a silicon internal reflection element. For each spectrum, 256 interferograms were co-added at 2 cm-1 resolution, and the water background was independently measured and subtracted from each protein spectrum. Spectral contributions from water vapor were subtracted using the atmospheric compensation feature of the Bruker Opus software package. The amide I region of the IR spectrum (1600-1700 cm-1) consists of a series of overlapped component bands that arise from absorption by different secondary structural elements in proteins and peptides. In order to deconvolve these spectra, second derivatives of the amide I region were taken to determine the peak positions of the component bands. Subsequently, these component bands within the original spectra were fitted to a fixed number of Gaussian functions (28Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar) using the OriginPro 7.5 software package by OriginLab, where the heights, widths, and positions of each band were optimized iteratively. Proteolytic Cleavage of Amyloid Fibrils Formed by RCMκ-CN—Prior to proteolysis, RCMκ-CN fibrils were formed by incubating in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, overnight at 37 °C. The presence of fibrils was confirmed by TEM. Limited proteolysis experiments were carried out by incubating native and fibrillar forms of RCMκ-CN with trypsin or proteinase K. Enzymatic digestions were performed at 37 °C using enzyme-to-substrate ratios of 1:100 (w/w) for trypsin and 1:1000 (w/w) for proteinase K. The presence of amyloid fibrils following proteolysis was confirmed by TEM. At the end of the assay, an aliquot of each sample was taken for SDS-PAGE analysis, and the remainder was used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. For SDS-PAGE, aliquots were removed at various time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by mixing with an equal volume of reducing sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 12% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). These samples were then heated to 95 °C for 5 min before being loaded onto gels. Proteolysis products were analyzed using 15 or 20% acrylamide gels (v/v) and standard techniques (29Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Analysis of the samples by TEM showed that the sample preparation for SDS-PAGE analysis was sufficient to disaggregate the fibrils. Mass Spectrometry—An Ultraflex III MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was used for the analysis of intact protein and proteolytic cleaved peptides. The instrument was used in linear mode for peptides >6000 Da and in reflectron mode for smaller peptides. Linear mode was calibrated using protein calibration standard I (Bruker Daltonics). The protein mixture enables calibrations and testing in a mass range of ∼3000 to 25,000 Da with an error of ∼100 ppm. Reflector mode was calibrated using peptide calibration standard II (Bruker Daltonics), which enables calibrations and testing in a mass range of 500-6000 Da to a mass accuracy greater than 50 ppm. Aliquots taken for analysis by mass spectrometry were first mixed with urea to a final concentration of 6 m and left overnight at room temperature in order to disaggregate the fibrils. The sample was then mixed with trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), acidified with HCl (final pH < 4), before being taken up in a reverse phase column ZipTipC-18 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After washing with acetonitrile (5%, v/v), containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid multiple times to remove any salt and urea present, the sample was then stepwise eluted with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% (v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). The proteinase-resistant peptide of interest was eluted with 50 and 60% (v/v) acetonitrile. Samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS in linear mode using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix (5 g/liter) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. To confirm that this peptide matched the protease-resistant band identified by SDS-PAGE, a tryptic in-gel digest was performed according to the method of Shevchenko et al. (30Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The Coomassie Blue-stained bands from the gel were cut with a sterile scalpel blade into small blocks and destained using 50 mm NH4HCO3 in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile. The blocks were rinsed and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 10 ng/μl trypsin in 5 mm NH4HCO3. The tryptic fragments were extracted from the gel pieces by sonicating the samples for 15 min with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and then the extracted peptide solution was dried down to a final volume of ∼5 μl using a vacuum centrifuge. The tryptic peptides were analyzed directly by MALDI-TOF MS in reflector mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. The identity of these peptides was confirmed by matching their observed masses to the expected masses of the in silico tryptic digest of the known κ-casein sequence using Biotools 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics). Amyloid Fibril Formation by RCMκ-CN Does Not Proceed by a Standard Nucleation-dependent Mechanism—First, RCMκ-CN was incubated at 37 °C at various concentrations (0-10 mg/ml) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and the increase in ThT binding (which is associated with fibril formation) was examined by an in situ assay (Fig. 1, A and B). We have previously observed that the presence of the ThT dye in this assay does not affect the rate or extent of fibril formation by RCMκ-CN or the morphology of the fibrils formed. For all of the concentrations tested, we found that during the early phase of incubation (i.e. the first 30 min), there was an initial concentration-dependent decrease in the ThT fluorescence of the samples. We and others have shown that κ-casein is able to bind ThT in its native state (12Farrell Jr., H.M. Cooke P.H. Wickham E.D. Piotrowski E.G. Hoagland P.D. J. Protein Chem. 2003; 22: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Thorn D.C. Meehan S. Sunde M. Rekas A. Gras S.L. MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. Wilson M.R. Carver J.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17027-17036Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and we observed that this initial decrease in fluorescence intensity at the start of this assay was attributable to the temperature dependence of the ThT fluorescence (an increase in temperature leading to a decrease in fluorescence intensity). Thus, as the samples were warmed from room temperature to 37 °C, the fluorescence intensity from ThT bound to the native state of the protein decreased. After this period, there was a concentration-dependent increase in ThT fluorescence, which reached a maximum at 600-800 min. The presence of fibrils in these samples was confirmed by TEM. Since the rate of increase in ThT fluorescence was observed to be dependent on the protein concentration (Fig. 1, A and B), we sought to determine the reaction rate for the formation of fibrils by RCMκ-CN. The apparent reaction order can be determined according to the equation lnV A + nlnC, where V represents the initial reaction rate, C is the protein concentration, and n is the apparent reaction order. The plot of the log of the protein concentration against the log of the initial reaction rate (Fig. 1C) gave a slope (n) of 1.13 ± 0.15, indicating that the rate of increase in ThT fluorescence for RCMκ-CN follows an apparent first-order kinetic mechanism in relation to the protein concentration. We also monitored the incubation of RCMκ-CN by a light scattering assay, which did not involve ThT (Fig. 1D). When RCMκ-CN (0-10 mg/ml) was incubated under the same conditions as for the ThT assay, there was a concentration-dependent increase in light scattering that was associated with fibril formation. Interestingly, both the ThT in situ (Fig. 1, A and B) and light scattering (Fig. 1D) data showed no evidence of a concentration-dependent variation in the lag phase associated with fibril formation, an attribute that is a component of a nucleation-dependent mechanism of aggregation (such as has been described for most amyloid fibril-forming systems) (3Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). Even when the protein was incubated at lower temperatures (e.g. 32 °C (Fig. 1E) and 27 °C (data not shown)), the lag phase of the increase in ThT fluorescence was very short (i.e. < 30 min) and concentration-independent. According to a nucleation-dependent aggregation mechanism, the rate-limiting step of fibril formation is the generation of stable nuclei, the rate of which is limited by the protein concentration. As such, the length of the lag phase of conversion of the protein to amyloid fibrils depends dramatically on the concentration of the protein (3Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). The clear absence of a concentration-dependent lag phase associated with fibril formation by RCMκ-CN suggested that the mechanism by which it forms fibrils may differ from that typically reported for other systems. We also tested whether adding preformed fibrils (seeds) to RCMκ-CN (2.5 mg/ml) incubated at 37 °C increased the rate of fibril formation, since in a nucleation-dependent mechanism, the addition of exogenous seeds bypasses the need for nucleus formation, which, as discussed above, is typically considered to be the rate-limiting step in the aggregation process. However, the addition of seeds (0.5-10.0%, w/w) had no effect on the length of the lag phase or the rate of increase in ThT fluorescence, either at 32 °C (data not shown) or 37 °C (Fig. 1F). Preformed fibrils that were sonicated prior to the addition also had no effect on RCMκ-CN fibril formation (data not shown). Similar results were found when the protein was incubated at 37 °C at 0.2 mg/ml and the reaction was seeded (10.0%, w/w) with preformed fibrils (data not shown). In contrast, seeding (0.5-2.0%, w/w) a sample of α-synuclein A53T (2 mg/ml), the Parkinson disease-related fibril-forming protein that has been shown to form"

However, little is known about the detailed regulatory mechanism by which PP2A activity is inhibited by I (1)(PP2A) and the consequent events in mammalian cells. In this study, we found that both I (1)(PP2A) and its N-terminal half I (1)(PP2A(1-120)), but neither I (1)(PP2A(1-163)) nor I (1)(PP2A(164-249)), inhibited PP2A activity in vitro, suggesting an autoinhibition by amino acid residues 121-163 and its neutralization by the C-terminal region. Furthermore, transfection of NIH3T3 cells produced a dose-dependent inhibition of PP2A activity by I (1)(PP2A)(1). I (PP2A) and PP2A were found to colocalize in PC12 cells. I (1)(PP2A) could only interact with the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) and had no interaction with the regulatory subunits of PP2A (PP2A-A or PP2A-B) using a glutathione S-transferase-pulldown assay. The interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of I (1)(PP2A) and PP2Ac from lysates of transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells. The N-terminal isotype specific region of I (1)(PP2A) was required for its association with PP2Ac as well as PP2A inhibition. In addition, the phosphorylation of Tau was significantly increased in PC12/Tau441 cells transiently transfected with full-length I (1)(PP2A) and with PP2Ac-interacting I (1)(PP2A) deletion mutant 1-120 (I (1)(PP2A)DeltaC2). Double immunofluorescence staining showed that I (1)(PP2A) and I (1)(PP2A)DeltaC2 increased Tau phosphorylation and impaired the microtubule network and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1984045227,"The ActVA-ActVB system from Streptomyces coelicolor is a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase involved in the antibiotic actinorhodin biosynthesis. ActVB is a NADH:flavin oxidoreductase that provides a reduced FMN to ActVA, the monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of dihydrokalafungin, the precursor of actinorhodin. In this work, using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, we investigated the mechanism of hydroxylation of dihydrokalafungin catalyzed by ActVA and that of the reduced FMN transfer from ActVB to ActVA. Our results show that the hydroxylation mechanism proceeds with the participation of two different reaction intermediates in ActVA active site. First, a C(4a)-FMN-hydroperoxide species is formed after binding of reduced FMN to the monooxygenase and reaction with O2. This intermediate hydroxylates the substrate and is transformed to a second reaction intermediate, a C(4a)-FMN-hydroxy species. In addition, we demonstrate that reduced FMN can be transferred efficiently from the reductase to the monooxygenase without involving any protein·protein complexes. The rate of transfer of reduced FMN from ActVB to ActVA was found to be controlled by the release of NAD+ from ActVB and was strongly affected by NAD+ concentration, with an IC50 of 40 μm. This control of reduced FMN transfer by NAD+ was associated with the formation of a strong charge·transfer complex between NAD+ and reduced FMN in the active site of ActVB. These results suggest that, in Streptomyces coelicolor, the reductase component ActVB can act as a regulatory component of the monooxygenase activity by controlling the transfer of reduced FMN to the monooxygenase.

The flavin-dependent monooxygenases are important enzymes that are involved in a wide variety of biological reactions. One of their fundamental functions uses their reduced flavins to activate molecular oxygen by generating flavin-hydroperoxide intermediates, the reactive species that oxygenate the substrate. Two different classes of flavin-dependent monooxygenases have been described. The first class comprises the well known single-component flavoprotein monooxygenases, in which within a single polypeptide chain, the flavin cofactor is reduced by NAD(P)H and reacts with O2 to generate the flavin-hydroperoxide species. Some of these flavoproteins have been investigated in great detail, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase being the prototype of this class of flavoprotein monooxygenase (1Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently, several two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases, present in prokaryotic cells and involved in a broad range of oxygenation reactions, have been reported. These systems use two different proteins, a reductase for reducing the flavin and an oxygenase for binding the reduced flavin and catalyzing the reaction with O2.

We have been investigating the mechanism of the FMN-dependent two-component enzyme system, ActVA-ActVB, which participates in the last steps of the biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor (11Caballero J.L.

Therefore, in contrast to the single-component flavin hydroxylases, the two-component systems catalyze the reduction of the flavin and the hydroxylation of the substrate on separate polypeptides. In the biosynthesis of actinorhodin the hydroxylase system consists of the reductase, ActVB, and the oxygenase, ActVA (14Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44362-44369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There is now general agreement that the hydroxylation steps of flavin-dependent hydroxylases proceed through the reaction of the reduced flavin with molecular oxygen to generate a flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide intermediate (18Ballou D.P. Entsch B. Cole L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This is followed by the transfer of an oxygen atom from the peroxide to the substrate. Catalysis by the two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases requires that the reduced flavin be transferred from the reductase to the monooxygenase without being oxidized by molecular O2. This would appear to be a very challenging process, because free reduced flavin becomes oxidized quite rapidly in the presence of O2. Such an oxidation must be avoided or the reduction of the flavin and the ensuing hydroxylation reaction would effectively be uncoupled and, instead, NAD(P)H would be consumed to produce H2O2 and superoxide. We have previously demonstrated that with the ActVA-ActVB system from S. coelicolor the transfer of FMNred from the reductase to the oxygenase is thermodynamically favorable (17Valton J. Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44362-44369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed the monooxygenase ActVA binds FMNred with a Kd value of 0.39 μm and FMNox with a Kd value of ∼20 μm, whereas the reductase ActVB binds FMNox more tightly than FMNred. There is also no evidence for specific binding interactions between the two components that might facilitate a channeling mechanism allowing the flavin to travel from one protein to another within a protein complex. These data suggest that, despite the drawbacks associated with the simultaneous presence of free FMNred and O2, FMNred is probably transferred between the two components by diffusion and rapid binding to the oxygenase during the hydroxylation reaction. In this work, we have determined that FMNred can be transferred very efficiently from the reductase to the monooxygenase without the participation of any protein·protein complexes. In addition, our data show that in the S. coelicolor system the rate of transfer of FMNred from the reductase, ActVB, to the hydroxylase, ActVA, is controlled by the release of NAD+ from ActVB and that the concentration of NAD+ strongly affects this rate. This is manifest by the formation of a strong charge·transfer complex between NAD+ and FMNred in the active site of ActVB. Materials—NAD+, NADH, and FAD were from Sigma. FMN was prepared by conversion of FAD to FMN with snake venom from Crotalus adamanteus (19Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10434-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). DCPIP and menadione were from Sigma. 5-Deazaflavin (5-deaza-5-carba-riboflavin) was a gift from Dr. Philippe Simon (Grenoble, France). Enantiopure (+)-kalafungin was synthesized by Dr. Rodney Fernandes and provided by Prof. Dr. Reinhard Brückner (Freiberg, Germany) (20Fernandes R.A. Brückner R. Synlett. 2005; 8: 1281-1285Google Scholar). DHK (dihydrokalafungin), the non-lactonic analogue of (+)-kalafungin, was obtained from the reductive treatment of (+)-kalafungin by NaBH4 as described in a previous study (21Tanaka H. Minami-Kakinuma S. Omura S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1982; 35: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A solution containing 40 μm (+)-kalafungin in anaerobic 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was mixed with ∼7 equivalents of NaBH4. The reaction was allowed to proceed for a few seconds under anaerobic conditions, and the mixture was then opened to air. The formation of DHK was verified by UV-visible spectrophotometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Both techniques showed that (+)-kalafungin was efficiently transformed to DHK with a yield of ∼100% (data not shown). HPAH-C2 from A. baumannii was provided by Dr. Jeerus Sucharitakul (Mahidol University, Thailand). Recombinant ActVA-Orf5 and His-tagged ActVB from S. coelicolor were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (14Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol.

Anaerobic Procedures and Rapid Reaction Experiments—All reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Solutions were made anaerobic in glass tonometers by ∼20 cycles of vacuum and equilibration with Ar2 gas that was depleted from oxygen contamination with an Oxiclear oxygen removal column (Labclear) as described previously (22Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17044-17053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To minimize oxygen contamination of reaction mixtures due to diffusion through valves, etc., all anaerobic solutions contained an oxygen-scrubbing solution consisting in 12.5–25 μm protocatechuate (PCA, final concentrations) and ∼0.06 unit/ml of protocatechuate dioxygenase (PCD, final concentration). This mixture has been shown to maintain anaerobic conditions efficiently (23Patil P.V. Ballou D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Rapid kinetics reactions were performed with a Hi-Tech Scientific stopped-flow Model SF-61DX instrument operating either in single or in double mixing mode, and using either a diode array spectrophotometer or a photomultiplier detector. Kinetic traces were analyzed and fitted with KinetAsyst 3 software (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK). Before each experiment, the stopped-flow instrument flow system was made anaerobic by incubating the flow system overnight with an oxygen scrubbing solution consisting of 100 mm PCA and 0.06 unit/ml PCD in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Reaction of ActVA·FMNred with O2 in the Presence or in the Absence of the Pyronaphthoquinone Substrate DHKred—A solution containing ActVA (50 μm), FMNox (20 μm), deazaflavin (60 nm), EDTA (10 mm), and catalase (50 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was made anaerobic in a glass tonometer as described above. FMNox was then photoreduced for 5–10 s using a commercial 1000-watt tungsten-halogen lamp placed ∼10 cm away from the solution. The redox status of FMN was monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry. When experiments were performed in the presence of DHK, the same reaction mixture as indicated above was used, but included the presence of 80 μm DHK. Both FMNox and oxidized DHK (DHKox) were photoreduced together by the procedure described above. This solution was then mixed in the stopped-flow instrument with an equal volume of a solution containing various concentrations of oxygen, and the reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at various wavelengths, or by spectrofluorometry with excitation at 390 nm and emission at wavelengths of >530 nm. Oxygenated solutions were prepared by equilibrating 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer for 30 min with air (21% oxygen) or with certified oxygen/nitrogen gas mixtures (5, 10, 50, and 100% oxygen). Investigation of the Kinetics of FMNred Transfer—To study the transfer of FMNred from ActVB to the monooxygenase (ActVA or HPAH-C2), the ActVB·FMNred complex was prepared. A solution containing ActVB (85 μm) and FMNox (20 μm) in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, in a glass tonometer equipped with a cuvette was made anaerobic as described above. The excess ActVB was to assure that most of the FMN was bound. The complex was then reduced by titration with an anaerobic solution of NADH delivered by a gastight Hamilton syringe connected to the tonometer via an Airless Ware fitting. Approximately 20 μm NADH was sufficient to fully reduce the ActVB·FMN complex. This complex was then mixed in the stopped-flow instrument with an equal volume of Tris-HCl buffer containing ActVA (45 μm) and O2 (600 μm), HPAH-C2 from A. baumannii (45 μm) and O2 (600 μm), oxidized DCPIP (20 μm), or oxidized menadione (40 μm). The concentrations given are those in the syringes before mixing. The inhibition of FMNred transfer from ActVB to HPAH-C2 by NAD+ was investigated by a double mixing stopped-flow technique. The ActVB·FMNred· NAD+ complex, prepared as described above (235, 40, and 40 μm of each component, respectively), was first mixed into an aging chamber with a solution containing various concentrations of NAD+ (from 0 to 5 mm). After a 5-s delay to assure that the binding of NAD+ had come to equilibrium, the solution from the first mix was mixed with an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing HPAH-C2 (50 μm) and O2 (255 μm), and the FMNred transfer to HPAH-C2 was followed spectrophotometrically at 386 and 700 nm to observe the formation of the C(4a)-FMN-OOH intermediate and the disappearance of the FMNred-to-NAD+ charge· transfer complex. Reaction of ActVA-FMNred with O2 in the Absence of the Pyronaphthoquinone Substrate and Formation and Decay of the C(4a)-FMN-OOH Intermediate—It has been previously shown that ActVA is able to stabilize a C(4a)-FMN-OOH species within its active site, but the kinetics of its formation and decay were not determined (17Valton J. Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44362-44369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Valton J. Fontecave M. Douki T. Kendrew S.G. Niviere V.

Here, we have investigated the kinetics of the formation and decay of the C(4a)-FMN-OOH intermediate by stopped-flow spectrophotometry at 4 °C, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An anaerobic solution of FMNred (20 μm), containing an excess of ActVA (50 μm) to promote full complex formation (Kd FMNred = 0.39 μm, (17Valton J. Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44362-44369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), was mixed with equal volumes of Tris-HCl buffer solution containing various concentrations of O2. The reaction was monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry. As shown in Fig. 1A (thick line) the first spectrum recorded at 5 s ([O2] = 595μm after mixing) had a main absorption band at 386 nm. This spectrum is characteristic of a C(4a)-FMN-OOH species, such as those found in other single- and two-component flavin-dependent hydroxylases, including HPAH-C2 from A. baumannii (22Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17044-17053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Palfey, B. A., Ballou, D. P., and Massey, V. (1995) in Active Oxygen in Biochemistry (Valentine, J. S., Foote, C. S., Greenberg, A., and Liebman, J. F., eds) pp. 37–83, Blackie Academic and Professional, London, UKGoogle Scholar). Reaction traces monitored at 386 nm were fit to a single exponential model, and the rate constants for formation of the absorbing species were found to be proportional to the O2 concentration (Fig. 1B). The linear plot of kobs at 386 nm versus oxygen concentration yielded a second-order rate constant of k = 2.97 ± 0.06 × 104 m–1 s–1 (Fig. 1C). These data are consistent with a bimolecular reaction between the reduced flavin bound to ActVA and oxygen to form the C(4a)-FMN-OOH intermediate. The C(4a)-FMN-OOH then slowly converted to FMNox with a half-life of ∼1400 s and was complete by ∼1 h, as seen from the appearance of the two characteristic bands of the oxidized flavin at 370 and 445 nm (Fig. 1A). The absorbance changes at 445 nm (Fig. 1B) were found to be independent of oxygen concentration. These data, which are consistent with our previous results from experiments at 25 °C, clearly show that ActVA strongly stabilizes the C(4a)-FMN-OOH intermediate (17Valton J. Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44362-44369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Valton J. Fontecave M. Douki T. Kendrew S.G. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At the end of this slow decay of the intermediate, 10 μm FMNox was detected (ϵ445 nm = 13 mm–1 cm–1), indicating that all of the initial FMNred was quantitatively oxidized to FMNox by O2. An ϵ value at 386 nm of 9.6 mm–1 cm–1 for the C(4a)-FMN-OOH species could then be calculated. Interestingly, when free FMNred was mixed with an air-saturated ActVA solution in the stopped-flow apparatus, kinetic traces were the same as those obtained when a preformed ActVA·FMNred complex was mixed with the same concentration of oxygen (data not shown). This implies that almost no spontaneous oxidation of free FMNred by O2 occurred, even though autoxidation of free FMNred by O2 is a reasonably fast process. For example, 40 μm FMNred is oxidized by 240 μm O2, final concentration, in an autocatalytic reaction with a t½ of ∼0.5 s (27Sucharitakul J. Phongsak T. Entsch B. Svasti J. Chaiyen P. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8611-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and no detectable C(4a)-FMN-OOH species is produced (28Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result implies that binding of FMNred to ActVA preceding the formation of the C(4a)-FMN-OOH species is fast and precludes any significant oxidation of free FMNred by oxygen. These results explain and are in full agreement with our previous steady-state kinetics experiments (24Valton J. Fontecave M. Douki T. Kendrew S.G. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reaction of ActVA-FMNred with O2 and Pyronaphthohydroquinone Substrate—The reaction of O2 with FMNred bound to ActVA in the presence of its substrate, reduced dihydrokalafungin (DHKred), was investigated by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. An anaerobic solution containing 80 μm DHKred, 20 μm FMNred, and an excess of ActVA (50 μm, to ensure that most of the FMNred was in complex with ActVA) was mixed with equal volumes of oxygenated Tris-HCl buffer solution containing various amounts of O2. In Fig. 2, the reported data were observed with a final O2 concentration of 595 μm. The reaction was followed at: (i) 365 nm, a wavelength that is useful for monitoring the formation of the C(4a)-FMN-OOH intermediate species (22Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. J.

In addition, fluorescence emission at 530 nm (excitation at 390 nm) was recorded to follow the formation of C(4a)-FMN-OH (hydroxy-FMN) and FMNox species. For many flavin-dependent hydroxylases, the C(4a)-FMN-OOH intermediate does not exhibit significant fluorescence emission upon excitation at 390 nm, whereas the C(4a)-FMN-OH species is often highly fluorescent (22Sucharitakul J.

These data indicate that the reaction proceeds through at least four successive phases (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Each trace could be fitted by the sum of four exponential processes using a single set of rate constants for data at all wavelengths.TABLE 1Rate constants determined from multiexponential fits for the 365, 445, and 520 nm absorbance and fluorescence traces of Fig. 2ATracek1k2k3k4m-1 s-1s-1s-1s-1365 nm3.96 ± 0.05 × 1041.48 ± 0.150.25 ± 0.03445 nm0.16 ± 0.020.013 ± 0.002520 nm0.16 ± 0.020.013 ± 0.002Fluorescence at 530 nm1.48 ± 0.150.16 ± 0.020.013 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab The rate constant k1 for phase 1 was directly dependent on O2 concentration (data not shown), indicating a bimolecular reaction with O2. No FMNox (445 nm trace) and almost no C(4a)-FMN-OH (fluorescence at 530 nm) were observed during this first phase. Thus, the bimolecular rate constant (3.96 ± 0.05 × 104 m–1 s–1) determined from the increase in absorbance at 365 nm is clearly associated with the formation of the C(4a)-FMN-OOH intermediate. This rate constant is only slightly different from that determined in the absence of the DHKred substrate (Fig. 1C, 2.97 ± 0.06 × 104 m–1 s–1). In the subsequent phases, k2, k3, and k4 were found to be independent of O2 concentration (data not shown), indicating that they did not involve direct reactions with O2. In phase 2, the appearance of fluorescence at 530 nm (with excitation at 390 nm) reached a maximum at ∼2-s reaction time, with a rate constant of 1.48 ± 0.15 s–1. Although there was only a small decrease in absorbance at 365 nm in this phase, the fluorescence data clearly reflect the hydroxylation reaction. Therefore, the above data are consistent with the formation of the C(4a)-FMN-OH intermediate species in phase 2, implying that hydroxylation of the DHKred substrate occurred during that phase. The trace at 520 nm does not show any increase in absorbance during this phase as might be expected for DHKox-OH. The immediate product is therefore most likely DHKred-OH, which has very little absorbance or fluorescence, and is not expected to contribute significantly to the absorption and fluorescence data during phase 2. Phase 3 is best indicated by the strong increase in absorbance at 445 nm characterized by a rate constant of 0.16 ± 0.02 s–1. This was due to formation of FMNox, which is expected to arise from dehydration of the C(4a)-FMN-OH intermediate. The small decrease of fluorescence with an identical rate constant (0.16 ± 0.0"

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of action of resveratrol in imatinib-sensitive (IM-S) and -resistant (IM-R) CML cell lines. Resveratrol induced loss of viability and apoptosis in IM-S and IM-R in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition of cell viability was detected for concentrations of resveratrol as low as 5 microM, and the IC(50) values for viability, clonogenic assays, apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation were in the 10-25 microM range. The effect of imatinib and resveratrol was additive in IM-S but not in IM-R clones in which the resveratrol effect was already maximal. The effect of resveratrol on apoptosis was partially rescued by zVAD-fmk, suggesting a caspase-independent contribution. Resveratrol action was independent of BCR-ABL expression and phosphorylation, and in agreement was additive to BCR-ABL silencing. Finally, phytoalexin inhibited the growth of BaF3 cells expressing mutant BCR-ABL proteins found in resistant patients, including the multiresistant T315I mutation. Our findings show that resveratrol induces apoptosis, caspase-independent death, and differentiation that collectively contribute to the specific elimination of CML cells. Resveratrol should provide therapeutic benefits in IM-R patients and in other hematopoietic malignancies."

Gln3-Myc13 and Gat1-Myc13 are restricted to the cytoplasm of cells provided with good nitrogen sources, e.g. glutamine. Following the addition of the Tor1,2 inhibitor, rapamycin, both transcription factors relocate to the nucleus. Gln3-Myc13 localization is highly dependent upon Ure2 and type 2A-related phosphatase, Sit4. Ure2 is required for Gln3 to be restricted to the cytoplasm of cells provided with good nitrogen sources, and Sit4 is required for its location to the nucleus following rapamycin treatment. The paucity of analogous information concerning Gat1 regulation prompted us to investigate the effects of deleting SIT4 and URE2 on Gat1-Myc13 localization, DNA binding, and NCR-sensitive transcription. Our data demonstrate that Tor pathway control of NCR-responsive transcription bifurcates at the regulation of Gln3 and Gat1. Gat1-Myc13 localization is not strongly influenced by deleting URE2, nor is its nuclear targeting following rapamycin treatment strongly dependent on Sit4. ChIP experiments demonstrated that Gat1-Myc13 can bind to the DAL5 promoter in the absence of Gln3. Gln3-Myc13, on the other hand, cannot bind to DAL5 in the absence of Gat1. We conclude that: (i) Tor pathway regulation of Gat1 differs markedly from that of Gln3, (ii) nuclear targeting of Gln3-Myc13 is alone insufficient for its recruitment to the DAL5 promoter, and (iii) the Tor pathway continues to play an important regulatory role in NCR-sensitive transcription even after Gln3-Myc13 is localized to the nucleus.

The utility of GATA factor localization as a Tor reporter derives from the correlation that Gln3 and Gat1 respond similarly to rapamycin inhibition of Tor1,2, to nitrogen starvation, or when cells are provided with a poor nitrogen source (proline); they localize to the nucleus, and NCR-sensitive transcription increases. On the other hand, with good nitrogen sources (e.g. glutamine and in some strains ammonia), transcription of NCR-sensitive genes encoding proteins required for the transport and utilization of poor nitrogen sources is minimal, which correlates with Gln3-Myc13 and Gat1-Myc13 being sequestered in the cytoplasm, a response that, in the case of Gln3, requires Ure2 (8Beck T.

Dephosphorylated Gln3 can then enter the nucleus and mediate NCR-sensitive transcription. Gat1 was reported to be similarly regulated (8Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Subsequently, protein kinase Npr1 was posited to be a negative regulator of nuclear Gln3 localization (25Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).This model has stimulated detailed studies of the steps outlined above. Although intracellular Gln3 phosphorylation and localization sometimes positively correlated, as predicted by the model of Tor pathway structure and operation, in other cases experimental observations were inconsistent with the predictions. Detailed investigations of expected correlations that failed to occur repeatedly led to alternative explanations of existing data and concomitantly revised and increased our understanding of Tor1,2 and GATA factor regulation. Among the most important findings have been the observations that: (i) in its active form, Sit4 is in a complex with Tap42 (21Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 22Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 27Wang H. Wang X. Jiang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); (ii) although methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine biosynthesis, and rapamycin treatment both cause nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization (28Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 29Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), they produce opposite effects on Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation, i.e. the former increases phosphorylation, whereas the latter decreases it (29Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); (iii) Sit4 remains active with respect to Gln3 dephosphorylation in the presence of both good and poor nitrogen sources, i.e. its activity is not demonstrably nitrogen source-responsive (30Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); (iv) nitrogen source-dependent changes in Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation become demonstrable when SIT4 is deleted, suggesting that nitrogen-responsive protein kinase activity rather than Sit4 phosphatase activity is the primary determining link between nitrogen availability and Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation (30Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); and (v) Npr1 protein kinase participates in Gln3 regulation indirectly by influencing the uptake of ammonia (31Feller A. Boeckstaens M. Marini A.M. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28546-28554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28460-28469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The studies described above evaluated the influence of nutrients, Tor1,2 inhibitors, and type 2A-related phosphatase activities (Sit4, Pph3) on Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation and localization. Missing from these analyses, however, are data that analyze and correlate the requirements of GATA factor localization with in vivo DNA binding and NCR-sensitive transcription. Also missing are data that address the regulation of Gat1. Although Gat1 was concluded to be regulated analogously to Gln3 (8Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), several predicted responses have eluded demonstration (8Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Gat1-mediated transcription is NCR-sensitive, but it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a Gat1-Ure2 complex in vitro (7Cooper T.G. Winderickx J. Taylor P.M. Nutrient-Induced Responses in Eukaryotic Cells Current Genetics. 7. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 225-257Google Scholar, 8Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 33Kulkarni A. Buford T.D. Rai R. Cooper T.G. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further, nitrogen source or rapamycin-dependent changes in Gat1-Myc13 phosphorylation have not been demonstrated, even though changes in Gat1-Myc13 phosphorylation in response to carbon starvation can be readily observed (33Kulkarni A. Buford T.D. Rai R. Cooper T.G. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).To provide the missing information cited above, we investigated the requirements of type 2A-related phosphatases (Sit4 and Pph3) for NCR-sensitive gene expression and compared them with those expected from previous studies of Gln3-Myc13 localization (30Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate rapamycin-induced Gat1-Myc13 localization, DNA binding, and NCR-sensitive transcription in wild type and type 2A-related phosphatase mutant strains. These investigations demonstrate that Tor1,2 pathway regulation of NCR-sensitive gene transcription bifurcates at the level of the GATA factors Gln3 and Gat1.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Culture Conditions: S. cerevisiae—Strains used in this work are listed in Table 1.

Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin DNA probes (about 500 bp) were synthesized by PCR, using primers 5′-AGTGTTGTCACACCTTGC-3′ and 5′-ACCCATTAATAGGGTTTC-3′ for DAL5 and 5′-AAACAGCAAGAAAGTCCACTGG-3′ and 5′-ACCTCTTAATCTTCTAGCCAAC-3′ for HHT1 and labeled using a PCR digoxigenin probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). Treatment of the Hybond-N+ nylon membranes was as described earlier (31Feller A. Boeckstaens M. Marini A.M. Dubois E. J. Biol.

Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 500 mm and incubation continued for 5 min. The cells were collected, washed once with cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, washed once with cold FA-SDS buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and resuspended in 1 ml of cold FA-SDS buffer. An equal volume of glass beads (0.5 mm in diameter) was added, and the cells were disrupted by vortexing for 30 min in a cold room. The lysate was diluted into 4 ml of FA-SDS buffer, and the glass beads were discarded. The cross-linked chromatin was then pelleted by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 35 min), washed for 60 min with FA-SDS buffer, resuspended in 1.6 ml of FA-SDS buffer for 15 min at 4 °C, and sonicated three times for 30 s. each (Branson Sonifier 250, Pulse 60%, Power 2) to yield an average DNA fragment size of 700 base pairs. Finally, the sample was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min and diluted 4-fold in FA-SDS buffer, and aliquots of the resultant chromatin containing solution were stored at –80 °C.Myc13-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating 100 μl of the chromatin containing solution for 180 min at 4 °C with 2 μl of mouse anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz) prebound to 10 μl of Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immune complexes were washed six times in FA-SDS buffer and recovered by treating with 50 μl of Pronase Buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) at 65 °C with agitation. Input (IN) and immunoprecipitated (IP) fractions were then subjected to Pronase treatment (0.5 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) for 60 min at 37 °C, and formaldehyde cross-links were reversed by incubating the eluates overnight at 65 °C. Finally, the samples were treated with RNase (50 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C. DNA from the IP fractions was purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Applied Science) and eluted in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8. IN fractions were boiled 10 min and diluted 500-fold with no further purification prior to quantitative PCR analysis.Concentrations of specific DNA targets in IN and IP samples were measured by real time PCR using a LightCycler 1.5 instrument and the FastStart DNA Master Plus SYBR Green I kit according to the manufacturer's (Roche Applied Science) protocol. Primers amplified a 161-bp region in the promoter of DAL5 (DAL5P1, 5′-CGAGGAGCTATCATTTGCTG-3′; DAL5P2, 5′-ATCTTTTGCCCCGATAATCC-3′) or a 150-bp region 2.5 kb upstream of the DAL5 AUG as the unbound control (DAL5U1, 5′-GTTCATTAGTCGCCTACAGC-3′; DAL5U2, 5′-CAGAGCCCCGCATATTTTGA-3′). A standard curve was generated for each primer pair with five successive 10-fold dilutions of an IN sample. This standard curve was used to assess PCR efficiency and determine the relative concentration of target DNA in all other samples. Specificity of the PCR products was assessed by melting curve analysis. Primer pairs generating different products, identified by more than one melting temperature peak, were discarded.The data were analyzed with LightCycler software, version 5.32. The IP/IN ratio corresponds to the concentration of target DNA in the IP sample relative to that in the corresponding IN sample, multiplied by 10. IP/IN values obtained for the unbound control (DAL5U) were substracted from IP/IN values obtained for the DAL5 promoter (DAL5P). To counterbalance variation generated by the immunoprecipitation step, we treated all of our data as follows. The wild type-induced value was set as 1, and the IP/IN value of every simultaneously immunoprecipitated sample was normalized accordingly. For every independent culture, the mean of the IP/IN ratios for two to four replicate immunoprecipitations was calculated. The values in Figs. 4 and 7 correspond to the mean IP/IN value of at least two independent cultures. The mean normalized IP/IN values of both DAL5U and DAL5P are displayed in the supplemental material.FIGURE 7ChIP analysis of rapamycin-induced recruitment of Gln3-Myc13 and Gat1-Myc13 to the DAL5 promoters in wild type, sit4Δ, ure2Δ, and ure2Δsit4Δ strains.

Cholesterol and sphingolipid availability affects Golgi vesiculation events and involves the activity of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). We recently demonstrated that high expression levels of annexin A6 (AnxA6) perturb the intracellular distribution of cellular cholesterol, thereby inhibiting caveolin export from the Golgi complex. In the present study we show that in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing AnxA6, sequestration of cholesterol in late endosomes, leading to reduced amounts of cholesterol in the Golgi, inhibits cPLA2 activity and its association with the Golgi complex. This correlates with the blockage of caveolin export from the Golgi in cells treated with methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, a Ca2+-dependent cPLA2 inhibitor. AnxA6-mediated down-regulation of cPLA2 activity was overcome upon the addition of exogenous cholesterol or transfection with small interfering RNA targeting AnxA6. These findings indicate that AnxA6 interferes with caveolin transport through the inhibition of cPLA2.

In addition, AnxA6 stimulates the membrane recruitment of the GTPase-activating protein p120GAP and protein kinase C to modulate the Ras signaling pathway (8Rentero C. Evans R. Wood P. Tebar F.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5809-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These multifunctional features of AnxA6 are most probably a consequence of (a) its dynamic spatiotemporal behavior in a Ca2+ and/or cholesterol-dependent manner but also (b) the promiscuity to interact with a large set of other molecules (10Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar), in particular through the flexible linker region (amino acids 320-378) which connects the N- and C-terminal AnxA6 repeats (4 repeats each).Expression of AnxA6 and other annexins varies in cells and tissues as well as in different pathophysiological situations (1Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 10Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). We recently compared wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOwt, contain very low AnxA6 levels) and AnxA6-deficient human epithelial carcinoma A431 cells with stable cell lines expressing high amounts of AnxA6 (CHOanx6, A431anx6). In these studies we showed that high AnxA6 levels result in an accumulation of cholesterol in the late endocytic compartment, leading to reduced amounts of cholesterol in the Golgi and the plasma membrane. This overall imbalance of cellular cholesterol is accompanied by an inhibition of caveolin export from the Golgi complex. Consequently, a significant diminution in the number of caveolae at the cell surface and a strong reduction of cholesterol efflux was observed (11Cubells L. Vila de Muga S. Tebar F. Wood P. Evans R. Ingelmo-Torres M. Calvo M. Gaus K. Pol A. Grewal T. Enrich C. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1568-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating the exit of caveolin from the Golgi complex is not fully understood, and recently the participation of syntaxin 6 (12Choudhury A. Marks D.L.

Vesiculation and tubulation events regulating membrane traffic and cargo export from the Golgi require the activity of cholesterol-dependent cPLA2 (15Grimmer S. Ying M. Walchli S. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Traffic. 2005; 6: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the possibility of AnxA6 interfering with caveolin export from Golgi membranes through the inhibition of cPLA2. In the present study we show that overexpression of AnxA6 indirectly inhibits cPLA2 activity and its association with the Golgi complex through the reduction of cholesterol availability. In support of cPLA2 being involved in caveolin transport, CHOwt treated with the Ca2+-dependent cPLA2 inhibitor, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), but not the Ca2+-independent cPLA2 inhibitor haloenol lactone suicide substrate (HELSS), mimics the phenotype of AnxA6 overexpression and leads to an accumulation of caveolin in the Golgi complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Nutrient Mixture Ham's F-12, DMEM, cycloheximide, water-soluble cholesterol, and saponin were from Sigma.

The generation of the stable AnxA6-overexpressing CHO cell line (CHOanx6) was described in detail (4Grewal T. Heeren J. Mewawala D. Schnitgerhans T. Wendt D. Salomon G. Enrich C. Beisiegel U.

For the inhibition of Ca2+-independent and -dependent cPLA2 activity, cells were incubated as described with either 5 μm HELSS for 30 min or 15 μm MAFP for 60 min, respectively (15Grimmer S. Ying M. Walchli S. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Traffic. 2005; 6: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, cells (40-70% confluence) were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/ml using Effectene (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions.Cycloheximide/Cholesterol Treatments—To inhibit protein synthesis in some experiments, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) was added to the media for 90 min. For cholesterol addition, cells were incubated with 30 μg/ml cholesterol (premixed for 30 min in DMEM by gentle agitation) for 90 min.RNAi-mediated Inhibition of AnxA6—To specifically knock down gene expression of human AnxA6, 1-2 × 106 HeLa cells were transfected in 2 ml of medium with 10 nm AnxA6 small interfering RNA (Santa Cruz, sc-29688) and 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Experiments were conducted 72 h after transfection when the depletion of AnxA6 was more significant (see Western blot in Fig. 1C). GFP small interfering RNA was used as a negative control.Release of [3H]AA—Cells were incubated overnight in 12 wells with 0.25 μCi/ml [3H]AA in DMEM, 0.5% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed and incubated with DMEM, 0.2% BSA for 10 min. Then the media and cells were harvested and measured by scintillation counting (15Grimmer S. Ying M. Walchli S. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Traffic. 2005; 6: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Pulldown Assays with Purified GST-AnxA6—Cells were incubated with and without 30 μg/ml cholesterol, placed in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm CaCl2 plus protease inhibitors), scraped, and centrifuged. Then 75 μg of GST-AnxA6 and 21 μg of GST were incubated for 90 min with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing with lysis buffer, Sepharose-bound GST-AnxA6 (and GST as control) was then incubated with 600 μg of cell extract for 2 h at 4 °C, and proteins bound to the column were collected by centrifugation and analyzed by Western blotting.Immunoprecipitation—CHO and CHOanx6 cells grown on 100-mm dishes were transfected with pEGFP-cPLA2. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline and solubilizing by scraping with a rubber policeman in TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin) followed by gentle rotation for 10 min at 4 °C, lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants of transfected or not transfected cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP or polyclonal anti-annexin A6 antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C and then for 60 min after the addition of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in TGH supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and then once without NaCl. 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used to separate proteins. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P and immunoblotted using anti-annexin A6 or anti-GFP followed by the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as described elsewhere (19Pons M. Ihrke G. Koch S. Biermer M. Pol A. Grewal T. Jackle S. Enrich C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For anti-cPLA2 labeling, cells were fixed with cold methanol for 2 min. For double labeling with anti-cPLA2 and anti-α-mannosidase II, cells were first fixed with cold methanol followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 min. Finally, samples were mounted in the anti-fading media Mowiol (Calbiochem), and cells were observed using an oil immersion Plan-Apo63x/1.4 objective in an Axio-plan Zeiss microscope. Images were captured with an AxioCam HRc camera and were digitally treated with Axio-Vision 3.1 software. In some experiments a Leica TCS SL laser-scanning confocal spectral microscope (Leica Microsystems) with argon and HeNe lasers attached to a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope was used. Image analysis was performed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. To quantify the fluorescence intensity staining, images were captured using identical contrast and exposure times. Using NIH image software (Image J), the area to be quantified (the plasma membrane) was selected, the pixel intensity was determined, and the average staining intensity (20 cells from 3 experiments) was calculated. Colocalization of cPLA2 and α-mannosidase II was quantified using the Image J program (National Institutes of Health) and the “Highlighting Colocalization” plugin (Pierre Bourdoncle, Institut Jacques Monod, Service Imagerie, Paris), which highlights the colocalized points of two images. Two points were considered to colocalize if their intensity was higher than 50%, and an image of colocalized points was generated. Then in each cell the Golgi was defined as the region of interest, and the co-localization (%) therein was calculated. In each experiment at least 50 cells per cell line were analyzed. In some experiments the colocalization of mannosidase II with transiently transfected GFP-cPLA2 was analyzed. The transfection procedures have been described elsewhere (11Cubells L. Vila de Muga S.

Martin S. Fernandez M.A. Ingelmo-Torres M. Ferguson C. Enrich C. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2091-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For visualization of GFP, images were acquired using 63× oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.32; 488 nm laser line; excitation beam splitter RSP 500, emission range detection 500-600 nm). The confocal pinhole was set at 2-3 Airy units to minimize changes in fluorescence due to GFP-tagged proteins moving away from the plane of focus. The whole cytoplasm, except the Golgi of a GFP fusion protein transfected cell, was photobleached using 50-80 scans with the 488-nm laser line at full power. Pre- and post-bleach images were monitored at 30-s intervals for 40 min. The excitation intensity was attenuated down to ∼5% of the half laser power to avoid significant photobleaching. The relative loss of fluorescence intensity in the unbleached region of interest and overall photobleaching in the whole cell during the time series were quantified using Image Processing Leica Confocal Software. Background fluorescence was measured in a random field outside of the cells. Fluorescence correction and normalization of GFP-tagged proteins were calculated according to Rabut and Ellenberg (20Rabut G. Ellenberg J. Goldman R.D. Spector D.L. Live Imaging: A Laboratory Manual.

All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. In brief, 4-5 × 109 cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, twice with BB (breaking buffer; 0.25 m sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and finally resuspended in four volumes of BB. Cells were homogenized by passing 25 times through a ball-bearing homogenizer (Balch homogenizer), which disrupts early and late endosomes, but not Golgi vesicles, and brought to a sucrose concentration of 37% (w/w) by the addition of 62% (w/w) sucrose. 14 ml of sample was overlaid with 15 ml of 35% (w/w) sucrose and 9 ml of 29% (w/w) sucrose (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 2.5 h at 25,000 rpm. Typically, 2 ml of a Golgi-enriched membrane fraction was recovered at the 35-29% interphase. In some experiments, before homogenization cells were preincubated with and without cholesterol for 90 min (30 μg/ml). The purity of the isolated Golgi membranes was confirmed by Western blot analysis with markers for Golgi (TGN38, GM130, GMAP210), early and late endosomes (Rab5, Rab7), plasma membrane (Na+K+ ATPase), and endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL; data not shown).Western Blot Analysis—CHOwt, CHOanx6, and HeLa cell lysates, samples from isolated Golgi membranes, and GST-AnxA6 pulldown assays were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) followed by incubation with primary antibodies and the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

To address whether the AnxA6-dependent reduction of cholesterol export from late endosomes (11Cubells L. Vila de Muga S. Tebar F. Wood P. Evans R. Ingelmo-Torres M. Calvo M. Gaus K. Pol A. Grewal T. Enrich C.

(15Grimmer S. Ying M. Walchli S. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Traffic. 2005; 6: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CHOwt express very low amounts of AnxA6 (4Grewal T. Heeren J.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5809-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas AnxA6 levels in CHOanx6 are rather similar to AnxA6 expression levels in other commonly used cell lines, such as HeLa (11Cubells L. Vila de Muga S. Tebar F. Wood P. Evans R. Ingelmo-Torres M. Calvo M. Gaus K. Pol A. Grewal T. Enrich C. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1568-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, both cell lines express comparable levels of cPLA2 (Fig. 1B). Importantly, these experiments clearly showed a 1.5-2.0-fold reduction of [3H]AA release in CHOanx6 cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A).To find out whether AnxA6 down-regulation leads to increased cPLA2 activity, HeLa cells, which express high levels of AnxA6 (11Cubells L. Vila de Muga S. Tebar F. Wood P. Evans R. Ingelmo-Torres M. Calvo M. Gaus K. Pol A. Grewal T. Enrich C. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1568-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C), were transfected with RNAi targeting AnxA6 (RNAi-AnxA6), and the release of AA was measured. Upon AnxA6 knockdown, the cellular release of AA increased significantly (2.0-fold, Fig. 1C). RNAi-GFP-transfected cells were used as a control and did not show any changes in the release of AA. Then, to address if reduced cPLA2 activity could be overcome by the addition of exogenous cholesterol in AnxA6-expressing cells, [3H]AA-labeled CHOwt and CHOanx6 cells were incubated with and without cholesterol, and the amount of released radioactivity was determined as described above (Fig. 1D). Similar to the results described in Fig. 1A, release of [3H]AA is reduced in CHOanx6 cells compared with the controls (100 ± 6 and 65 ± 7% for CHOwt and CHOanx6, respectively). In agreement with previous data (15Grimmer S. Ying M. Walchli S. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Traffic. 2005; 6: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), exogenous cholesterol increased cPLA2 activity 1.54 ± 0.10- and 2.12 ± 0.37-fold in both cell lines, respectively (n = 3). Thus, the addition of cholesterol compensates for the inhibitory effect of AnxA6 on cPLA2 activity in CHOanx6 cells to result in a release of [3H]AA, which is comparable with that of the controls. It is tempting to speculate that the retention of cholesterol in late endosomes of CHOanx6 cells (11Cubells L. Vila de Muga S. Tebar F. Wood P. Evans R. Ingelmo-Torres M. Calvo M. Gaus K. Pol A. Grewal T. Enrich C. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1568-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) leads to an impaired supply of cholesterol for cPLA2, thereby interfering with Golgi vesiculation.Impaired Translocation of cPLA2 to the Golgi Complex in AnxA6-expressing Cells—Then, to address if elevated AnxA6 levels perturb cPLA2 translocation to the Golgi, we isolated Golgi membranes from CHOwt and CHOanx6 cells and compared the amount of cPLA2. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A) revealed reduced cPLA2 levels in the Golgi-enriched membrane fraction of CHOanx6 cells. Because CHOanx6 are characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes leading to reduced cholesterol levels in the Golgi (11Cubells L. Vila de Muga S. Tebar F. Wood P. Evans R. Ingelmo-Torres M. Calvo M. Gaus K. Pol A. Grewal T. Enrich C. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1568-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we concluded that reduced cPLA2 levels in the Golgi of CHOanx6 cells could be due to an ineffective delivery of cholesterol from late endosomes to the Golgi complex. In support of this hypothesis, treatment of CHOwt cells with U18666A, a pharmacological agent to accumulate cholesterol in late endosomes, also resulted in a clear reduction of cPLA2 in the Golgi fractions without affecting total amounts of cPLA2 (Fig. 2B, compare the second and fourth lanes). To confirm these findings by means of immunofluorescence microscopy, the staining pattern of cPLA2 and a Golgi marker (α-mannosidase II) in CHOwt and CHOanx6 was compared (Fig. 3A). In both cell lines punctuate and in part diffuse staining of cPLA2 was observed throughout the cell and was more intense in the perinuclear region, in particular in CHOwt cells. In the CHOanx6 cell line, cPLA2 appeared cytosolic with minor cPLA2 staining detected within the Golgi complex as judged by colocalization with anti-α-mannosidase II and anti-cPLA2 (see Fig. 3A, arrows in panel a-c). Quantification of fluorescence intensity confirmed the increased co-localization (∼3-fold) of cPLA2 with α-mannosidase II in CHOwt compared with CHOanx6 cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, when Golgi membranes were isolated from CHOwt or CHOanx6 cells in the presence of cholesterol (90 min) and analyzed by Western blotting, a significant increase of cPLA2 levels was observed (Fig. 3C). Thus, in CHOanx6 cells the reduced localization of cPLA2 in the Golgi correlates with a decreased enzymatic activity of cPLA2 (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2Cholesterol impaired translocation of cPLA2 into Golgi membranes. A, reduced cPLA2 levels in Golgi fractions isolated from CHOanx6 cells (anx6) compared with controls (wt) are shown. AnxA6 expression does not affect cPLA2 levels in whole cell lysates (WCL, A and B). B, cPLA2 levels in isolated Golgi fractions from CHOwt cells with and without U18666A were analyzed. cPLA2 is not detectable in the Golgi fraction upon U18666A treatment, indicating that cPLA2 translocation to the Golgi requires late endosomal cholesterol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

https://openalex.org/W1984879522,"Experimental data and homology modeling suggest a structure for the exofacial configuration of the Glut1 glucose transporter in which 8 transmembrane helices form an aqueous cavity in the bilayer that is stabilized by four outer helices. The role of transmembrane segment 6, predicted to be an outer helix in this model, was examined by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and the substituted cysteine accessibility method using the membrane-impermeant, sulfhydryl-specific reagent, p-chloromercuribenzene-sulfonate (pCMBS). A fully functional Glut1 molecule lacking all 6 native cysteine residues was used as a template to produce a series of 21 Glut1 point mutants in which each residue along helix 6 was individually changed to cysteine. These mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their expression levels, functional activities, and sensitivities to inhibition by pCMBS were determined. Cysteine substitutions at Leu(204) and Pro(205) abolished transport activity, whereas substitutions at Ile(192), Pro(196), Gln(200), and Gly(201) resulted in inhibition of activity that ranged from approximately 35 to approximately 80%. Cysteine substitutions at Leu(188), Ser(191), and Leu(199) moderately augmented specific transport activity relative to the control. These results were dramatically different from those previously reported for helix 12, the structural cognate of helix 6 in the pseudo-symmetrical structural model, for which none of the 21 single-cysteine mutants exhibited reduced activity. Only the substitution at Leu(188) conferred inhibition by pCMBS, suggesting that most of helix 6 is not exposed to the external solvent, consistent with its proposed role as an outer helix. These data suggest that helix 6 contains amino acid side chains that are critical for transport activity and that structurally analogous outer helices may play distinct roles in the function of membrane transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2049717891,"Many proteins involved in DNA replication and repair undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; a homotrimeric protein that encircles double-stranded DNA to function as a sliding clamp for DNA polymerases) is monoubiquitylated by the RAD6-RAD18 complex and further polyubiquitylated by the RAD5-MMS2-UBC13 complex in response to various DNA-damaging agents. PCNA mono- and polyubiquitylation activate an error-prone translesion synthesis pathway and an error-free pathway of damage avoidance, respectively. Here we show that replication factor C (RFC; a heteropentameric protein complex that loads PCNA onto DNA) was also ubiquitylated in a RAD18-dependent manner in cells treated with alkylating agents or H2O2. A mutant form of RFC2 with a D228A substitution (corresponding to a yeast Rfc4 mutation that reduces an interaction with replication protein A (RPA), a single-stranded DNA-binding protein) was heavily ubiquitylated in cells even in the absence of DNA damage. Furthermore RFC2 was ubiquitylated by the RAD6-RAD18 complex in vitro, and its modification was inhibited in the presence of RPA. The inhibitory effect of RPA on RFC2 ubiquitylation was relatively specific because RAD6-RAD18-mediated ubiquitylation of PCNA was RPA-insensitive. Our findings suggest that RPA plays a regulatory role in DNA damage responses via repression of RFC2 ubiquitylation in human cells.

Our findings suggest that RPA plays a regulatory role in DNA damage responses via repression of RFC2 ubiquitylation in human cells. Cellular DNA is continuously damaged by a vast variety of endogenous and exogenous genotoxicants. When genomic DNA is damaged, cells respond by activation of complex signaling networks that delay cell cycle progression, induce repair of lesions, activate damage tolerance pathways, and trigger apoptosis or senescence (1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 2Carr A.M. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that DNA damage-inducible signaling pathways serve important tumor-suppressive roles and prevent mutations that could lead to malignancy. Various genotoxins elicit different forms of DNA damage and result in distinct signal transduction pathways and biological outcomes. Distal steps of DNA damage-induced checkpoint signaling pathways that result in inhibition of the cell cycle are relatively well understood (3Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 4Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). However, molecular details of proximal signaling events and lesion-specific DNA damage recognition events are less clear. DNA replication and repair require the coordinated actions of multiple proteins on small regions of DNA. A limited number of proteins serve to coordinate multiple replication and repair events. Some proteins function commonly in DNA replication and repair and frequently have a crucial role in both processes. Three such examples are replication protein A (RPA), 2The abbreviations used are: RPAreplication protein APCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRFCreplication factor CPolpolymeraseRLCRFC-like complexHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineHUhydroxyureaMMSmethyl methanesulfonateSupsupernatantE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseAPapurinic/apyrimidinic. proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and replication factor C (RFC). RPA was originally identified as a eukaryotic single-stranded DNA-binding protein essential for in vitro replication of SV40 DNA (5Bochkareva E. Korolev S. Lees-Miller S.P. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PCNA is a trimer of three identical subunits arranged head-to-tail to generate a ringlike structure with a large central cavity for encircling DNA. It is well established that PCNA provides a mobile platform to serve as anchor and processivity factor for DNA polymerases during chromosomal replication (7Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Wyman C. Botchan M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 334-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PCNA is loaded onto the primer-template junction in an ATP-dependent manner by a multiprotein clamp loader, RFC (9Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell.

RPA, PCNA, and RFC are key proteins that play central roles in DNA replication, participating in competitive polymerase switching during lagging strand synthesis. The DNA polymerase α-primase complex (Pol α) that synthesizes an RNA-DNA hybrid primer requires contact with RPA to remain stably attached to the primed site. For processive DNA synthesis to follow, Pol α must be replaced by DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ). Replacement of Pol α by Pol δ is initiated by interactions between RFC and RPA that disrupt Pol α-RPA interactions and result in removal of Pol α from DNA. After RFC loads PCNA onto the primed site, Pol δ associates with PCNA by displacing RFC. The switching process is indeed coordinated by RPA via cooperative interactions with PCNA and RFC (11Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1961-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RPA, RFC, and PCNA also play key roles in DNA repair by interacting with many DNA repair enzymes (13Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 14Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 15Zou Y. Liu Y. Wu X. Shell S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Such interactions are believed to play roles in DNA damage recognition and in recruiting and positioning of DNA repair enzymes. RFC consists of five different subunits, which are homologous to one another and are members of the AAA+ family of ATPases (16Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RFC1(p140) subunit is sometimes referred to as the “large subunit” as it contains both N- and C-terminal extensions beyond its region of homology with the four “small” subunits. The four small RFC subunits are designated RFC2(p40), RFC3(p36), RFC4(p37), and RFC5(p38) in mammals. Three protein complexes with resemblance to RFC that are involved in maintaining genome stability have been described recently. These RFC-like complexes (RLCs) share four common small subunits (RFC2–5), and each carries a unique large subunit (RAD17, CTF18, or ELG1) replacing the RFC1. These RLCs are involved in the checkpoint response (RAD17-RFC), sister chromatid cohesion (CTF18-RFC), and maintenance of genome stability (ELG1-RFC) (18Kim J. MacNeill S.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R873-R875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). DNA damage sensors and repair proteins must react in a rapid and efficient manner to execute their functions. Frequently the regulation of these proteins involves post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, to help modulate the assembly and disassembly of complexes and to assist targeting and the regulation of enzymatic activity in a timely manner. For example, RPA is hyperphosphorylated upon DNA damage or replication stress by several checkpoint kinases (20Zernik-Kobak M. Vasunia K. Connelly M. Anderson C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23896-23904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation alters RPA-DNA and RPA-protein interactions (15Zou Y. Liu Y. Wu X. Shell S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21Wu X. Shell S.M. Zou Y. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4728-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent studies in the DNA repair field have highlighted the expanding role of ubiquitylation in the regulation of diverse DNA repair processes and pathways. One of the most striking examples of how ubiquitylation can affect protein function is that of PCNA in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Following DNA damage, PCNA can be monoubiquitylated or polyubiquitylated on the Lys-164 residue, and each modification results in a different outcome with respect to DNA synthesis and repair (22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 23Stelter P. Ulrich H.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitylated PCNA directs translesion synthesis via error-prone DNA polymerases, whereas polyubiquitylated PCNA is associated with an error-free DNA repair pathway (22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 23Stelter P. Ulrich H.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Mammalian PCNA also undergoes monoubiquitylation after UV irradiation, and monoubiquitylated PCNA preferentially binds to translesion synthesis polymerases that contain one or two copies of ubiquitin-binding domains (24Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M.

Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In contrast to RPA and PCNA, damage-dependent modification of RFC has not been described. Recent studies have significantly broadened the scope of the role of ubiquitylation to include regulatory functions in DNA repair and damage response pathways. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether the clamp loader RFC is likewise subjected to regulated modification. We examined the modification of all subunits in RFC and RLCs. We demonstrated that RFC2 and RFC4 are ubiquitylated following treatment of cells with alkylating agents. The ubiquitylation was partially dependent on RAD18. Surprisingly RPA inhibited the RAD18-dependent ubiquitylation of RFC2. Our results suggest that RFC regulates the DNA damage response pathway via interaction with RPA and ubiquitylation. Plasmid Constructs—To generate pCDNA·RFC2(p40)FLAG and pCDNA·RFC2(p40)HA, human p40 coding region was amplified by PCR as an EcoRI-XhoI fragment. The PCR product was inserted into the EcoRI-XhoI site either of pCDNA-C-FLAG or pCDNA-C-HA. To generate pCAGGS·RFC2(p40), the human p40 coding region was amplified by PCR as a SalI-XhoI fragment. The PCR product was inserted into the XhoI site of pCAGGS. pCDNA-C-FLAG and pCDNA-C-HA was constructed by inserting the FLAG or HA epitope into the XhoI-XbaI site of pCDNA3.1. Expression plasmids containing human RFC1-FLAG, human FLAG-RAD17, human FLAG-CTF18, human FLAG-p38, human FLAG-p37, and human FLAG-p36 were constructed by inserting their cDNA described previously (28Shiomi Y. Shinozaki A. Nakada D. Sugimoto K. Usukura J. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) into pCDNA3. Although N-terminally and C-terminally tagged forms of each RFC2 subunit were used, the presence of the epitope tag did not affect RFC2 regulation at least in the context of experiments reported in this study. pCAGGS·FLAG-Ubiquitin and pCAGGS·hRAD18 were constructed as described previously (25Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for human RFC and PCNA were described earlier (29Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Masuda Y. Suzuki M. Piao J. Gu Y. Tsurimoto T. Kamiya K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6904-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and that for human RPA, p11d-tRPA (31Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a generous gift of Dr. Marc S. Wold (University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA). Mouse E1 expression vector RLC (32Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 33Imai N. Kaneda S. Nagai Y. Seno T. Ayusawa D. Hanaoka F. Yamao F. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Hideyo Yasuda (School of Life Science, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Tokyo, Japan). Human cDNAs for RAD6A and RAD18 amplified from a HeLa cDNA library by PCR introducing a NdeI site at the start codon were cloned together into pET20b(+) (Novagen) as an artificial operon. After cloning the PCR fragments, the nucleotide sequences were verified. All the expression plasmids of PCNA, RPA, RFC, E1, RAD6A, and RAD18 were designed for production of intact proteins without any affinity tags. Cell Culture and Transfection—293A and HCT116 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HCT116 RAD18-/-cells were established as described previously (25Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.4 μg of plasmid DNA was used to transfect each 6-cm plate of cells. Transfected cells were treated with genotoxins 24 h post-transfection. Genotoxin and Inhibitor Treatments—Asynchronous cell cultures were grown to approximately 80% confluency. For UV treatment, cells were washed with PBS, and exposed to UV light (254 nm) at a fluence rate of 43 J m-2/s. For genotoxin and inhibitor treatment, hydroxyurea (HU; 1 m in H2O), aphidicolin (dissolved in Me2SO), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; dissolved in Me2SO), ethyl methanesulfonate (dissolved in Me2SO), N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (dissolved in Me2SO), H2O2 (diluted in PBS), mitomycin C, bleomycin (dissolved in H2O), or camptothecin (dissolved in Me2SO) was added to the culture media to give a final concentration of 2 mm, 0.025 mm, 0.1–1.7 mm, 20 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.01 mm, 0.05 mg/ml, or 20 nm, respectively, and cells were exposed for 8 h unless otherwise stated. Antibodies—A mouse monoclonal antibody against Drosophila RFC40 (anti-dRFC40) was used for probing human RFC2(p40). A hybridoma cell line producing anti-dRFC40 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Gerald M. Rubin (University of California, Berkeley), and monoclonal antibody was purified as described previously (34Harrison S.D. Solomon N. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1701-1709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether anti-dRFC40 antibody cross-reacts with human RFC2(p40), an HA epitope-tagged form of hRFC2(p40) was overexpressed in 293A cells by transfection, and cell lysate was recovered 24 h post-transfection and then immunoblotted with either anti-dRFC40 or anti-HA antibody. An anti-dRFC40-reactive protein band migrating at 40 kDa was clearly observed only in extracts from HA-hRFC2(p40)-transfected cells and corresponded to the species detected with an anti-HA antibody (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, the anti-dRFC40 antibody recognizes human RFC2(p40). To avoid confusion we refer to the anti-dRFC40 antibody as “anti-RFC2” antibody in this study. Other commercial antibodies used in this study were: anti-HA (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-RFC1 (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RAD17 (H-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-tubulin (B-5-1-2, Sigma), anti-histone H3 (6.6.2, Upstate; and ab1791, Abcam), and anti-PCNA (PC10, Oncogene). Preparation of Cell Lysate and Chromatin Fraction—293A cells in a 3.5- or 6-cm dish were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then harvested into radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor (Nacalai)). The cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min on ice, and then the Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS-insoluble fraction and -soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation. The soluble fraction was used as the supernatant (Sup) fraction. The resultant pellet was washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer four times and then sonicated after adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer (7% glycerol, 22% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% β-mercaptoethanol). The resultant solution was used as the chromatin fraction. We confirmed that there were few contaminations in each Sup and chromatin fraction using anti-tubulin and anti-histone H3 antibodies (supplemental Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cell extracts were resolved by electrophoresis by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose filters, the blots were incubated with antibodies, and immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences; or DURA, Pierce) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-RFC2 (dRFC4(p40)) antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then with 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation for overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed with PBS three times and boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min, and the bound proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Protein Purification—Human RFC, PCNA, and RPA were purified as described previously (29Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Masuda Y. Suzuki M. Piao J. Gu Y. Tsurimoto T. Kamiya K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6904-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mouse E1 was overproduced in insect cells and purified as described previously (35Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human RAD6A-RAD18 complex was overproduced in Escherichia coli cells and then purified by column chromatography (phosphocellulose, heparin-Sepharose, Mono Q, and gel filtration) from E. coli cell lysate. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 33 fmol of singly primed single-stranded M13 mp18 DNA (30Masuda Y. Suzuki M. Piao J. Gu Y. Tsurimoto T. Kamiya K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6904-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 1.0 μg (9.1 pmol) of RPA, 86 ng (1.0 pmol as a trimer) of PCNA, 75 ng (260 fmol) of RFC, 100 ng (850 fmol) of mouse E1, 175 ng (2.4 pmol) of RAD6A-RAD18 complex, and 12.5 μg (1460 pmol) of ubiquitin. After incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, reactions were terminated with 2 μl of 300 mm EDTA. Structural Model Building—Homology modeling of the human clamp loader-clamp complex was performed using MODELLER version 7.7 (36Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The homologous structures were defined using the fold recognition server FORTE (37Tomii K. Akiyama Y. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 594-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinate of the clamp-clamp loader complex (Protein Data Bank code 1SXJ) was selected as a template for model building. Before submission to MODELLER, the sequence-structure alignment obtained from FORTE was used. Due to the lack of the template structure, the N-terminal 582 residues of human RFC1 were not modeled. The figures were prepared using MOLMOL (38Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). Coloring of each RFC subunit and PCNA was according to Fig. 2 in the review by Bowman et al. (39Bowman G.D. Goedken E.R. Kazmirski S.L. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Specific DNA-damaging Agents Induce Modification of RFC2— To analyze the modification of each subunit of the RFC complex, a FLAG epitope-tagged form of each subunit of RFC and RLCs was expressed in human 293A cells. Transfected cells were treated with UV irradiation, γ-ray, HU, or MMS, and then cell extracts were prepared. The cell extracts were separated into Nonidet P-40-insoluble chromatin fractions and -soluble fractions (Sup). RFC and RLC subunits in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Following MMS treatment all of the subunits, except for CTF18 and RFC5, accumulated in the chromatin fraction, whereas no accumulation was observed following treatments with UV irradiation, γ-ray, or HU. Levels of soluble CTF18 and RFC5 decreased after MMS treatment, although we did not detect concomitant increases in the chromatin-bound levels of these subunits (Fig. 1A). Taken together, the results of Fig. 1A demonstrate that the levels and subcellular distribution of RFC and RLC subunits are regulated in response to MMS. It was important to determine whether endogenous RFC and RLC subunits were also redistributed to chromatin in response to MMS. Therefore, we determined the effects of MMS on endogenous RFC1, RAD17, or RFC2 proteins for which good antibodies are available. As shown in Fig. 1B, endogenous RFC1, RAD17, and RFC2 accumulated in the chromatin fraction of MMS-treated 293A cells. Similar to ectopically expressed tagged proteins, endogenous RFC subunits were redistributed to chromatin in response to MMS treatment. Interestingly we observed prominent forms of ectopically expressed RFC2 and RFC4 that migrated with reduced electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE gels in chromatin fractions from MMS-treated 293A cells (Fig. 1A, lane 7). Electrophoretically retarded species of endogenous RFC2 were also evident in chromatin fractions of MMS-treated 293A cells (Fig. 1B, lane 7). The electrophoretically shifted form of RFC2 was more prominent than that of RFC4 (Fig. 1A). Therefore we focused on RFC2 and further analyzed its MMS-induced modification. We performed quantitative analyses to determine the amount of chromatin-bound RFC2 relative to the soluble fraction in MMS-treated cells. In 293A cells ectopically expressing HA-tagged RFC2, more than 90% of the RFC2 accumulated in the chromatin fraction following 8 h of MMS treatment, whereas in untreated cells, less than 10% of RFC2 was present in the chromatin fraction (supplemental Fig. 3). Following MMS treatment, we consistently detected two electrophoretically retarded anti-RFC2-reactive proteins in the chromatin fraction. The apparent molecular mass of electrophoretically retarded RFC2 is consistent with ubiquitylation. The two putative ubiquitylated forms of RFC2 (shown in Fig. 1) might correspond to species that are monoubiquitylated on different residues. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that modifications other than ubiquitin are also present on the shifted RFC2. Furthermore smaller anti-RFC2-reactive proteins, possibly corresponding to degradation products, were detected in soluble and chromatin fractions from both control and MMS-treated cells (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 3). The electrophoretically retarded forms of RFC2 were induced by MMS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). At lower concentrations of MMS (0.1 or 0.213 mm), no RFC2 band shift was detectable. However, treatment with higher concentrations of MMS (0.425, 0.85, or 1.7 mm) induced prominent electrophoretically retarded forms of RFC2 on chromatin (Fig. 1C). In the experiments described above, the cells were treated with MMS for 8 h. We subsequently examined the kinetics of RFC2 modification by treating 293A cells with MMS (0.85 mm) for 1 h and preparing samples for immunoblotting at 0, 2, 5, and 8 h following MMS treatment. As shown in Fig. 1D, the shifted forms of RFC2 were detectable by 5 h after treatment of cells with MMS (lane 4). Similar to results of Fig. 1A, the genotoxin-induced RFC2 mobility shift was specific for MMS because UV irradiation (30 J/m2; lanes 7–9) did not induce RFC modification at any time point tested (although as expected, UV irradiation induced PCNA monoubiquitylation under these experimental conditions). Conversely little or no PCNA modification was detectable under the conditions used for the experiment shown in Fig. 1D (lanes 2–5), although low levels of PCNA ubiquitylation were observed when cells were treated with 0.85 mm MMS for longer times (data not shown). The results of Fig. 1, A and D, indicated that MMS-induced RFC2 modification is not a general response to DNA damage. To gain insight into the significance of RFC2 modification, 293A cells ectopically expressing RFC2-HA were treated with a more extensive panel of DNA-damaging agents for 8 h, and proteins in resulting chromatin fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-RFC2 antibody (Fig. 1E, upper panel). DNA-damaging agents we tested included alkylating agents (ethyl methanesulfonate and N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine), an oxidizing agent (H2O2), a DNA cross-linking agent (mitomycin C), double strand break-inducing agents (bleomycin and ionizing radiation), and the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. Of the genotoxic agents tested, only ethyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and H2O2 induced the shifted RFC2 band evident in MMS-treated cells (Fig. 1E, upper panel, lanes 7–10). Many of the agents failing to induce the RFC2 band shift nevertheless induced very robust PCNA monoubiquitylation (Fig. 1E, lower panel). Therefore, we conclude that RFC2 modification is a specific response to a subset of genotoxins. RAD18-dependent Ubiquitylation of Human RFC2—To test whether the shifted RFC2-specific band in MMS-treated cells was due to ubiquitylation, RFC2-HA was co-expressed with FLAG-tagged ubiquitin in 293A cells. The transfected cells were treated with MMS. Endogenous and HA-tagged RFC2 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-RFC2 antibody from cell lysates, and the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with either anti-RFC2 (Fig. 2A, upper panel) or anti-FLAG antibody to detect FLAG-ubiquitin-modified proteins (lower panel). Anti-RFC2-reactive bands migrating at the sizes expected for monoubiquitylated RFC2 (48 kDa) were observed in our anti-RFC2 immunoprecipitates (lanes 3 and 4, Ub-RFC2). In addition to the 48-kDa ubiquitin-RFC2 band, two extra, slowly migrating bands (51 and 62 kDa) were observed in the immunoprecipitates obtained from cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (lane 4, Flag-Ub-RFC2) that were also detec"
https://openalex.org/W2159690166,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Here, we developed a model to study the early stage of PAH in SCD. We exposed wild-type and transgenic sickle cell SAD (Hbb(s)/Hbb(s)) mice to hypoxia (8% O(2)) for 7 days. Prolonged hypoxia in SAD mice only induced 1) increased neutrophil count in both bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral circulation; 2) increased BAL IL1beta, IL10, IL6, and TNF-alpha; and 3) up-regulation of the genes endothelin-1, cyclo-oxygenase-2, angiotensin-converting-enzyme, and IL-1beta, suggesting that amplified inflammatory response and activation of the endothelin-1 system may contribute to the early phase of PAH in SCD. Since phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are involved in pulmonary vascular tone regulation, we evaluated gene expression of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) isoforms and of PDE-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, which are the main cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate hydrolyzing enzymes. In SAD mouse lungs, prolonged hypoxia significantly increased PDE-4 and -1 gene expressions. The PDE-4 inhibitor, rolipram, prevented the hypoxia-induced PDE-4 and -1 gene up-regulation and interfered with the development of PAH, most likely through modulation of both vascular tone and inflammatory factors. This finding supports a possible therapeutic use of PDEs inhibitors in the earlier phases of PAH in SCD."

Protein phosphatases and kinases together help control a host of cellular functions (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). Reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine, and threonine side chains represents a fundamental mode of cellular signal transduction, regulating cell growth and differentiation. Protein phosphatases, unlike the protein kinase superfamily, can be classified as members of separate superfamilies that are mechanistically and structurally distinct from one another (2Tonks N.K.

The so-called dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) dephosphorylate both pTyr and pSer/pThr and belong to class I cysteine-based PTPs. Cys-based PTPs and DSPs share the conserved signature motif HCXXGXXRS(T) and exhibit similar mechanisms of catalysis, involving a two-step process that proceeds via formation of a cysteinyl-phosphate enzyme-substrate intermediate (3Zhou G.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation requires phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine with a characteristic TY/TXY motif found within the enzyme activation loop. This reversible process is mediated by either MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) or dual specificity MKPs (DSPs) (4Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). DSPs control MAPK signaling via dephosphorylation and exhibit feedback regulation (5Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). There are ∼65 human genes encoding various DSPs with low sequence similarity with respect to one another (2Tonks N.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The gene encoding dual specificity protein phosphatase 23 (DUSP23) is located on human chromosome 1q23 (6Wu Q. Li Y. Gu S. Li N. Zheng D. Li D. Zheng Z. Ji C. Xie Y. Mao Y. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1542-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DUSP23 (originally erroneously termed DUSP25) encodes a 150-residue protein that has also been referred to as low molecular mass dual specificity phosphatase 3 (LDP-3) and VH1-like phosphatase Z (VHZ). This class I cysteine-based PTP belongs to the intracellular, non-receptor VH1-like, atypical dual specificity phosphatases subfamily. The atypical DSPs represent an ill-defined group of enzymes that are small (<200 residues) and appear devoid of specific MAP kinase-targeting motifs. VHZ possesses distinctive active site signature motif HCXXGXXRS(T) characteristic of VH1-like phosphatase, a virulence factor of Vaccinia virus. VHZ has the DSP motif but lacks CDC25 (CDC; cell division cycle) homology domain found in cell cycle regulator CDC25 phosphatase (6Wu Q. Li Y. Gu S. Li N. Zheng D. Li D. Zheng Z. Ji C. Xie Y. Mao Y. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1542-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In vitro, VHZ can dephosphorylate p44-ERK1 (MAPK3) but not p38 or p54SAPK-β (MAPK10) (6Wu Q. Li Y. Gu S.

Also, in vitro, it is able to enhance activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 (MAPK14) stimulated by several osmotic stress and functions as an enhancer of osmotic stress (7Takagaki K. Satoh T. Tanuma N. Masuda K. Takekawa M. Shima H. Kikuchi K. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The specificity of the VHZ toward selective MAPKs family members might dictate its involvement in different biological functions (6Wu Q. Li Y. Gu S. Li N. Zheng D. Li D. Zheng Z. Ji C. Xie Y. Mao Y. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1542-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we present the x-ray structure of VHZ with a malate ion bound in the catalytic center. A unique arrangement of symmetry-related molecule leads to the docking of a product-like loop in the active site, creating with the bound malate ion a pseudo enzyme-substrate/product complex with Tyr-136′. In this context, Thr-135′–Tyr-136′ mimics the TY motif found with the activation loops of MAP kinases. Mutational and functional analysis of crucial residues at the active site of VHZ, Phe-66, Leu-97, and Phe-99, shed light on their role in substrate binding and catalysis for pNPP, pThr, and pTyr phosphopeptide substrates. Our structure provides insights into protein substrate binding and recognition by VHZ and enhances our understanding of dual specificity phosphatase catalysis. Gene Cloning, Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—The gene for human VHZ (E.C. 3.1.3.48, 3.1.3.16; Swiss-Prot: Q9BVJ7) was amplified using the following PCR primers: forward, 5′-GGCGTGCAGCCCCCCAACTTCTCCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATTTCGTTCGCTGGTAGAACTG-3′, and cloned in pSGX4 (BC) vector. Various mutations of VHZ were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primer sequences used were as follows: F66A; forward, 5′-GCGCATCCCCGAC GCCTGCCCGCCGGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCCGGCGGGCAGGCGTCGGGGATGC-3′, for L97E; forward, 5′-GCACTGTGCTGAGGGCTTTGGCCGCAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTGCGGCCAAAGCCCTCAGCACAGTGC-3′, for L97A; forward, 5′-GCACTGTGCTGCCGGCTTTGGCCGCAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTGCGGCCAAAGCCGGCAGCACAGTGC-3′, and for F99A, forward, 5′-GTGCTCTGGGCGCTGGCCGCACTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGTGCGGCCAGCGCCCAGAGCAC-3′. Sequence-verified clones were then transformed into BL21(DE3)-codon+RIPL cells for the expression. Protein expression and purification followed the standard NYSGXRC protocol (available through pepcDB). Protein Tyrosine and Serine/Threonine Phosphatase Assay—Protein tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatase activity was measured using the Universal tyrosine phosphatase kit and Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Takara and Millipore). Poly(Glu-pTyr) (4:1, 20–50 kDa) and Lys-Arg-pThr-Ile-Arg-Arg were used as substrates for pTyr and pThr phosphatase assays, respectively. Protein concentration of 2.5 μg for pNPP and 20 μg of all mutants and native protein were used for both pThr and pTyr phosphatase activity measurements. Native and all mutants had intact N-terminal small ubiquitin-like modifier tag. Inhibition assays with dl-malic acid were performed with the same tyrosine phosphates assay kit at concentrations of 10–1000 μm. In vitro, VHZ showed phosphatase activity versus pNPP, phospho-peptide PTP, and pSer/Thr substrates, thereby confirming that the protein used for structure determination possesses dual specificity. Crystallization and Data Collection—Diffraction quality crystals of Se-Met protein (small ubiquitin-like modifier tag-cleaved) were obtained in the orthorhombic space group P212121 at room temperature via vapor diffusion against a reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.15 m dl-malic acid, pH 7.0 (1 μl of reservoir solution plus 1 μl of protein at 20 mg/ml). Crystals were frozen by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen using the mother liquor with added glycerol (final concentration = 15% (v/v)). Four x-ray diffraction data sets from four crystals were collected under standard cryogenic conditions at Beamline X29, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and were reduced, merged, and scaled using HKL2000 (8Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The Matthews coefficient was calculated to be 2.03 Å3/Da assuming one molecule/asymmetric unit.

This polypeptide chain forms a five-stranded (β1–β5), twisted β-sheet flanked by five α-helices (α1 and α3–α6) (Fig. 1). The final refined model of VHZ consists of residues 2–150 (excluding the N-terminal methionine), one malate anion, and 114 water molecules. The crystallographic Rfactor and Rfree are 19 and 22%, respectively, and ∼90% of polypeptide backbone φ/ψ combinations occur in most favored regions of the Ramachandran diagram (Table 1). The PTP Loop and the Active Site—The active site of VHZ is composed of a distinctive HCXXGXXRS(T) signature motif, also known as PTP loop, characteristic of cysteine-dependent PTPs. The active site is located within a 6-Å-deep crevice on the surface. The PTP or P-loop region (93–101 amino acids) connects β5 and α4 (Fig. 1) and includes the conserved catalytic Cys-95 that makes a covalent bond with the phosphorous atom of the pTyr/Thr/Ser substrate during catalysis (3Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding pocket is also lined by hydrophobic side chains (Ala-96, Leu-97, Gly-98, Phe-99, and Gly-100) and a positively charged residue, Arg-101 (Fig. 2, a and b). In some cases, larger hydrophobic residues such as Leu or Met replace Ala-96. In a few cases, His replaces Leu-97. Only Gly-98 and Arg-101 are conserved. Kinetic studies suggest that this conserved Arg plays an important role in substrate binding and transition state stabilization (15Zhang Z.Y. Malachowski W.P. Van Etten R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the C95S mutant of VHZ showed essentially no phosphatase activity (6Wu Q. Li Y. Gu S. Li N. Zheng D. Li D. Zheng Z. Ji C. Xie Y. Mao Y. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1542-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In our structure, Cys-95 interacts with O2 and O3 of malate ion, N′ of Ala-96 and Gly-98 and the partially conserved Thr-102 (Ser in many other phosphatases) of the active site motif (HCXXGXXRS(T)) (Table 2). Hydrogen bonding interaction and stabilization of the cysteinyl anion to OG/OG1 of Ser/Thr is likely to reduce the pKa of the thiol, thereby allowing it to participate in catalysis (19Rossi R. Barra D. Bellelli A. Boumis G. Canofeni S. Di Simplicio P. Lusini L. Pascarella S. Amiconi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19198-19206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When the residue corresponding to Thr-102 is mutated to Ala in VHR (S131A) and PTP1 (S222A), remarkable decreases in activity were observed without affecting substrate binding and formation of the covalent catalytic intermediate (20Chen L. Montserat J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Hengge A.C. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7084-7092Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction of Cys-95 with OG1 of Thr-102 and also its exposure to solvent both appear important for its catalysis (19Rossi R. Barra D. Bellelli A. Boumis G. Canofeni S. Di Simplicio P.

In vitro, the active site cysteine undergoes reversible oxidation and inactivation via conversion of the cysteine thiolate to sulfenic acid (SOH). Further oxidation steps lead to irreversible activation via formation of sulfinic (SO2H) and then sulfonic acid (SO3H) (22den Hertog J.

The conserved Asp-65 acts as a general acid/base catalyst during dephosphorylation and is thought to interact directly with pTyr or pSer/pThr in peptide substrates (23Zhang Z. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, mutational studies revealed that the D65A mutant virtually abolishes phosphatase activity, indicating that it is important for catalytic activity (6Wu Q. Li Y. Gu S. Li N. Zheng D. Li D. Zheng Z. Ji C. Xie Y. Mao Y. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1542-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A HingeProt analysis from BioInfo3D suggests that Arg-62 and Gln-79 represent hinge residues, giving flexibility to the WPD loop. For other phosphatases, the ligand-induced-closed conformation of WPD loop is correlated with the ligand/phosphate binding. Transition from the open to the closed conformation of the WPD loop occurs on substrate binding, suggesting that the flexibility of the WDP loop contributes to substrate specificity (24Yang J. Niu T. Zhang A. Mishra A.K. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Cell Biochem. 2001; 84: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In our structure, Arg-101 of the PTP loop sits near the WPD loop, where it makes a salt bridge with Asp-65, creating a closed conformation. Putative Enzyme-hydrolyzed Substrate/Product Complex—In the presence of the malate ion, enzymatic activity versus pTyr substrates is reduced via weak competitive inhibition (IC50 ∼ 500 μm). In the crystal structure, the malate ion makes a total of 14 interactions with the PTP loop and one with the WPD loop, thereby stabilizing both loops (Table 2, Fig. 2a). This pattern of protein-ion interactions is similar to that seen for a sulfate ion in the structure of VHR (PDB ID: 1VHR) (25Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b) and the substrate phosphate moiety in a structure of PTP1b (PDB ID: 1EEN and 1EEO) (26Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). O2, O3, and O4 of the malate ion serve as mimics for three of the four phosphate oxygen atoms of pTyr (Table 2, Fig. 2, a and b). It is remarkable that Tyr-136 of a symmetry-related copy of VHZ (designated with a prime) docks in the enzyme active site binding to Asp-65 of the WPD loop and Arg-101 of the PTP loop (Fig. 3, Table 2). Together, Asp-65 and Arg-101 form a salt bridge, giving rise to the catalytically competent closed conformation of the enzyme. Leu-97, Phe-99, and Phe-66 appear crucial for stabilizing the position of the phenyl ring of Tyr-136′, as seen with Ala-217 and Ile-219 and Phe-182 in the PTP1b-substrate complex structure (PDB ID: 1EEN). Phe-66 is highly conserved in VHZ orthologs. The relative spatial arrangement of the bound malate ion and the docked Tyr-136′ side chain mimics an enzyme-substrate complex (Figs. 3 and 4). To the best of our knowledge, the present structure reveals for first time stabilization of Asp-65 so as to permit donation of a proton to the transition state phenoxide, thereby generating the tyrosine-leaving group. A number of groups have previously suggested that the conserved active site Asp (Asp-65 in VHZ) stabilizes the dissociative transition state for enzyme-product formation and helps in the departure of leaving phenoxide (21Hengge A.C.

In a previously published structure, the C215S mutant form of PTP1b bound to a small peptide substrate, the Asp of the WPD loop was observed to be in a different, non-productive rotamer conformation placing the side chain oxygen atom ∼6.8 Å from the OH4 of the pTyr substrate (29Sarmiento M.

Both hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions are involved in stabilizing this enzyme-product complex. In addition to contacts with the Tyr of TY motif itself, Phe-66 makes a π -π stacking aromatic interaction with Phe-143′, and the side chain oxygen atoms of Glu-134 interact with NZ of Lys-140′ and NE2 and OE1 of Gln-144′ (Fig. 4, a and b). The backbone oxygen atom of Phe-66 also interacts with the side chain of Gln-147′. These findings also suggest that residues C-terminal to the TY motif may represent determinants of VHZ substrate specificity. Comparison of our structure with enzyme-substrate-peptide complex structures of PTP1b (PDB IDs: 1EEO and 1EEN) and VHR (1J4X) revealed interesting similarities and differences with respect to substrate orientation and WPD loop conformation. PTP1b dephosphorylates phospho-Tyr residues in many receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor, insulin, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (29Sarmiento M. Puius Y.A. Vetter S.W. Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhao Y. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, VHR shows specificity for both ERK1 and ERK2 in vitro (30Schumacher M.A. Todd J.L. Rice A.E. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which may be explained by the extended nature of the interactions observed between VHR (via N-terminal CDC homology domain) and its peptide substrate (Fig. 5a). Unexpectedly, the orientation of the bound peptide in our VHZ enzyme-product complex more closely resembles that seen for PTP1b than for VHR (Fig. 5, a and b). The docking of the phospho-group is similar in all three (malate in VHZ), but the substrate recognition is different, which is due to the variations in residues not only lining the active site pocket but also other regions away from the active site. PTP1b and VHR show difference in recognition of substrate peptides. In VHR, the phosphate moiety of the pThr of the biphosphorylated (pThr-XpTyr) substrate is stabilized by Arg-158 and Asn-41. If ERK1/ERK2 were to bind similarly to VHZ two major variations between them do not support the same: 1) Phe-66 and not Asp-65 of VHZ superimposes with the catalytic Asp of WPD loop of VHR and 2) Ala-20 in VHZ corresponds to Asn-41 of VHR; also, Arg-129 (analogous to Arg-158 of VHR) is buried and shielded by Asn7. Accordingly, for a similar mode of binding in VHZ, a drastic conformational change of WPD loop may be necessary. However, no conformation change is observed between the native and complex structures of VHR. In VHZ and PTP1b, due to high similarities in residues lining the active pocket, the orientation of the substrate is similar in both except for the fact that VHZ lacks interactions seen between PTP1b substrate and the PTP1b-N-terminal regions (46–49 amino acids). Accordingly, the symmetry-related molecule docking loop along with its Tyr-136′ is displaced by ∼4.8Åas compared with PTP1b substrate peptide toward Asp-65 and Arg-101 (Fig. 6). This is probably because it is a leaving Tyr and not pTyr. However, the stacking of Phe-66 and Tyr-136′ is preserved, as seen in PTP1b complex. In 1EEO, the distance between pTyr-OH4 and Asp-181 OD1 is ∼6.7 Å, and either Asp-181 or pTyr or both need to move to come closer to facilitate the hydrolysis (Fig. 6). Tyrosine of pTyr upon hydrolysis is expected to move a little away from the phosphate but will need to interact with Asp of WPD loop that donates proton before it leaves the active site. In the current structure, Tyr-136′ makes close interaction with Asp-65 and Arg-101, and their role in dissociation is clearly revealed for the first time structurally (Figs. 5, a and b, and 6). In our structure, Tyr-136′ represents the hydrolyzed Tyr of pTyr-substrate. The orientation of Thr-135′ and Tyr-136′ is very similar to Phe (P – 1 position) and pTyr in 1EEO structure despite the absence of the interacting residues for Thr-135′ in VHZ. Also, the overall loop orientation is similar in both. Mutagenesis Analysis of Crucial Residues of the Active Site—To further extend our understanding of the active site integrity and role of various residues of the VHZ, a number of mutations were generated: L97A, L97E, F99A, and F66A. A relative percentage of increase/decrease in phenotype is measured for native and all mutants. Poly (Glu-pTyr) (4:1, 20–50 kDa) and Lys-Arg-pThr-Ile-Arg-Arg phosphopeptides and pNPP were tested for the functional analysis. Two mutations, L97A and L97E, were generated to study the effect of size and charge on substrate binding and catalysis. L97A mutant showed reduced phosphatase activity ∼5–18% for tested pThr/pTyr phosphopeptides and pNPP (Fig. 7). However, L97E showed severely reduced catalytic activity toward pTyr/pNPP (by ∼89–94%), suggesting a non-tolerance of negative charge but only ∼15% reduction in activity for pThr phosphopeptide. A smaller reduction in phosphatase activity of L97E for pThr phosphopeptide suggests that the P – 1 residue Arg of pThr peptide may play a role by complementing the charge on Glu-97 (VHZ), as does the presence of Ile at P + 1 position, similar to Val in ERK1. Tyr-128 in VHR analogous to Phe-99 of VHZ stacks against the pTyr aromatic ring of substrate in the substrate-enzyme structure (PDB ID: 1J4X). In our putative enzyme-product complex, Tyr-136′ is farther away from Phe-99, unlike VHR. However, it may be because it represents the product. To functionally characterize the effect of Phe-99 on substrate binding, F99A mutant was generated. Phe-99 is not strictly conserved in VHZ and is replaced by His in some orthologs, whereas it is Ile in PTP1b. Unexpectedly, the phosphatase activity of F99A mutant increases by ∼76–92% for pThr and pNPP and only marginally (4%) for pTyr phosphopeptide (Fig. 7). The increase in activity suggests less requirement of Phe-99 for catalysis, or maybe a smaller residue enhances substrate binding. Only a mutational study on the corresponding residue in VHR can resolve this issue. Phe-66 is characteristic of VHZ orthologs, and in the putative enzyme-substrate complex, this residue stacks with Tyr-136′ representing the substrate/product. There is a similar stacking between pTyr of the substrate and Phe-182 in PT1P1b-substrate complex. F182H mutant of PTP1b decreased (but did not abolish) the activity of the enzyme for synthetic substrate derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor (31Pedersen A.K. Guo X.L. Moller K.B. Peters G.H. Andersen H.S. Kastrup J.S. Mortensen S.B. Iversen L.F. Zhang Z.Y. Moller N.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 421-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Phe residue is important to help stabilize the transition state and contributes to a hydrophobic pocket that buries pTyr of the substrate (26Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 32Sun J.P. Fedorov A.A. Lee S.Y. Guo X.L. Shen K. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12406-12414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In VHZ, F66A produced variable effects depending on the tested substrates. As expected, it showed reduced phosphatase activity (∼74%) on pNPP and a drastically hampered activity (∼98%) on pThr. However, only a marginal reduction (∼6%) was observed for pTyr phosphopeptide (Fig. 7). Reduction in phenotype for pNPP cleavage as expected suggests the important role of Phe-66 for aromatic interaction of phenyl ring of pNPP and thus pTyr of substrate for the proper positioning for catalysis. Here since poly(Glu-pTyr) (4:1) substrate, which is a universal PTP substrate, is highly negatively charged, it may not represent natural substrate for the VHZ and thus presumably poses variation in results as with the pNPP. Further studies on more authentic substrates and also on p44ERK1 that is shown to be dephosphorylated by VHZ might shed light on these issues in future. We can summarize these findings briefly by stating that although VHZ is more closely related in terms of both amino acid sequence (20% sequence identity) and three-dimensional structure (r.m.s.d. 2.2 Å for Cα atoms) to the dual specificity phosphatase VHR, it resembles PTP1b (17% sequence identity and r.m.s.d. 2.4 Å for Cα) in terms of substrate/product binding properties. Given the observed similarities of the hydrophobic interactions between the enzyme and the phenyl ring of the substrate/product tyrosine for VHZ (involving Leu-97 and Phe-66) and PTP1b (involving Ala-217 and Phe-182) and the relative disposition of the conserved Asp of the WPD loop, we conclude that enzyme-substrate/product interactions in the vicinity of the TY motif largely dictate the mode of substrate/product binding. Also, mutagenesis results indicate a possible role of P – 1, P1, and P + 1 residue of substrate, and their interactions with VHZ residues such as Leu-97, Phe-66, and Phe-99 together might determine the substrate specificity, catalytically competent docking of pThr/pTyr at the active site, and thus efficiency of catalysis. Our analysis also suggests that the residues of the active site pocket in VHZ are scrutinized optimally during evolution to deliver the dual substrate specificity. Thus, our structure of the VHZ enzyme-substrate/product complex, the second structure of a dual specificity phosphatase enzyme-substrate complex, provides insights into substrate/product binding that differ significantly from those arising from the previously published structure of the VHR-substrate complex (PDB ID: 1J4X). Also, we presume that the other low molecular weight dual specificity phosphatase subfamily members lacking N-terminal CDC25 homology domain might share the similar mode of substrate recognition. Proposed Mechanism of Dephosphorylation of Phospho-tyrosine by VHZ—Comparisons of our structure with those of other protein phosphatase enzyme-substrate complexes demonstrate that the modes of TY motif and malate ion binding provide potentially useful insights into VHZ substrate binding and catalysis. Specifically, we contend that Tyr-136′ and the adjacent malate ion mimic the hydrolyzed phospho-tyrosine of the peptidic portion of the substrate and the cleaved phosphate group, respectively. In addition, we believe that the similarity among trajectories and relative spatial dispositions of the PTP and WPD loops in available related protein phosphatases structures indicate that PTPase signature motif phosphatases recognize the phosphoryl group and catalyze substrate hydrolysis via a common mechanism. We, therefore, propose the following catalytic mechanism for VHZ (Fig. 8). 1) The reaction begins with entry of either pTyr or pSer/pThr to the active site. 2) Thereafter, the flexible WPD loop clamps down over the active site, bringing Asp-65 close to Arg-101, which stabilizes the closed conformation (Table 2, Figs. 5 and 8). 3) Asp-65, now in the vicinity of pTyr, supports acid/base catalysis, assisting formation of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate with SG of Cys-95 (3Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4) The phosphate group then undergoes hydrolytic removal, and Asp-65 acts as a general acid, donating a proton to the resulting phenoxide (Fig. 8, state a) and promoting leaving of the peptidic portion of the substrate. 5) Immediately following phosphate hydrolysis and peptidic substrate leaving, the WPD loop remains in the closed conformation, stabilized by interactions among Arg-101, the cysteinyl-phosphate side chain, and the WPD loop. 6) Thereafter, Asp-65, which now acts as a general base (23Zhang Z. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), activates a water molecule that in turn engages in nucleophilic attack of the sulfur-phosphorous bond. 7) Finally, as the phosphate group leaves the active site, the WPD loop is free to adopt an open conformation capable of accepting entry of another substrate. Although the proposed catalytic mechanism pertains to pTyr substrates, a similar mechanism may also pertain to pSer/Thr substrates. The difference in length between the Cα atom and phosphate moieties of pSer/pThr and pTyr suggests that the backbone atoms of the substrate loop would have to descend deeper into the relatively shallow active site to facilitate pSer/pThr docking. Future structural analysis of this phosphatase with pSer/pThr substrates should further our understanding of substrate recognition/selectivity and the mechanism of catalysis.

https://openalex.org/W2039310511,"The expression of major histocompatibility class II genes is necessary for proper antigen presentation and induction of an immune response. This expression is initiated by the class II transactivator, CIITA. The establishment of the active form of CIITA is controlled by a series of post-translational events, including GTP binding, ubiquitination, and dimerization. However, the role of phosphorylation is less clearly defined as are the consequences of phosphorylation on CIITA activity and the identity of the kinases involved. In this study we show that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) interact directly with CIITA, targeting serine residues in the amino terminus of the protein, including serine 288. Inhibition of this phosphorylation by dominant-negative forms of ERK or by treatment of cells with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 resulted in the increase in CIITA-mediated gene expression from a class II promoter, enhanced the nuclear concentration of CIITA, and impaired its ability to bind to the nuclear export factor, CRM1. In contrast, inhibition of ERK1/2 activity had little effect on serine-to-alanine mutant forms of CIITA. These data suggest a model whereby ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of CIITA down-regulates CIITA activity by priming it for nuclear export, thus providing a means for cells to tightly regulate the extent of antigen presentation."
