https://openalex.org/W2046575894,"The activity of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase, an enzyme that synthesizes adrenaline from noradrenaline in the adrenal medulla, is markedly depressed following hypophysectomy. Enzyme activity is restored to normal after administration of ACTH or the potent glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. Thus the biosynthesis of adrenaline in the adrenal medulla appears to be regulated by the pituitary-adrenocortical system."
https://openalex.org/W1485592454,"Abstract Palmityl coenzyme A was found to inhibit and inactivate both purified yeast and crude rat liver glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The yeast enzyme was inhibited 50% at a concentration of 0.0031 mm. The inhibition was strictly competitive and reversible with respect to glucose 6-phosphate and of the mixed type with respect to TPN. Bovine serum albumin and hydroxylamine both prevented and reversed the inhibition, but no restoration of activity was possible once the enzyme became inactivated. Of a group of 12 other enzymes of diverse metabolic function which were tested, 7 were inhibited or inactivated, or both, by very low concentrations of the acyl ester. Glutamic dehydrogenase was found to be the most sensitive as 50% inhibition occurred at 3 x 10-4 mm. In view of the widespread inhibition of enzymes by palmityl coenzyme A and other acyl coenzyme A esters, the physiological role of these esters as regulators of certain metabolic pathways must be viewed with reservation."
https://openalex.org/W1513207354,"A study was made of the effects of phospholipase C (Clostridium perfringens α toxin) and of insulin on lipolysis by fat cells isolated from epididymal adipose tissue of the rat. Both insulin and phospholipase C inhibited, in the absence of glucose in the incubation medium, the release of fatty acids and glycerol that was stimulated by submaximal concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone, epinephrine, glucagon, and theophylline. Both substances failed to inhibit the lipolytic action of high concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone and theophylline. The similar inhibitory action of phospholipase C and of insulin on lipolysis, an action that is independent of their stimulatory effects on glucose transport, provides additional evidence that both may be acting on a common parameter, possibly the plasma membrane, of the fat cell."
https://openalex.org/W1550155885,"Abstract Neutral salts in high concentrations (0.3 to 3.0 m) inhibit the activity of myosin nucleoside triphosphatase, trypsin, lactate dehydrogenase, estradiol-17β dehydrogenase, and fumarase in an order of increasing effectiveness for anions: CH3COO- l Cl- l NO3- l Br- l I- l SCN- l ClO4-, and in an order of increasing effectiveness for cations: (CH3)4N+ l Cs+ l K+ l Na+ l Li+. These orders, which are maintained in all of the salt concentrations tested, and with the widely different enzymes employed, are also the orders in which these anions and cations disrupt the organized structure of diverse macromolecules as established by physical methods. Furthermore, the anions listed above disrupt the structure of myosin with a similar order of effectiveness. Because of the parallelism between general structure-disrupting effectiveness and activity-inhibiting effectiveness, it is considered that the various ions inhibit activity by disrupting structure. Given such a conclusion, it follows that the salt sensitivity of structurally different forms of the same enzyme should differ. This is the case when native and p-chloromercuribenzoate-modified myosin are compared. The adenosine triphosphatase activity of native and p-chloromercuribenzoate-modified myosin are similar when assays are carried out in the absence of salts. The p-chloromercuribenzoate-modified form, being less sensitive to salt inhibition, thus appears to be activated when assayed in 0.6 m KCl (or similar concentrations of the several salts studied) and compared with native myosin in 0.6 m KCl. These observations provide additional evidence that the α and β forms of myosin correspond to different conformations despite the fact that optical rotatory dispersion cannot clearly indicate a difference in structure. They further suggest that salt sensitivity as evaluated by the activity parameter can be used as an extremely sensitive if only semiquantitative method for the evaluation of conformational change."

https://openalex.org/W1602418844,"Abstract An enzyme which catalyzes the formation of nicotinamide mononucleotide in the presence of nicotinamide, 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, adenosine triphosphate, and Mg++ has been purified from rat liver. The reaction is highly specific for ATP and is not substituted for by a variety of nucleotides. Enzymic activity has been found in all of the tissues studied, and in the crude homogenate it is apparently in an inhibited state. The inhibitor is removed by protamine sulfate. A broad activity peak is observed between pH 7.5 and 9.5 with maximal activity around pH 8. The enzymic activity is stable at these pH values, but it is acid labile. The apparent Km values for nicotinamide, PP-ribose-P, and ATP are 2.62 µm, 3.57 x 10-5 m, and 3.83 x 10-4 m, respectively. The Vmax was calculated to be 5.4 mµmoles per mg of protein per hour."

https://openalex.org/W1540969889,"Abstract 1. The dose-response curves for the stimulation of the metabolism of slices of rat interscapular brown adipose tissue by addition of each of five lipolytic hormones in vitro are determined and compared with the corresponding curves determined with rat epididymal white adipose tissue under the same conditions. 2. Each of the five hormones studied is capable of stimulating both oxygen consumption and release of free fatty acids in brown adipose tissue. The dose-response curves for the action of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and glucagon on these two metabolic activities of brown adipose tissue are in concentration ranges which are very close to the corresponding curves determined with white adipose tissue. The dose-response curves for the action of adrenocorticotropic hormone and thyrotropin on brown adipose tissue are shifted to considerably higher concentrations than are the corresponding curves for white adipose tissue. 3. The ratio of oxygen consumption to free fatty acid release is several times higher in brown than in white adipose tissue, when the two tissues are compared while under maximal stimulation by any of the five hormones. 4. When brown adipose tissue is stimulated by catecholamines or glucagon, both the percentage of stimulation and the absolute rate of oxygen consumption are found to be unusually high for a mammalian tissue. 5. Further evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings within brown adipose tissue is a physiologically important means of activation of the high metabolic capabilities of this tissue. 6. Certain apparent advantages are enumerated which seem to make attractive the use of brown adipose tissue for further study of the primary chemical mechanisms of action of the five hormones investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1548047210,"Abstract A disaccharide composed of glucuronic acid and d-galactose has been isolated from chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate glycopeptides. Its structure has been determined in the following way. (a) Reduction with borohydride demonstrated that galactose constitutes the reducing end of the disaccharide; (b) digestion with β-glucuronidase cleaved the disaccharide into glucuronic acid and galactose, demonstrating a β linkage; (c) periodate oxidation of the disaccharide methylglycoside resulted in no loss of galactose; and (d) oxidation of the disaccharide with lead tetraacetate degraded the galactose moiety to lyxose. This establishes the structure of the disaccharide as 3-O-β-d-glucuronosyl-d-galactose."

https://openalex.org/W1535217253,"Abstract Nucleoli were prepared from rat liver nuclei isolated in 2.2 m sucrose. Assays for glutamate dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase, catalase, acid phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, glucose 6-phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase as markers for cytoplasmic contamination revealed that the isolated nucleoli were in a high state of purity. Studies of the intranuclear distribution pattern of the enzymes and determination of the specific activities of nuclear enzymes showed that ribonucleic acid polymerase, ribonuclease, and, to a lesser extent, diphosphopyridine nucleotide pyrophosphorylase and adenosine triphosphatase A are localized to the nucleolus. Nuclear acid and alkaline deoxyribonuclease and adenosine triphosphatase B were not found to be localized to the nucleolus. The increased ribonuclease activity produced by sonic oscillation, Triton X-100, and p-chloromercuribenzoate, as well as the different response to these agents of nuclear fractions from normal rats and from rats treated with thioacetamide or actinomycin D, or both, shows that there may be more than one mechanism of latency of nuclear and nucleolar ribonucleases. The differences in substrate specificities of ribonuclease, adenosine triphosphatase A, and adenosine triphosphatase B of nuclear and of nucleolar origin point to qualitative differences between these nuclear and nucleolar enzymes. The existence of a polynucleotide phosphorylase activity was shown by the formation of nucleoside diphosphates from polyribonucleotides when the latter were incubated with nuclear subfractions."

https://openalex.org/W24579602,"A procedure is described for obtaining a purified, stable, polyribonucleotide-free myosin fraction from skeletal muscle of chicken. The method involves extraction by pyrophosphate, differential ultracentrifugation of the extract, treatment with pancreatic ribonuclease, gel filtration of the treated extract, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. A myosin obtained by the pyrophosphate extraction and gel filtration appears to be homogeneous by electrophoresis or analytical ultracentrifugation. This material yields, on DEAE-cellulose chromatography, five fractions (I to V), eluting at ionic strengths corresponding to the following compositions of the elution buffers: I, 0.02 m potassium pyrophosphate; II, 0.125 m KCl-0.003 m potassium pyrophosphate; III, 0.18 m KCl-0.005 m potassium pyrophosphate; IV, 0.36 m KCl-0.01 m potassium pyrophosphate; and V, 0.90 m KCl-0.02 m potassium pyrophosphate. Fraction I consists mainly of myoglobin, Fractions II to IV show the characteristics of myosin, and Fraction V is a ribonucleoprotein. The two myosin fractions eluted at lower ionic strength contain polyribonucleotide and have a high Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase activity, while Fraction IV, which is eluted at high ionic strength, is free of polyribonucleotide and has a low Ca2+ ATPase activity. The sedimentation values of the chromatographic myosin fractions are similar, but their electrophoretic behavior differs. All fractions give negative results for ATP sensitivity and Mg2+ ATPase activity. Results obtained following treatment with RNase or chelating agents of the extract or myosin eluted at lower ionic strength on DEAE-cellulose suggest that the chromatographic heterogeneity observed is due to the complex formation between polyribonucleotide and myosin and mediated by divalent ions. Pretreatment with these agents results in a single myosin fraction eluted from DEAE-cellulose at the same ionic strength as the myosin free from polyribonucleotide. Treatment of chromatographic myosin fractions containing polyribonucleotide by this same procedure gives the same polyribonucleotide-free fraction upon chromatography. Consideration of the results obtained by electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation of the Sephadex-excluded fractions in relation to the chromatographic behavior suggests that pyrophosphate extraction results in myosin which is in complex with polyribonucleotide by means of divalent ions. ATPase activity was found to be lowest in the myosin fraction which was free of polyribonucleotide when compared to the fractions which did contain polyribonucleotide. No explanation of this observation is given at the present time."

https://openalex.org/W1576687539,"Yeasts utilize tryptophan for the synthesis of nicotinic acid under aerobic, but not under anaerobic, conditions. Under aerobic conditions of growth, radioactivity from tryptophan-14C uniformly labeled in the benzene ring and 14C-carboxyl-labeled 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid is incorporated into nicotinic acid. Under anaerobic conditions, little radioactivity from these compounds is incorporated into nicotinic acid. The presence of a tryptophan-nicotinic acid pathway in yeast is further supported by the establishment of the presence of formylkynurenine formamidase and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidase, two of the enzymes known to mediate the conversion of tryptophan to nicotinic acid in mammalian systems. Under anaerobic conditions, yeasts incorporate radioactivity from uniformly labeled aspartate-14C and glutamate-14C, suggesting that an alternative pathway similar to that shown in several bacterial systems is operative. Evidence is presented which establishes quinolinic acid as a precursor to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Quinolinic acid appears, therefore, to be a common intermediate in the alternative pathways for nicotinic acid biosynthesis in yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1538866238,"Abstract The extent of inhibition of cytochrome oxidase activity by cyanide depends upon the method of assay. It has been confirmed that this inhibition is readily reversible with the use of the standard manometric technique. However, in the spectrophotometric assay only about 10% of the control activity is observed after the cyanide is removed by physical methods. The polarographic assay yields intermediate results. On the other hand, the polarographic assay shows a complete reversal of inhibition when the cyanide-treated heart muscle preparation is first incubated under reducing conditions. The tetrachlorohydroquinone oxidase activity of the heart muscle preparation is also decreased by cyanide treatment. The spectra of the purified cytochrome oxidase treated with cyanide are similar to those of cytochrome a. It is likely that there are two sites for the interaction of cytochrome oxidase and cyanide: the heme a iron and a second noncovalent locus. The nature of this second site s discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1568927761,"Abstract Ethanol has been identified as a normal trace constituent of mammalian tissue by criteria which include the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in the presence of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and a tissue sublimate containing volatile substituents of the tissue; chromatographic identification of ethyl dinitrobenzoate after reaction of the sublimate with 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride; and gas-liquid chromatography of benzoate derivatives prepared from tissue sublimates. Ethanol-14C is formed from sodium pyruvate-2-14C during incubation with liver slices under anaerobic conditions. Its formation is linear for the first hour and is dependent on the presence of low concentrations of pyruvate. The ability of pyruvate dehydrogenase isolated from pig heart to catalyze the formation of ethanol from pyruvate when coupled to an alcohol dehydrogenase-reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide system has been investigated. Formation of ethanol requires, in addition to pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate, NADH, thiamine pyrosphosphate, and Mg++. It is inhibited by semicarbazide and sodium bisulfite. The results support the view that the pyruvate dehydrogenase system produces free acetaldehyde which can be reduced to ethanol in the mammal."
https://openalex.org/W178110957,"In 1952 Korkes (1) demonstrated that cell-free extracts of Clostridium kluyveri catalyze the reduction of diphosphopyridine nucleotide with molecular hydrogen. The complex nature of this over-all process was revealed by kinetic measurements suggesting the participation of more than one protein component (2) and by the demonstration of requirements for at least two heatstable cofactors (2-4). One of these cofactors is replaceable with FAD; the other is unidentified (4). In addition stimulation by ferrous salts was reported (2, 3). This report describes the separation of cell-free extracts into two protein fractions, both of which are required for hydrogenlinked DPN reduction. Ferredoxin (5) was identified as the active component of one of these fractions. Incidental to this study was the development of a new manometric procedure for measuring DPN-dependent hydrogen uptake that permits a more careful kinetic analysis of the reaction. A preliminary report of these results has been published (6)."

https://openalex.org/W99273108,"Abstract Kinetic studies on beef heart supernatant malic dehydrogenase were carried out in 0.1 m triethanolamine-acetate buffer. Analysis of the data by the method of Dalziel revealed that specific relationships between calculated kinetic parameters did not conform to the criteria proposed for mechanisms involving sequential addition for each pair of substrates. The results also did not conform to the criteria proposed for a mechanism involving a random order of substrate addition to enzyme, in which all of the complexes are in rapid equilibrium with the substrates. These observations can be contrasted with those of Raval and Wolfe (1) on hog heart malic dehydrogenase. With this enzyme, of apparent mitochondrial origin, the results were found to be compatible with a mechanism involving an ordered addition of substrate to the enzyme, with no kinetically active ternary complexes. A kinetic mechanism for supernatant malic dehydrogenase has been proposed; it involves the participation of three binary complexes of substrate and enzyme (enzyme-oxaloacetate, enzyme-diphosphopyridine nucleotide, and enzyme-DPNH) and no kinetically significant ternary complexes. It has further been proposed that the preferred route of the reaction is via the branch of the pathway involving enzyme-DPNH, and that the rate constants are identical for DPNH interacting either with free enzyme or with the enzyme-oxaloacetate complex. This formulation is consistent with the experimentally determined kinetic parameters and with the independently determined dissociation constant for enzyme-DPNH obtained by fluorometric measurements. Substrate inhibition of supernatant malic dehydrogenase by oxaloacetate was observed at pH values below 7.8. This observation may be interpreted as further indication of the existence of a binary enzyme-oxaloacetate complex. However, the possibility that the inhibition is due to the formation of inactive ternary complexes with oxaloacetate cannot be ruled out."

https://openalex.org/W2408225262,"Abstract The stoichiometry of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide binding to supernatant malic dehydrogenase (S-MDH) was determined by fluorometric techniques and a Sephadex gel filtration procedure. Both types of measurement yielded a stoichiometry of 1 mole of DPNH bound per mole of enzyme. This stoichiometry was unaffected by the presence of d-malate, a compound which is known to form a ternary enzyme complex having distinctive fluorescent properties. The dissociation constants for the binary enzyme-DPNH and ternary enzyme-DPNH-d-malate complexes with respect to DPNH were determined. Several criteria were used to determine the effectiveness of a number of compounds in forming ternary complexes with S-MDH and DPNH. A requisite for ternary complex formation was a dicarboxylic acid with chain length of 3 to 4 carbon atoms. Although an α-hydroxyl group was not necessary for ternary complex formation, the introduction of such a group in a specific steric configuration resulted in a loss of capacity to form such a complex. Formation of strong fluorescing complexes by a number of dicarboxylic acids is not necessarily related to their effectiveness as inhibitors of S-MDH activity. The presence of an α-hydroxyl group appears to be required for inhibition, although added steric considerations involving the β carbon atom may obliterate such inhibitory capacity."

https://openalex.org/W141462554,"SUMMARY Cofactor requirements for the reduction of diphosphopyridine nucleotide with molecular hydrogen by enzyme preparations of Clostridium kluyveri were reinvestigated. The results confirmed previous conclusions that flavin adenine dinucleotide and a factor in boiled extracts (“Magnesol co- factor”), separable from FAD by chromatography on Magnesol, were involved. Whereas the FAD requirement is absolute at all concentrations of reactants tested, activation by the Magnesol cofactor is observed only at relatively low concentrat,ions of FAD. In the absence of Magnesol cofactor, hydrogen-linked DPN reduction is a bimolecular function of the FAD concentration. However, when Magnesol cofactor is present, DPN reduction follows normal Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics with re- spect to FAD, and the affinity of enzyme for FAD is much higher than when Magnesol cofactor is absent. Similar activa- tion of the hydrogenase system is obtained when the Magnesol cofactor is replaced by high concentrations of flavin mononu- cleotide, adenosine triphosphate, diphosphate, or any of a large number of other nucleoside di- or triphosphates. The results suggest the presence two binding sites on hydro- genase, namely, a catalytic site capable of binding FAD and an allosteric site capable of binding factors present in the Magnesol cofactor preparation and also nucleotides including FAD, flavin mononucleotide, adenosine triphosphate, and adenosine diphos- phate when these are present at high concentrations. The Magnesol preparation was resolved by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography into two active fractions, neither of which contained a sufficient concentration of any of the common nucleotides to account for its activity. Previous suggestions that the Magnesol cofactor activity is due to flavin mononucleotide or ferredoxin were shown be incorrect. REFERENCES"
https://openalex.org/W1906476965,"Abstract Methods for the partial purification of the phosphoprotein phosphatase of the frog egg are described. The enzyme is soluble in distilled water, is heat stable, and is not inactivated by 1 m acetic acid or 0.1 n Na2CO3. The pH optimum (3.0) is unusually low. The enzyme is inhibited competitively by phosphate and molybdate. The enzyme has no activity on the internal pyrophosphates of dinucleotides and similar compounds, on phosphoramidates, or on aliphatic phosphate esters. The enzyme is active on a long series of acyl phosphates: organic and inorganic polyphosphates, both long and short chains and small rings; aromatic phosphates; phosphoenolpyruvate; acetyl phosphate; and carbamyl phosphate. It is less active on phosphoproteins. Evidence is presented which suggests that these activities are all due to one enzyme. The enzyme most closely resembles the phosphoprotein phosphatase of spleen but differs from the latter in several critical respects. The implications of these findings are examined. It is suggested that the enzyme is better classified as a nonspecific phosphoanhydride hydrolase than as a phosphoprotein phosphatase."
