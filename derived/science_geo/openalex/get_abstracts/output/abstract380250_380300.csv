https://openalex.org/W2045297101,"Limited information is available regarding epigenomic events mediating initiation and progression of tobacco-induced lung cancers. In this study, we established an in vitro system to examine epigenomic effects of cigarette smoke in respiratory epithelia. Normal human small airway epithelial cells and cdk-4/hTERT-immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) were cultured in normal media with or without cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) for up to 9 months under potentially relevant exposure conditions. Western blot analysis showed that CSC mediated dose- and time-dependent diminution of H4K16Ac and H4K20Me3, while increasing relative levels of H3K27Me3; these histone alterations coincided with decreased DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and increased DNMT3b expression. Pyrosequencing and quantitative RT-PCR experiments revealed time-dependent hypomethylation of D4Z4, NBL2, and LINE-1 repetitive DNA sequences; up-regulation of H19, IGF2, MAGE-A1, and MAGE-A3; activation of Wnt signaling; and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes such as RASSF1A and RAR-beta, which are frequently silenced in human lung cancers. Array-based DNA methylation profiling identified additional novel DNA methylation targets in soft-agar clones derived from CSC-exposed HBEC; a CSC gene expression signature was also identified in these cells. Progressive genomic hypomethylation and locoregional DNA hypermethylation induced by CSC coincided with a dramatic increase in soft-agar clonogenicity. Collectively, these data indicate that cigarette smoke induces 'cancer-associated' epigenomic alterations in cultured respiratory epithelia. This in vitro model may prove useful for delineating early epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression during pulmonary carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999807139,"Major depressive disorder is a debilitating disease. Unfortunately, treatment with antidepressants (ADs) has limited therapeutic efficacy since resistance to AD is common. Research in this field is hampered by the lack of a reliable natural animal model of AD resistance. Depression resistance is related to various factors, including the attendance of cardiovascular risk factors and past depressive episodes. We aimed to design a rodent model of depression resistance to ADs, associating cardiovascular risk factors with repeated unpredicted chronic mild stress (UCMS). Male BALB/c mice were given either a regular (4% fat) or a high fat diet (45% fat) and subjected to two 7-week periods of UCMS separated by 6 weeks. From the second week of each UCMS procedure, vehicle or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated daily. The effects of the UCMS and fluoxetine in both diet conditions were assessed using physical (coat state and body weight) and behavioural tests (the reward maze test and the splash test). The results demonstrate that during the second procedure, UCMS induced behavioural changes, including coat state degradation, disturbances in self-care behaviour (splash test) and anhedonia (reward maze test) and these were reversed by fluoxetine in the regular diet condition. In contrast, the high-fat diet regimen prevented the AD fluoxetine from abolishing the UCMS-induced changes. In conclusion, by associating UCMS—an already validated animal model of depression—with high-fat diet regimen, we designed a naturalistic animal model of AD resistance related to a sub-nosographic clinical entity of depression."
https://openalex.org/W1993052631,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry is mediated by the interaction between a variably glycosylated envelope glycoprotein (gp120) and host-cell receptors. Approximately half of the molecular mass of gp120 is contributed by N-glycans, which serve as potential epitopes and may shield gp120 from immune recognition. The role of gp120 glycans in the host immune response to HIV-1 has not been comprehensively studied at the molecular level. We developed a new approach to characterize cell-specific gp120 glycosylation, the regulation of glycosylation, and the effect of variable glycosylation on antibody reactivity. A model oligomeric gp120 was expressed in different cell types, including cell lines that represent host-infected cells or cells used to produce gp120 for vaccination purposes. N-Glycosylation of gp120 varied, depending on the cell type used for its expression and the metabolic manipulation during expression. The resultant glycosylation included changes in the ratio of high-mannose to complex N-glycans, terminal decoration, and branching. Differential glycosylation of gp120 affected envelope recognition by polyclonal antibodies from the sera of HIV-1-infected subjects. These results indicate that gp120 glycans contribute to antibody reactivity and should be considered in HIV-1 vaccine design."

We find that both DAP and spermine are capable of activating LOXL2 to the same extent and have similar Michaelis constants (Km ∼ 1 mm) and catalytic rates (kcat ∼ 0.02 s−1). We also show that LOXL2 is capable of being inhibited by a known suicide inhibitor of lysyl oxidase (LOX), β-aminopropionitrile, which we find is a potent inhibitor of LOXL2 activity. The modality of inhibition of β-aminopropionitrile was also examined and found to be competitive with respect to the substrates DAP and spermine. In addition, we identified an antibody inhibitor (AB0023) of LOXL2 enzymatic function and have found that the inhibition occurs in a non-competitive manner with respect to both spermine and DAP. The binding epitope of AB0023 was mapped to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain four of human LOXL2. AB0023 binds to a region remote from the catalytic domain making AB0023 an allosteric inhibitor of LOXL2. This affords AB0023 several advantages, because it is specific for LOXL2 and inhibits the enzymatic function of LOXL2 in a non-competitive manner thereby allowing inhibition of LOXL2 regardless of substrate concentration. These results suggest that antibody allosteric modulators of enzymatic function represent a novel drug development strategy and, in the context of LOXL2, suggest that inhibitors such as these might be useful therapeutics in oncology, fibrosis, and inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W1990905462,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in proper function and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We performed a systematic comparison of miRNA expression in undifferentiated vs. differentiating ESCs. We report that 138 miRNAs are increased on the induction of differentiation. We compared the entire list of candidate mRNA targets of up-regulated miRNAs with that of mRNA down-regulated in ESCs on induction of differentiation. Among the candidate targets emerging from this analysis, we found three genes, Smarca5, Jarid1b, and Sirt1, previously demonstrated to be involved in sustaining the undifferentiated phenotype in ESCs. On this basis, we first demonstrated that Smarca5 is a direct target of miR-100, Jarid1b of miR-137, and we also confirmed previously published data demonstrating that Sirt1 is a direct target of miR-34a in a different context. The suppression of these three miRNAs by anti-miRs caused the block of ESC differentiation induced by LIF withdrawal. On the other hand, the overexpression of the three miRNAs resulted in an altered expression of differentiation markers. These results demonstrate that miR-34a, miR-100, and miR-137 are required for proper differentiation of mouse ESCs, and that they function in part by targeting Sirt1, Smarca5, and Jarid1b mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1988651019,"Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is commonly found in freshwater habitats but is also the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease when infecting humans. Although various virulence factors have been reported, little is known about the nutrition and the metabolism of the bacterium. Here, we report the application of isotopologue profiling for analyzing the metabolism of L. pneumophila. Cultures of Lp were supplied with [U-13C3]serine, [U-13C6]glucose, or [1,2-13C2]glucose. After growth, 13C enrichments and isotopologue patterns of protein-derived amino acids and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate were determined by mass spectrometry and/or NMR spectroscopy. The labeling patterns detected in the experiment with [U-13C3]serine showed major carbon flux from serine to pyruvate and from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which serves as a precursor of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate or as a substrate of a complete citrate cycle with Si specificity of the citrate synthase. Minor carbon flux was observed between pyruvate and oxaloacetate/malate by carboxylation and decarboxylation, respectively. The apparent lack of label in Val, Ile, Leu, Pro, Phe, Met, Arg, and Tyr confirmed that L. pneumophila is auxotrophic for these amino acids. Experiments with [13C]glucose showed that the carbohydrate is also used as a substrate to feed the central metabolism. The specific labeling patterns due to [1,2-13C2]glucose identified the Entner-Doudoroff pathway as the predominant route for glucose utilization. In line with these observations, a mutant lacking glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Δzwf) did not incorporate label from glucose at significant levels and was slowly outcompeted by the wild type strain in successive rounds of infection in Acanthamoeba castellanii, indicating the importance of this enzyme and of carbohydrate usage in general for the life cycle of Lp.

Lp survives within amoebae and macrophages because of its ability to establish a replication vacuole that is derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. Once within a vacuole, Lp differentiates into the replicative form. When nutrients become limiting, a regulatory cascade triggers the differentiation to a spore-like mature intracellular form (MIF), the so-called transmissive form, which metabolically seems to be nearly dormant (1.Garduño R.A.

These forms exhibit a thickened cell wall and high amounts of cytoplasmic granules of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), a general energy and carbon storage compound of bacteria (1.Garduño R.A. Garduño E.

When released from spent hosts, these transmissive forms of Lp are able to persist for long periods in the environment. It has also been shown that Lp is able to differentiate into a “viable but nonculturable” status of greatly reduced metabolic activity after persistence in water (9.Steinert M. Emödy L. Amann R. Hacker J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2047-2053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, Legionella species can also grow in defined culture media under laboratory conditions (10.Pine L.

Microbiol. 1981; 13: 865-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also well known that Lp uses amino acids as preferred energy and carbon sources (4.Molofsky A.B. Swanson M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Pine L. George J.R. Reeves M.W. Harrell W.K. J. Clin.

More specifically, Ser, Glu, Tyr, and/or Thr are efficiently used as carbon and energy sources in vitro (14.Tesh M.J. Morse S.A. Miller R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Cys, Gln, Ser, and Arg support growth in vivo (19.Wieland H. Ullrich S. Lang F. Neumeister B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1528-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From in silico analysis of the known Lp genome sequences it is proposed that Lp is auxotrophic for the amino acids Cys, Met, Arg, Thr, Val, Ile, and Leu (18.Hoffman P.S. Hoffman P.S. Klein T. Friedman H. Legionella pneumophila: Pathogenesis and Immunity. Springer Publishing Corp., New York2008: 113-131Google Scholar, 25.Cazalet C. Rusniok C. Brüggemann H. Zidane N. Magnier A. Ma L.

Science. 2004; 305: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that Lp harbors genes for ∼12 classes of ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters and amino acid permeases, as well as various different amino peptidases and proteases. In addition, it has been shown that amino acid transporters of the host cell and of Lp are essential for intracellular replication; specifically, a neutral amino acid transporter of the host cell (SLC1A5 of MM6 monocyte cells) is necessary for Lp to replicate within this host (19.Wieland H. Ullrich S. Lang F. Neumeister B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1528-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a bacterial Thr transporter (PhtA) is reported to be essential for replication of Lp in bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice (27.Sauer J.D. Bachman M.A. Swanson M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9924-9929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, it was also suggested that Lp is able to use glucose as a carbon source (14.Tesh M.J. Morse S.A. Miller R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Weiss E. Peacock M.G. Williams J.C. Curr.

Microbiol. 1984; 11: 81-88Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), although the addition of glucose to the medium did not support in vitro growth (18.Hoffman P.S. Hoffman P.S. Klein T. Friedman H. Legionella pneumophila: Pathogenesis and Immunity. Springer Publishing Corp., New York2008: 113-131Google Scholar, 20.Keen M.G. Hoffman M.S. Curr. Microbiol. 1984; 11: 81-88Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As no active sugar transport could be demonstrated in vitro (14.Tesh M.J. Morse S.A. Miller R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Fonseca M.V. Sauer J.D. Swanson M.S. Heuner K. Swanson M.S. Legionella-Molecular Microbiology.

Springer Publishing Corp., New York2008: 113-131Google Scholar), it is generally believed that Lp does not utilize sugars as a carbon source but relies on gluconeogenesis (18.Hoffman P.S. Hoffman P.S. Klein T. Friedman H. Legionella pneumophila: Pathogenesis and Immunity. Springer Publishing Corp., New York2008: 113-131Google Scholar). On the other hand, some of the various ABC-type transport systems might be involved in sugar uptake, because Lp also possesses putative systems for degradation of cellulose, chitin, starch, and glycogen (28.Brüggemann H. Hagman A. Jules M. Sismeiro O. Dillies M.A. Gouyette C. Kunst F. Steinert M. Heuner K. Coppée J.Y. Buchrieser C. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Recently, Lp has been shown to actively degrade cellulose (29.Pearce M.M. Cianciotto N.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 300: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the basis of this evidence it can be assumed that glucose is also catabolized, but the metabolic routes are still unknown. The four sequenced genomes of Lp (Lp Philadelphia (26.Chien M.

Microbiol. 1984; 11: 81-88Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that the bulk of the acetyl-CoA entering the citrate cycle or used as precursor for the storage compound PHB is derived from fatty acid catabolism (18.Hoffman P.S. Hoffman P.S. Klein T. Friedman H. Legionella pneumophila: Pathogenesis and Immunity. Springer Publishing Corp., New York2008: 113-131Google Scholar). Indeed, Lp possesses huge amounts of phospholipases exerting extracellular and cell-associated activities (31.Banerji S. Aurass P. Flieger A. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 298: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32.Flieger A. Rydzewski K. Banerji S. Broich M. Heuner K. Infect.

Microbiol. 2010; 300: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the glyoxylate shunt appears to be absent in the Lp strains sequenced thus far. One powerful method of studying metabolic pathways in growing microbes is based on incorporation experiments with stable isotope-labeled precursors (e.g. 13C-labeled glucose) followed by the determination of the resulting isotopologue patterns in key metabolites, such as protein-derived amino acids or other storage compounds. Using stoichiometric models, isotopologue profiles can serve as constraints in metabolic flux calculations (13C-based metabolic flux analysis) (34.Zamboni N. Fendt S.M. Rühl M. Sauer U. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 878-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Metabolic flux analysis is now well established for the analysis of metabolic flux in microorganisms growing under standardized conditions (reviewed in Refs. 34.Zamboni N. Fendt S.M. Rühl M. Sauer U. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 878-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar and 35.Sauer U. Eikmanns B.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 765-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These models typically rely on the use of minimal media with only one possible carbon source. It is therefore difficult to adapt metabolic flux analysis calculations to organisms with complex multiple carbon usage (i.e. when growing in complex media). However, because of the specificity of the detected isotopologue profiles, observation-driven analysis can also trace metabolic pathways in cases with unknown and/or multiple carbon usage (36.Eisenreich W. Slaghuis J. Laupitz R. Bussemer J. Stritzker J. Schwarz C. Schwarz R. Dandekar T. Goebel W. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this study, the metabolism of Lp grown under culture conditions was analyzed for the first time by 13C-labeled isotopologue (13C-isotopologue) profiling using glucose or Ser as precursors. A. castellanii ATCC30010 was cultured in PYG 712 medium (2% proteose-peptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1 m glucose, 4 mm MgSO4, 0.4 m CaCl2, 0.1% sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.05 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 × 6 H2O, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4, and 2.5 mm K2HPO4) at 20 °C. Escherichia coli DH5α was used to clone recombinant plasmid DNA. Experiments were done with L. pneumophila Paris (CIP 107629 (25.Cazalet C. Rusniok C. Brüggemann H. Zidane N. Magnier A. Ma L.

As described previously (28.Brüggemann H. Hagman A. Jules M. Sismeiro O. Dillies M.A. Gouyette C. Kunst F. Steinert M. Heuner K. Coppée J.Y. Buchrieser C. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), Lp strains were cultured in AYE medium (ACES-buffered yeast extract broth: 10 g of ACES, 10 g of yeast extract, 0.4 g of l-cysteine, and 0.25 g of iron pyrophosphate in 1 liter (pH 6.8)) (see also supplemental Table S1) or on ACES-buffered charcoal-yeast extract (BCYE) agar plates at 37 °C. Alternatively, Lp Paris was cultivated in a chemically defined medium (CDM) (for details see supplemental Table 1) adapted from Ristroph et al. (12.Ristroph J.D. Hedlund K.W. Gowda S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 13: 115-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1 liter of growth medium (AYE or CDM) was supplemented with 2 g of [U-13C6]glucose, 2 g of [1,2-13C2]glucose, or 0.3 g of [U-13C3]Ser. 500 ml of the supplemented AYE medium was inoculated with 1 ml of an overnight culture of Lp Paris. For supplemented CDM the inoculum was 4 ml of an overnight culture grown in AYE medium. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C and 220 rpm, and the optical density at 600 nm (A600) was determined at regular intervals. An A600 of 1.0 was determined as exponential growth, whereas an A600 of ∼2.0 correlated with stationary growth. Cultures in AYE medium reached exponential growth after 16 h and stationary growth at 29 h. Cultures grown in CDM became stationary at 40 h. Before harvesting, a culture aliquot was plated on LB agar plates to rule out the possibility of contamination. The bacteria were killed with sodium azide at a final concentration of 10 mm and pelleted at 5500 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. The pellet was washed twice with 200 ml of water and then once with 2 ml of water. The supernatant was discarded, and the bacterial pellet was autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min. The lpp0483 mutant strain of Lp Paris (Δzwf) was constructed as described previously (28.Brüggemann H. Hagman A. Jules M. Sismeiro O. Dillies M.A. Gouyette C. Kunst F. Steinert M. Heuner K.

Immun. 2002; 70: 1604-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, the gene lpp0483 (zwf) was inactivated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance (kanR) cassette into the chromosomal gene. The chromosomal region containing the lpp0483 gene was PCR-amplified with the primers lpp0483_for and lpp0483_rev, and the product (2639 bp) was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). On this template, an inverse PCR was performed using the primers lpp0483_inv_for and lpp0483_inv_BamHI_rev, with the reverse primer bearing a BamHI restriction site. These primers amplified 4912 bp corresponding to the pGEM backbone and the flanking regions of lpp0483. The resulting PCR product was BamHI-digested and ligated to the kanR cassette (1210 bp amplified via PCR from the plasmid pGEM-KanR subcloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector) using primers containing BamHI restriction sites at the ends (Kan_BamHI_for and Kan_BamHI_rev). All primers are listed in Table 1. For chromosomal recombination, the construct (i.e. PCR fragment containing the kanR cassette with flanking regions of the gene of interest, ∼900 bp upstream and ∼250 bp downstream) was introduced into the Lp Paris strain by transformation. Three independent Δzwf mutant strains were generated, and two of them were used for intracellular replication assays.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyOligonucleotideSequencePCRlpp0483_forTACATTGAGAAAAAAGCGAAGCCAAlpp0483_revTGCTGTTTAATAATCGCCTTTTCGAlpp0483_inv_forACAGCCTTATAATATCTTTClpp0483_inv_BamHI_revCGGGATCCCGGTTAATTTTTGATAATCATCKan_BamHI_forCGGGATCCCGCTATCTGGACAAGGGAAAACKan_BamHI_revCGGGATCCCGGAAGAACTCCAGCATGAGATRT-PCRaccC-ForGAACTTGGCATTCAGACTGTTGCaccC-RevAGCATGTCCTTTCCCATCACCedd-ForAGAGCAGCTTATCTGAATCAAATGGedd-RevAAAACCTGCAAACCACCCTGAfadD-ForAATGGAGTACCACATGAAATTGACGfadD-RevCCAGAGGAGATATCCAGGTGTAfumC-ForAACACGTGTAGAAACAGACAGCATGfumC-RevAGGGGTTCATGAGAAGCCAGApfp-ForCTGGTGGTGTGACCGCTGTAApfp-RevGGGACTTGGCCTATAGACCATTpgl-edd-ForCTAGAACAGCTTCATTCCAGAGpgl-edd-RevGAGTACGGTTGATGCGCTTATApykA-ForGCCAGTAAGGAACCTGAAATTCTGpykA-RevCTTCTGCTTCAATTGCTGTACGCppsA-ForACTATAGATTTGGCACATCTTGGCAppsA-RevGGGTTTCCAACATTCAACATCACTrpiA-ForAAGAACTGGCAGCAATCAAACACrpiA-RevCCAAGGCCATAGGTGTTGAGAAsucA-ForTTGTCTGGAGGAAGTATGGCTTATGsucA-RevTGAAGGGTTAAACGCCAAAGCzwf-pgl-ForGCCAAAGGAAGTCATACGCTTAzwf-pgl-RevGAGAATCAATTTGGCTATTCACC Open table in a new tab For in vivo growth of Lp Paris and its derivatives in A. castellanii, we followed a protocol described previously (28.Brüggemann H. Hagman A. Jules M. Sismeiro O. Dillies M.A. Gouyette C. Kunst F. Steinert M. Heuner K. Coppée J.Y. Buchrieser C. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In brief, 3-day-old cultures of A. castellanii were washed in AC buffer (PYG 712 medium without proteose-peptone, glucose, and yeast extract) and adjusted to 5 × 105 cells. Stationary phase Legionella bacteria grown on BCYE agar were diluted in water and mixed with A. castellanii at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. After invasion for 1 h at 37 °C, the A. castellanii layer was washed twice, defining the start point of the time course experiment. The number of colony forming units (CFU) of legionellae was determined by plating on BCYE agar. Each infection was carried out in duplicates and was done at least three times. The intracellular multiplication was carried out as described above but without the washing step. After 3 days, A. castellanii cells were resuspended, 100-μl aliquots were lysed, and serial dilutions were spread on BCYE agar to determine the number of CFU. To study the replication rates in repeating rounds of infection, the remaining solution was incubated at 37 °C for a further 3 days and diluted (1:1000). The number of CFU was determined by plating the remaining solution on BCYE agar. 1 ml of the remaining dilution was used to reinfect fresh amoeba cultures as described previously. Four rounds of infection were performed in total, and each infection was carried out in duplicates and done at least three times. The infection procedure was similar to the assay described above, but equal amounts of bacteria of the wild type and the Δzwf mutant strain (kanamycin resistant) were used together to co-infect the A. castellanii cells. After 3 days, A. castellanii cells were resuspended, 100-μl aliquots were lysed, and serial dilutions were spread on BCYE agar with and without kanamycin to determine the number of CFU. The remaining infection solution was incubated at 37 °C for a further 3 days and diluted (1:1000). The resulting solution was used to determine the number of CFU on BCYE with and without kanamycin and to reinfect fresh amoebae. Four rounds of infection were performed in total. To determine the number of wild type bacteria, the CFU on BCYE-kanamycin agar was subtracted from the CFU on BCYE plates without kanamycin. In the survival assay, the mixture of the first infection was incubated for a further 19 days. To follow the Δzwf and WT strain recovery capabilities, each sample was plated (100 μl) on BCYE and/or BCYE-kanamycin plates. Each infection was carried out in duplicates and was done at least three times. Total RNA was extracted from bacteria grown in AYE medium to the appropriate growth phase, incubated with Dnase I, and then repurified. RT-PCR reactions were performed with a OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) using gene-specific primers. The RT reaction was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min with 0.5 μg of total RNA. PCR amplification was performed with ea"
https://openalex.org/W2059194533,"Orosomucoid (ORM), also called alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, is an abundant plasma protein that is an immunomodulator induced by stressful conditions such as infections. In this study, we reveal that Orm is induced selectively in the adipose tissue of obese mice to suppress excess inflammation that otherwise disturbs energy homeostasis. Adipose Orm levels were elevated by metabolic signals, including insulin, high glucose, and free fatty acid, as well as by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which is found in increased levels in the adipose tissue of morbid obese subjects. In both adipocytes and macrophages, ORM suppressed proinflammatory gene expression and pathways such as NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalings and reactive oxygen species generation. Concomitantly, ORM relieved hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated lipolysis in adipocytes. Accordingly, ORM improved glucose and insulin tolerance in obese and diabetic db/db mice. Taken together, our results suggest that ORM integrates inflammatory and metabolic signals to modulate immune responses to protect adipose tissue from excessive inflammation and thereby from metabolic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2073576611,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) associates with both integrins and growth factor receptors in the control of cell motility and survival. Loss of FAK during mouse development results in lethality at embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) and a block in cell proliferation. Because FAK serves as both a scaffold and signaling protein, gene knock-outs do not provide mechanistic insights in distinguishing between these modes of FAK function. To determine the role of FAK activity during development, a knock-in point mutation (lysine 454 to arginine (R454)) within the catalytic domain was introduced by homologous recombination. Homozygous FAK(R454/R454) mutation was lethal at E9.5 with defects in blood vessel formation as determined by lack of yolk sac primary capillary plexus formation and disorganized endothelial cell patterning in FAK(R454/R454) embryos. In contrast to the inability of embryonic FAK(-/-) cells to proliferate ex vivo, primary FAK(R454/R454) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were established from E8.5 embryos. R454 MEFs exhibited no difference in cell growth compared with normal MEFs, and R454 FAK localized to focal adhesions but was not phosphorylated at Tyr-397. In E8.5 embryos and primary MEFs, FAK R454 mutation resulted in decreased c-Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation. R454 MEFs exhibited enhanced focal adhesion formation, decreased migration, and defects in cell polarity. Within immortalized MEFs, FAK activity was required for fibronectin-stimulated FAK-p190RhoGAP association and p190RhoGAP tyrosine phosphorylation linked to decreased RhoA GTPase activity, focal adhesion turnover, and directional motility. Our results establish that intrinsic FAK activity is essential for developmental processes controlling blood vessel formation and cell motility-polarity but not cell proliferation. This work supports the use of FAK inhibitors to disrupt neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2067957695,"Endoplasmic reticulum oxidation 1 (ERO1) is a conserved eukaryotic flavin adenine nucleotide-containing enzyme that promotes disulfide bond formation by accepting electrons from reduced protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and passing them on to molecular oxygen. Although disulfide bond formation is an essential process, recent experiments suggest a surprisingly broad tolerance to genetic manipulations that attenuate the rate of disulfide bond formation and that a hyperoxidizing ER may place stressed cells at a disadvantage. In this study, we report on the development of a high throughput in vitro assay for mammalian ERO1α activity and its application to identify small molecule inhibitors. The inhibitor EN460 (IC50, 1.9 μm) interacts selectively with the reduced, active form of ERO1α and prevents its reoxidation. Despite rapid and promiscuous reactivity with thiolates, EN460 exhibits selectivity for ERO1. This selectivity is explained by the rapid reversibility of the reaction of EN460 with unstructured thiols, in contrast to the formation of a stable bond with ERO1α followed by displacement of bound flavin adenine dinucleotide from the active site of the enzyme. Modest concentrations of EN460 and a functionally related inhibitor, QM295, promote signaling in the unfolded protein response and precondition cells against severe ER stress. Together, these observations point to the feasibility of targeting the enzymatic activity of ERO1α with small molecule inhibitors.

Disulfide bonds stabilize the tertiary structures of secreted proteins (1Anfinsen C.B. Redfield R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1956; 11: 1-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and disulfide formation is essential in all known life forms. The oxidative process that generates disulfide bonds in eukaryotes is accelerated by the formation of mixed disulfides between ER resident oxidoreductases, such as protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) 3The abbreviations used are: PDIprotein disulfide isomeraseAURAmplex Ultra RedDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)DTTdithiothreitolGSTglutathione S-transferaseTrxAredreduced thioredoxinAMS4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidGSHglutathioneNEMN-ethyl maleimideMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineERO1endoplasmic reticulum oxidation 1FADflavin-adenine dinucleotideTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineTHPTri(hydroxypropyl)phosphine. and reduced cysteine residues on newly translocated client proteins. Productive resolution of these mixed disulfides transfers the disulfide to the client protein and leaves the PDIs in a reduced state (2Appenzeller-Herzog C. Ellgaard L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Reduced PDIs are enzymatically reoxidized by an ER oxidase, ERO1, conserved from yeast to mammals (reviewed in Refs. 3Tu B.P.

Yeast ERO1 contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) tightly bound to a four helical bundle motif also found in other sulfhydryl oxidases (5Gross E. Kastner D.B. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Cell. 2004; 117: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A series of disulfide exchange reactions, first between reduced PDI and a shuttle disulfide on ERO1 and then to an ERO1 disulfide lying adjacent to the isoalloxazine ring, leads to the reduction of the flavin and the eventual transfer of a pair of electrons to molecular oxygen (4Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This disulfide relay results in the generation of one molecule of H2O2 for each disulfide bond formed in the ER (6Gross E. Sevier C.S. Heldman N. Vitu E. Bentzur M. Kaiser C.A. Thorpe C. Fass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In addition to the shuttle and active-site cysteines, ERO1 has several regulatory cysteines that form disulfide bonds that restrain the enzymatic activity of the fully oxidized enzyme (7Sevier C.S.

Sørensen E.S. Ellgaard L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2977-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). ERO1 genes are also under transcriptional control, and their mRNA levels increase with the load of unfolded reduced proteins in the ER, a phenomenon mediated by the unfolded protein response (9Travers K.J.

ERO1 is an essential enzyme in yeast, and its dysfunction leads to a rapid decline in oxidative protein folding, strong activation of the unfolded protein response, and marked loss of viability (11Pollard M.G.

Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Interestingly, more modest attenuation of ERO1 activity improves the fitness of yeast challenged with high levels of protein misfolding in their ER (ER stress) (13Haynes C.M. Titus E.A. Cooper A.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). A similar situation prevails in worms; the single ero1 gene is essential, yet its partial inactivation enhances survival of worms exposed to the ER stress-inducing glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (14Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes. Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Furthermore, compromise of ero1 in the adult also extends the life span of worms that are not exposed to conditions that promote unusual levels ER stress (15Curran S.P. Ruvkun G. PLoS. Genet. 2007; 3: e56Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These observations suggest potential benefits for partial inhibition of ERO1. Mammals have two ERO1 isoforms encoded by separate genes (10Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S. Bulleid N.J. Cabibbo A. Sitia R. J. Biol.

ERO1α is broadly expressed, whereas ERO1β is substantially restricted to the endocrine pancreas (16Dias-Gunasekara S. Gubbens J. van Lith M. Dunne C. Williams J.A. Kataky R. Scoones D. Lapthorn A.

Interestingly, mice homozygous for nearly complete loss-of-function mutations in both isoforms are viable and have a very mild kinetic defect in oxidative protein folding in explanted cells (17Zito E. Chin K.T. Blais J. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These observations point to the wide latitudes allowed for ERO1 activity in mammals and hold the prospect of targeting the enzyme with inhibitors. Here, we report on the application of a high throughput assay for ERO1α activity to the discovery of small molecule inhibitors and on the biochemical and cellular characterization of an inhibitor with a surprising mechanism for attaining specificity. A fusion protein of GST-SMT3-mouse ERO1α (residues 23–464) was expressed in the Rosetta (DE3) bacterial strain (Novagen). After growth at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8, the culture was shifted to 18 °C, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to 0.5 mm for an overnight incubation. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm imidazole) supplemented with protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A), and lysed by high pressure cell disruption. To remove cell debris, the lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,500 rpm, and the supernatant was subjected to glutathione affinity chromatography (5 ml of GSTrap 4B, GE Healthcare). Bacterially expressed and purified Ulp1p protease (18Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) was added to the purified protein and incubated overnight at 4° C to cleave the GST-SMT3 from the ERO1α (residues 23–464) prior to further gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-75 prep grade column. The cleaved ERO1α (residues 23–464) protein was reapplied to glutathione beads, and the flow through was collected. The concentration of the purified protein was determined spectroscopically at 280 nm and 446 nm in 6 m guanidine HCl and 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) assuming an extinction coefficient of 90,630 m−1 cm−1 (apo-ERO1α) and 11,300 m−1 cm−1 (FAD). All protein concentrations reported throughout this manuscript were determined similarly. Where indicated, 500 μl aliquots of TrxA in buffer A (65 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) were reduced with a 100-fold excess of dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at room temperature, and excess reductant was removed by size exclusion using a PD-10 gel filtration (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions of 500 μl were collected, and the thiol titer for pooled reduced thioredoxin (TrxAred) fractions was determined using aliquots diluted into 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Sigma) and measuring the average absorbance at 412 nm. ERO1α (residues 23–464), between 10 nm and 200 nm, and bacterially expressed TrxAred were combined in a 20-μl reaction in buffer A in a 384-well black round bottom plate (Corning catalog no. 3677) with 0.1 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (Worthington), 5 μm Amplex Ultra Red (AUR; Invitrogen) at room temperature and read kinetically at 535 ± 20 nm excitation and 590 ± 20 nm emission on a TECAN F500 fluorescent plate reader. The inhibitors were as follows: EN460 2-chloro-5-[4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-4-[(5-phenyl-2-furanyl)methylene]-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl], (TimTec, catalog no. ST05611) and QM295 (5(4H)-isoxazolone, 4-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methylene]-3-phenyl; Chembridge, catalog no. 5904135) were constituted to 10 mm in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and added where indicated. Oxygen consumption was measured using an Oxygraph Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments, Pentney, Kings Lynn, UK). All experiments were done at room temperature in air-saturated buffer at sea level (∼250 μm O2 in buffer A) as described (6Gross E. Sevier C.S. Heldman N. Vitu E. Bentzur M. Kaiser C.A. Thorpe C. Fass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Oxygen levels were monitored until a linear baseline was established, and catalytic oxygen consumption was initiated by the addition of TrxAred (50 μm) into a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 1 μm ERO1α (residues 23–464) with or without the indicated compounds (50 μm) with a final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration of 2%. 200 nm ERO1α, 20 μm TrxAred, and 200 μm DTT with the indicated concentration of inhibitor were combined in a 384-well format white-walled clear flat bottom plate (Falcon 3963) in a 20-μl total reaction volume. At end point, 0.5 mm DTNB was added, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read on a TECAN F500 plate reader, essentially as described (19Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21464) Google Scholar). ERO1α (1 μm) was reacted with TrxAred (10 μm) for the indicated amount of time ± inhibitors (25 μm) before quenching with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) (2 mm) and SDS (4%) for 1 h in the dark as described (7Sevier C.S. Qu H. Heldman N. Gross E. Fass D. Kaiser C.A. Cell. 2007; 129: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To detect ERO1α, samples were resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (10%) and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal serum raised to ERO1α (residues 23–464) protein. To detect TrxA, samples were resolved by nonreducing Tris-Tricine-PAGE (16.5%) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The absorbance spectra of compound EN460 and the indicated proteins were measured in a diode array (Agilent HP 8453) using a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Absorbance of EN460 (100 μm) following reaction with DTT, reduced glutathione (GSH), tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine (THP), or tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (TCEP) (all 500 μm) was measured kinetically in 1 ml of buffer A (pH 6.5) and again following the addition of N-ethyl maleimide (NEM, 4 mm). ERO1α (150 μm), TrxA (50 μm), EN460 (250 μm), and DTT (2 mm) were combined in 100 μl of buffer A for 60 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by gel filtration (G50 Sephadex, GE Healthcare). Samples were divided into three aliquots of 35 μl and exposed to THP (2 mm), FAD (1 mm), or both, where indicated, for 2 h at room temperature in the dark followed by a second gel filtration. ERO1α activity was measured by AUR assay. Where indicated, FAD concentration was determined by first denaturing in 8 m guanidine HCl, followed by measuring FAD fluorescence at 450ex and 535em at pH 2. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and plated the day before the experiment at 70% confluence in 6-well dishes. Cells were challenged with DTT (10 mm) and/or the indicated ERO1α inhibitors (50 μm) where indicated for 30 min. In the washout experiment, cells were washed free of the DTT and incubated with fresh media ± inhibitor. At harvest, phosphate-buffered saline containing NEM (10 mm) was added and the cells subsequently kept on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors, and 10 mm NEM). Protein concentrations were estimated by Lowry assay, and comparable amounts of protein were run on a nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antiserum to ERO1α. 293T cells stably transfected with the ATF6-UPRE-luciferase reporter (a gift of Michael Bassett and Jonathan Weissman, University of California, San Francisco) were treated overnight in low serum-containing media (5%) with the indicated concentration of tunicamycin (Calbiochem) or inhibitors. Cells were lysed in 25 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100), and luciferase was developed by addition of 25 ml of luciferase assay reagent (25 mm Gly-Gly, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 11.7 mm potassium phosphate, 1.6 mm ATP, 0.2 mg/ml CoA, 500 μm luciferin), and luminescence was read in a 96-well white plate (Costar catalog no. 3912) on a TECAN F500 plate reader. The effect of ERO1α inhibitors on the survival of cells exposed to tunicamycin were measured as described (20Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Khersonsky S. Marciniak S. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Javitt N. Chang Y.T. Ron D. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 2: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, Perk−/− mouse fibroblasts (21Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) were plated at a density of 5000 cells/well in 24-well plates. A day later, the medium was replaced with complete medium with or without the compounds at 24 μm. The cells were incubated with or without compound for 7 h and then exposed to the indicated concentration of tunicamycin for another 24 h in the continued presence of compound. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and returned to complete medium. After an additional 12 days of culture, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.05 mg/ml WST-1 (Dojindo) and 0.05 mg/ml phenazine methosulfate (Sigma), and the A450 minus the OD650 of 100 μl of medium from each well was measured after a 2–4-h incubation period. ERO1α catalyzes the transfer of a pair of electrons from reduced substrates to molecular oxygen with the formation of H2O2. A homogenous assay of ERO1α activity was developed in which reduced bacterial thioredoxin (TrxAred, a good in vitro surrogate for the natural substrates of ERO1α) is reacted with purified recombinant mouse ERO1α in the presence of oxygen. The H2O2 produced by this reaction drives the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mediated oxidation of AUR generating a fluorescent signal (Fig. 1A). When reactions were performed in the presence of a large excess of HRP, the rate of development of the fluorescent signal was limited by the concentration of TrxAred and by the amount of enzyme in the reaction. Under these conditions, the Km for TrxAred was 3.1 μm (Fig. 1B). At 20 μm TrxAred the enzyme showed a turnover number of five disulfide bonds generated per minute with initial rates that were linearly dependent on ERO1α concentration (Fig. 1, C and D). This assay was applied to a screen for small molecules that inhibit the development of the fluorescent signal. The assay performed well with Z values between 0.75 and 0.9 (supplemental Fig. 1). Among 210,965 compounds in the primary screen (supplemental Table 1), we identified 629 compounds that lowered AUR fluorescence by >2-fold. Inhibitors were counterscreened for their activity against HRP in an assay that employed H2O2, HRP, and AUR. Compounds that passed this test were rescreened for their ability to inhibit ERO1α in an orthogonal, colorimetric end point assay that detects the depletion of free thiols by ERO1α in the presence of TrxAred and DTT by the loss of reactivity to the Ellman reagent, DTNB (19Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21464) Google Scholar). Because the latter assay is performed at high concentrations of DTT (200 μm), it also selects against nonspecific thiol-reactive compounds. Compounds were stratified according to potency at the secondary screen level and restocked from powder. Employing these selective criteria (supplemental Fig. 2) left us with two candidate inhibitors: benzoic acid, 2-chloro-5-[4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-4-[(5-phenyl-2-furanyl)methylene]-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl], which we named EN460 in light of its enone group and molecular mass of 460 Da, and 5(4H)-isoxazolone,4-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methylene]-3-phenyl, which we named QM295, in view of its quinone methide group and molecular mass of 295 Da, (Fig. 2A). Both compounds inhibited the development of AUR fluorescence in a kinetic assay (Fig. 2B). The compound concentration needed to inhibit 50% of AUR fluorescence was nearly identical for both compounds, 1.9 μm (Fig. 2C). Both compounds also inhibited oxygen consumption by purified ERO1α in a reaction fed by TrxAred (Fig. 2D). As neither assay could distinguish between inhibitors that bound TrxAred and those that targeted ERO1α, we challenged purified ERO1α with TrxAred in the presence or absence of compounds and monitored the ERO1α redox state by labeling the free thiols with AMS. Like yeast ERO1, the cysteines in the mammalian enzyme mostly were oxidized in the basal state, and the protein demonstrated a high mobility in SDS-PAGE. Exposure to TrxAred lead to reduction of the regulatory disulfides, and a new steady state was attained whereby the enzyme was reduced, activated, and AMS-reactive, as demonstrated by its lower mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 9 and 10). In the absence of inhibitor in the assay, ERO1α returned to its oxidized, AMS-nonreactive, high mobility state following oxidation of the TrxAred, as reported in case of the yeast enzyme (7Sevier C.S. Qu H. Heldman N. Gross E. Fass D. Kaiser C.A. Cell. 2007; 129: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although the inhibitors did not affect the reduction of ERO1α by TrxAred, they appeared to block the ability of ERO1α to completely oxidize TrxAred in the assay (shown for EN460 in Fig. 2F, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5) and to return ERO1α to its high mobility state (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 4, 8 and 12). This inability to return to the high mobility state likely indicates a defect in ERO1α reoxidation rather than a covalent modification by the compound that affects mobility, as the position of ERO1α on SDS-PAGE was unaffected by the compound alone (i.e. when AMS was omitted from the reaction, data not shown). Together, these experiments suggest that the inhibitors function not by interfering with the transfer of electrons from TrxAred to ERO1α but rather by targeting the reduced enzyme such that further oxidation of dithiol substrates by molecular oxygen is compromised. A similar phenomenon was observed in vivo. At steady state, the ERO1α in mouse embryonic fibroblasts was mostly oxidized with high mobility on SDS-PAGE. Exposure of the cells to DTT (10 mm) lead to reduction of the disulfides in ERO1α and imparted a lower mobility on the protein in SDS-PAGE. Exposure of cells to EN460 or QM295 resulted in the accumulation of an ERO1α form with lower mobility, indicative of the reduced state (Fig. 3A). At steady state, QM295 had a less prominent effect of ERO1α oxidation than EN460 (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 3A). To confirm the inhibitory effect of QM295, we monitored ERO1α reoxidation following its reduction with DTT in cells and washout of the reductant. The presence of QM295 led to a marked delay in ERO1α reoxidation following DTT washout (Fig. 3B). Together, these observations suggest that both compounds were able to inhibit the enzyme in vivo as well as in vitro. Blocking ERO1 activity in yeast and worms activates the unfolded protein response (11Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 12Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). EN460 and QM295 were also found to activate an unfolded protein response reporter in cultured 293T cells (Fig. 3C). EN460 was a more potent activator, but its action was limited by toxicity at the highest concentrations used (data not shown), whereas QM295 had a more shallow and sustained dose response. Lowered levels of ERO1 activity can protect against severe ER stress in worms, yeast, and cultured mammalian cells (13Haynes C.M. Titus E.A. Cooper A.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 14Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes. Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 17Zito E. Chin K.T. Blais J. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we found that continuous exposure to low concentrations of EN460 (and to a lesser degree QM295) protected hypersensitive Perk−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (22Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar) from subsequent exposure to tunicamycin (Fig. 3D). Protection by ERO1α inhibitors was relatively modest, compared with a known protectant like TGD31BZ (20Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Khersonsky S. Marciniak S. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Javitt N. Chang Y.T. Ron D. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 2: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and was likely limited by toxicity. Nonetheless, these observations point to the potential for ERO1α inhibitors to protect against the consequences of severe ER stress in mammalian cells. Hereafter, we described studies on the mechanism of action of the more potent inhibitor EN460. A lag phase in EN460 inhibition of H2O2 production in the fluorescent assay (data not shown) suggested the hypothesis that the enone functionality of the inhibitor (Fig. 2A) reacts with cysteine residues uncovered during the reductive activation of ERO1α. To test for the irreversible inhibition predicted by this mechanism of action, we first exposed ERO1α (20 μm) to compound (250 μm) in the presence or absence of reduced substrate. We then diluted the mixture of enzyme and inhibitor 100-fold (to 200 nm and 2.5 μm, respectively) and compared the enzymatic activity in an assay that is sensitive to thiol depletion by ERO1α (Fig. 4A). When added to this assay at 2.5 μm, EN460 had a very modest inhibitory effect (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, when diluted to a 2.5 μm final concentration after having been allowed to first react with the enzyme at a 100-fold higher concentration, the inhibition was far more conspicuous (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 8 and 12). Furthermore, the degree of inhibition that persisted after dilution was greater in the sample in which ERO1α was first activated by reducing substrate when exposed to EN460 than in the sample in which ERO1α was oxidized and inactive when exposed to EN460 (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 10 and 12). In a related, confirmatory experiment, ERO1 and EN460 were allowed to react in the presence or absence of a reduced substrate, and the enzyme was then separated from the small molecules in the reaction mix by gel filtration and assayed kinetically using the AUR fluorescent assay (Fig. 4C). ERO1α exposed to EN460 in the absence of reduced substrate retained most of its enzymatic activity following the removal of excess EN460 by gel filtration, whereas the sample that was exposed to inhibitor in the presence of reduced substrate showed very low activity following gel filtration (Fig. 4D). Together, these experiments suggested that EN460 is an activity-dependent, poorly reversible, or irreversible inhibitor of ERO1. EN460 is colored red and has a broad absorbance peak between 450-550 nm both in aqueous solutions and in dimethyl sulfoxide. This chromophore is rapidly bleached by reductants, such as the thiols in DTT, GSH, and phosphine-based reagents THP and TCEP. A rapid decrease in visible absorbance is accompanied by a corresponding increase at 290 nm (Fig. 5, A and B). Consistent with the enone reactive functionality of EN460, DTT (Fig. 5C), and GSH (supplemental Fig. 3) form adducts with these thiols. These adducts are reversible as addition of excess NEM restored the absorbance peak at 470 nm and led to a loss of chromophore at 290 nm. In contrast, the phosphines generate reduced forms of EN460 that are reversed only slightly by NEM (Fig. 5C, upper panel). Like its yeast counterpart, mammalian ERO1α exhibits a bright yellow color due to the presence of FAD bound tightly but noncovalently within the active site of the oxidase (Fig. 6A, blue trace). The protein envelope contributes an additional absorbance band centered at 280 nm. In the experiments to follow, the subsequent modulation of the absorbance of ERO1α by covalent binding of EN460 was revealed after removing the spectral contribution of excess free reagent by gel filtration. When ERO1α was incubated with EN460 in the presence of TrxAred and DTT, the protein emerging from the gel filtration column showed notable additional absorbance at 290 nm and longer wavelengths (Fig. 6A, red trace). This feature was dominated by the covalent modification of the ERO1α protein because incubation of EN460 with reduced TrxAred and DTT in the absence of the oxidase did not generate this"

Genetic and biochemical approaches coupled with functional assays in cultured cells were used to explore the consequences of Nrf2 repression. Nrf2 suppression by Keap1-directed ubiquitylation or the expression of independent short hairpin RNA (shRNA)/siRNA sequences enhanced cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, Smad-dependent tumor cell motility and growth in soft agar. Loss of Nrf2 was accompanied by concomitant Smad linker region/C-terminus phosphorylation, induction of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressor Slug and suppression of the cell–cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. Ectopic expression of the wildtype but not dominant-negative Nrf2 suppressed the activity of a synthetic transforming growth factor-β1-responsive CAGA-directed luciferase reporter. shRNA knock-down of Nrf2 enhanced the activity of the synthetic CAGA reporter, as well as the expression of the endogenous Smad target gene plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Finally, we found that Nrf2/Smad3/Smad4 formed an immunoprecipitable nuclear complex. Thus, loss of Nrf2 increased R-Smad phosphorylation and R-Smad signaling, supporting the hypothesis that loss of Nrf2 in an oncogenic context-dependent manner can enhance cellular plasticity and motility, in part by using transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1993289308,"Minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm's) are components of the DNA replication licensing complex. In vivo, reduced expression or activity of Mcm's has been shown to result in highly penetrant early onset cancers (Shima et al., 2007; Pruitt et al., 2007) and stem cell deficiencies (Pruitt et al., 2007). Here we use mouse embryonic fibroblasts from an Mcm2-deficient strain of mice to show by DNA fiber analysis that origin usage is decreased in Mcm2-deficient cells under conditions of hydroxyurea (HU)-mediated replication stress. DNA damage responses (DDRs) resulting from HU and additional replication-dependent and replication-independent genotoxic agents were also examined and shown to function at wild-type (wt) levels. Further, basal levels of many components of the DDR were expressed at wt levels, showing that there is no acute replicative stress under normal growth conditions. Only very modest, 1.5- to 2-fold increases in the basal levels of gamma-H2AX, p21(cip1) and 53bp foci were found, consistent with a slight chronic elevation in DDR pathways. The one condition in which a larger difference between wt- and Mcm2-deficient cells was found occurred after ultraviolet irradiation and may reflect the role of Chk1-mediated suppression of dormant origins. In vivo, abrogating p53-mediated DDR in Mcm2-deficient mice results in increased embryonic lethality and accelerated cancer formation in surviving mice. Further, p53 mutation rescues the negative effect of Mcm2 deficiency on the survival of neural stem cells in vitro; however, the enhanced survival correlates with increased genetic damage relative to Mcm2 wt cells carrying the p53 mutation. Together these results show that even relatively minor perturbations to primary or dormant replication origin usage contribute to accelerated genetic damage in vivo. In addition, these studies show that tumor types resulting from Mcm2 deficiency are strongly affected by interaction with both genetic background and p53."

https://openalex.org/W2034148530,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) is a secreted protein involved in several cellular processes, including proliferation, senescence and apoptosis. Loss of IGFBP7 expression is a critical step in the development of human tumors, including melanoma and colon cancer. By microarray gene expression studies, we have detected downregulation of IGFBP7 gene expression in follicular and papillary thyroid tumors in comparison with normal thyroid tissue. Evaluation of publicly available PTC microarray gene expression data sets confirmed, in a consistent fraction of tumors, the downregulation of IGFBP7 transcript levels. The functional consequence of IGFBP7 downregulation was addressed in the PTC-derived NIM1 cell line in which IGFBP7 expression is repressed by promoter hypermethylation. Exposure to soluble IGFBP7 protein or restoration of IGFBP7 expression by complementary DNA transfection reduced growth rate, migration, anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity of NIM1 cells. We show that the effects of IGFBP7 are related to apoptosis. Our data suggest that loss of IGFBP7 expression has a functional role in thyroid carcinogenesis, and it may represent a possible basis for therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2082026429,"Understanding the functional implications of changes in gene expression, mutations, etc., is the aim of most genomic experiments. To achieve this, several functional profiling methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for the discovery of new cell functionalities with complex dependences on more than one variable."
https://openalex.org/W1980314357,"Lamin A, a key component of the nuclear lamina, is generated from prelamin A by four post-translational processing steps: farnesylation, endoproteolytic release of the last three amino acids of the protein, methylation of the C-terminal farnesylcysteine, and finally, endoproteolytic release of the last 15 amino acids of the protein (including the farnesylcysteine methyl ester). The last cleavage step, mediated by ZMPSTE24, releases mature lamin A. This processing scheme has been conserved through vertebrate evolution and is widely assumed to be crucial for targeting lamin A to the nuclear envelope. However, its physiologic importance has never been tested. To address this issue, we created mice with a “mature lamin A-only” allele (LmnaLAO), which contains a stop codon immediately after the last codon of mature lamin A. Thus, LmnaLAO/LAO mice synthesize mature lamin A directly, bypassing prelamin A synthesis and processing. The levels of mature lamin A in LmnaLAO/LAO mice were indistinguishable from those in “prelamin A-only” mice (LmnaPLAO/PLAO), where all of the lamin A is produced from prelamin A. LmnaLAO/LAO exhibited normal body weights and had no detectable disease phenotypes. A higher frequency of nuclear blebs was observed in LmnaLAO/LAO embryonic fibroblasts; however, the mature lamin A in the tissues of LmnaLAO/LAO mice was positioned normally at the nuclear rim.

This deletion does not affect protein farnesylation/methylation but abolishes the final cleavage by ZMPSTE24, resulting in the accumulation of a farnesylated, truncated prelamin A in cells (2Young S.G.

Interestingly, several HIV-protease inhibitors block ZMPSTE24 activity, leading to an accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A (9Caron M. Auclair M. Sterlingot H. Kornprobst M. Capeau J.

This prelamin A accumulation conceivably could underlie some side effects of HIV protease inhibitors, for example lipodystrophy and osteoporosis (9Caron M. Auclair M. Sterlingot H. Kornprobst M.

The discovery of a link between prelamin A processing and progeroid disorders has generated considerable excitement (2Young S.G. Fong L.G. Michaelis S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2531-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Worman H.J. Fong L.G. Muchir A. Young S.G. J. Clin.

But despite an explosion of interest in prelamin A, some fundamental issues regarding its processing have never been addressed. Notably, it is not even known whether the complicated scheme for lamin A biogenesis is physiologically important. Several cell culture studies have suggested that prelamin A processing is crucial for the delivery of lamin A to the nuclear envelope (18Holtz D. Tanaka R.A. Hartwig J. McKeon F. Cell. 1989; 59: 969-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Lutz R.J. Trujillo M.A. Denham K.S. Wenger L. Sinensky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this issue has never been assessed in vivo. Investigators interested in prelamin A are often asked the following questions: What would happen if the mature form of lamin A were synthesized directly, bypassing all of prelamin A enzymatic modifications? Would the absence of prelamin A processing lead to lethal disease phenotypes, akin to those occurring in Lmna knock-out mice? Is prelamin A processing crucial for the delivery of mature lamin A to the nuclear envelope? The answers to these questions are not known. We reasoned that prelamin A processing might be essential in mammals because this process has been conserved through vertebrate evolution (19Lutz R.J. Trujillo M.A. Denham K.S. Wenger L. Sinensky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Vorburger K. Kitten G.T. Nigg E.A.

Hosick T.J. Sinensky M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and also because of cell culture studies suggesting that the post-translational processing steps are essential for the targeting of the protein to the nuclear envelope (18Holtz D. Tanaka R.A. Hartwig J. McKeon F. Cell. 1989; 59: 969-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Lutz R.J. Trujillo M.A. Denham K.S. Wenger L. Sinensky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We predicted that eliminating prelamin A processing would elicit significant disease phenotypes. To test this prediction, we used gene targeting to create “mature lamin A-only” knock-in mice, where mature lamin A is synthesized directly, bypassing prelamin A processing. We compared the phenotypes of mature lamin A-only mice to “prelamin A-only” knock-in mice, which produce mature lamin A through the normal prelamin A processing pathway. Of note, both mature lamin A-only and prelamin A-only mice lack the capacity to synthesize lamin C. Thus, a side benefit of our experiments was to determine if the synthesis of lamin C is crucial for the growth and vitality of mice. We generated a mutant Lmna allele yielding only mature lamin A, LmnaLAO, using a strategy similar to one used to generate a mutant Lmna allele yielding progerin (LmnaHG) (32Yang S.H. Bergo M.O. Toth J.I. Qiao X. Hu Y. Sandoval S. Meta M. Bendale P. Gelb M.H. Young S.G. Fong L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10291-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The arms of the gene-targeting vector were generated by long-range PCR from genomic DNA isolated from 129/OlaHsd embryonic stem (ES) cells. A 3.8-kb 5′ arm, which spanned from the middle of intron 7 to the 3′-untranslated sequences in exon 12, was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Next, intron 10 was deleted with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); that mutation prevents lamin C synthesis. Next, the last 30 nucleotides of exon 11, intron 11, and the first 24 nucleotides of exon 12 were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis; this mutation brings the last codon of mature lamin A immediately adjacent to prelamin A stop codon. The 5′ arm was then cloned into the EcoRI site of pKSloxPNT-mod (33Joyner A.L. Skarnes W.C. Rossant J. Nature. 1989; 338: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Next, a 5-kb 3′ arm, identical to the one used in the LmnaHG project (32Yang S.H. Bergo M.O. Toth J.I. Qiao X. Hu Y. Sandoval S. Meta M. Bendale P. Gelb M.H. Young S.G. Fong L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10291-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), was cloned into the AscI site of pKSloxPNT-mod. The vector was linearized with NotI and electroporated into 129/OlaHsd ES cells. Targeted ES cells were identified by Southern blot analysis of EcoRI- or HindIII-digested genomic DNA with a 348-bp 5′-flanking probe. This probe was amplified from mouse genomic DNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CAA GGA GCT CGG ATT CTG TC-3′ and 5′-GTC AGG GAA GAG TGC AGA GG-3′. Targeted ES cells were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and the resulting male chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6 females to generate heterozygous knock-in mice (LmnaLAO/+). LmnaLAO/+ mice were intercrossed to generate homozygous mice (LmnaLAO/LAO). Genotyping of mice was performed by PCR. The wild-type allele was detected by amplifying a 450-bp fragment with primers 5′-GCT CCC ACT GCC TGT AAC TC-3′ and 5′-CAG AAG ATC ACG TGC AGG A-3′. The mutant allele was detected by amplifying a 350-bp fragment with primers 5′-GCT CCC ACT GCC TGT AAC TC-3′ and 5′-GCC AGA GGC CAC TTG TGT AG-3′. To exclude the possibility of unwanted mutations in the LmnaLAO or the LmnaPLAO alleles, the full-length lamin A cDNA was isolated from LmnaLAO/LAO fibroblasts, and the full-length prelamin A cDNA was isolated from both LmnaPLAO/PLAO and Lmna+/+ fibroblasts. Aside from the expected mutation in the LmnaLAO transcript, no other mutations were found. LmnaLAO/+ mice were bred with Zmpste24+/− mice (14Bergo M.O. Gavino B. Ross J. Schmidt W.K. Hong C.

All mice were fed a chow diet and housed in a virus-free barrier facility with a 12-h light-dark cycle. Animal experiments were approved by UCLA Animal Research Committee. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from day 13.5 postcoitum mouse embryos (35Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol.

Aynardi-Whitman M. Goldman R.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 399-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the proteins were separated on 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). The size-separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. The following antibodies were used: goat polyclonal antibodies against lamin A/C (1:400, sc6215), lamin B1 (1:200, sc6217), and actin (1:200, sc1616) (all Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a mouse monoclonal antibody against lamin B2 (1:200, E-3, Invitrogen), and a rat monoclonal antibody against prelamin A (1:50) (37Lee R.

Secondary antibodies were IRDye 700- or IRDye 800-labeled antibodies against mouse/rat/goat IgG (1:8000, Rockland Immunochemicals). Antibody binding was detected with a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared scanner. To assess the morphology of nuclei in embryonic fibroblasts, early passage cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with ice-cold methanol, rinsed briefly with acetone, and stained as described previously (32Yang S.H. Bergo M.O. Toth J.I. Qiao X. Hu Y. Sandoval S. Meta M. Bendale P. Gelb M.H. Young S.G. Fong L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10291-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: a rabbit polyclonal antibody against lamin A/C (1:50, sc20681), a goat polyclonal antibody against lamin B1 (1:200, sc6217) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal antibodies against lamin A (1:200, MAB3540, Chemicon) and lamin B2 (1:200, E-3, Invitrogen), and a rat monoclonal antibody against prelamin A (1:50) (37Lee R.

For secondary antibodies, we used Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 568-labeled antibodies against mouse/rabbit/rat/goat IgG (1:200, Invitrogen). DNA was visualized with DAPI. Images were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a ×40 objective and an ApoTome, and processed with AxoVision software, or were obtained on a Leica TCS-SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope with a ×63 objective. The confocal and STED images (Fig. S3) were recorded with a Leica TCS SP5 STED confocal system equipped with an oil immersion objective (HCX PL APO 100 × 1.4NA STED). A 635-nm pulsed diode laser (PicoQuant, Germany) was used for excitation. The pulses for STED depletion were delivered with a tunable Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai BB, Spectra Physics) emitting at 750 nm. Fluorescence emitted from an ATTO 647N-labeled secondary antibody against mouse IgG (Active Motif) was collected through a Semrock BrightLine FF01–685/40–25 nm band pass filter (Rochester, NY) in front of an avalanche photodiode (APD, PerkinElmer). Optical sectioning was achieved by using a detection pinhole set to 1 Airy. Scanning was performed at a line frequency of 10 Hz, averaged 1 to 2 times with an image format of 512 × 512 pixels. Pixel size was kept between 18.5 nm × 18.5 nm and 29.5 nm × 29.5 nm by applying a 10.2–16.4× digital zoom. For comparison of conventional confocal and STED confocal images, all imaging parameters were kept identical except for increasing the APD gain by 7% when recording the STED image in order to compensate for the slight loss of signal in STED microscopy resulting from the shrinking of the effective excitation spot. In some experiments, primary fibroblasts were treated with an FTI (ABT-100, 2–5 μm) or vehicle (DMSO) alone for 24 h. To analyze the frequency of nuclear blebbing in cultured fibroblasts, >800 cells/genotype were counted in blinded fashion as described (31Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Lammerding J. Vickers T.A. Meta M. Coté N.

Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissues from mice were sectioned (5-μm thick) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Light microscopy images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope with a ×40 objective and a RT slider 2.3.0 camera; images were recorded with SPOT 4.7 software (Diagnostic Instruments). To assess the location of lamin A within the nucleus, 6–10 μm-thick frozen tissue sections were fixed with ice-cold methanol, rinsed with acetone, permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, and then preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween and 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated with a rabbit antibody against lamin A/C (1:50, sc20681, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After several washes, the sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an Alexa Fluor 568-labeled antibody against rabbit IgG (1:200, Invitrogen).

Two parallel strips of Scotch tape were attached ∼5 mm apart to the bottom of the silicone membrane of the strain dish, resulting in a uniaxial strain field between the two strips during strain application. Fibroblasts were plated on fibronectin-coated silicone membranes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and cultured for 24 h. Before each assay, cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (1.5 μg/ml) for 15 min; the medium was then replaced with phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% FCS and 25 mm Hepes. Membranes were placed on a custom-made strain device, and 20% uniaxial strain was applied to the silicone membrane. Membrane and nuclear strains were computed based on bright field and fluorescent images acquired before, during, and after strain application. Normalized nuclear strain was defined as the ratio of nuclear strain to membrane strain to compensate for small variations in applied membrane strain. Cells that were damaged during or after strain application were excluded from the analysis. Disease phenotypes associated with Zmpste24 deficiency (abnormal body weight curves, reduced survival, and number of spontaneous rib fractures) were assessed in Zmpste24−/−Lmna+/+ and Zmpste24−/−LmnaLAO/+ mice, along with sibling control mice (Zmpste24+/+Lmna+/+, Zmpste24+/+LmnaLAO/+). Body weights were measured weekly for 20 weeks; numbers of surviving mice were also recorded weekly. The numbers of rib fractures were counted after removing the heart and lungs from the thoracic cavity (38Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Meta M. Coté N. Yang S.H. Stewart C.L. Sullivan T. Burghardt A. Majumdar S.

Statistical differences in the numbers of nuclei with nuclear blebs were assessed with the χ2 test. Variations in nuclear strain assays were analyzed with an unpaired t test with Welch's correction to account for differences in variances.

In the current study, we used gene targeting to create a mutant Lmna allele, LmnaLAO, that yields exclusively mature lamin A. The targeting event eliminated intron 10, thereby abolishing lamin C synthesis, and also deleted all DNA sequences between the last codon of mature lamin A (in exon 11) and the prelamin A stop codon (in exon 12) (Fig. 1A). Gene-targeting events were identified by Southern blotting of EcoRI- or HindIII-digested genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). We predicted that the LmnaLAO allele would yield exclusively mature lamin A. To test this prediction, we performed Western blot analyses on extracts of LmnaLAO/+ and LmnaLAO/LAO embryonic fibroblasts with an antibody against lamin A/C. As controls, we examined fibroblasts from wild-type (Lmna+/+) embryos and embryos harboring a prelamin A-only allele (LmnaPLAO/+ and LmnaPLAO/PLAO). The LmnaPLAO allele contains a deletion of intron 10 (which abolishes lamin C synthesis) but no other mutations (43Davies B.S. Barnes R.H. Tu Y. Ren S. Andres D.A. Spielmann H.P. Lammerding J. Wang Y. Young S.G. Fong L.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar). As expected, LmnaLAO/LAO and LmnaPLAO/PLAO fibroblasts contained mature lamin A, but no lamin C (Fig. 1C). In LmnaLAO/LAO fibroblasts, lamin A was synthesized directly, whereas in LmnaPLAO/PLAO fibroblasts, it was generated through prelamin A processing. Thus, when prelamin A processing was blocked with a protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), prelamin A accumulated in LmnaPLAO/PLAO fibroblasts, but not in LmnaLAO/LAO fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). The amount of lamin A in primary LmnaLAO/LAO fibroblasts was greater than in Lmna+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). This result was not surprising, given that all of the output of the LmnaLAO allele is channeled into the production of mature lamin A (rather than split bet"

During this process, DnaK binds its substrates in coordination with a catalytic ATPase cycle. Both the ATPase and protein folding activities of DnaK are stimulated by its co-chaperones, DnaJ and GrpE. However, it is not yet clear how changes in the stimulated ATPase rate of DnaK impact the folding process. In this study, we performed mutagenesis throughout the nucleotide-binding domain of DnaK to generate a collection of mutants in which the stimulated ATPase rates varied from 0.7 to 13.6 pmol/μg/min−1. We found that this range was largely established by differences in the ability of the mutants to be stimulated by one or both of the co-chaperones. Next, we explored how changes in ATPase rate might impact refolding of denatured luciferase in vitro and found that the two activities were poorly correlated. Unexpectedly, we found several mutants that refold luciferase normally in the absence of significant ATP turnover, presumably by increasing the flexibility of DnaK. Finally, we tested whether DnaK mutants could complement growth of ΔdnaK E. coli cells under heat shock and found that the ability to refold luciferase was more predictive of in vivo activity than ATPase rate.

Escherichia coli DnaK is a member of the highly conserved heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) 4The abbreviations used are: Hsp70heat shock protein 70SBDsubstrate-binding domainNBDnucleotide-binding domainDTTdithiothreitolWTwild typeATPadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). family, and it is involved in a variety of cellular pathways, including protein folding, transport, and degradation (1Rensing S.A. Maier U.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). As a central player in protein quality control and homeostasis, Hsp70 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases (3Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Patury S. Miyata Y. Gestwicki J.E. Curr. Top. Med.

These observations have led to an interest in understanding how the various activities of Hsp70 are correlated. heat shock protein 70 substrate-binding domain nucleotide-binding domain dithiothreitol wild type adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). One of the main roles of DnaK is to enable the folding of nascent or otherwise unfolded proteins (6Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In this role, DnaK is thought to limit aggregation and facilitate folding by binding to the hydrophobic regions exposed in these substrates. Briefly, DnaK, like all the Hsp70 family members, consists of a substrate-binding domain (SBD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) connected by a hydrophobic linker (7Bertelsen E.B. Chang L. Gestwicki J.E. Zuiderweg E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8471-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 8Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J.

The NBD of DnaK is further divided into four subdomains as follows: IA/IIA, which form the base, and IB/IIB, which form the upper walls of the nucleotide binding cleft (Fig. 1A). The binding of ATP to DnaK results in an “open” conformation with low substrate affinity. Upon hydrolysis, the ADP-bound form assumes a “closed” conformation that binds substrate with higher affinity (10Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Schmid D. Baici A.

Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, allosteric communication between the two domains is thought to link nucleotide turnover to substrate binding and release. DnaK alone has a low intrinsic ATPase rate, which facilitates regulation by the important co-chaperones, DnaJ and GrpE. DnaJ specifically stimulates ATP hydrolysis and thus favors high affinity substrate binding (17Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition, DnaJ independently binds to substrates with its C-terminal domains and is thought to help these proteins bind to DnaK (19Goffin L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). GrpE, on the other hand, induces nucleotide exchange and leads to substrate release (21Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). These co-chaperone activities appear to be required for the cellular functions of DnaK because deletion of either DnaJ or GrpE causes defects in growth at elevated temperatures, similar to what is seen in ΔdnaK strains (5Paek K.H. Walker G.C. J Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 283-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2748-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sell S.M. Eisen C. Ang D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the key insights into the folding of substrates by DnaK have emerged from in vitro studies on the model substrate, firefly luciferase. For example, it was found that DnaK requires DnaJ and GrpE to refold denatured luciferase (6Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This platform has also been used to explore the roles of ATP hydrolysis in controlling substrate folding. For example, this process was found to require multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis (5Paek K.H. Walker G.C. J Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 283-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Also, ATPγS blocks refolding, further suggesting an important role for nucleotide cycling (24Wisén S. Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 374: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Barthel T.K. Zhang J. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5482-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Klucken J. Shin Y. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, truncated forms of DnaJ, which are able to stimulate ATP hydrolysis normally but cannot interact with substrates, are unable to stimulate luciferase refolding (18Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that ATPase activity is necessary but not sufficient to achieve luciferase folding. Finally, the chaperone function of DnaK can also be assayed in vivo by monitoring the ability of DnaK mutants to complement growth of ΔdnaK E. coli cells under heat shock (also called heat shock rescue) (27Bardwell J.C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). At elevated temperatures, many proteins in E. coli become prone to unfolding and aggregation. One of the roles of DnaK is to bind these substrates, protecting them from aggregation (3Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Gragerov A. Nudler E. Komissarova N. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Nikiforov V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10341-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Röder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Following a return to normal temperature, DnaK also participates in active refolding (30Groemping Y. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Grimshaw J.P. Jelesarov I. Siegenthaler R.K. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19048-19053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similar to what was observed in the in vitro luciferase refolding experiments, the ATPase activity of DnaK appears to be required during heat shock, because active site mutations that abolish nucleotide turnover are unable to rescue heat shock (24Wisén S. Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 374: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Barthel T.K. Zhang J. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5482-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Klucken J. Shin Y. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that ATPase rate may be an important modulator of chaperone activities. However, previous studies largely relied on either single mutations of catalytic residues or nucleotide mimics (24Wisén S. Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 374: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Barthel T.K. Zhang J. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5482-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Klucken J. Shin Y. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unknown if changes in the rate of ATP hydrolysis lead to predictable changes in chaperone functions, such as luciferase folding and heat shock rescue. Insights into these relationships have been complicated by several factors. First, the DnaK chaperone system is impacted by a number of potential variables. For example, several studies have highlighted substrate binding kinetics, interdomain communication, and the stimulation of the DnaK ATPase rate as important variables for refolding or cellular growth under heat shock (19Goffin L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Kamath-Loeb A.S. Lu C.Z. Suh W.C. Lonetto M.A. Gross C.A. J. Biol.

Second, the interdependence of these variables presents important challenges. For example, a mutation that disrupts interdomain communication might also interfere with substrate binding and DnaJ-mediated ATPase stimulation (34Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 41Jiang J. Maes E.G. Taylor A.B. Wang L. Hinck A.P. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 422-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To better understand how the ATPase rate might regulate chaperone activity, we have undertaken a strategy of performing mutagenesis on the NBD of DnaK to generate a battery of mutants that varied in their co-chaperone-stimulated ATPase rates by over 15-fold. We envisioned that this collection of mutants might reveal the trends between turnover rates and folding outcomes. Moreover, one of our main goals in this study was to support our ongoing efforts to discover chemical compounds that target Hsp70s (24Wisén S. Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 374: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 42Jinwal U.K. Miyata Y. Koren 3rd, J. Jones J.R. Trotter J.H. Chang L. O'Leary J. Morgan D. Lee D.C. Shults C.L. Rousaki A.

Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As part of those studies, we wanted to evaluate if genetic modulation of the DnaK ATPase rate can predicatively modulate chaperone activities in vitro and in vivo. We anticipated that knowledge about these relationships would enable more predictive strategies for finding potent chemical probes for use in cellular and animal models. Here, we report that ATP hydrolysis rate and luciferase refolding activity were poorly correlated. The disconnection between these two activities was most striking in a series of mutations that displayed negligible ATPase activity but retained normal refolding activity. Moreover, we found that, across the whole series of mutants, the in vitro refolding activity was more predictive of heat shock rescue than ATPase activity. These results provide insight into the function of the DnaK chaperone network. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen); pMCSG7 plasmid (Midwest Center for Structural Genomics, Bethesda); ATP-agarose column (Sigma); NRLLLTG peptide (University of Michigan Peptide Core) (15Buczynski G. Slepenkov S.V. Sehorn M.G. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27231-27236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); luciferase and SteadyGlo Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI); and ΔdnaK E. coli cells (a generous gift from Dr. Ursula Jacob). Furthermore, all absorbance and luminescence measurements were performed using a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The E. coli dnaK and grpE genes were amplified by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase and inserted into the pMCSG7 plasmid through ligation-independent cloning, as described previously (44Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The partial overlapping site-directed mutagenesis primers for dnaK were designed based on the report of Zheng et al. (45Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis of the dnak gene was carried out following the user manual for the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Twenty nine dnaK mutants were made as follows: T12A, K55A, R56A, F67L, R71A, D85A, M89A, P90A, F91A, K106A, E171S, L177A, V192A, Y193A, G198A, T199A, I202A, S203A, E217A, G223A, L227A, G228A, E230A, E230Q, D231N, D233A, S234A, K263A, and I373A. The wild type (WT) His-tagged DnaK and its mutants were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and first purified by batch purification with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His·Bind® resin (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) following the user manual. The His tag of eluted DnaK was then removed by His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease (1 mm DTT, 4 °C, overnight incubation). After adjusting the MgCl2 and KCl concentration to 10 mm, the sample was further purified by ATP-agarose column using previously established protocols (43Chang L. Bertelsen E.B. Wisén S. Larsen E.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, the remaining cleaved His tag was removed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The purification of GrpE followed the same strategy except that the ATP-agarose column was excluded. DnaJ was purified as described previously (43Chang L. Bertelsen E.B. Wisén S. Larsen E.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with the exclusion of hydroxyapatite and Q-Sepharose fast-flow column purification steps and the addition of a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) to remove contaminating ATPase activity. Finally, N-terminal His-tagged J-domain 2–108 was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described above without cleaving the His tag. All proteins were concentrated and exchanged into 25 mm Tris buffer (10 mm KCl (150 mm KCl for DnaJ), 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) and stored at −80 °C until use. WT DnaK and mutants were prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm sodium fluoride, pH 7.4) and spectra collected at 0.1 mg/ml in a 0.1-cm cuvette at room temperature. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) at 1-nm intervals from 190 to 260 nm at a scanning speed of 50 nm/min and a 5.0 nm bandwidth. Each spectrum reported is the average of 15 scans after the subtraction of the base-line spectrum (buffer without the addition of DnaK) and normalization (millidegree cm2 dmol−1). This procedure was adapted from a previously described protocol (43Chang L. Bertelsen E.B. Wisén S. Larsen E.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were prepared with the addition of DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, NR substrate (NRLLLTG), and/or denatured luciferase to a total volume of 15 μl in each well. Next, 10 μl of 2.5 mm ATP was added to start the reaction. The final concentrations were as follows: ATP (1 mm), DnaK (0.5 μm), and NR substrate (100 μm), unless otherwise noted. Intrinsic ATPase rate was measured with DnaK (0.6 μm) in the absence of co-chaperones or substrate. When ATPase rate was tested as a comparison to refolding activity (see FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), guanidine hydrochloride-denatured luciferase at 8 nm and DnaK at 1 μm were used to match the conditions described in the luciferase refolding assay (see below). The final concentrations of DnaJ, GrpE, are reported for each experiment under “Results.” For steady state conditions, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1–3 h, and then 80 μl of malachite green reagent was added to each well, immediately followed by 10 μl of 32% (w/v) sodium citrate. Samples were mixed thoroughly and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Finally, A620 was measured. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the signal from nonspecific ATP hydrolysis in controls lacking DnaK was subtracted. A phosphate standard curve (using potassium dibasic phosphate) was generated each day and used to convert the units to pmol of Pi/μg of DnaK/min.FIGURE 3IB decoupling mutations increased DnaK flexibility and decreased DnaJ-mediated ATPase stimulation without impacting luciferase refolding activity. A, NBD of DnaK is shown with a close-up on the region around residues Phe-67, Pro-90, and Phe-91. These three residues appear to stabilize loop(74–96) (dark gray), which is connected to the critical catalytic residue, Lys-70. B, mutant F67L was more susceptible to trypsin digestion and demonstrated a different digestion pattern than WT-DnaK or a representative IB mutant, D85A. C, for decoupling mutants F91A and F67L, the Km value for DnaJ-mediated ATPase stimulation was significantly increased. D, however, the decoupling mutants did not impact DnaJ-stimulated luciferase refolding. The final concentrations were as follows: DnaK (1 μm), GrpE (0.125 μm), denatured luciferase (8 nm), and ATP (1 mm) in both C and D.

The luciferase refolding activity of DnaK WT and mutants was evaluated as described with minor changes (24Wisén S. Gestwicki J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 374: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, denatured firefly luciferase was prepared by beginning with a concentrated stock (8.2 μm) of luciferase with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 25 mm HEPES buffer (50 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.2). This stock was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then diluted to 0.2 μm with the same HEPES buffer without guanidine hydrochloride. This preparation was used as the stock solution for final sample preparation. Enzyme mix (10 μl) containing DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and denatured firefly luciferase in 39 mm HEPES (170 mm potassium acetate, 1.7 mm magnesium acetate, 3 mm DTT, 12 mm creatine phosphate, 50 units/ml creatine kinase, pH 7.6) was first added into each well, and then 4 μl of 3.5 mm ATP, dissolved in water, was added to start the reaction. The final concentration of DnaK was 1 μm; denatured luciferase was 8 nm, and ATP was 1 mm unless otherwise noted. The concentration of DnaJ and GrpE is reported for each experiment under “Results.” After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, equilibrium was reached, and 14 μl of 0.5 or 2% (v/v) SteadyGlo reagent in 50 mm glycine buffer (30 mm MgSO4, 10 mm ATP, and 4 mm DTT, pH 7.8) was added into each well, and the luminescence was measured. For each experiment, the signal from a negative control containing everything but DnaK was subtracted. Native luciferase was diluted to 0.032 μm in 50 mm HEPES (10 mm MgSO4, 300 mm KCl, 20 mm DTT, pH 7.5) and loaded into a 96-well PCR plate (ThermoFisher) (5 μl/well). Next, 5 μl of 2 μm DnaK was added in triplicate into the wells containing luciferase. The reaction mixtures were heated to 39.5 °C for 8 min, and the samples were transferred into a 96-well, opaque, white microtiter plate (ThermoFisher). Next, 10 μl of 0.5% v/v SteadyGlo reagent, as described above, was added to each well, and the luminescence was measured. The partial proteolysis protocol was adapted from a previously described method (14Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schröder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Briefly, we prepared samples of 6 μm DnaK in 40 mm HEPES buffer (20 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) with 1 mm nucleotide (ADP or ATP). Additives such as J-domain (residues 2–108, 4-fold molar equivalents) were noted when included. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Trypsin (Sigma, EC 3.4.2.1.4) was added at a 1:4 (trypsin:DnaK) molar ratio to bring the final volume to 50 μl. Proteolysis was carried out at room temperature for 20 min, unless otherwise noted. The reaction was quenched with the addition of 25 μl of SDS loading buffer (240 mm Tris, 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 16% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 mg/ml bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were analyzed using a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Thermosensitive E. coli ΔdnaK (DE3) cells that expressed target genes under the T7 promoter were generated using λDE3 lysogenization kit (Novagen) based on the reported method of Sugimoto et al. (46Sugimoto S. Higashi C. Yoshida H. Sonomoto K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 60: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). pMCSG7 plasmids containing dnaK WT and mutant genes were transformed into ΔdnaK (DE3) E. coli cells, and transformation with an empty pMCSG7 vector served as a negative control. For the complementation assay, a single colony of each dnaK mutant was inoculated into 5 ml of LB with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown with shaking overnight at 30 °C. The next day, all the overnight cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.055 by LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 4 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. From the diluted culture, a 100-μl aliquot was loaded onto a transparent 96-well flat bottom plate (Corning Glass) in triplicate. These samples were incubated at 43 °C with shaking for 6 h, and the A600 value for each well was measured. The expression of DnaK protein in each clone was verified by adding 4 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the undiluted overnight culture, incubating at 37 °C for 5 h, lysing the cultures, normalizing the protein content, and then separating proteins by SDS-PAGE. In this study we aimed to assess whether changes in the ATPase rate of DnaK lead to predictable changes in chaperone function. Toward this goal, we employed available mutational and structural data to select ∼30 novel or established mutations in the NBD of DnaK (8Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J.

https://openalex.org/W2080240482,"We have previously demonstrated that cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a calcium signaling messenger in interleukin 8 (IL-8)-induced lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. In this study we examined the possibility that IL-8 activates CD38 to produce another messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), in LAK cells, and we showed that IL-8 induced NAADP formation after cADPR production. These calcium signaling messengers were not produced when LAK cells prepared from CD38 knock-out mice were treated with IL-8, indicating that the synthesis of both NAADP and cADPR is catalyzed by CD38 in LAK cells. Application of cADPR to LAK cells induced NAADP production, whereas NAADP failed to increase intracellular cADPR levels, confirming that the production of cADPR precedes that of NAADP in IL-8-treated LAK cells. Moreover, NAADP increased intracellular Ca(2+) signaling as well as cell migration, which was completely blocked by bafilomycin A1, suggesting that NAADP is generated in lysosome-related organelles after cADPR production. IL-8 or exogenous cADPR, but not NAADP, increased intracellular cAMP levels. cGMP analog, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, increased both cADPR and NAADP production, whereas the cAMP analog, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, increased only NAADP production, suggesting that cAMP is essential for IL-8-induced NAADP formation. Furthermore, activation of Rap1, a downstream molecule of Epac, was required for IL-8-induced NAADP formation in LAK cells. Taken together, our data suggest that IL-8-induced NAADP production is mediated by CD38 activation through the actions of cAMP/Epac/protein kinase A/Rap1 in LAK cells and that NAADP plays a key role in Ca(2+) signaling of IL-8-induced LAK cell migration."

BALB/c mice were subcutaneously implanted with C26 colon carcinoma cells, and 2 d later they received either solvent or red wine polyphenols (RWPs) (100 mg/kg/d, human equivalent dose ≈500 mg/d) in the drinking water for 25 d. Wistar rats received either solvent or RWPs (100 mg/kg/d, human equivalent dose ≈1000 mg/d) in the drinking water 1 wk before injection of azoxymethane and were studied 10 wk later. In mice, RWPs inhibited tumor growth by 31%, reduced tumor vascularization and the number of lung metastases, decreased proliferation as indicated by down-regulation of Ki67, cyclin D1, and UHRF1, and increased apoptosis as indicated by TUNEL staining and active caspase-3 levels in tumor cells. RWPs reduced expression of VEGF, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and cyclooxygenase-2 and increased expression of tumor suppressor genes p16INK4A, p53, and p73 in tumor cells. In rats, RWPs reduced by 49% the number of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci (preneoplastic lesions) in colon. Thus, RWPs effectively reduced the development of colon carcinoma tumors in vivo by blunting tumor vascularization and by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis of tumor cells subsequent to an up-regulation of tumor suppressor genes.—Walter, A., Etienne-Selloum, N., Brasse, D., Khallouf, H., Bronner, C., Rio, M.-C., Beretz, A., Schini-Kerth, V.

https://openalex.org/W1994610567,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) often establishes a persistent infection that most likely involves a complex host-virus interplay. We previously reported that the HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) bound to cellular protein FKBP38 and resulted in apoptosis suppression in human hepatoma cell line Huh7. In the present research we further found that NS5A increased phosphorylation levels of two mTOR-targeted substrates, S6K1 and 4EBP1, in Huh7 in the absence of serum. mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or NS5A knockdown blocked S6K1 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation increase in NS5A-Huh7 and HCV replicon cells, suggesting that NS5A specifically regulated mTOR activation. Overexpression of NS5A and FKBP38 mutants or FKBP38 knockdown revealed this mTOR activation was dependent on NS5A-FKBP38 interaction. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 treatment in NS5A-Huh7 showed that the mTOR activation was independent of PI3K. Moreover, NS5A suppressed caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation, which was abolished by NS5A knockdown or rapamycin, indicating NS5A inhibited apoptosis specifically through the mTOR pathway. Further analyses suggested that apoptotic inhibition exerted by NS5A via mTOR also required NS5A-FKBP38 interaction. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation showed that NS5A disrupted the mTOR-FKBP38 association. Additionally, NS5A or FKBP38 mutants recovered the mTOR-FKBP38 interaction; this indicated that the impairment of mTOR-FKBP38 association was dependent on NS5A-FKBP38 binding. Collectively, our data demonstrate that HCV NS5A activates the mTOR pathway to inhibit apoptosis through impairing the interaction between mTOR and FKBP38, which may represent a pivotal mechanism for HCV persistence and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018254952,"Altered neurotrophic support as a result of reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and trafficking has been revealed as a key factor in Huntington disease (HD) pathology. BDNF binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB, leading to activation of intracellular signaling pathways to promote differentiation and cell survival. In order to design new neuroprotective therapies based on BDNF delivery, it is important to define whether BDNF-mediated TrkB signaling is affected in HD. Here, we demonstrate reduced TrkB-mediated Ras/MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling but unchanged phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and phospholipase Cγ activation in knock-in HD striatal cells. Altered BDNF-mediated ERK1/2 activation in mutant huntingtin cells is associated with reduced expression of p52/p46 Shc docking proteins. Notably, reduced BDNF-induced ERK1/2 activation increases the sensitivity of mutant huntingtin striatal cells to oxidative damage. Accordingly, pharmacological activation of the MAPK pathway with PMA prevents cell death induced by oxidative stress. Taken together, our results suggest that in addition to reduced BDNF, diminished Ras/MAPK/ERK1/2 activation is involved in neurotrophic deficits associated with HD pathology.

Thus, recent evidence demonstrates that wild type huntingtin facilitates BDNF transcription, whereas mutant huntingtin impairs it (5Zuccato C. Ciammola A. Rigamonti D. Leavitt B.R. Goffredo D.

Accordingly, BDNF mRNA expression and protein levels are reduced in cortex and striatum of HD patients and in mouse and cellular models of HD (7Duan W. Guo Z. Jiang H. Ware M. Li X.J. Mattson M.P.

In order to respond to BDNF, striatal neurons must exhibit an appropriate expression and function of its high affinity receptor TrkB. Notably, we have previously described a significant reduction of total TrkB receptors in several HD mouse models, HD knock-in cells, and HD human brain (11Ginés S. Bosch M. Marco S. Gavaldà N. Díaz-Hernández M. Lucas J.J. Canals J.M. Alberch J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, reduced TrkB mRNA levels were also found in caudate but not in the cortex of HD patients (10Zuccato C. Marullo M. Conforti P. MacDonald M.E. Tartari M. Cattaneo E. Brain Pathol. 2008; 18: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These results suggest that altered neurotrophic support as a result of BDNF deficit may contribute to the selective degeneration of striatal neurons in HD. However, no study has been reported on the functional consequences of TrkB down-regulation in HD pathology. The neuroprotective action of BDNF through TrkB receptors is associated with activation of MAPKs, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and the PLC-γ pathways (12Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr.

We found in mutant huntingtin striatal cells a defective BDNF-mediated Ras-MAPK-ERK1/2 activation but unaffected BDNF-induced PI3K-Akt and PLC-γ signaling. We provide evidence that diminished levels of p52/p46 adapter proteins rather than decreased cell surface TrkB receptor per se may account for the reduced BDNF-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Finally, the functional relevance of altered BDNF-induced ERK1/2 activation in mutant cells was demonstrated by analysis of cell death and dysfunction induced by oxidative stress. Based on these data, we propose that pharmacological modulation of the ERK1/2 pathway may provide a new therapeutic target in HD. brain-derived neurotrophic factor Huntington disease mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phospholipase Cγ extracellular signal-regulated kinase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate epidermal growth factor mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase phosphate-buffered saline quantitative PCR cAMP-response element CRE-binding protein glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin.

The knock-in striatal models faithfully represent the HD mutation carried by patients because elongated polyglutamine tracts are placed within the correct context of the murine Hdh gene.

Striatal cells were grown at 33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% streptomycin/penicillin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen). To analyze TrkB signaling, wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells were placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h and then exposed to BDNF (100 ng/ml), EGF (25 ng/ml), or PMA (1 μm) for different time periods (0, 5, 15, and 30 min). To analyze the neuroprotective role of ERK1/2 activation against oxidative stress, wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells were treated with 200 μm H2O2 or pretreated with BDNF (100 ng/ml for 15 min) or BDNF in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm for 15 min) before H2O2 treatment. Total cellular extracts were collected in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris base (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein contents were determined by a (detergent-compatible) protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts (30 μg) were mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, resolved by 6–10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were blocked in 10% nonfat powdered milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (phospho-p44/42 ERK1/2 (1:1000), total ERK1/2 (1:2500), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221) (1:1000), total MEK1/2 (1:1000), phospho-c-Raf (Ser338) (1:1000), total c-Raf (1:1000), phospho-Akt (Ser473) (1:1000), total Akt (1:1000), phospho-PLC-γ (Tyr783) (1:1000), PLC-γ (1:1000), phospho-Trk (Tyr496/490) (1:1000), total TrkB (1:500), total Shc (1:1000), total IRS-1 (1:1000), total Ras (1:2500), anti-HA (1:1000), or α-tubulin (1:50,000)). The membranes were then rinsed three times with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing for 30 min with TBS-T, the membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The Gel-Pro densitometry program (Gel-Pro Analyzer for Windows version 4.0.00.001) was used to quantify the different immunoreactive bands relative to the intensity of the α-tubulin band in the same membranes. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of band density obtained in three independent experiments. Surface TrkB receptors were measured by biotinylation followed by Western blot using a specific antibody that only recognizes full-length TrkB isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), as described elsewhere (16Du J. Feng L. Yang F. Lu B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1423-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells were incubated in Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) in cold PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 30 min. The surface biotinylation was stopped by removing the above solution and incubating the cells in 10 mm ice-cold glycine in PBS for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and an additional once with cold PBS and then harvested and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris base (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein contents were determined by (detergent-compatible) protein assay (Bio-Rad). Surface-biotinylated TrkB receptors were immunoprecipitated from total extracts (500 μg) by Immunopure immobilized streptavidin (Pierce), separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot using a polyclonal anti-TrkB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105/well (triplicate wells), fixed in 4% (w/w) paraformaldehyde for 15 min to detect surface TrkB immunostaining, or fixed and then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% saponin (5 min) to visualize total TrkB and Ras protein. Blocking was done in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, and cells were then incubated for 2 h in blocking solution containing anti-TrkB antibody (extracellular domain, 1:100; Millipore), anti-TrkB (total TrkB, 1:500; Santa Cruz) or anti-Ras antibody (1:200; BD Bioscience). After several washes in PBS (three times for 5 min each), cells were then incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse (1:200) or Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:300) (Invitrogen). For TrkB staining, cells were examined by confocal microscopy using a TCS SL laser-scanning confocal spectral microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany) with argon and helium-neon lasers attached to a DMIRE2 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg). Images were taken using a ×63 numerical aperture objective with a ×4 digital zoom and standard (1 Airy disk) pinhole. For each cell, the entire three-dimensional stack of images from the ventral surface to the top of the cell was obtained by using the Z drive in the TCS SL microscope. For Ras staining, cells were observed with a BX60 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with an Orca-ER cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). TrkB and Ras immunofluorescence was quantified using the ImageJ version 1.33 by Wayne Rasband (National Institutes of Health). In all cases, 20–25 cells were randomly selected from at least three independent cultures. To analyze the sensitivity of wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells to oxidative stress, striatal cells were treated for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 200 μm H2O2. Cells were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed in PBS (three times for 5 min each), and permeabilized for 10 min with PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin. Actin cytoskeleton was visualized by incubating cells for 30 min with 0.1 mg/ml of TRITC-labeled phalloidin. Stained cells were observed with a BX60 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with an Orca-ER cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). To analyze whether PMA-mediated neuroprotection from H2O2 involved protein kinase C activation, MAPK signaling was inhibited in wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells by incubation with the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (10 μm for 15 min) prior to PMA treatment (1 μm for 15 min), and H2O2-induced cell death was determined by analysis of actin cytoskeleton. Cell survival was quantified by counting the total number of cells in treated conditions versus vehicle-treated conditions (100%). Forty fields were counted per condition and experiment, comprising at least 20–25 cells. Data are given as mean ± S.D. of values obtained in three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells were stimulated with BDNF (100 ng/ml) or EGF (25 ng/ml) for 15 min, harvested with the lysis buffer (the same as that for Western blot), and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of lysates were set aside to allow quantification of total Ras by immunoblotting. Equal amounts of the remainder lysates were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with beads coated with fusion protein (GST-Raf1-RBD) consisting of GST fused to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 (Millipore). Beads were washed three times with cold PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and an additional once with cold PBS. Bound protein was eluted for 5 min with 5× Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting for Ras. For the study of Ras-dependent induction of the ERK1/2 pathway, wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Wild type and mutant huntingtin cells at 70% confluence were transfected with HA-RasV12, a constitutively active form of Ras (generously provided by Dr. N. Agell, University of Barcelona), and the protein extracts were prepared 24 h post-transfection. The luciferase vector pGL3 Basic vector containing the promoter 2 (P2) of the trkB gene (1600trkBP2-Luc) (17Barettino D. Pombo P.M. Espliguero G. Rodríguez-Peña A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Rodriguez-Peña (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain). Briefly, wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells were seeded into 24-well plates and co-transfected (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) with P2-CRE-TrkB-Luc (0.3 μg) and the pRL-TK construct (0.25 μg) (Promega, Madison, WI), which produces Renilla luciferase as a control for transfection efficiency. At 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed with Glo Lysis buffer, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in cell lysates were sequentially measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and luminometer (BIO-TEK Clarity). Firefly luciferase luminescence was normalized by Renilla luciferase luminescence. The mean values for each construct were obtained from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Total RNA from wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells was extracted using the Total RNA Isolation Nucleospin® RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Total RNA (500 ng) was used to synthesize cDNA using random primers with the StrataScript® first strand cDNA synthesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA synthesis was performed at 42 °C for 60 min in a final volume of 20 μl according to manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was then analyzed by Q-PCR using the following TaqMan® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA): 18 S (Hs99999901_s1) and p52/p46 Shc (Mm00468940_m1). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed in 25-μl volumes on 96-well plates, in a reaction buffer containing 12.5 μl of Brilliant® Q-PCR Master Mix (Stratagene), 1.25 μl of TaqMan® gene expression assays, and 1 ng of cDNA. Reactions included 40 cycles of a two-step PCR, 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min, after initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min. All Q-PCR assays were performed in duplicate and repeated for at least three independent experiments. To provide negative controls and exclude contamination by genomic DNA, the reverse transcription was omitted in the cDNA synthesis step, and the samples were subjected to the PCR in the same manner with each TaqMan® gene expression assay. The Q-PCR data were analyzed using the MxProTM Q-PCR analysis software version 3.0 (Stratagene). Quantification was performed with the Comparative Quantitation Analysis program of the mentioned software and using the 18 S gene expression as internal loading control. All of the data were analyzed with the program GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Experimental data were analyzed by Student's t test. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was accepted as denoting statistical significance. Decreased mRNA and protein levels of TrkB receptors have previously been described by our group in several HD models (11Ginés S. Bosch M. Marco S. Gavaldà N. Díaz-Hernández M. Lucas J.J. Canals J.M. Alberch J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Given the importance of cell surface TrkB receptors for activation of BDNF signaling, we first investigated by biotinylation and Western blotting the expression of cell surface TrkB in immortalized wild type STHdhQ7 and mutant STHdhQ111 striatal cells. These cells express endogenous levels of normal and mutant huntingtin with 7 and 111 glutamines, respectively, and provide an accurate genetic HD cell model (15Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous results (11Ginés S. Bosch M. Marco S. Gavaldà N. Díaz-Hernández M. Lucas J.J. Canals J.M. Alberch J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we found a significant reduction (48% ± 15%, p ≤ 0.01) of total TrkB levels in mutant huntingtin striatal cells compared with wild type cells (Fig. 1A). Notably, surface TrkB levels were reduced by 35 ± 10% (p ≤ 0.05) in the biotinylated fraction of mutant huntingtin cells compared with wild type cells, whereas no differences were found on total and cell membrane EGFR levels. We next examined whether reduced TrkB expression was associated with transcriptional deficits. Given that the trkB gene is a target of CREB transcription (18Deogracias R. Espliguero G. Iglesias T. Rodríguez-Peña A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2004; 26: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and an altered CREB/CREB-binding protein pathway has previously been shown in mutant STHdhQ111 striatal cells (9Gines S. Seong I.S. Fossale E. Ivanova E. Trettel F. Gusella J.F. Wheeler V.C. Persichetti F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we have analyzed CRE-TrkB transcriptional activity in wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells by a luciferase reporter gene assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, a significant decrease of CRE-TrkB luciferase activity was detected in mutant compared with wild type striatal cells, suggesting that TrkB transcriptional deregulation may be involved in reduced TrkB expression in mutant huntingtin striatal cells. To further analyze the expression and distribution of cell surface TrkB receptors, immunocytochemistry analysis was performed in permeable (Fig. 2A) and non-permeable (Fig. 2B) wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells. According to the biochemical data, a significant reduction of total TrkB staining was revealed in mutant compared with wild type cells (40% ± 10%; p ≤ 0.001). Notably, when cell surface TrkB expression was examined using an antibody against the extracellular domain of TrkB in non-permeable wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells, a punctate TrkB staining that was significantly lower in mutant compare with wild type cells was revealed (29% ± 7%; p ≤ 0.001). Moreover, whereas a homogenous distribution of TrkB was observed in mutant cells, enriched TrkB membrane patches were detected in wild type cells (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these results indicate that mutant huntingtin leads to a specific reduction and altered distribution of cell surface TrkB receptors in striatal cells. TrkB-mediated signaling involves the activation of the Ras/MAPK/ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, and PLC-γ pathways (12Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 13Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin.

To determine whether BDNF-induced TrkB signaling was also affected by mutant huntingtin expression, we evaluated BDNF-mediated ERK1/2, Akt, and PLC-γ activation in wild type STHdhQ7 and mutant STHdhQ111 huntingtin striatal cells. Cells were treated with BDNF for 0–30 min, and total cell extracts were collected and analyzed by Western blot using specific antibodies. BDNF treatment induced a similar increase of Akt (Ser473) and PLC-γ (Tyr783) phosphorylation in both wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively), which suggests that both Akt and PLC-γ signaling are properly activated even in the presence of lower TrkB receptors in mutant huntingtin cells. In contrast to Akt and PLC-γ, BDNF-mediated activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway was significantly reduced in mutant compared with wild type cells. Thus, whereas in wild type cells BDNF treatment caused a robust and time-dependent activation of MAPK signaling detected as increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, MEK, and c-Raf, in mutant huntingtin striatal cells, BDNF failed to increase phosphorylation of ERK1/2, MEK, and c-Raf (Fig. 3C). We next examined whether impaired BDNF-mediated ERK1/2 activation was specific for TrkB or a general mechanism associated with activation of growth factor receptors. Wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells were treated with EGF, and the levels of p-ERK1/2 were evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D). Importantly, mutant huntingtin striatal cells exhibited similar time-dependent EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation as wild type striatal cells. These findings demonstrate that mutant huntingtin interferes specifically with BDNF TrkB-mediated ERK1/2 signaling in striatal cells. The activation of BDNF-mediated TrkB signaling depends on TrkB phosphorylation (12Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 13Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin.

To test whether reduced TrkB phosphorylation might explain the lack of BDNF-mediated ERK1/2 activation observed in mutant huntingtin striatal cells, we next analyzed the levels of phospho-Tyr490 TrkB, the Tyr residue critical for activation of Ras/MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways. Western blot and quantitative analysis demonstrated similar time-dependent TrkB phosphorylation induced by BDNF in wild type and mutant huntingtin striatal cells (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that mutant huntingtin does not impair BDNF-induced TrkB signaling by altering TrkB phosphorylation and activation. Phosphorylation of TrkB at Tyr490 provides critical binding sites to adapter proteins, such as Shc and IRS, involved on TrkB activation of Ras/MAPKs and PI3K/Akt, respectively (12Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 19Skaper S.D. CNS Neurol. Disord.

However, there is a growing need to develop a highly specific, accurate, and multisite quantitative method. Herein, we report a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-multiple reaction monitoring method to simultaneously quantify multisite modifications with unmatched specificity, sensitivity, and throughput. With one set of purification of histones by high pressure liquid chromatography or SDS-PAGE, nearly 20 modification sites including acetylation, propionylation, methylation, and ubiquitination were quantified within 2 h for two samples to be compared. Using this method, the relative levels of H2B ubiquitination and H3 Lys-79 methylation were quantified in the U937 human leukemia cell line, U937 derivative cell lines overexpressing anti-secretory factor 10 (AF10) and mutant AF10 with the deletion of the hDot1 binding domain OM-LZ. We found that H2B ubiquitination is inversely correlated with H3 Lys-79 methylation.

https://openalex.org/W2007321246,"Background In the environment as well as in the vertebrate intestine, Listeriae have access to complex carbohydrates like maltodextrins. Bacterial exploitation of such compounds requires specific uptake and utilization systems. Methodology/Principal Findings We could show that Listeria monocytogenes and other Listeria species contain genes/gene products with high homology to the maltodextrin ABC transporter and utilization system of B. subtilis. Mutant construction and growth tests revealed that the L. monocytogenes gene cluster was required for the efficient utilization of maltodextrins as well as maltose. The gene for the ATP binding protein of the transporter was located distant from the cluster. Transcription analyses demonstrated that the system was induced by maltose/maltodextrins and repressed by glucose. Its induction was dependent on a LacI type transcriptional regulator. Repression by glucose was independent of the catabolite control protein CcpA, but was relieved in a mutant defective for Hpr kinase/phosphorylase. Conclusions/Significance The data obtained show that in L. monocytogenes the uptake of maltodextrin and, in contrast to B. subtilis, also maltose is exclusively mediated by an ABC transporter. Furthermore, the results suggest that glucose repression of the uptake system possibly is by inducer exclusion, a mechanism not described so far in this organism."
https://openalex.org/W2057563860,"Cartilage is resistant to tumor invasion. In the present study, we found that the NH(2)-propeptide of the cartilage-characteristic collagen, type IIB, PIIBNP, is capable of killing tumor cells. The NH(2)-propeptide is liberated into the extracellular matrix prior to deposition of the collagen fibrils. This peptide adheres to and kills cells from chondrosarcoma and cervical and breast cancer cell lines via the integrins alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3). Adhesion is abrogated by blocking with anti alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) antibodies. When alpha(v) is suppressed by small intefering RNA, adhesion and cell killing are blocked. Normal chondrocytes from developing cartilage do not express alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrins and are thus protected from cell death. Morphological, DNA, and biochemical evidence indicates that the cell death is not by apoptosis but probably by necrosis. In an assay for invasion, PIIBNP reduced the number of cells crossing the membrane. In vivo, in a tumor model for breast cancer, PIIBNP was consistently able to reduce the size of the tumor."

N-Acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST) transfers sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate to position 6 of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate in CS or DS to yield GalNAc(4,6-SO4) residues. We here report generation of transgenic mice that lack GalNAc4S-6ST. GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice were born normally and fertile. In GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice, GalNAc(4,6-SO4) residues in CS and DS disappeared completely, indicating that GalNAc4S-6ST should be a sole enzyme responsible for the synthesis of GalNAc(4,6-SO4) residues in both CS and DS. IdoA-GalNAc(4,6-SO4) units that account for ∼40% of total disaccharide units of DS in the liver of the wild-type mice disappeared in the liver DS of GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice without reduction of IdoA content. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) derived from GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice contained CS without GlcA-GalNAc(4,6-SO4) units. Tryptase and carboxypeptidase A activities of BMMCs derived from GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice were lower than those activities of BMMCs derived from wild-type mice, although mRNA expression of these mast cell proteases was not altered. Disaccharide compositions of heparan sulfate/heparin contained in the mast cells derived from BMMCs in the presence of stem cell factor were much different from those of heparan sulfate/heparin in BMMCs but did not differ significantly between wild-type mice and GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice. These observations suggest that CS containing GalNAc(4,6-SO4) residues in BMMCs may contribute to retain the active proteases in the granules of BMMCs but not for the maturation of BMMCs into connective tissue-type mast cells.

https://openalex.org/W2061414242,"The frequency of squamous cell skin carcinoma in organ transplant patients is around 100-fold higher than normal. This dramatic example of therapy-related cancer reflects exposure to sunlight and to immunosuppressive drugs. Here, we show that the interaction between low doses of UVA, the major ultraviolet component of incident sunlight, and 6-TG, a UVA chromophore that is introduced into DNA by one of the most widely prescribed immunosuppressive drugs, causes DNA single- and double-strand breaks (DSB). S phase cells are particularly vulnerable to this DNA breakage and cells defective in rejoining of S-phase DSB are hypersensitive to the combination of low-dose UVA and DNA 6-TG. 6-TG/UVA-induced DNA lesions provoke canonical DNA damage responses involving activation of the ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 pathways and appropriate cell cycle checkpoints. Higher levels of photochemical DNA damage induce a proteasome-mediated degradation of Chk1 and checkpoint abrogation that is consistent with persistent unrepaired DNA damage. These findings indicate that the interaction between UVA and an immunosuppressant drug causes photochemical DNA lesions, including DNA breaks, and can compromise cell cycle checkpoints. These two properties could contribute to the high risk of sunlight-related skin cancer in long-term immunosuppressed patients."
https://openalex.org/W2115790092,"DNA replication is tightly regulated, but paradoxically there is reported to be an excess of MCM DNA replication proteins over the number of replication origins. Here, we show that MCM levels in primary human T cells are induced during the G0→G1 transition and are not in excess in proliferating cells. The level of induction is critical as we show that a 50% reduction leads to increased centromere separation, premature chromatid separation (PCS) and gross chromosomal abnormalities typical of genomic instability syndromes. We investigated the mechanisms involved and show that a reduction in MCM levels causes dose-dependent DNA damage involving activation of ATR & ATM and Chk1 & Chk2. There is increased DNA mis-repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and both NHEJ and homologous recombination are necessary for Mcm7-depleted cells to progress to metaphase. Therefore, a simple reduction in MCM loading onto DNA, which occurs in cancers as a result of aberrant cell cycle control, is sufficient to cause PCS and gross genomic instability within one cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2041562875,"Synaptic pruning is a physiological event that eliminates excessive or inappropriate synapses to form proper synaptic connections during development of neurons. Appropriate synaptic pruning is required for normal neural development. However, the mechanism of synaptic pruning is not fully understood. Strength of synaptic activity under competitive circumstances is thought to act as a selective force for synaptic pruning. Long-term depression (LTD) is a synaptic plasticity showing persistent decreased synaptic efficacy, which is accompanied by morphological changes of dendritic spines including transient retraction. Repetitive induction of LTD has been shown to cause persistent loss of synapses in mature neurons. Here, we show that multiple, but not single, induction of LTD caused a persistent reduction in the number of dendritic synapses in cultured rat developing hippocampal neurons. When LTD was induced in 14 days in vitro cultures by application of (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, and repeated three times with a one day interval, there was a significant decrease in the number of dendritic synapses. This effect continued up to at least two weeks after the triple LTD induction. The persistent reduction in synapse number occurred in the proximal dendrites, but not the distal dendrites, and was prevented by simultaneous application of the group I/II mGluR antagonist (S)-a-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG). In conclusion, we found that repetitive LTD induction in developing neurons elicits synaptic pruning and contributes to activity-dependent regulation of synapse number in rat hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2162527783,"Abl-mediated transformation requires the activation of multiple pathways involved in the cellular proliferation and survival, including PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT-dependent Pim kinases. Recently, the E17K mutation in the AKT1 has been associated with multiple human malignancies and leukemia in mice. However, this mutation has not been identified in Abl-transformed cells. We investigated the presence of the AKT1(E17K) mutation in v-Abl-transformed cell clones. AKT1(E17K) was detected in 3 (2.6%) of 116 specimens examined. To show the involvement of AKT1(E17K) directly in v-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis, we infected bone marrow cells from mice with bicistronic retroviruses encoding v-Abl and either wild-type or the mutant AKT1. Interestingly, we found that E17K mutant greatly increased the v-Abl transformation efficiency as compared with wild-type AKT1. Ectopic expression of E17K mutant increased the expression levels of antiapoptotic protein BCL2 and phosphorylation levels of proapoptotic protein BAD. This correlated with an increased protection from imatinib-induced apoptosis in Abl transformants. Furthermore, AKT1(E17K) promotes survival of the Pim-deficient cells, indicating a functional link between AKT and Pim in v-Abl transformation. In addition, AKT1(E17K) delays loss of Pim-1 and Pim-2 protein levels on v-Abl inactivation, which suggests that there exists reciprocal signaling between AKT and Pim in v-Abl transformants."

Of interest, cardiac output was significantly decreased in <i>SM22</i>α-<i>CreKI</i><sup>+</sup>/<i>Klf4<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></i> mice, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, a lack of Klf4 in the heart resulted in the reduction in expression of multiple cardiac genes, including <i>Gata4. In vivo</i> chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on the heart revealed that Klf4 bound to the promoter region of the <i>Gata4</i> gene. Results provide novel evidence that Klf4 plays a key role in late fetal and/or postnatal cardiac development."

Genetic studies have further associated 3BP2 mutations to the human disease cherubism and to inflammation and bone dysfunction in mouse. However, how wild type 3BP2 functions in macrophage differentiation remains poorly understood. In this study, using small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of 3BP2 in the RAW264.7 monocytic cell line, we show that 3BP2 was required for receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL)-induced differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into multinucleated mature osteoclasts but not for granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor/interleukin-4-induced differentiation into dendritic cells. 3BP2 silencing was associated with impaired activation of multiple signaling events downstream of RANK, including actin reorganization; Src, ERK, and JNK phosphorylation; and up-regulation of osteoclastogenic factors. In addition, 3BP2 knockdown cells induced to osteoclast by RANKL displayed a reduced increase of Src and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1) mRNA and protein expression. Importantly, 3BP2 interacted with Src, Syk, Vav, and Cbl in monocytic cells, and the introduction of constitutively active mutants of Src and NFATc1 in 3BP2-deficient cells restored osteoclast differentiation. Finally, the expression of a 3BP2 cherubism mutant was found to promote increased Src activity and NFAT-dependent osteoclast formation. Together, this study demonstrates that wild type 3BP2 is a key regulator of RANK-mediated macrophage differentiation into osteoclast through Src and NFATc1 activation.

IntroductionOsteoclasts are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells, differentiating from CD11b+ hematopoietic cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. The interaction between bone marrow stroma, osteoblasts, hematopoietic cells, and the immune system is determinant for bone homeostasis and osteoclastogenesis (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L.

Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). In response to osteotropic factors, osteoblasts express RANKL, which binds RANK on osteoclast progenitor cell surfaces, leading to osteoclast maturation. Consistently, mice lacking RANKL or RANK exhibit an osteopetrotic phenotype, associated with defects in bone resorption and a lack of osteoclasts (3Kong Y.Y. Yoshida H. Sarosi I. Tan H.L. Timms E.

Stimulation of mononuclear osteoclast precursors by RANKL and M-CSF regulates growth, differentiation, fusion, and survival, leading to functional multinucleated osteoclasts (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S.

Mature osteoclasts express typical markers, including tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP) and calcitonin receptor, and adhere to the bone surface through a ring of polymerized actin, adhesion receptors (αvβ3), and cytoskeleton molecules, forming a sealed resorbing compartment in which acidification and secretion of proteolytic enzymes allow the resorption of the bone matrix (1Boyle W.J.

These signal transduction pathways ultimately converge to the activation of several transcription factors such as NFκB, c-Fos, PU.1, and microphathalmia-associated transcription factor (4Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Another crucial transcriptional event during osteoclastogenesis is the up-regulation of NFATc1 downstream RANK and intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling (14Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev.

Takayanagi H. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). NFATc1 is a member of the NFAT family of transcription factors, the transcriptional activities of which are regulated by the Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (16Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Inhibiting calcineurin activity by cyclosporine A and FK506 suppressed osteoclast differentiation in vitro (17Takayanagi H. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1116: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Conversely, the expression of constitutively activated NFATc1 promotes osteoclast differentiation in the absence of RANKL (14Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A.

Therefore, NFATc1 appears to be necessary and sufficient for osteoclastogenesis.Adapter proteins are key components of leukocyte immunoreceptor signal transduction pathways coupled to protein-tyrosine kinases (19Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 20Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Molecular scaffolds composed of adapter proteins and enzymes are assembled and activated at the plasma membrane by Src and/or Syk protein-tyrosine kinases. These scaffolds transduce signals to the cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and nucleus to activate lipid and calcium signaling, gene expression, and metabolic changes involved in leukocyte proliferation, differentiation, and motility. We and others have identified a regulatory role for 3BP2 (c-Abl SH3 domain-binding protein-2, also known as SH3BP2) in immunoreceptor signaling, including T (21Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S.

Importantly, 3BP2 associates several signaling proteins such as Src/Syk kinases, Vav proteins, and PLCγ, involved in NFAT activation (reviewed in Refs. 29Deckert M. Rottapel R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 584: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 30Hatani T. Sada K. Curr. Med. Chem. 2008; 15: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistently, 3BP2 was found to positively regulate the activity of NFAT in T and B cells (21Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A.

In addition, studies in mouse deficient for 3BP2 expression have shown that 3BP2 regulates B cell development and BCR-mediated B cell activation and calcium mobilization (24de la Fuente M.A. Kumar L.

Cell. 2007; 128: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) indicates that 3BP2 also plays a crucial role during inflammation and bone remodeling. Cherubism is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the erosion of maxillar and mandibular bone with the resultant dental and facial deformity caused by excessive osteoclast activity and giant cell granuloma formation (33Southgate J. Sarma U. Townend J.V. Barron J. Flanagan A.M. J. Clin. Pathol. 1998; 51: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The signaling alterations of a mutant form of 3BP2 as observed in a mouse model of cherubism include increased tumor necrosis factor α production by hyperactive macrophages associated with systemic inflammation, aberrant osteoclast activities, and osteoporosis (32Ueki Y. Lin C.Y. Senoo M. Ebihara T. Agata N. Onji M. Saheki Y. Kawai T. Mukherjee P.M. Reichenberger E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 2007; 128: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genetic inactivation of NFATc1 in mice with cherubism prevented bone loss (34Aliprantis A.O. Ueki Y. Sulyanto R. Park A. Sigrist K.S. Sharma S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Olsen B.R. Glimcher L.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3775-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), suggesting that NFAT activation by 3BP2 is a critical step during osteoclastogenesis. However, exactly how wild type 3BP2 functions in RANK-mediated osteoclast differentiation has not yet been elucidated.In this study, we have investigated the role of 3BP2 during osteoclast differentiation and RANK signaling. Using RNA interference blocking experiments in the RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cell line, we show that the absence of 3BP2 in pre-osteoclasts is associated with a severe reduction of osteoclast formation and increased expression of osteoclastogenic factors. The absence of 3BP2 resulted in decreased RANK-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling, Src phosphorylation, and activation of multiple signaling pathways involved in RANK signaling, as well as a deregulated expression of NFATc1. 3BP2 interacted with signaling proteins, including Src, Syk, Vav1, and Cbl in resting cells, and the introduction of constitutively active mutants of Src and NFATc1 in 3BP2-deficient cells restored osteoclast differentiation. In addition, the expression of a 3BP2 cherubism mutant was found to promote increased Src activity and NFAT-dependent osteoclast formation. Altogether, this study demonstrates that wild type 3BP2 is a key regulator of RANK-mediated osteoclastogenesis through Src and NFATc1 activation.DISCUSSIONGenetic evidence linking mutant 3BP2 proteins to the bone disease cherubism (31Ueki Y.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which wild type endogenous 3BP2 regulates osteoclastogenesis. Using RNA interference blocking experiments in the RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cell line, we show here that the absence of 3BP2 in pre-osteoclasts dramatically impaired their ability to form TRAP+ multinucleated cells following RANKL stimulation. The defects in osteoclastogenesis observed in the absence of 3BP2 resulted from a decreased RANK-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling and activation of multiple signaling pathways, including Src phosphorylation and impaired NFATc1 expression. Genetic complementation of 3BP2-deficient cells with constitutively active mutants of Src and NFATc1 restored osteoclast differentiation. In addition, the expression of a 3BP2 cherubism mutant was found to promote increased Src activity and NFAT-dependent osteoclast formation. Our study demonstrates that wild type 3BP2 is required for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through its regulation of signaling pathways involving Src and NFATc1 activation.In leukocytes, including T and B lymphocytes, NK cells, and mast cells, 3BP2 interacts with intracellular proteins such as Src and Syk protein-tyrosine kinases, Vav proteins, and PLCγ that have been involved in calcium signaling and NFAT activation downstream ITAM-containing immunoreceptors and adaptors (29Deckert M. Rottapel R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 584: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Hatani T. Sada K. Curr. Med. Chem. 2008; 15: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, our data indicate that osteoclasts constitute another type of leukocytes in which NFAT activation by wild type 3BP2 plays an important role. Consistent with overexpression experiments (42Lietman S.A. Yin L. Levine M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and studies in mice genetically engineered to express a gain-of-function mutant of 3BP2 (34Aliprantis A.O. Ueki Y. Sulyanto R. Park A. Sigrist K.S. Sharma S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Olsen B.R. Glimcher L.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3775-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), our findings also support the importance of NFATc1 in 3BP2-dependent osteoclast signaling. Interestingly, the absence of 3BP2 expression did not affect the acquisition by monocytic cells of a dendritic-like phenotype, as evidenced by the increased expression of dendritic cell markers such as CD11c, CD80, and CD86, observed following stimulation of 3BP2-deficient cells with GM-CSF and IL-4 or upon further maturation induced by LPS. Early signaling induced by the combination of GM-CSF and IL-4 was also not affected by 3BP2 silencing in RAW264.7 cells. Because myeloid DCs can differentiate upon multiple cytokine signaling pathways (43Shortman K. Naik S.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), a role for 3BP2 in the generation of distinct subsets of DCs cannot be excluded. Recently, a gain-of-function mutant of 3BP2 was involved in increased activity of inflammatory macrophages in a mouse model of cherubism (34Aliprantis A.O. Ueki Y. Sulyanto R. Park A. Sigrist K.S. Sharma S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Olsen B.R. Glimcher L.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3775-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be interesting to determine whether wild type 3BP2 also participates in the differentiation process of inflammatory DCs and/or macrophages. Nevertheless, our data directly implicate wild type 3BP2 in RANK signaling in the differentiation process of monocytic cells toward osteoclasts. Of note, we recently found that bone marrow macrophages from 3BP2-deficient mice failed to differentiate into osteoclasts following RANKL/M-CSF stimulation. 5R. Rottapel and M. Deckert, unpublished observations.The process of osteoclast differentiation from monocytic precursors involves the activation downstream RANK of a large number of signaling molecules and transcription factors (4Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). It is well established that one crucial event during osteoclastogenesis is the up-regulation of NFATc1, a member of the NFAT family of transcription factors, the transcriptional activities of which are regulated by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (17Takayanagi H. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1116: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). During the early phase of osteoclast precursor differentiation, the initial induction of NFATc1 protein following RANK/RANKL interaction is mediated by a TRAF6-dependent pathway and leads to the autoamplification of NFATc1, which then regulates the expression of osteoclastogenic genes involved in cell maturation and bone resorption (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar, 4Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 17Takayanagi H. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1116: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Differentiation experiments using the RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cell line show that the absence of 3BP2 in pre-osteoclasts dramatically impaired early and late signaling events typically associated with RANKL stimulation, including actin cytoskeleton remodeling; activation of Src, ERK1/2, JNK, and Akt; and increased expression and activity of c-Fos and NFATc1. As a consequence, the expression of NFATc1 target genes such as TRAP, calcitonin receptor, cathepsin K, and αVβ3 integrin was severely reduced in the 3BP2-deficient cells following RANK engagement. Interestingly, the expression of the transcription factor PU.1 (data not shown) and of NFATc2 and NFATc3, two other NFAT family members, was not significantly affected by silencing of 3BP2. This suggests that 3BP2 specifically couples RANK signaling to NFATc1 activation, a notion also supported by the rescue experiments with active NFATc1 in 3BP2 knockdown cells. Genetic studies by Aliprantis et al. (34Aliprantis A.O. Ueki Y. Sulyanto R. Park A. Sigrist K.S. Sharma S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Olsen B.R. Glimcher L.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3775-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) have established that NFATc1 is downstream of 3BP2 cherubism mutant proteins. Together with our observations, this suggests that wild type and mutant 3BP2 proteins function through overlapping signaling pathways. In 3BP2 knockdown macrophages, RANKL stimulation failed to induce c-Fos mRNA expression and AP-1 activity, suggesting that 3BP2 participates in the initial TRAF6-dependent induction of NFATc1 messenger expression rather than in the NFATc1-dependent amplification of NFATc1 induction. TRAF6 and Src physically interact during osteoclast activation (5Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), and Src phosphorylation was impaired downstream of RANK in the absence of 3BP2. Conversely, the expression of a gain-of-function cherubism mutant of 3BP2 (3BP2 R415P) in RAW264.7 cells led to enhanced osteoclast formation and increased Src phosphorylation, underlining the importance of Src for 3BP2 signaling in osteoclasts. Importantly, we found that c-Src physically interacted with 3BP2 in monocytic cells. Therefore, it should be interesting to examine whether 3BP2 interacts with TRAF6, directly or indirectly through Src or additional proteins.Constitutively active Src only partially rescued the impaired osteoclast differentiation observed in 3BP2 knockdown cells. Although osteoclasts rescued by overexpression of active Src differentiated into large multinucleated cells expressing high levels of TRAP, their morphology and size suggested that they are not fully mature. Thus, another question is how does 3BP2 couple RANK to the activation of NFATc1 besides Src? Interestingly, various binding partners of 3BP2, identified in other leukocytes (29Deckert M. Rottapel R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 584: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Hatani T. Sada K. Curr. Med.

Med. 2005; 11: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, the costimulatory signals provided by the ITAM-containing adaptor proteins DAP12 and FcRγ have been shown to play critical roles during osteoclast differentiation through Syk (6Koga T. Inui M. Inoue K. Kim S. Suematsu A. Kobayashi E. Iwata T. Ohnishi H. Matozaki T. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Takayanagi H. Takai T. Nature. 2004; 428: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 7Mócsai A. Humphrey M.B. Van Ziffle J.A. Hu Y. Burghardt A. Spusta S.C. Majumdar S. Lanier L.L. Lowell C.A. Nakamura M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6158-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts from DAP12 × FcRγ-null mice exhibit defective NFATc1 expression as a consequence of impaired PLCγ-dependent calcium signaling (6Koga T. Inui M. Inoue K. Kim S. Suematsu A. Kobayashi E. Iwata T. Ohnishi H. Matozaki T. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Takayanagi H. Takai T. Nature. 2004; 428: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Of note, B cells from 3BP2−/− mice show impaired PLCγ phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, and NFAT activation (24de la Fuente M.A. Kumar L. Lu B. Geha R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our observations that in myeloid cells 3BP2 forms a signaling complex with c-Src, Syk, Vav, and Cbl provide a mechanistic explanation of how 3BP2 might participate in RANK-mediated osteoclast formation. Also, overexpression of active Src in control and 3BP2 knockdown cells induced the phosphorylation of Syk and ERK1/2, two events critically involved in several aspects of osteoclast function (2Walsh M.C. Kim N. Kadono Y. Rho J. Lee S.Y. Lorenzo J. Choi Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 33-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, by regulating Src activity, 3BP2 might impact on other osteoclast signaling pathways. Interestingly, Src-induced phosphorylation of Cbl downstream αvβ3 integrin promotes the recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in a signaling complex composed of Pyk2-Src-Cbl essential for osteoclast bone resorbing activity (51Miyazaki T. Sanjay A. Neff L. Tanaka S. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17660-17666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The interaction of 3BP2 with Cbl in RAW264.7 cells therefore suggests that phosphorylation of Cbl by c-Src represents another possible event of 3BP2 signaling in osteoclast. Src−/− mice are osteopetrotic because of defective formation of ruffled borders and subsequent bone resorption but not because of impaired osteoclast differentiation (47Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms by other Src family members in mice. Whereas a negative regulatory function of Lyn in osteoclastogenesis was reported (48Kim H.J. Zhang K. Zhang L. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Faccio R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2325-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the expression of Fyn, another Src family member, increased during osteoclast differentiation (12Shinohara M. Koga T. Okamoto K. Sakaguchi S. Arai K. Yasuda H. Takai T. Kodama T. Morio T. Geha R.S. Kitamura D. Kurosaki T. Ellmeier W. Takayanagi H. Cell. 2008; 132: 794-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Our observations that 3BP2 is a partner and substrate of Fyn (21Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Foucault I. Le Bras S. Charvet C. Moon C. Altman A. Deckert M. Blood. 2005; 105: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) therefore suggest that Fyn may participate in 3BP2 signaling in addition of Src.In the absence of 3BP2, osteoclast precursors failed to reorganize their actin cytoskeleton, a process that has been found to be actively regulated by Src and Syk kinases, as well as Rho GTPases and guanine nucleotide exchange factor proteins, such as Vav family members (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar, 8Faccio R. Teitelbaum S.L. Fujikawa K. Chappel J. Zallone A. Tybulewicz V.L. Ross F.P. Swat W. Nat.

The observed interactions of 3BP2 with Src, Syk, and Vav in myeloid cells again provide some mechanistic insights on how 3BP2 might participate in cytoskeleton reorganization in forming osteoclasts. In genetically engineered mice, a gain-of-function mutant of 3BP2 promoted increased phosphorylation of Syk (32Ueki Y. Lin C.Y. Senoo M. Ebihara T. Agata N. Onji M. Saheki Y. Kawai T. Mukherjee P.M. Reichenberger E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 2007; 128: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that a 3BP2 cherubism mutant expressed in macrophages strongly increased Src phosphorylation, compared with wild type 3BP2. It is therefore likely that 3BP2 regulates the localization and/or the activity of some of these proteins through its different protein-binding domains. Further experiments using co-cultured primary bone marrow macrophages and osteoblasts, which bring adhesion receptor ligands, should clarify the mechanism by which endogenous 3BP2 regulates osteoclast actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Interestingly, Src and Syk kinases signaling pathways are involved downstream multiple receptors necessary to osteoclast differentiation, ruffled border formation, and bone resorption, including RANK, costimulatory immunoreceptors coupled to ITAM-containing adapter proteins DAP12/FcRγ, αvβ3 integrin, and c-Fms (11Zou W. Kitaura H. Reeve J. Long F. Tybulewicz V.L. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 13Zou W. Reeve J.L.

Mitnick M. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2476-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, 3BP2 may integrate osteoclastogenic signals through its interactions with Src, Syk, Vav, and Cbl proteins.In conclusion, our study provides evidence that wild type 3BP2 is a crucial regulator of RANK-mediated macrophage differentiation into osteoclasts. Further studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which wild type and pathological 3BP2 proteins regulate leukocyte activation and differentiation should provide a better understanding of inflammatory and bone diseases. IntroductionOsteoclasts are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells, differentiating from CD11b+ hematopoietic cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. The interaction between bone marrow stroma, osteoblasts, hematopoietic cells, and the immune system is determinant for bone homeostasis and osteoclastogenesis (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar, 2Walsh M.C. Kim N. Kadono Y. Rho J. Lee S.Y. Lorenzo J. Choi Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 33-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Osteoclast differentiation is essentially triggered by two hematopoietic factors, the member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of cytokine receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) 4The abbreviations used are: RANKLreceptor activator of NFκB ligandGM-CSFgranulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factorNFκBnuclear factor κBNFATnuclear factor of activated T cellsTRAPtartrate-resistant alkaline phosphatasePLCphospholipase CIKKIκB kinaseITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifshshort hairpinILinterleukinMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinaseHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinLPSlipopolysaccharidePBSphosphate-buffered salineDCdendritic cellIRESinternal ribosomal entry site. and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). In response to osteotropic factors, osteoblasts express RANKL, which binds RANK on osteoclast progenitor cell surfaces, leading to osteoclast maturation. Consistently, mice lacking RANKL or RANK exhibit an osteopetrotic phenotype, associated with defects in bone resorption and a lack of osteoclasts (3Kong Y.Y. Yoshida H. Sarosi I. Tan H.L. Timms E. Capparelli C. Morony S. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Van G. Itie A. Khoo W. Wakeham A. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Mak T.W. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1999; 397: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). Stimulation of mononuclear osteoclast precursors by RANKL and M-CSF regulates growth, differentiation, fusion, and survival, leading to functional multinucleated osteoclasts (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). Mature osteoclasts express typical markers, including tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP) and calcitonin receptor, and adhere to the bone surface through a ring of polymerized actin, adhesion receptors (αvβ3), and cytoskeleton molecules, forming a sealed resorbing compartment in which acidification and secretion of proteolytic enzymes allow the resorption of the bone matrix (1Boyle W.J.

These signal transduction pathways ultimately converge to the activation of several transcription factors such as NFκB, c-Fos, PU.1, and microphathalmia-associated transcription factor (4Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Another crucial transcriptional event during osteoclastogenesis is the up-regulation of NFATc1 downstream RANK and intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling (14Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev.

Takayanagi H. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). NFATc1 is a member of the NFAT family of transcription factors, the transcriptional activities of which are regulated by the Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (16Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Inhibiting calcineurin activity by cyclosporine A and FK506 suppressed osteoclast differentiation in vitro (17Takayanagi H. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1116: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Conversely, the expression of constitutively activated NFATc1 promotes osteoclast differentiation in the absence of RANKL (14Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A.

Therefore, NFATc1 appears to be necessary and sufficient for osteoclastogenesis.Adapter proteins are key components of leukocyte immunoreceptor signal transduction pathways coupled to protein-tyrosine kinases (19Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 20Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Molecular scaffolds composed of adapter proteins and enzymes are assembled and activated at the plasma membrane by Src and/or Syk protein-tyrosine kinases. These scaffolds transduce signals to the cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and nucleus to activate lipid and calcium signaling, gene expression, and metabolic changes involved in leukocyte proliferation, differentiation, and motility. We and others have identified a regulatory role for 3BP2 (c-Abl SH3 domain-binding protein-2, also known as SH3BP2) in immunoreceptor signaling, including T (21Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S.

Importantly, 3BP2 associates several signaling proteins such as Src/Syk kinases, Vav proteins, and PLCγ, involved in NFAT activation (reviewed in Refs. 29Deckert M. Rottapel R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 584: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 30Hatani T. Sada K. Curr. Med. Chem. 2008; 15: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistently, 3BP2 was found to positively regulate the activity of NFAT in T and B cells (21Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A.

Blood. 2005; 105: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in mouse deficient for 3BP2 expression have shown that 3BP2 regulates B cell development and BCR-mediated B cell activation and calcium mobilization (24de la Fuente M.A. Kumar L. Lu B. Geha R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Chen G. Dimitriou I.D. La Rose J. Ilangumaran S. Yeh W.C. Doody G. Turner M. Gommerman J. Rottapel R.

Cherubism is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the erosion of maxillar and mandibular bone with the resultant dental and facial deformity caused by excessive osteoclast activity and giant cell granuloma formation (33Southgate J. Sarma U. Townend J.V. Barron J. Flanagan A.M. J. Clin. Pathol. 1998; 51: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The signaling alterations of a mutant form of 3BP2 as observed in a mouse model of cherubism include increased tumor necrosis factor α production by hyperactive macrophages associated with systemic inflammation, aberrant osteoclast activities, and osteoporosis (32Ueki Y. Lin C.Y. Senoo M. Ebihara T. Agata N. Onji M. Saheki Y. Kawai T. Mukherjee P.M. Reichenberger E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 2007; 128: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genetic inactivation of NFATc1 in mice with cherubism prevented bone loss (34Aliprantis A.O. Ueki Y. Sulyanto R. Park A. Sigrist K.S. Sharma S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Olsen B.R. Glimcher L.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3775-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), suggesting that NFAT activation by 3BP2 is a critical step during osteoclastogenesis. However, exactly how wild type 3BP2 functions in RANK-mediated osteoclast differentiation has not yet been elucidated.In this study, we have investigated the role of 3BP2 during osteoclast differentiation and RANK signaling. Using RNA interference blocking experiments in the RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cell line, we show that the absence of 3BP2 in pre-osteoclasts is associated with a severe reduction of osteoclast formation and increased expression of osteoclastogenic factors. The absence of 3BP2 resulted in decreased RANK-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling, Src phosphorylation, and activation of multiple signaling pathways involved in RANK signaling, as well as a deregulated expression of NFATc1. 3BP2 interacted with signaling proteins, including Src, Syk, Vav1, and Cbl in resting cells, and the introduction of constitutively active mutants of Src and NFATc1 in 3BP2-deficient cells restored osteoclast differentiation. In addition, the expression of a 3BP2 cherubism mutant was found to promote increased Src activity and NFAT-dependent osteoclast formation. Altogether, this study demonstrates that wild type 3BP2 is a key regulator of RANK-mediated osteoclastogenesis through Src and NFATc1 activation."

In eukaryotes the cysteine desulfurase Nfs (IscS) donates the sulfur during Fe/S cluster assembly and was thought sufficient for this reaction. Moreover, Nfs is indispensable for tRNA thiolation, a modification generally required for tRNA function and protein synthesis. Recently, Isd11 was discovered as an integral part of the Nfs activity at an early step of Fe/S cluster assembly. Here we show, using a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches, that Isd11, in line with its strong association with Nfs, is localized in the mitochondrion of T. brucei. In addition to its involvement in Fe/S assembly, Isd11 also partakes in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA thiolation, whereas Mtu1, another protein proposed to collaborate with Nfs in tRNA thiolation, is required for this process solely within the mitochondrion. Taken together these data place Isd11 at the center of these sulfur transactions and raises the possibility of a connection between Fe/S metabolism and protein synthesis, helping integrate two seemingly unrelated pathways.

Here we show, using a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches, that Isd11, in line with its strong association with Nfs, is localized in the mitochondrion of T. brucei. In addition to its involvement in Fe/S assembly, Isd11 also partakes in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA thiolation, whereas Mtu1, another protein proposed to collaborate with Nfs in tRNA thiolation, is required for this process solely within the mitochondrion. Taken together these data place Isd11 at the center of these sulfur transactions and raises the possibility of a connection between Fe/S metabolism and protein synthesis, helping integrate two seemingly unrelated pathways."

By using molecular library screening, we identified a compound named NF449 with inhibitory activity toward FGFR3 signaling. In cultured chondrocytes and murine limb organ culture, NF449 rescued FGFR3-mediated extracellular matrix loss and growth inhibition, which represent two major cellular phenotypes of aberrant FGFR3 signaling in cartilage. Similarly, NF449 antagonized FGFR3 action in the multiple myeloma cell lines OPM2 and KMS11, as evidenced by NF449-mediated reversal of ERK MAPK activation and transcript accumulation of CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines, both of which are induced by FGFR3 activation. In cell-free kinase assays, NF449 inhibited the kinase activity of both wild type and a disease-associated FGFR3 mutant (K650E) in a fashion that appeared non-competitive with ATP. Our data identify NF449 as a novel antagonist of FGFR3 signaling, useful for FGFR3 inhibition alone or in combination with inhibitors that target the ATP binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2048467008,"R-spondin-1 (Rspo1) is an intestinal growth factor known to exert its effects through activation of the canonical Wnt (cWnt) signaling pathway and subsequent expression of cWnt target genes. We have detected Rspo1 mRNA in murine islets and the murine MIN6 and βTC β-cell lines, and Rspo1 protein in MIN6 β-cells. Rspo1 activated cWnt signaling in MIN6 β-cells by increasing nuclear β-catenin and c-myc, a cWnt target gene. Rspo1 also induced insulin mRNA expression in MIN6 cells. Analysis of MIN6 and mouse β-cell proliferation by [3H]thymidine and BrdU incorporation, respectively, revealed that Rspo1 stimulated cell growth. Incubation of MIN6 and mouse β-cells with cytokines (IL1β/TNFα/interferon-γ) significantly increased cellular apoptosis; this increase was abolished by pretreatment with Rspo1. Rspo1 also stimulated insulin secretion in a glucose-independent fashion. We further demonstrated that the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, exendin4 (EX4), stimulated Rspo1 mRNA transcript levels in MIN6 cells in a glucose-, time-, dose-, and PI3-kinase-dependent fashion. This effect was not limited to this β-cell line, as similar time-dependent increases in Rspo1 were also observed in the βTC β-cell line and mouse islets in response to EX4 treatment. Together, these studies demonstrate that Rspo1 is a novel β-cell growth factor and insulin secretagogue that is regulated by EX4. These findings suggest that Rspo1 and the cWnt signaling pathway may serve as a novel target to enhance β-cell growth and function in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 4The abbreviations used are: T2DMtype 2 diabetes mellitusPIphosphatidylinositolFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelingRspoR-spondinFrzFrizzledcWntcanonical WntLRPlow density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinqRT-PCRquantitative reverse transcription-PCRAPCadenomatosis polyposis coli. represents a serious and growing epidemic that poses a major public health threat in the 21st century. The development of T2DM usually requires the presence of both insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function, but also involves the loss of β-cells (1Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar). Moreover, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by the autoimmune-mediated destruction of β-cells. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches that enhance β-cell mass expansion, as well as β-cell function, represent an exciting arsenal against diabetes. type 2 diabetes mellitus phosphatidylinositol fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling R-spondin Frizzled canonical Wnt low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein quantitative reverse transcription-PCR adenomatosis polyposis coli. Wnt signaling has been demonstrate to play important roles in development as well as in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including diabetes (2Welters H.J. Kulkarni R.N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 19: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway requires interaction between a secreted glycoprotein, Wnt, and a seven transmembrane receptor protein, Frizzled (Frz). There are at least three distinct intracellular Wnt pathways, including, most notably, the canonical Wnt (cWnt) cascade that leads to changes in intracellular β-catenin levels and is thought to be involved in cell fate specification and proliferation. β-catenin is normally phosphorylated and targeted for proteolysis by a complex of proteins, including adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), axin and the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK3β) (Fig. 1A). cWnt activation of the Frz and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) co-receptors results in dissociation of this degradation complex, permitting entry of β-catenin into the nucleus to activate cWnt target genes in conjunction with TCF/LEF family transcription factors and, possibly, other DNA-binding partners (3Nusse R. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). cWnt target genes have been identified in different models and these include, but are not limited to, the cell-cycling genes, c-myc, and cyclin D1. Interestingly, mice that lack the gene encoding LRP5 show impaired glucose tolerance because of perturbed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (4Fujino T. Asaba H. Kang M.J. Ikeda Y. Sone H. Takada S. Kim D.H. Ioka R.X. Ono M. Tomoyori H. Okubo M. Murase T. Kamataki A. Yamamoto J. Magoori K. Takahashi S. Miyamoto Y. Oishi H. Nose M. Okazaki M. Usui S. Imaizumi K. Yanagisawa M. Sakai J. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adipocyte-secreted Wnts have been shown to stimulate insulin secretion and glucokinase gene transcription in INS1 cells in vitro through the activation of cWnt signaling (5Schinner S. Ulgen F. Papewalis C. Schott M. Woelk A. Vidal-Puig A. Scherbaum W.A. Diabetologia. 2008; 51: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic mice that overexpress a dominant-negative form of mouse Frz8 under the Ipf-1/Pdx-1 promoter are normoglycemic and display normal GSIS (6Papadopoulou S. Edlund H. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2844-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the β-cells of these mice produce four times more and secrete twice as much insulin as those of wild-type littermates, suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms to achieve and maintain normoglycemia (6Papadopoulou S. Edlund H. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2844-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Finally, Rulifson et al. (7Rulifson I.C. Karnik S.K. Heiser P.W. ten Berge D. Chen H. Gu X. Taketo M.M. Nusse R. Hebrok M. Kim S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6247-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) demonstrated that conditional pancreatic β-cell specific expression of degradation-resistant β-catenin leads to β-cell expansion, increased insulin production and serum levels, and enhanced glucose handling. This observation is further strengthened by a recent study from Liu and Habener showing that exendin4 (EX4), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, stimulates β-cell proliferation via activation of the cWnt signaling pathway (8Liu Z. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8723-8735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The roof plate-specific spondin (R-spondin, Rspo) protein family consists of four structurally related members (Rspo1–4), with conserved cysteine-rich furin-like and thrombospondin domains. Several lines of evidence indicate that Rspo family members function as Frz and/or LRP receptor ligands in vitro: 1) Rspo is a secreted protein (9Kim K.A. Kakitani M. Zhao J. Oshima T. Tang T. Binnerts M. Liu Y. Boyle B. Park E. Emtage P. Funk W.D. Tomizuka K. Science. 2005; 309: 1256-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar); 2) unlike Wnt ligands that form a ternary complex with Frz and LRP receptors, Rspo proteins failed to form a ternary complex but can nonetheless bind to both receptors (10Nam J.S. Turcotte T.J. Smith P.F. Choi S. Yoon J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13247-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); 3) there is a positive modulation of Wnt ligand activity by Rspo via direct interaction between the two ligands (11Wei Q. Yokota C. Semenov M.V. Doble B. Woodgett J. He X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15903-15911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); and 4) Rspo prevents LRP6 internalization (12Kim K.A. Wagle M. Tran K. Zhan X. Dixon M.A. Liu S. Gros D. Korver W. Yonkovich S. Tomasevic N. Binnerts M. Abo A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing human Rspo1 exhibit a profound increase in proliferation of intestinal crypt epithelial cells, which correlates with the activation of β-catenin (9Kim K.A. Kakitani M. Zhao J. Oshima T. Tang T. Binnerts M. Liu Y. Boyle B. Park E. Emtage P. Funk W.D. Tomizuka K. Science. 2005; 309: 1256-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Adenoviral-mediated transfection of each isoform of Rspo into mice also induces gastrointestinal proliferation in association with β-catenin activation (13Kim K.A. Zhao J. Andarmani S. Kakitani M. Oshima T. Binnerts M.E. Abo A. Tomizuka K. Funk W.D. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, although expressed at high levels in the gut, Rspo1 has also been detected in human pancreatic islets by immunohistochemisty (9Kim K.A. Kakitani M. Zhao J. Oshima T. Tang T. Binnerts M. Liu Y. Boyle B. Park E. Emtage P. Funk W.D. Tomizuka K. Science. 2005; 309: 1256-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, no studies to-date have examined the role of Rspo1 in β-cell physiology. Therefore, in the present study, we have determined the role of Rspo1 in the mature pancreatic β-cell, through analysis of the effects of Rspo1 on β-cell proliferation, apoptosis and insulin secretion, as well as through analysis of the effects of known β-cell regulatory factors (i.e. glucose and GLP-1) on Rspo1 expression. MIN6 β-cells (mouse insulinoma cell line, a kind gift from Drs. J. Miyazaki, University of Tokyo and D. F. Steiner, University of Chicago) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 71 μm 2-mercaptoethanol in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. The βTC β-cell line was maintained in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Islets were isolated from 20–30 g of CD1 mice (Charles River, St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) by collagenase digestion, as previously described (14Li L. El-Kholy W. Rhodes C.J. Brubaker P.L. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) for 2 days after isolation. Mouse islet cells were dispersed by incubation with Dispase II (Roche Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) as previously described (15Gyulkhandanyan A.V. Lee S.C. Bikopoulos G. Dai F.

Cells were then cultured overnight. Animal tissues or cells grown to ∼80–90% confluence were lysed for preparation of RNA using either the RNeasy or RNeasy Micro Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry (absorbance at 260 nm) and stored at −80 °C until use. Equal amounts of RNA isolated from animal tissues, cells, or islets were analyzed by RT-PCR using a One-Step kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR primers and conditions have been reported previously (16Mohamed O.A.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in a Chromo4 Continuous Fluorescence Detection unit with Opticon Monitor 3 software (Bio-Rad) using Taqman Gene Expression Assays for specific primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All reactions were performed in duplicate, and control reactions were performed without RT enzyme and/or without template. The linearity of amplification of the Taqman primer-probe sets was verified over nine orders of magnitude (data not shown). Ribosomal protein 18 S RNA (no. Hs99999901_sl) was used as the endogenous control for all quantitative analyses of mRNA expression and was not found to change in response to any of the experimental treatments tested (data not shown). Relative quantification of Rspo1 (2 sets of primers used, set 1 no. Mm00507076_m1 and set 2 no. Mm00507077_m1), c-myc (no. Mm00487803_m1), cyclin D1 (no. Mm00432359_m1), and insulin2 (no.

Cells and islets were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 70 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Laboratories)). Proteins of interest were detected with primary antibodies targeted against mouse Rspo1 (goat IgG, 1:1000, R&D Systems), cleaved caspase3 (rabbit IgG, 1:1000, New England Biolabs), or pan-actin (rabbit IgG, 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoblotted membranes were then probed with the appropriate secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit (1:2000, New England Biolabs), and HRP-linked anti-goat (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA)) and visualized by electrochemical luminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfe, Quebec, Canada). Membranes were subsequently treated at 50 °C for 30 min with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for a second round of immunoblotting. To determine protein levels of nuclear β-catenin, MIN6 cells were grown to 80–90% confluency in 10-cm dishes and serum-starved overnight, followed by treatment with either medium alone (control), EX4 (10 nm), LiCl (20 mm), Wnt3a (641 pm), or Rspo1 (34.5 pm to 34.5 nm) for 30 min or 8 h. Lysates were then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 350 μl of Buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Laboratories) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were further lysed by addition of 10% Nonidet P-40 (to a final concentration of 1%, Sigma-Aldrich) and vortexed for 1 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,600 × g at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with 400 μl of Buffer A and the nuclear fraction was further pelleted for 10 min at 1600 × g at 4 °C. Nuclei were solubilized by addition of one pellet volume of NE buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). One-fourth pellet volume of 5 m NaCl and one pellet volume of NE buffer were further added to the resulting pellet. Nuclei were then homogenized by sonication for 5 s and were stored at −80 °C until used (27Everly Jr., D.N. Kusano S. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11648-11655Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 50 μg of nuclear protein, as measured by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), was used for immunoblotting using antibodies against β-catenin (mouse IgG, 1:1000, BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP, mouse IgG, 1:1000, nuclear fraction protein loading control (28Meares G.P.

MIN6 cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 24-well plates, serum-starved overnight, and then treated with medium alone (control), EX4 (10 nm) or various doses of recombinant Rspo1 (34.5 pm to 34.5 nm) overnight in the presence of serum-free medium with 25 mm glucose. Cell proliferation was measured as described (29Wang Q. Li L. Xu E. Wong V. Rhodes C. Brubaker P.L. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 37 kBq/ml [3H]methylthymidine (specific activity: 3000 GBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h. Cells were then washed twice in cold PBS and incubated for 30 min in 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C to precipitate the DNA. The liquid layer was removed by aspiration and 500 μl of 0.1 m sodium hydroxide was added to the cells for an additional 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The solubilized material was then transferred to 4 ml of scintillant, and radioactive counts were determined by liquid scintillation counting. For measurement of murine β-cell proliferation, dispersed islet cells were treated for 48 h with medium alone (control), EX4 (10 nm) or recombinant Rspo1 (34.5 nm) in the presence of serum-free medium with 20 mm glucose and, for the last 24 h, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 μm). Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin and incubated with mouse anti-BrdU (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich) and guinea pig anti-insulin (1:200, Dako Diagnostics, Mississauga, ON, Canada) antibodies. Cells were then gently washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min with appropriate secondary antibodies (Texas-Red-conjugated anti-mouse (1:200) and Cy2-conjugated anti-guinea pig (1:200), Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and then mounted with mounting medium for fluorescence containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (VectaShield, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Proliferative index is expressed as a percentage of BrdU- and insulin-positive cells over total insulin-positive cells analyzed under Zeiss Axioplan microscope with Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss Canada, Don Mills, Ontario, Canada). A minimum of 100 β-cells was counted per treatment. MIN6 cells were grown to 80–90% confluency and apoptosis assay was performed as previously described (14Li L. El-Kholy W. Rhodes C.J. Brubaker P.L. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2121199432,"Protein-arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) plays pivotal roles in various cellular processes. However, its role in megakaryocytic differentiation has yet to be investigated. Human leukemia K562 cells have been used as a model to study hematopoietic differentiation. In this study, we report that ectopic expression of HA-PRMT1 in K562 cells suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation as demonstrated by changes in cytological characteristics, adhesive properties, and CD41 expression, whereas knockdown of PRMT1 by small interference RNA promoted differentiation. Impairment of the methyltransferase activity of PRMT1 diminished the suppressive effect. These results provide evidence for a novel role of PRMT1 in negative regulation of megakaryocytic differentiation. Activation of ERK MAPK has been shown to be essential for megakaryocytic differentiation, although the role of p38 MAPK is still poorly understood. We show that knockdown of p38alpha MAPK or treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 significantly enhanced PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. Further investigation revealed that PRMT1 promotes activation of p38 MAPK without inhibiting activation of ERK MAPK. In p38alpha knockdown cells, PRMT1 could no longer suppress differentiation. In contrast, enforced expression of p38alpha MAPK suppressed PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of parental K562 as well as PRMT1-knockdown cells. We propose modulation of the p38 MAPK pathway by PRMT1 as a novel mechanism regulating megakaryocytic differentiation. This study thus provides a new perspective on the promotion of megakaryopoiesis."

We found using correlative light and electron microscopy that Pcdh-γA3 and -γB2, but not -γC4, -α1, or N-cadherin, generate intracellular juxtanuclear membrane tubules when expressed in cells. These tubules recruit the autophagy marker MAP1A/1B LC3 (LC3) but are not associated with autophagic vesicles. Lipidation of LC3 is required for its coclustering with Pcdh-γ tubules, suggesting the involvement of an autophagic-like molecular cascade. Expression of wild-type LC3 with Pcdh-γA3 increased tubule length whereas expression of lipidation-defective LC3 decreased tubule length relative to Pcdh-γA3 expressed alone. The tubules were found to emanate from lysosomes. Deletion of the luminal/extracellular domain of Pcdh-γA3 preserved lysosomal targeting but eliminated tubule formation whereas cytoplasmic deletion eliminated both lysosomal targeting and tubule formation. Deletion of the membrane-proximal three cadherin repeats resulted in tubes that were narrower than those produced by full-length molecules.

Conditional knock out in retina also increased apoptosis of some retinal cell types but, unlike in spinal cord, did not affect synaptic connectivity (13Lefebvre J.L. Zhang Y. Meister M. Wang X.

We show here that Pcdh-γA3 and -γB2 generate intracellular membrane tubules that recruit the autophagic vesicle protein LC3, the mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8. LC3 is lipidated via a reaction similar to the ubiquitin ligase cascade and targets to nascent autophagosomes where it is thought to stabilize the phagophore (15Xie Z. Nair U. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 16Xie Z. Nair U. Geng J. Szefler M.B. Rothman E.D. Klionsky D.J.

Cell. 2008; 19: 4651-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). How LC3 carries out this function(s) is completely unknown. LC3 is a member of a family of proteins including GABARAP, GEC-1, and GATE-16 (18Tanida I. Ueno T. Kominami E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2503-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), all of which are implicated in protein or vesicle trafficking. We found that LC3 recruitment to Pcdh-γ-induced tubules was dependent on LC3 lipidation. Coexpression of Pcdh-γA3 with lipidation-defective LC3 reduced tubule length whereas expression of wild-type LC3 increased tubule length compared with Pcdh-γA3 expressed alone. The tubules emanated from lysosomes. The luminal/extracellular domain of Pcdh-γA3 was found to be required for tubule formation, and shortening its length resulted in narrower tubules. Thus, Pcdh-γs, in concert with LC3 family members, could participate in the biogenesis of their own trafficking organelles via intraluminal homophilic interactions. The effect of LC3 perturbation on tubule length is consistent with a role for LC3 in promoting or stabilizing membrane expansion. Pcdh-γA3-GFP has been described (8Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M.

Pcdh-γA3-GFP with the three membrane-proximal cadherin repeats deleted was generated by PCR amplification of the distal three cadherin repeats and ligating to the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and extracellular membrane-proximal segment just after the end of the sixth cadherin repeat (corresponding to amino acid 667) using an introduced Sal1 site to fuse the segments. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated on 35-mm live imaging dishes with gridded glass bottoms (Mattek) for analysis by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). Cells were plated on 25-mm coverslips in 6-well plates for light microscopy alone. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of each plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For lysosomal inhibition, after transfection cells were treated overnight with 20 mm NH4Cl. Primary neurons were grown and transfected as described (6Fernández-Monreal M. Kang S. Phillips G.R. Mol.

For Pcdhs or N-cad transfected alone, cells were fixed 24 h after transfection with 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer with 1 mm CaCl2. For cotransfection with hcRedLC3wt or ΔG constructs, cells were imaged live prior to fixation with glutaraldehyde because we found hcRed fluorescence to be incompatible with glutaraldehyde fixation. Confocal stacks of transfected cells were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope. Differential interference contrast and fluorescent images were acquired. The location of the cell was documented with respect to the coverslip grid using brightfield illumination. The cells were then fixed if imaged live and processed for transmission electron microscopy. The material was washed in sodium cacodylate buffer and treated with 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferracyanide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then dehydrated in solutions of ethanol at increasing concentrations of 50%, 60%, and 70%, kept in 2 ml of 3% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 12 h at 4 °C, washed in 70% ethanol, and further dehydrated with increasing concentrations of 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol. After dehydration, cells were infiltrated with a 1:1 solution of resin (Embed 812 kit; Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 100% ethanol for 24 h at room temperature. After infiltration, the resin/ethanol was replaced with a 1-ml layer of pure resin, and an open ended embedding capsule was placed on the dish surrounding the cell of interest. The resin was then hardened in a vacuum oven at 65 °C for 8–12 h. After the first layer was solidified, the capsule was topped off with more resin and put back in the oven for another 8–12 h. To separate the block from the dish, a hot plate was heated to 60 °C, and the dish was placed on a preheated hot plate for exactly 3 min. The dish was removed from the hot plate and the capsule carefully peeled free from the dish. The imaged cell was relocated in the block face and sectioned through. Sections were contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and serial sections of the cell of interest were documented at magnifications of ×10,000, ×15,000, and ×30,000. Confocal, differential interference contrast, and transmission electron microscopy images were realigned and oriented using nuclear and other morphological landmarks. Immunoelectron microscopy was performed as described (8Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M. Elste A. Fidler L. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 3: 5096-5104Crossref Google Scholar). Induction of LC3 clustering by Pcdh-γs, -α1, or N-cad was quantified as follows. Confocal sections of random cells doubly transfected with RFP-LC3 and Pcdh or N-cad GFP/YFP/Venus constructs were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 410 microscope. It was then determined whether RFP-LC3 in each cell was punctate or diffuse. At least 75 cells were scored for each condition over three independent experiments, and the number of punctate LC3 cells was averaged. All conditions were counted blindly. ImageJ was used on imported transmission electron microscopy images to determine tubule length and diameter and averaged from 20–30 tubules from two cells/condition. A t test was used to determine significance. For immunoelectron microscopic quantification of anti-Pcdh-γ-labeled organelles, the overall number of gold particles/organelle was determined, and for each organelle, the orientation of particles was designated as “paired,” representing an adhesive-like conformation, or “unpaired.” The ratio of unpaired to paired labeled organelles was determined from 51 labeled organelles. Pcdh-γ-GFP fusions are functional in vivo (7Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R.

When expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons and cell lines, Pcdh-γ-GFPs exhibited an intracellular distribution that shifted to the cell surface at cell-cell contacts upon deletion of the cytoplasmic region (6Fernández-Monreal M. Kang S. Phillips G.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 40: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), indicating specific retention signals within the cytoplasmic domain. To determine the identity of the compartments that harbor full-length intracellular Pcdh-γs, we performed CLEM (21Polishchuk R.S. Polishchuk E.V. Marra P. Alberti S. Buccione R. Luini A. Mironov A.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Razi M. Tooze S.A. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of transiently transfected cells. This allowed the precise relocalization of GFP-tagged Pcdh-γs under the electron microscope. Although largely intracellular, in some cases γB2-YFP (Fig. 1A, arrowheads) was found at the interface between two transfected cells (Fig. 1A, cells 1 and 2). Pcdh-γA3-GFP was previously observed to target to cell-cell interfaces (5Frank M. Ebert M. Shan W. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Colman D.R. Kemler R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Fernández-Monreal M. Kang S. Phillips G.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 40: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). γB2-YFP never accumulated at the interface between a transfected cell and a nontransfected cell (Fig. 1A, cells 1 and 3). Both Pcdh-γ-positive and -negative cell-cell interfaces were relocated under the electron microscope by CLEM. The γB2-YFP positive interface between cell 1 and cell 2 (Fig. 1B) was more electron-dense with rigid alignment of plasma membranes compared with the γB2-YFP-negative interface between cell 1 and the nonexpressing cell 3 (Fig. 1C). We took advantage of the property that Pcdh-γs render membranes electron-dense to identify the intracellular organelles that harbor the A, B, and C subclasses of Pcdh-γs and compare these with a Pcdh-α family member (Pcdh-α1) and the classical cadherin, N-cad. Three representatives of the Pcdh-γ cluster, γA3-GFP, γB2-YFP, and γC4-YFP, were compared with each other and with a member of the α cluster, Pcdh-α1-GFP (α1-GFP), as well as the classical N-cad-Venus. Intracellular juxtanuclear accumulations of γA3-GFP were present in most transfected cells (Fig. 2A, box). The area corresponding to γA3-GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2A, boxes) was analyzed by CLEM in individual cells (Fig. 2, A, right panel, and B). In all cells, precisely at the area of γA3-GFP fluorescence, electron-dense membrane tubules were observed that were completely absent in untransfected cells. High magnification of the γA3-GFP induced tubules (Fig. 2B) revealed a diameter of ∼60–70 nm. These tubules were distinct from rough and smooth ER-like profiles that were oftentimes found in the vicinity of the tubules but were also observed in untransfected cells. In some cases the tubules were observed to emanate from 100–250 nm vesicular organelles that also contained smaller dot-like profiles (Fig. 2B, right panel, arrowheads). Intracellular accumulations were also observed for γB2-YFP and γC4-YFP (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively) and were examined by CLEM. Tubules similar to those found in γA3-GFP-transfected cells were found in γB2-YFP-transfected cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, γC4-YFP did not induce the formation of tubules (Fig. 2D) but instead accumulated in layered membrane sheets similar to the type of accumulations observed for some ER proteins (25Snapp E.L. Hegde R.S. Francolini M. Lombardo F. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J.Cell Biol. 2003; 63: 257-269Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 26Lingwood D. Schuck S. Ferguson C. Gerl M.J. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12041-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unlike γA3-GFP-induced tubules, the γC4-YFP-induced sheets were continuous through several serial sections, demonstrating that γC4-YFP induces accumulation of sheets rather than tubules (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, γC4-YFP sheets were found to be continuous with the nuclear envelope, suggesting an ER origin (supplemental Fig. 1). By comparison, α1-GFP was almost exclusively intracellular and absent at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 3A) in agreement with its apparent lack of adhesive activity (9Mutoh T. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Murata Y. Yagi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 94: 494-508Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Morishita H. Umitsu M. Murata Y. Shibata N. Udaka K. Higuchi Y. Akutsu H. Yamaguchi T. Yagi T. Ikegami T. J.Biol.Chem. 2006; 281: 33650-33663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By CLEM, α1-GFP showed ER-like accumulations that, at higher magnification, appeared to be associated with ribosomes (Fig. 3A, right panel), suggesting an expansion of rough ER. N-cad-Venus was more prominent at cell junctions (not shown) but also could be found intracellularly (Fig. 3B). CLEM of N-cad-Venus intracellular accumulations showed a different ER-like profile with wrapped sheets and vacuoles (Fig. 3B, right panel) that, unlike α1-GFP, did not associate with ribosomes. These whorled membranes have also been shown to be associated with accumulations due to ER expansion (25Snapp E.L. Hegde R.S. Francolini M. Lombardo F. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J.Cell Biol. 2003; 63: 257-269Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 26Lingwood D. Schuck S. Ferguson C. Gerl M.J. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12041-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, γA3-GFP and γB2-YFP produce a specific type of intracellular tubule versus the ER and sheet-like accumulations observed for the other constructs. To determine the origin of the tubules within the secretory pathway, we searched for organelle markers that might colocalize with γA3-GFP- and γB2-YFP-induced tubules (see supplemental Fig. 2). The autophagy protein LC3, when fused to either GFP or RFP, has been shown to be a reliable marker for autophagosomes in cultured cells and in vivo (18Tanida I. Ueno T. Kominami E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2503-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 27Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). We found that both γA3-GFP and γB2-YFP induced the clustering of, and colocalized with, RFP-LC3 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, neither γC4-YFP, α1-GFP, nor N-cad-Venus affected the clustering of RFP-LC3, which remained diffuse in transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Quantification showed that ∼70% of cells transfected with γA3-GFP or γB2-YFP and RFP-LC3 exhibited clustered LC3 (Fig. 4B). All constructs evaluated were expressed at comparable levels in cells (see supplemental Fig. 3). Furthermore, no accumulation of autophagic vesicles or autolysosomes, which have been visualized using the same electron microscopic preparation method (22Razi M. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 23Razi M. Tooze S.A. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), could account for the high levels of clustered LC3 in γA3-GFP- or γB2-YFP-transfected cells (see Fig. 2). γA3-GFP, when cotransfected with RFP-LC3 into cultured hippocampal neurons at 12 days in vitro, also produced intracellular clusters, some of which were found to cocluster with RFP-LC3 (Fig. 4C, arrowheads and inset). It is known that LC3 clustering artifacts due to protein aggregation can lead to misidentification of LC3 puncta (28Kuma A. Matsui M. Mizushima N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 29Tanida I. Yamaji T. Ueno T. Ishiura S. Kominami E. Hanada K. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). LC3 is lipidated at the glycine residue near its carboxyl terminus via a reaction similar to the ubiquitin ligase pathway, and this lipidation is required for LC3 targeting in autophagy (29Tanida I. Yamaji T. Ueno T. Ishiura S. Kominami E. Hanada K. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nonspecific clustering of LC3 at protein aggregates lacks the requirement for lipidation of LC3 (29Tanida I. Yamaji T. Ueno T. Ishiura S. Kominami E. Hanada K. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether LC3 lipidation is required for clustering with γA3-GFP. Wild-type hcRed-LC3 or lipidation-defective hcRed-LC3-ΔG (29Tanida I. Yamaji T. Ueno T. Ishiura S. Kominami E. Hanada K. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was transfected with γA3-GFP, and the extent of LC3 clustering was evaluated quantitatively (Fig. 5). Wild-type hcRed-LC3 was found to cocluster with γA3-GFP (Fig. 5A, left panels) similar to RFP-LC3 (see Fig. 4). In contrast, hcRed-LC3-ΔG did not cocluster with γA3-GFP (Fig. 5A, right panels). Quantitative analysis demonstrated that γA3-GFP induced the formation of wild-type hcRed-LC3 clusters but not that of hcRed-LC3-ΔG. Thus, lipidation of LC3 is required for the colocalization of LC3 with Pcdh-γ-induced intracellular tubules. We suspected that wild-type and lipidation-defective LC3 might differentially affect tubule formation or elongation when coexpressed with γA3-GFP. To test this, we compared the tubules produced by γA3-GFP alone or in the presence of wild-type hcRed-LC3 or hcRed-LC3-ΔG. In contrast to the relatively long electron-dense tubules formed by γA3-GFP in the presence of wild-type hcRed-LC3 (Fig. 6A), the electron-dense tubules were significantly shorter in the presence of hcRed-LC3-ΔG (Fig. 6B). Instead of tubules, most of the electron-dense organelles in hcRed-LC3-ΔG/γA3-GFP-cotransfectedcells consisted of vesicles similar to the type that were often connected to the tubules in RFP-LC3 and γA3-GFP-cotransfected cells (see Fig. 2B, right panel). Quantification revealed an almost 50% reduction in tubule length in cells transfected with γA3-GFP plus hcRed-LC3-ΔG relative to γgA3-GFP plus wild-type hcRed-LC3. Cells transfected with γA3-GFP alone had a tubule length intermediate to the two (Fig. 6C). Thus, LC3 promotes γA3-GFP tubule elongation in a lipidation-dependent fashion. In cells cotransfected with hcRed-LC3-ΔG and γA3-GFP, the predominant electron-dense organelles were 100–250-nm vesicles (Fig. 7A, right panel) rather than tubules (Fig. 7A, left panel), suggesting that the initial substrates for tubule formation may be a subclass of vesicular organelles that sprout tubules when Pcdh-γs accumulate in them. We sought to determine the types of organelles that harbor Pcdh-γs by immunostaining of γA3-GFP-transfected cells with subcellular markers including those for ER, Golgi, early endosomes, and late endosomes/lysosomes (supplemental Fig. 2). We observed a significant colocalization of Pcdh-γs with anti-LAMP-2 immunostaining (Fig. 7B and supplemental Fig. 2). Both γA3-GFP and γB2-YFP, constructs that induced tubules, exhibited significant colocalization with LAMP-2 (supplemental Fig. 4). Thus, in these cells, the combined data suggest that Pcdh-γA and B, but not C, families, together with LC3, induce the sprouting of tubules as they accumulate in late endosomes/lysosomes in a manner dependent on LC3 lipidation. To verify the lysosomal origin of γA3-GFP-induced tubules, we treated γA3-GFP-transfected cells with NH4Cl, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification. In this case, large vacuoles (Fig. 7C) were induced with a reduction in tubules, indicating that tubulogenesis is tied to lysosomal function. A few tubules (Fig. 7C, arrowhead) were observed, however, to emanate from the enlarged vacuoles (Fig. 7C, arrow). The luminal/extracellular domains of Pcdh-γA3 and Pcdh-γB2, but not Pcdh-γC4, were shown to participate in cell-cell interactions with homophilic properties, whereas the cytoplasmic domains promoted retention (6Fernández-Monreal M. Kang S. Phillips G.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 40: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the luminal/extracellular and/or cytoplasmic domains mediate tubule formation. Cytoplasmic-d"

Here, we describe an intracellular permease, PfNT2. PfNT2 is, like PfNT1, a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. Confocal and immunoelectron microscopic analyses of transgenic parasites harboring green fluorescent protein- or hemagglutinin-tagged PfNT2 demonstrated endoplasmic reticulum localization.

https://openalex.org/W2095012297,"The pneumococcal epsilon zeta antitoxin toxin (PezAT) system is a chromosomally encoded, class II toxin antitoxin system from the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumnoniae. Neutralization of the bacteriotoxic protein PezT is carried out by complex formation with its cognate antitoxin PezA. Here we study the stability of the inhibitory complex in vivo and in vitro. We found that toxin release is impeded in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis due to the proteolytic resistance of PezA once bound to PezT. These findings are supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating a strong thermodynamic stabilization of both proteins upon binding. A detailed kinetic analysis of PezAT assembly revealed that these particular features of PezAT are based on a strong, electrostatically guided binding mechanism leading to a stable toxin antitoxin complex with femtomolar affinity. Our data show that PezAT complex formation is distinct to all other conventional toxin antitoxin modules and a controlled mode of toxin release is required for activation."

However, the effect of directional mechanical forces in skeletal muscle gene regulation is completely unknown. Here, we identified that stretch in the longitudinal and transverse directions to the diaphragm muscle fibers up-regulated Ankrd2 gene expression by two distinct signaling pathways in wild-type (WT) and mdm, a mouse model of muscular dystrophy with early-onset of progressive muscle-wasting. Stretch in the longitudinal direction activated both NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcription factors, whereas stretch in the transverse direction activated only AP-1 transcription factor. Interestingly, longitudinal stretch activated Ankrd2 promoter only by NF-kappaB, whereas transverse stretch activated Ankrd2 promoter by AP-1. Moreover, we found that longitudinal stretch activated Akt, which up-regulated Ankrd2 expression through NF-kappaB. However, transverse stretch activated Ras-GTP, Raf-1, and Erk1/2 proteins, which up-regulated Ankrd2 expression through AP-1. Surprisingly, the stretch-activated NF-kappaB and AP-1 signaling pathways was not involved in Ankrd2 regulation at the basal level, which was high in the mdm mouse diaphragm. Taken together, our data show the anisotropic regulation of Ankrd2 gene expression in the diaphragm muscles of WT and mdm mice via two distinct mechanosensitive signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2018511748,"Dysregulated signal transduction through the notch pathway has been noted in human and mouse medulloblastoma studies. Gamma secretase inhibitors (GSIs) impair notch signaling by preventing the cleavage of transmembrane notch proteins into their active intracellular domain fragments. Previous studies have shown that GSI treatment caused apoptosis and impaired medulloblastoma cell engraftment in xenograft systems. In this study, we used in vivo genetic and pharmacologic approaches to quantify the contribution of notch signaling to sonic hedgehog (shh)-activated mouse medulloblastoma models. In contrast to prior in vitro studies, pharmacologic inhibition of notch pathways did not reduce the efficiency of medulloblastoma xenotransplantation nor did systemic therapy impact tumor size, proliferation, or apoptosis in genetically engineered mouse medulloblastoma models. The incidence and pathology of medulloblastomas driven by the SmoA1 transgene was unchanged by the bi-allelic absence of Notch1, Notch2, or Hes5 genes. These data show that notch signaling is not essential for the initiation, engraftment, or maintenance of sonic hedgehog pathway-driven medulloblastomas."

(2006) Apoptosis 11, 1121-1129). In the present study, PLIbeta was found to bind Cyt c. The interactions of LRG and PLIbeta with Cyt c were compared by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Human LRG bound horse and snake Cyt c with dissociation constants of 1.58 x 10(-13) M and 1.65 x 10(-10) M, respectively, but did not bind yeast Cyt c, while G. brevicaudus PLIbeta bound horse, snake, and yeast Cyt c with dissociation constants of 1.05 x 10(-10) M, 2.37 x 10(-12) M, and 1.67 x 10(-6) M, respectively. On the other hand, LRG did not show any PLA(2) inhibitory activity and did not bind G. brevicaudus basic PLA(2), whereas PLIbeta bound the basic PLA(2) with a dissociation constant of 1.21 x 10(-9) M, which is smaller than those with the Cyt c described above. The PLA(2) inhibitory activity of PLIbeta was also found to be suppressed by the binding of Cyt c to PLIbeta. These results suggest that autologous Cyt c is an endogeneous ligand for LRG and PLIbeta and that these serum proteins neutralize the autologous Cyt c released from the dead cells."

https://openalex.org/W1988103908,"The human mixed lineage leukemia-5 (MLL5) gene is frequently deleted in myeloid malignancies. Emerging evidence suggests that MLL5 has important functions in adult hematopoiesis and the chromatin regulatory network, and it participates in regulating the cell cycle machinery. Here, we demonstrate that MLL5 is tightly regulated through phosphorylation on its central domain at the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Upon entry into mitosis, the phosphorylated MLL5 delocalizes from condensed chromosomes, whereas after mitotic exit, MLL5 becomes dephosphorylated and re-associates with the relaxed chromatin. We further identify that the mitotic phosphorylation and subcellular localization of MLL5 are dependent on Cdc2 kinase activity, and Thr-912 is the Cdc2-targeting site. Overexpression of the Cdc2-targeting MLL5 fragment obstructs mitotic entry by competitive inhibition of the phosphorylation of endogenous MLL5. In addition, G(2) phase arrest caused by depletion of endogenous MLL5 can be compensated by exogenously overexpressed full-length MLL5 but not the phosphodomain deletion or MLL5-T912A mutant. Our data provide evidence that MLL5 is a novel cellular target of Cdc2, and the phosphorylation of MLL5 may have an indispensable role in the mitotic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2038867887,"Upon a stimulus of light, histamine is released from Drosophila photoreceptor axonal endings. It is taken up into glia where Ebony converts it into beta-alanyl-histamine (carcinine). Carcinine moves into photoreceptor cells and is there cleaved into beta-alanine and histamine by Tan activity. Tan thus provides a key function in the recycling pathway of the neurotransmitter histamine. It is also involved in the process of cuticle formation. There, it cleaves beta-alanyl-dopamine, a major component in cuticle sclerotization. Active Tan enzyme is generated by a self-processing proteolytic cleavage from a pre-protein at a conserved Gly-Cys sequence motif. We confirmed the dependence on the Gly-Cys motif by in vitro mutagenesis. Processing time delays the rise to full Tan activity up to 3 h behind its putative circadian RNA expression in head. To investigate its pleiotropic functions, we have expressed Tan as a His(6) fusion protein in Escherichia coli and have purified it to homogeneity. We found wild type and mutant His(6)-Tan protein co-migrating in size exclusion chromatography with a molecular weight compatible with homodimer formation. We conclude that dimer formation is preceding pre-protein processing. Drosophila tan(1) null mutant analysis revealed that amino acid Arg(217) is absolutely required for processing. Substitution of Met(256) in tan(5), on the contrary, does not affect processing extensively but renders it prone to degradation.

Kinetic parameters of Tan reveal characteristic differences in K(m) and k(cat) values of carcinine and beta-alanyl-dopamine cleavage, which conclusively illustrate the divergent tasks met by Tan."
https://openalex.org/W1981217106,"Tumor progression is a multiple step process in which, in addition to oncogenic mutation, other supporting factors can contribute to transformation. The role these factors have in cancer is an open question. Using the Emicro-myc model of B-cell transformation, we evaluated the contribution of the cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) in supporting lymphomagenesis. We have previously shown that disruption of the Y449xxM motif of the IL-7 receptor alpha (IL-7Ralpha) in a knock-in mouse model (IL-7Ralpha(449F)) has minor effects on lymphocyte production, but interferes with the activation of survival effectors. To address the hypothesis that targeted signal ablation would selectively affect lymphocyte transformation, IL-7Ralpha(449F) mice were crossed with two lymphomagenesis models, transgenic (Tg) IL-7 and Emicro-myc mice. We found that the loss of IL-7Ralpha Y449 signaling prevented Tg IL-7-mediated T- and B-lymphocyte transformation and decreased the development of Emicro-myc-induced B-cell tumors. We showed that the IL-7Ralpha(449F) mutation prevented increased survival of Tg IL-7 CD8 T cells, and decreased viability of bone marrow progenitor B cells, as well as Emicro-myc-induced proliferation. This study shows that IL-7Ralpha Y449 is important for lymphocyte transformation, and that unlike deficiencies in pre-B cell receptor signaling, Myc overexpression cannot compensate for the loss of IL-7Ralpha signals in early B-cell development."

Its final 83 amino acids localize PIP5KIβ to the uropod of chemotaxing neutrophils and T cells, and interact with ezrin-radixinmoesin (ERM) proteins and EBP50 (4.1-ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50), a scaffold protein with 2 PDZ (PSD-95, disc large, ZO-1) domains. The structural motifs at the PIP5KIβ C terminus that confer signaling specificity are, nonetheless, unknown. We show that the last 4 residues of PIP5KIβ constitute an atypical PDZ-binding motif, which steers PIP5KIβ to the uropod by binding to both EBP50 PDZ domains. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis indicated that PDZ-binding motif is necessary for PIP5KIβ localization and for chemoattractant-induced neutrophil polarization. Polarity in cells that express PIP5KIβ mutants lacking the PDZ-binding motif was restored by overexpression of PIP5KIβ, but not of PIP5KIγ_i2, another isoform that localizes to the neutrophil uropod. Our results identify an isoform-specific PDZ-binding motif in PIP5KIβ, which confers specificity for PIP5KIβ signaling at the uropod during leukocyte chemotaxis.—Mañes, S., Fuentes, G., Peregil, R.

P24, but not P18, proved to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in HeLa cells and to negatively affect mitochondrial function.

On the other hand, P18 inhibits the Ca2+ influx induced by 0.6 mm ATP in HEK293 cells stably transfected with P2X7, with an IC50 of ∼1 μm. Thus, P18 is devoid of intrinsic P2X7 stimulatory activity and behaves as an ATP antagonist.

SC from adult animals were grown for 4 days in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, Srl, Milano, Italy) containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10–5 m cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (Sigma). Adherent HeLa cells (2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates) were loaded with 10 μm Fura-2AM for 45 min at 37 °C in complete medium.

For HEK293 cells, fluorescence intensity was monitored under stirring: before each reading cycle, an orbital shaking was made (1 s, 1 mm width, 350 rounds/min). Adherent (on 20-mm poly-lysine-coated coverslips) HEK293 cells and wild type and CMT1A SC were incubated with 10 μm Fura-2AM in complete medium for 45 min at 37 °C and then washed with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).

After acquisition of the basal fluorescence level, the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, 4 μm) was added.

HEK293-P2X7 and HEK293-mock cells were seeded in 96-well plates (6 × 104 cells/well) and incubated in the presence of 20 μm ethidium bromide. Ethidium bromide influx was evaluated with a fluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Optima; excitation and emission wavelengths were 355 and 390 nm, respectively), upon addition of different concentrations of either ATP, or P24, or P18 or Ap2A. To evaluate P24- or P18-mediated inhibition of ATP-induced uptake of ethidium bromide, cells were preincubated for 10 min with 20 μm P24 or P18, before addition of ATP. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed under stirring. Before each reading cycle, an orbital shaking was made (1 s, 1 mm width, 350 rounds/min). HEK293-P2X7 and HEK293-mock cells (2 × 104 cells/well), wild type and CMT1A SC (1.2 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in quadruplicate in 96-well plates, and incubated (or not) with different concentrations of P18, P24, or Ap2A. After 48 h of culture, cell proliferation was evaluated with the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One solution cell proliferation assay, which uses a solution containing a tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS) and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine ethosulfate) (Promega).

The P24-induced Ca2+ increase in these cells was also abrogated by addition of 10 μm Gd3+ (Fig. 1) or 30 μm La3+ (not shown), confirming that it was due to influx of extracellular Ca2+.

The similar effects observed on cell Ca2+, ΔΨm, and viability upon activation of P2X7 (see Introduction) or administration of P24 (14Bruzzone S. Dodoni G. Kaludercic N. Basile G. Millo E. De Flora A.

Thus, HeLa cells were preincubated with KN-62, an inhibitor of P2X7, as well as of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (22Gargett C.E. Wiley J.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and then treated with P24. As shown in Fig. 1, KN-62 abrogated the P24-induced [Ca2+]i increase, thus supporting the involvement of P2X7 in P24-stimulated Ca2+ influx. To confirm a role for P2X7 in the P24-induced Ca2+ influx, HEK293 cells stably transfected with P2X7 (HEK293-P2X7 cells) were treated in parallel with either ATP or P24 at two different concentrations (100 μm and 1 mm). P24 induced a slow and sustained [Ca2+]i increase already at 100 μm, a concentration at which ATP was ineffective (Fig. 2A), in agreement with previous data on the affinity of P2X7 for this dinucleotide (23Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). At the concentration of 1 mm, the [Ca2+]i rise triggered by P24 was larger than at 100 μm but substantially smaller than that caused by ATP (Fig. 2A). A slow and sustained [Ca2+]i increase induced by 100 μm P24 was also observed on single cells (not shown), suggesting that continuous presence of P24 does not induce P2X7 desensitization, in line with what observed with ATP (17North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). The effect of P24 was concentration-dependent, with as low as 5 μm being already effective, as measured at 10 min after the addition (Fig. 2B). Preincubation of HEK293-P2X7 cells with KN-62 prevented the P24-induced [Ca2+]i increase and P24 had no effect on [Ca2+]i homeostasis in HEK293 cells transfected with the empty vector (HEK293-mock cells) (Fig. 2C). Neither of the two P24 isomers, P18 or Ap2A, elicited a [Ca2+]i increase in HEK293-P2X7 cells or in HEK293-mock cells (not shown). To investigate the involvement of P2X7 in P24-stimulated ΔΨm collapse, HEK293-P2X7 cells were loaded for 2.5 h with the mitochondrial fluorescent probe TMRM, in the presence or absence of 100 μm P24. The difference between the basal fluorescence level and the fluorescence recorded upon addition of the uncoupler FCCP revealed an almost complete (85%) dissipation of the ΔΨm (Fig. 3A). The ΔΨm of cells incubated with 1 mm ATP was also dissipated to a similar extent (by 75%, Fig. 3A), in agreement with previous observations (18Adinolfi E. Callegari M.G. Ferrari D. Bolognesi C. Minelli M. Wieckowski M.R. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Di Virgilio F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3260-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Activation of P2X7 initially leads to increased membrane permeability to small cations, followed by the progressive opening of a large, nonselective membrane pore, permeable to large fluorescent dyes (15Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 16Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G.

Addition of up to 1 mm P24 to HEK293-P2X7 cells did not cause influx of either Lucifer yellow or of ethidium bromide. Conversely, 1 mm ATP induced cell uptake of Lucifer yellow (not shown) and of ethidium bromide (Fig. 3B). Altogether, these results indicate that the P24-induced activation of P2X7 causes opening of the ion channel, allowing subsequent Ca2+ influx, but is not followed by pore formation. Influx of extracellular Ca2+, and the subsequent dissipation of ΔΨm, was previously shown to be responsible for P24-induced cell death (14Bruzzone S. Dodoni G. Kaludercic N. Basile G. Millo E.

Thus, we explored P24 cytotoxicity in HEK293-P2X7 and in HEK293-mock cells. Up to 10 μm P24 had no effect on viability of HEK293-mock cells, whereas it showed a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity on HEK293-P2X7 cells (Fig. 4, A and B), with an LC50 of 1.1 ± 0.2 μm, ∼10-fold lower than that reported for HeLa cells (9.8 μm, Ref. 10Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14509-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After 24 h of incubation in the presence of 0.2, 1, or 5 μm P24, [Ca2+]i levels in HEK293-P2X7 cells were concentration dependently increased, from a basal value of 43 nm, to 83, 102, and 131 nm, respectively (inset to Fig. 4A). In HEK293-P2X7 cells preincubated in the presence of 100 nm KN-62, a concentration inhibiting P2X7, without affecting CaMKII (22Gargett C.E. Wiley J.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the P24-induced cytotoxicity was almost completely prevented (Fig. 4C), suggesting that P24-induced cell death is mediated by P2X7 activation. To confirm the involvement of P2X7 in the P24-induced cytotoxicity, HEK293-P2X7 and -mock cells were preincubated in the presence of a different inhibitor of this purinergic receptor, oxidized ATP (oATP) (17North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar): as shown in Fig. 4C, oATP almost completely prevented P24-induced HEK293-P2X7 cell death. P18 was also previously found to decrease cell viability on several human cell types, although at a concentration 1-log higher than P24, via an as yet unidentified mechanism (10Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14509-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). P18-induced cytotoxicity was not significantly different (p > 0.5) on HEK293-P2X7 and on HEK293-mock cells, with an LC50 of 25 ± 5 and 30 ± 4 μm, respectively (Fig. 4D), demonstrating that it does not depend on expression of P2X7. On the other hand, Ap2A did not significantly affect viability of either HEK293-P2X7 or HEK293-mock cells at concentrations up to 100 μm (not shown). The observation that P24 triggered a Ca2+ rise in the absence of pore formation (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), suggested that it might be an incomplete P2X7 agonist, and prompted experiments aimed at investigating its effects on ATP-dependent P2X7 activation. To this purpose, HEK293-P2X7 cells were preincubated for 10 min with P24 and then challenged with increasing concentrations of ATP. In the presence of 100 μm P24, the Ca2+ increase induced by ATP was significantly reduced by 100, 66, 58, or 13% at the ATP concentrations of 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, or 1 mm, respectively (Fig. 5A). The Ca2+ rise induced by 0.6 mm ATP was concentration dependently inhibited by P24, with an IC50 of 17.0 ± 3.4 μm, as calculated from the logarithmic regression curves (Fig. 5C). Although 20 μm P24 per se induced a slow Ca2+ increase, it reduced the ATP-induced Ca2+ rise by ∼50% (inset to Fig. 5C, black trace). Next, we explored whether P18, which by itself had no effect on [Ca2+]i homeostasis, could affect the ATP-induced Ca2+ increase in HEK293-P2X7 cells. Indeed, preincubation of the cells for 10 min with 50 μm P18, completely abolished the Ca2+ influx induced by 1 mm ATP (not shown). Fig. 5A shows the percentages of inhibition obtained upon preincubation of HEK293-P2X7 cells with 2 μm P18, in comparison with those obtained with 100 μm P24. The IC50 of P18 on the [Ca2+]i rise induced by 0.6 mm ATP was 1.2 ± 0.2 μm, as calculated from the logarithmic regression curves (Fig. 5D). Thus, P18 inhibits the effect of ATP on P2X7, much more efficiently than P24, without affecting per se the [Ca2+]i (inset to Fig. 5D, black trace). The concentration-effect curves for ATP were progressively shifted to the right in the presence of 100 μm P24 or of 2 and 20 μm P18 (Fig. 5B), without decreasing agonist efficacy. These data indicate that both P24 and P18 blocks ATP-evoked activation of P2X7 receptors in a competitive fashion. A 10-min preincubation of the cells in the presence of 100 μm Ap2A did not significantly decrease the [Ca2+]i rise induced by 1 mm ATP (not shown). Next, we investigated whether P24 and P18 could affect the delayed pore formation following exposure to extracellular ATP. Fig. 5E shows that addition of either P24 or P18 (20 μm) completely abrogated the opening of the pore induced by 1 mm ATP in HEK293-P2X7, as measured by ethidium bromide uptake. A P2X7-mediated increase of the basal [Ca2+]i has been demonstrated to cause functional derangement in SC from rats with the CMT1A neuropathy and pharmacological P2X7 antagonists restored normal [Ca2+]i in CMT1A SC (20Nobbio L. Sturla L. Fiorese F. Usai C. Basile G. Moreschi I. Benvenuto F. Zocchi E. De Flora A. Schenone A. Bruzzone S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23146-23158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect on CMT1A SC of the newly identified P2X7 antagonist P18 on CMT1A SC, we first evaluated its toxicity on CMT1A SC. As shown in Fig. 6A, P18 was devoid of cell toxicity at concentrations ≤25 μm, Ap2A did not affect cell viability at concentrations up to 100 μm, whereas the LC50 of P24 was 22.3 ± 3.2 μm after 48 h of incubation, as calculated from the non-linear regression curve. Similar results for P24, P18, and Ap2A were obtained on SC from wild-type rats (not shown) and the LC50 values for P18 and P24 on SC (∼118.0 and 22.3 μm, respectively) are similar to those already reported in HeLa cells (10Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

BzATP was chosen to stimulate P2X7 in SC, since it is the most potent agonist for this purinergic receptor, with a much higher affinity than ATP (24Baraldi P.G. Di Virgilio F. Romagnoli R. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1707-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). P18 antagonized the BzATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise in CMT1A SC in a concentr"
https://openalex.org/W2029258723,"In the rodent forebrain GABAergic neurons are generated from progenitor cells that express the transcription factors Dlx1 and Dlx2. The Rap-1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MR-GEF, is turned on by many of these developing GABAergic neurons. Expression of both Dlx1/2 and MR-GEF is retained in both adult mouse and human forebrain where, in human, decreased Dlx1 expression has been associated with psychosis. Using in situ hybridization studies we show that MR-GEF expression is significantly down-regulated in the forebrain of Dlx1/2 double mutant mice suggesting that MR-GEF and Dlx1/2 form part of a common signalling pathway during GABAergic neuronal development. We therefore compared MR-GEF expression by in situ hybridization in individuals with major psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression) and control individuals. We observed a significant positive correlation between layers II and IV of the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the percentage of MR-GEF expressing neurons in individuals with bipolar disorder, but not in individuals with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or in controls. Since MR-GEF encodes a Rap1 GEF able to activate G-protein signalling, we suggest that changes in MR-GEF expression could potentially influence neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W1971869094,"Intramolecular allosteric interactions responsible for actin conformational regulation are largely unknown. Previous work demonstrated that replacing yeast actin Val-76 with muscle actin Ile caused decreased nucleotide exchange. Residue 76 abuts Trp-79 in a six-residue linear array beginning with Lys-118 on the surface and ending with His-73 in the nucleotide cleft. To test if altering the degree of packing of these two residues would affect actin dynamics, we constructed V76I, W79F, and W79Y single mutants as well as the Ile-76/Phe-79 and Ile-76/Tyr-79 double mutants. Tyr or Phe should decrease crowding and increase protein flexibility. Subsequent introduction of Ile should restore packing and dampen changes. All mutants showed decreased growth in liquid medium. W79Y alone was severely osmosensitive and exhibited vacuole abnormalities. Both properties were rescued by Ile-76. Phe-79 or Tyr decreased the thermostability of actin and increased its nucleotide exchange rate. These effects, generally greater for Tyr than for Phe, were reversed by introduction of Ile-76. HD exchange showed that the mutations caused propagated conformational changes to all four subdomains. Based on results from phosphate release and light-scattering assays, single mutations affected polymerization in the order of Ile, Phe, and Tyr from least to most. Introduction of Ile-76 partially rescued the polymerization defects caused by either Tyr-79 or Phe-79. Thus, alterations in crowding of the 76-79 residue pair can strongly affect actin conformation and behavior, and these results support the theory that the amino acid array in which they are located may play a central role in actin regulation."
