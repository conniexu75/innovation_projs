https://openalex.org/W2042637324,"Mice deficient in CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) showed no overt abnormalities during development and early adulthood, but had a reduced lifespan and increased incidence of neoplastic changes in the liver. Greater than 70% of Sod1−/− mice developed liver nodules that were either nodular hyperplasia or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cross-sectional studies with livers collected from Sod1−/− and age-matched +/+ controls revealed extensive oxidative damage in the cytoplasm and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus and mitochondria from as early as 3 months of age. A marked reduction in cytosolic aconitase, increased levels of 8-oxo dG and F2-isoprostanes, and a moderate reduction in glutathione peroxidase activities and porin levels were observed in all age groups of Sod1−/− mice examined. There were also age-related reductions in Mn superoxide dismutase activities and carbonic anhydrase III. Parallel to the biochemical changes, there were progressive increases in the DNA repair enzyme APEX1, the cell cycle control proteins cyclin D1 and D3, and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met. Increased cell proliferation in the presence of persistent oxidative damage to macromolecules likely contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis later in life."

These observations suggested the pathophysiological importance of FGF-23 on phosphate homeostasis. However, regulation of FGF-23 production is still unclear. We investigated effects of both dietary phosphorus and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3) on circulating FGF-23 in vivo Administration of. 1α,25(OH)2D3 dose-dependently increased serum FGF-23 in thyroparathyroidectomized rats without correlating with serum inorganic phosphorus or serum parathyroid hormone. On the other hand, vitamin D receptor null mice had very low serum FGF-23 and did not respond to the 1α,25(OH)2D3 administration. These observations suggested 1α,25(OH)2D3 directly or indirectly regulates circulating FGF-23. Serum FGF-23 had a strong correlation with serum inorganic phosphorus controlled by dietary phosphorus in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. High phosphate diet elicited a 5-fold increase in serum FGF-23 compared with sham-operated rats, whereas serum FGF-23 did not correlate with serum calcium or serum creatinine in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. Administration of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 also elicited a severalfold increase in serum FGF-23 in the uremic rats. Taken together, this shows that both serum phosphorus and 1α,25(OH)2D3 regulate circulating FGF-23 independent of each other. Therefore, we proposed there was a feedback loop existing among serum phosphorus, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and FGF-23, in which the novel phosphate-regulating bone-kidney axis integrated with the parathyroid hormone-vitamin D3 axis in regulating phosphate homeostasis.

The parathyroid hormone-vitamin D3 endocrine system, as well as dietary phosphorus, plays an important role in regulating renal and gastrointestinal absorption of phosphate. Recently, emerging evidence suggests that other systemic and/or paracrine/autocrine factors are present in bones for maintaining phosphate homeostasis, such as fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), 1The abbreviations used are: FGF-23, fibroblast growth factor-23; Pi, phosphate; IP, inorganic phosphorus; TPTX, thyroparathyroidectomy; XLH, X-linked hypophosphatemia; PHEX, phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome; 1α,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; 1α-OHase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1α-hydroxylase; PTH, parathyroid hormone; ELISA, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay; VDRKO, vitamin D receptor null(–/–). frizzled-related protein-4 (FRP-4), and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) (1The ADHR, ConsortiumNat.

These three factors were highly expressed in tumors isolated from oncogenic osteomalacia patients and reduced phosphate transport in kidney. Among these factors, FGF-23 strongly suppressed 1α,25(OH)2D3 production and elicited hypophosphatemia. Administration of the recombinant FGF-23 protein reduced serum phosphorus without affecting serum calcium, as well as increasing renal phosphorus excretion in mice (12Shimada T. Muto T. Urakawa I.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary phosphorus and 1α,25(OH)2D3 on FGF-23 production. Administration of FGF-23 protein or overexpression of Fgf23 gene in rodent suppressed 1α,25(OH)2D3 production by reducing 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1α-hydroxylase in the proximal tubules (12Shimada T.

On the contrary, Fgf23-null mice reported increased circulating 1α,25(OH)2D3 despite hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and low PTH levels (24Shimada T. Kakitani M. Yamazaki Y. Hasegawa H. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Tomizuka K. Yamashita T. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Administration of 1α,25(OH)2D3 increased serum FGF-23 in normal mice (25Shimada T. Hasegawa H. Yamazaki Y. Muto T. Hino R. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Nakahara K. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). These observations suggested mutual regulation between FGF-23 and 1α,25(OH)2D3; however, 1α,25(OH)2D3 administration also increases intestinal phosphate uptake and suppresses PTH. Thus, we used thyroparathyroidectomized rats as well as 5/6 nephrectomized rats fed a diet with various kinds of phosphorus content to examine the direct effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 administration on serum FGF-23. Dietary phosphate deprivation or loading rapidly induces activation or repression of phosphate absorption in kidney and in intestine, mainly by inducing or suppressing type II sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransporter expression (26Katai K. Miyamoto K. Kishida S. Segawa H. Nii T. Tanaka H. Tani Y. Arai H. Tatsumi S. Morita K. Taketani Y. Takeda E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Katai K.

Therefore, the serum phosphorus level is not susceptible to the change in dietary phosphorus content in normal animals in vivo. We investigated the effects of dietary phosphorus on FGF-23 production in vivo using 5/6 nephrectomized uremic rats, in which the serum phosphorus level can be easily manipulated by dietary phosphorus due to reduced kidney function. We also examined the correlations between serum FGF-23 and (a) serum inorganic phosphorus, (b) serum calcium, (c) serum creatinine, and (d) serum PTH in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. Normal Rat—Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (CREA Japan, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were given either vehicle, 10, 30, 100, or 300 ng of 1α,25(OH)2D3/kg of bodyweight intravenously, three times a week for 2 weeks. Blood samples were obtained from the vena cava under ether anesthesia on day 14. Serum calcium, serum inorganic phosphorus, and serum creatinine were measured by an automatic analyzer (Type 7170E, Hitachi Corp.). Serum FGF-23 was determined by the Human FGF-23 ELISA kit (Kinos Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) Rats and PTH-infused TPTX Rats—Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Charles River (Tokyo, Japan) were TPTX under ether anesthesia. After confirming hypocalcemia had been induced, rats were divided to two groups, the TPTX group and the TPTX + PTH group. Rats in the TPTX + PTH group were subcutaneously implanted with ALZET® osmotic pumps (model 2ML2, Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA) and administered human PTH-(1–34) at a constant rate of 2.4 μg/day for 14 days. Rats in the TPTX group were intravenously injected with vehicle, 50 ng/kg or 300 ng/kg 1α,25(OH)2D3, three times a week for 2 weeks; rats in the TPTX + PTH group were injected with either vehicle or 50 ng/kg 1α,25(OH)2D3 three times a week for 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected and various parameters analyzed as described above. Vitamin D Receptor Null(–/–) (VDRKO) Mice—VDRKO mice and their littermates kept on a high calcium and high phosphorus diet (28Yoshizawa T. Handa Y. Uematsu Y. Takeda S. Sekine K. Yoshihara Y. Kawakami T. Arioka K. Sato H. Uchiyama Y. Masushige S. Fukamizu A. Matsumoto T. Kato S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 6: 391-396Crossref Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) were administered vehicle or 300 ng/kg 1α,25(OH)2D3 three times a week for 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected and analyzed as described above. 5/6 Subtotally Nephrectomized Uremic Rat Models and Diets—Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180–200 g were purchased from CREA Japan and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12-h light/dark cycle. After acclimating for 1 week, the rats were 5/6 nephrectomized and then allowed unlimited access to normal rodent chow (CE-2, CREA Japan Inc.) and tap water. The phosphate (Pi)-controlled diets and 1α,25(OH)2D3 injection started when rat serum creatinine reached within the range of 1.1–1.5 mg/dl. Three Pi-controlled diets (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were used in the present study: a high Pi diet, containing 0.9% phosphorus, 0.6% calcium; a midrange Pi diet, containing 0.6% phosphorus, 0.6% calcium; and a low Pi diet, containing 0.2% phosphorus, 0.6% calcium (26Katai K. Miyamoto K. Kishida S. Segawa H. Nii T. Tanaka H. Tani Y. Arai H. Tatsumi S. Morita K. Taketani Y. Takeda E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Katai K.

The following groups of rats were studied: 1) 5/6 nephrectomized rats fed either the high, midrange, or low Pi diet for 4 weeks, 2) 5/6 nephrectomized rats fed the high, midrange, or low Pi diet and injected with 50 ng of 1α,25(OH)2D3/kg of bodyweight intravenously twice weekly for 4 weeks, and 3) age-matched sham-operated rats fed normal rat chow (CE-2, CREA Japan) used as a control. Blood samples were obtained from the vena cava under ether anesthesia at day 28 and various parameters analyzed as described above. Serum PTH was determined using a Rat Intact PTH ELISA kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA). All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with Chugai Pharmaceutical's ethical guidelines for animal care, and all experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the institution. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as means ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined using Student's t test or Dunnett's t test (SAS Preclinical Package, Version 5.0, SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo) unless otherwise indicated. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on Serum FGF-23 in Normal Rats— Intravenous administration of 1α,25(OH)2D3, three times a week for 2 weeks, dose-dependently increased serum FGF-23 (Fig. 1A); however, it also increased serum inorganic phosphorus (Fig. 1B). Therefore, 1α,25(OH)2D3 administration increased both serum FGF-23 and serum phosphorus in normal rats. Effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on Serum FGF-23 in TPTX Rats—As shown in Fig. 2, A–C, Thyroparathyroidectomized rats induced hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and also a slight but significant decrease in serum FGF-23 in comparison with normal rats. Administration of 1α,25(OH)2D3 dose-dependently increased serum FGF-23 as well as serum calcium in TPTX rats. Also 1α,25(OH)2D3 suppressed serum inorganic phosphorus in TPTX rats. PTH infusion to TPTX rats normalized serum calcium, serum inorganic phosphorus, and serum FGF-23. 1α,25(OH)2D3 increased serum FGF-23; however, unlike TPTX rats, no significant change was observed in serum inorganic phosphorus and serum calcium in PTH-infused TPTX rats. These observations suggested that 1α,25(OH)2D3 increased serum FGF-23 independent of serum inorganic phosphorus and PTH. Effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on Serum FGF-23 in VDRKO Mice— VDRKO mice kept on high calcium (2%) and high phosphorus (1.25%) diets showed considerably low serum FGF-23 (<3 pg/ml, below detection limit) and low serum calcium (5.8 ± 0.6 mg/dl) in comparison with the wild-type littermates (FGF-23, 254 ± 35.6 pg/ml; calcium, 9.5 ± 0.1 mg/dl). 1α,25(OH)2D3 administration did not affect either serum FGF-23 (<3 pg/ml, below detection limit) or serum calcium (5.1 ± 0.2 mg/dl). Effects of Pi-controlled Diets on Serum FGF-23 and Serum Inorganic Phosphorus in 5/6 Nephrectomized Rats—Serum inorganic phosphorus correlated with the dietary phosphorus contents (Fig. 3A) in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. On the contrary, serum calcium correlated with serum phosphorus in a reciprocal fashion (Fig. 3B). The 5/6 nephrectomy induced a significant increase in serum FGF-23 in rats, regardless of the dietary phosphorus contents (Fig. 3C). Serum FGF-23 of sham-operated rats was 305 ± 23 pg/ml. Whereas, serum FGF-23 increased in high, midrange, and low Pi diet groups (5108 ± 989 pg/ml, 1815 ± 200 pg/ml, and 1133 ± 121 pg/ml, respectively). Serum FGF-23 showed a clear correlation with serum phosphorus (Fig. 4A) and a weak inverse correlation with serum calcium (Fig. 4B) in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. However, serum FGF-23 did not correlate with serum creatinine (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Correlations between serum FGF-23 and serum inorganic phosphorus (A), serum calcium (B), and serum creatinine (C) in 5/6 nephrectomized rats fed with Pi-controlled diet. 5/6 nephrectomized rats were fed either high Pi, midrange Pi, or low Pi diet for 4 weeks.

Serum inorganic phosphorus weakly correlated with serum FGF-23 in the nephrectomized rats with or without 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment (Fig. 6A). However, the other three parameters did not have a strong correlation with serum FGF-23 (Fig. 6, B–D).Fig. 6Correlations between serum FGF-23 and serum inorganic phosphorus (A), serum calcium (B), serum creatinine (C), and serum PTH (D) in 5/6 nephrectomized rats with or without 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 administration. 5/6 nephrectomized rats fed Pi-controlled diets were given intravenously either vehicle or 50 ng/kg 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 4 weeks.

Whereas, in the 5/6 nephrectomized rats, 50 ng/kg 1α,25(OH)2D3 increased serum FGF-23 by 3–9-fold, suggesting that 1α,25(OH)2D3 had a more profound effect on increasing serum FGF-23 in rats with chronic renal failure. Shimada et al. reported that a single injection of 1α,25(OH)2D3 increased serum FGF-23 and suggested the increase in FGF-23 by 1α,25(OH)2D3 was independent of serum inorganic phosphorus (25Shimada T. Hasegawa H. Yamazaki Y. Muto T. Hino R. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Nakahara K. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). We confirmed their result that intravenous administration of 1α,25(OH)2D3 dose-dependently increased serum FGF-23 (Fig. 1A). However, we also observed an increase in serum inorganic phosphorus (Fig. 1B). There was a strong significant correlation between serum FGF-23 and serum phosphorus (Fig. 1C) in the normal rats given 1α,25(OH)2D3. Since 1α,25(OH)2D3 stimulates intestinal phosphate uptake and suppresses PTH production, this experiment indicated that 1α,25(OH)2D3 increased serum FGF-23 as well as serum phosphorus. To evaluate the effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 apart from serum phosphorus on FGF-23 production, 1α,25(OH)2D3 was administered to thyroparathyroidectomized rats with or without PTH infusion. 1α,25(OH)2D3 also increased serum FGF-23 in thyroparathyroidectomized, and the effect was independent of serum phosphorus (Fig. 2, A–C). The direct effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on FGF-23 production was confirmed by the fact that VDRKO mice did not respond to the 1α,25(OH)2D3 administration. Larsson et al. (18Larsson T. Nisbeth U.

Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 2272-2279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) reported phosphate deprivation and/or phosphate loading to normal subjects did not affect serum FGF-23; however, serum phosphorus weakly correlated with serum FGF-23 in predialysis patients with chronic kidney disease. Recent studies also revealed that serum FGF-23 was elevated in patients with end-stage renal disease (16Webber T.J. Liu S. Indridason O.S. Quarles L.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 20Shigematsu T. Kazama J.J. Yamashita T. Fukumoto S. Hosoya T. Geyjo F. Fukagawa M. Am. J.

Uchiyama Y. Masushige S. Fukamizu A. Matsumoto T. Kato S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 6: 391-396Crossref Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the effect of dietary phosphorus on FGF-23 production using 5/6 nephrectomized rats fed the diets with various kinds of phosphorus content. Serum FGF-23 was elevated in uremic rats; however, serum FGF-23 did not clearly correlate with serum creatinine in those rats as was observed in human subjects. Serum phosphorus was well controlled by the dietary phosphorus in 5/6 nephrectomized rats (Fig. 3A). Serum FGF-23 positively correlated with serum phosphorus in those rats (Fig. 3C). In the physiological condition, a high serum phosphorus suppresses 1α,25(OH)2D3 production in kidney. Thus, the elevation of serum FGF-23 induced by a high Pi diet was independent of serum 1α,25(OH)2D3. Moreover, serum FGF-23 was drastically elevated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 administration in 5/6 nephrectomized rats fed with various Pi-controlled diets (Fig. 5). However, serum FGF-23 did not correlate with serum calcium, serum creatinine, or serum PTH in those rats (Fig. 6, B–D). These observations suggested that FGF-23 production was mainly regulated by serum phosphorus and serum 1α,25(OH)2D3. Recent studies (16Webber T.J. Liu S. Indridason O.S. Quarles L.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17Jonsson K.B. Zahradnik R. Larsson T. White K.E. Sugimoto T. Imanishi Y. Yamamoto T. Hampson G. Koshiyama H. Ljuggren Ö. Oba K.

Serum phosphorus concentrations were negatively correlated with circulating FGF-23 levels in patients with XLH. Moreover, FGF-23 mRNA expression was enhanced in the calvarial and mandible bones of Hyp-mouse, which is a homologue of human XLH (13Liu S. Guo R. Simpson L.G. Xian Z-S. Burnham C.E. Quarles L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37419-37426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Mutations in PHEX, a phosphate-regulating gene with homology to endopeptidase on the X-chromosome, are responsible for XLH. PHEX mRNA is predominantly expressed in bone and teeth. 1α,25(OH)2D3 decreased PHEX mRNA and PHEX protein in primary osteoblasts derived from newborn mouse calvaria as well as MC3T3-E1 cells, a mouse osteoblastic cell line, in vitro (29Ecarot B. Desbarats M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PHEX mRNA expression in tibial bone was suppressed by 1α,25(OH)2D3 administration in 5/6 nephrectomized rats in vivo (30Brewer A.J. Canaff L. Hendy G.F. Tennenhouse H.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F739-F748Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is plausible that administration of 1α,25(OH)2D3 up-regulated circulating FGF-23 levels in 5/6 nephrectomized rats at least partly by down-regulation of PHEX expression in bones. FGF-23 induces hypophosphatemia by inhibiting both renal and intestinal Pi absorption by suppressing NaPi-IIa and -IIb production (3Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S.

Yamashita T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). FGF-23 also inhibits 1α,25(OH)2D3 production in renal proximal tubules, which results in the reduction of intestinal Pi absorption and PTH secretion. On the contrary, 1α,25(OH)2D3 induced an increase in circulating FGF-23, and also loss of vitamin D signaling in VDRKO mice led to very low serum FGF-23. In 5/6 nephrectomized rats, serum phosphorus controlled by dietary phosphorus content positively correlated with serum FGF-23, suggesting an increase in serum phosphorus induces FGF-23 production. We propose that a feedback loop exists between serum phosphorus, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and FGF-23, in which the novel phosphate-regulating bone-kidney axis would be integrated with the parathyroid hormone-vitamin D3 axis in regulating phosphate homeostasis.

The mechanisms underlying the cancer-protective effects of these naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds, however, remain elusive. Based on our previous finding that the cytotoxic effect of the flavanol epigallocatechin-3-gallate on prostate cancer cells correlates with its ability to inhibit fatty acid synthase (FAS, a key lipogenic enzyme overexpressed in many human cancers), we examined the anti-lipogenic effects of a panel of 18 naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds. In addition to epigallocatechin-3-gallate, five other flavonoids, more particularly luteolin, quercetin, kaempferol, apigenin, and taxifolin, also markedly inhibited cancer cell lipogenesis. Interestingly, in both prostate and breast cancer cells, a remarkable dose-response parallelism was observed between flavonoid-induced inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, inhibition of cell growth, and induction of apoptosis. In support for a role of fatty acid synthesis in these effects, the addition of exogenous palmitate, the end product of FAS, markedly suppressed the cytotoxic effects of flavonoids. Taken together, these findings indicate that the potential of flavonoids to induce apoptosis in cancer cells is strongly associated with their FAS inhibitory properties, thereby providing a new mechanism by which polyphenolic compounds may exert their cancer-preventive and antineoplastic effects.

Flavonoids constitute the largest and most important group of polyphenolic compounds in plants. They are widely distributed in many frequently consumed beverages and food products of plant origin such as fruit, vegetables, wine, tea, and cocoa (1Beecher G.R. J.

The molecular structure of flavonoids consists of two aromatic rings (A ring and B ring), that are linked by a three-carbon bridge (Fig. 1). Depending on their oxidation state and functional groups, flavonoids are further divided in six subclasses: flavones, flavanones, flavanols, flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanidins (1Beecher G.R.

N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 957: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Furthermore, also consumption of olives and/or olive oil, containing relatively large amounts of the flavones luteolin and apigenin, has been associated with a lower risk to develop cancer of the breast, ovary, and colon (20Stoneham M.

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 381-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 6Birt D.F. Hendrich S. Wang W. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 90: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism by which these compounds exert their cancer-protective effects are poorly understood. Recently, we have shown that the flavanol EGCG, 1The abbreviations used are: EGCG, epigallocatechin-3-gallate; EC, epicatechin; ECG, epicatechin-3-gallate; EGC, epigallocatechin; FAS, fatty acid synthase; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA.1The abbreviations used are: EGCG, epigallocatechin-3-gallate; EC, epicatechin; ECG, epicatechin-3-gallate; EGC, epigallocatechin; FAS, fatty acid synthase; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA. the main polyphenolic compound of green tea, inhibited fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity and lipogenesis in prostate cancer cells, an effect that was strongly associated with growth arrest and cell death (23Brusselmans K. De Schrijver E. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). FAS is a key metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of long chain fatty acids (24Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In contrast to most normal tissues, which show low FAS expression, expression of FAS is markedly increased in various human cancers, including cancer of the prostate, breast, ovary, endometrium, colon, and lung (25Swinnen J.V.

Pathol. 2000; 31: 1068-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of FAS occurs early in tumor development and is further enhanced in more advanced tumors. In addition, high FAS expression levels often predict a poor outcome for cancer patients. We have previously demonstrated that RNA interference-mediated silencing of FAS severely inhibits lipogenesis and induces growth arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (28De Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3799-3804PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, blockage of FAS by the chemical inhibitors cerulenin and C75 also inhibits proliferation and is cytotoxic for various tumor cell lines in vitro and/or tumor xenografts in vivo (29Pizer E.S.

In the present work we have investigated whether, in addition to EGCG, other naturally occurring flavonoids also inhibit FAS activity and lipogenesis in cancer cells and whether this inhibition correlates with the effects of these polyphenolic compounds on cancer cell growth and survival.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The human LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Nonmalignant skin fibroblasts were kindly provided by Prof. Dr. J. J. Cassiman (Center for Human Genetics, K. U. Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). Cells were cultured as previously described (23Brusselmans K. De Schrijver E. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, apigenin, taxifolin, eriodictyol, naringenin, myricetin, galangin, flavone, 3-OH-flavone, genistein, resveratrol, (+/–)catechin, (–)-epicatechin (EC), (–)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (–)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) and (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) were purchased from Sigma; cells were exposed to various concentrations (0–100 μm) of polyphenols or to vehicle (Me2SO) for the indicated periods. For culturing cells in the presence of palmitate-bovine serum albumin complex, palmitate (Sigma) was first complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen) as described (34Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 volumes of a 4% bovine serum albumin solution in 0.9% NaCl were added to 1 volume of 5 mm palmitate in ethanol and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to obtain a 1 mm stock solution of bovine serum albumin-complexed palmitate.RNA Interference—Transfection of LNCaP cells with small interfering (si) RNA was carried out as previously described (28De Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3799-3804PubMed Google Scholar); siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The siRNA oligonucleotides targeting FAS were: sense, CCCUGAGAUCCCAGCGCUGdTdT; antisense, CAGCGCUGGGAUCUCAGGGdTdT. As a control, the GL2 luciferase siRNA was used as previously described (35Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8081) Google Scholar). Transfections of LNCaP cells were performed with 0.66 nmol of siRNA duplex in 60-mm dishes (0.4 × 106 cells/dish) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Morphological analysis and [2-14C]acetate incorporation assays were performed 72 h after transfection.[2-14C]Acetate Incorporation Assay and TLC Analysis—After 1 or 20 h of exposure to polyphenols or at 72 h after transfection with siRNA, 2-14C-labeled acetate (57 mCi/mmol; 2 μCi/dish; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the culture medium of LNCaP cells, MDA-MB-231 cells, or fibroblasts. After 4 h of incubation, culture medium and cells were collected, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.8 ml of PBS. Lipids were extracted using the Bligh Dyer method as previously described (36Swinnen J.V. Van Veldhoven P.P. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4468-4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); [2-14C]acetate incorporation into cellular lipids was quantitated by scintillation counting. Obtained results were normalized for sample protein content. For TLC analysis, lipid extracts and standards were spotted on silica gel G plates (Merck) and developed in hexane-diethyl ether-acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) for separation of neutral lipids or in chloroform-methanol-acetic acid (65: 25:10, v/v/v) for separation of phospholipids. Lipid samples and standards were visualized by iodine vapor. The different lipid fractions were quantitated using a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized for sample protein content.FAS Activity Assay (in Vitro)—Enzymatic activity of FAS was measured on cellular extracts of LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were harvested, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5); thereafter, sample protein content was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were preincubated with polyphenolic compounds (100 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in 2.5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7). Subsequently, 20 μl of reaction mix (2.5 mm NADPH, 1.25 mm acetyl-CoA, 1.25 mm malonyl-CoA, and 0.02 mm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (60 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) was added, and samples were incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold 1 m HCl/methanol (6:4, v/v), fatty acids were extracted with petroleum benzin, and incorporation of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was analyzed by scintillation counting.Immunoblot Analysis—After exposure to different concentrations of polyphenols, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a reducing buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.715 m 2-mercaptoethanol and 8.7% glycerol. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA assay. Generation of antibodies against FAS and Western blot procedures using antibodies against FAS, cytokeratin 18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA) have been previously described (28De Schrijver E.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 642-646PubMed Google Scholar).Proliferation/Cytotoxicity Assay—LNCaP cells, MDA-MB-231 cells, or fibroblasts were treated with different doses of polyphenolic compounds. After 0, 24, 48 or 72 h of exposure, cells were collected, and cell growth and viability were determined using a trypan blue dye exclusion assay as described previously (23Brusselmans K. De Schrijver E. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Hoechst Staining—LNCaP cells were plated in Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells per chamber, incubated overnight, and treated with polyphenolic compounds. After 24 h of exposure, Hoechst dye 33342 (Sigma) was added to the culture medium of living cells; changes in nuclear morphology were detected by fluorescence microscopy using a filter for Hoechst 33342 (365 nm).Statistical Analysis—Obtained results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using a Tukey test as post-test. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data are the means ± S.D.RESULTSComparative Analysis of the Inhibitory Activity of Naturally Occurring Polyphenolic Compounds toward Cancer Cell Lipogenesis—To investigate the ability of polyphenolic compounds to inhibit lipogenesis, LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with different polyphenols (25 μm) for 5 h, and incorporation of 2-14C-labeled acetate into cellular lipids was quantitated. Of 18 naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds (Fig. 1), luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol inhibited lipogenesis by more than 50% (Table I). Apigenin, taxifolin, and EGCG also displayed inhibitory activity on lipogenesis, but their effect was less pronounced. No significant inhibitory effects were observed for the other compounds at a concentration of 25 μm (Table I).Table IInhibitory activity of polyphenolic compounds (25 μm) on LNCaP cell lipogenesis (5-h exposure)Polyphenol class% Lipogenesis of controlControl (0 μm)100.0 ± 9.6LuteolinFlavone24.0 ± 9.0aSignificantly different from control cells (0 μm) by the Tukey test.QuercetinFlavonol38.1 ± 7.0aSignificantly different from control cells (0 μm) by the Tukey test.KaempferolFlavonol49.2 ± 8.3aSignificantly different from control cells (0 μm) by the Tukey test.ApigeninFlavone68.4 ± 6.7aSignificantly different from control cells (0 μm) by the Tukey test.TaxifolinFlavanone74.6 ± 11.4aSignificantly different from control cells (0 μm) by the Tukey test.EGCGFlavanol80.7 ± 6.7aSignificantly different from control cells (0 μm) by the Tukey test.GalanginFlavonol82.5 ± 12.5ECGFlavanol85.1 ± 9.3MyricetinFlavonol87.2 ± 5.1EriodictyolFlavanone87.9 ± 11.6CatechinFlavanol91.6 ± 9.0NaringeninFlavanone92.3 ± 8.4GenisteinIsoflavone94.3 ± 8.1ECFlavanol95.5 ± 7.7ResveratrolStilbene96.9 ± 5.73-OH-flavoneFlavonol98.3 ± 7.1EGCFlavanol99.3 ± 4.9FlavoneFlavone99.3 ± 8.7a Significantly different from control cells (0 μm) by the Tukey test. Open table in a new tab Because luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol turned out to be the most efficient inhibitors, the effects of these compounds on lipogenesis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were studied in more detail. EGCG, the main polyphenolic compound in green tea which was previously demonstrated to inhibit lipogenesis in LNCaP cells (23Brusselmans K. De Schrijver E. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and 3-OH-flavone, a polyphenol that did not affect cancer cell lipogenesis, were used as a positive and negative reference, respectively. 2-14C-Labeled acetate incorporation assays showed that after 5 h of exposure of LNCaP cells to luteolin, quercetin, or kaempferol, a significant decrease in lipid synthesis was already evident at a concentration of 6 μm. Higher concentrations further reduced lipogenesis in a dose-dependent way (Fig. 2A). A further decline was observed after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 2B). At 12 μm, luteolin reduced lipogenesis to less than 10% of the control levels, thereby making luteolin the most efficient inhibitor of the studied flavonoids. EGCG was clearly less active (Fig. 2, A–B). Luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol had similar inhibitory effects on lipid synthesis in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2C), a breast cancer cell line that displays about 50–70% of the lipogenic activity observed in LNCaP cells. 3-OH-flavone did not affect lipid synthesis in LNCaP or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2, A–C), even not at a concentration of 100 μm (data not shown).Fig. 2Flavonoid-mediated inhibition of lipid biosynthesis in cancer cells.A–B, [2-14C]acetate incorporation into cellular lipids of LNCaP cells after 5 h (A) or 24 h (B) exposure to 3-OH-flavone (3-OH-flav), luteolin (lut), quercetin (que), kaempferol (kae), or EGCG. C, [2-14C]acetate incorporation into cellular lipids of MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 h exposure to 3-OH-flavone, luteolin, quercetin, or kaempferol. D, impact of flavonoids on the enzymatic activity of FAS in vitro. Protein extracts from LNCaP cells were incubated with vehicle (ctrl) or with 100 μm 3-OH-flavone, kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin, or EGCG, and FAS activity was measured by quantitation of 2-14C-labeled malonyl-CoA incorporation into fatty acids in vitro.

A concentration of 100 μm luteolin reduced the in vitro FAS activity to 14%, and 100 μm quercetin caused a reduction to 19%, whereas 100 μm kaempferol caused a reduction to 32% (Fig. 2D). EGCG decreased enzymatic FAS activity to less than 1% at a concentration of 100 μm, thereby making it, at least in vitro, a more efficient inhibitor of FAS enzymatic activity than luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol (Fig. 2D). In agreement with its effects on cancer cell lipogenesis, 100 μm 3-OH-flavone did not inhibit enzymatic activity of FAS (Fig. 2D). Western blot analysis for FAS revealed that luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol did not influence FAS protein levels in LNCaP cells (data not shown), thereby confirming that inhibition of lipid synthesis was the direct result of inhibition of enzymatic FAS activity and was not caused by decreased FAS expression. Consistent with their FAS inhibitory effect, inhibition of lipogenesis by luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol affected the synthesis of phospholipids (including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and sphingomyelin) and of triglycerides in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3; data for quercetin are shown; similar results were obtained for luteolin and kaempferol) and MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown); 3-OH-flavone had no effect on any of these lipid classes (Fig. 3). As previously observed for EGCG and cerulenin (23Brusselmans K. De Schrijver E. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Int. J.

Wyke J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 512: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol also decreased the synthesis of cholesterol in LNCaP (Fig. 3) and MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). Cholesterol synthesis, however, accounts for less than 10% of the total lipogenic activity in LNCaP and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, whereas ∼75 and 15% of the lipogenic activity in these cells represents phospholipid and triglyceride synthesis, respectively.Fig. 3Effect of flavonoid-induced inhibition of lipogenesis on different lipid classes of LNCaP cells. After 20 h of exposure to 3-OH-flavone or quercetin, LNCaP cells were exposed to [2-14C]acetate for 4 h. After lipid extraction, different lipid species were separated by TLC, and incorporation of [2-14C]acetate was quantitated by scintillation counting.

Similar changes of LNCaP cell phenotype were observed after specific RNAi-mediated FAS inhibition (which caused a reduction of lipogenesis to 34% of the normal levels, i.e. a FAS inhibitory effect comparable with that of 6–12 μm luteolin or 25–50 μm quercetin or kaempferol) (Fig. 4), suggesting that the changes in cell morphology induced by luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol were direct results of FAS inhibition. These phenotypical changes were not observed in 3-OH-flavone-treated LNCaP cells (not shown).Fig. 4Microscopic analysis of LNCaP cell morphology after treatment with flavonoids (24 h) or FAS siRNA (72 h). Compared with control cells (A), luteolin (12 μm) (B), and kaempferol (25 μm) (C) induced morphological changes in LNCaP cells, similar to those induced by FAS inhibition via RNAi (D), including loss of cell-cell contacts and formation of astrocyte-like extrusions.

Already at a concentration of 6 μm, growth inhibition was observed. For all three flavonoids, a remarkable parallelism was observed between the dose-response curves reflecting growth inhibition and those reflecting inhibition of lipogenesis. 3-OH-flavone also slightly inhibited proliferation of LNCaP cells and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5), but only at high concentrations (25–50 μm).Fig. 5Flavonoids inhibit cancer cell proliferation. LNCaP cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with different concentrations of luteolin, quercetin, kaempferol, or 3-OH-flavone.

Remarkably, for all three flavonoids, induction of cell death occurred at flavonoid concentrations that also inhibited lipid synthesis.

MyoD is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediated by different E3 ubiquitin ligases not identified as yet. Here we report that MyoD interacts with Atrogin-1/MAFbx (MAFbx), a striated muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase dramatically up-regulated in atrophying muscle. A core LXXLL motif sequence in MyoD is necessary for binding to MAFbx. MAFbx associates with MyoD through an inverted LXXLL motif located in a series of helical leucine-charged residue-rich domains. Mutation in the LXXLL core motif represses ubiquitination and degradation of MyoD induced by MAFbx. Overexpression of MAFbx suppresses MyoD-induced differentiation and inhibits myotube formation. Finally the purified recombinant SCFMAFbx complex (SCF, Skp1, Cdc53/Cullin 1, F-box protein) mediated MyoD ubiquitination in vitro in a lysine-dependent pathway. Mutation of the lysine 133 in MyoD prevented its ubiquitination by the recombinant SCFMAFbx complex. These observations thus demonstrated that MAFbx functions in ubiquitinating MyoD via a sequence found in transcriptional coactivators. These transcriptional coactivators mediate the binding to liganded nuclear receptors. We also identified a novel protein-protein interaction module not yet identified in F-box proteins. MAFbx may play an important role in the course of muscle differentiation by determining the abundance of MyoD.

MAFbx may play an important role in the course of muscle differentiation by determining the abundance of MyoD. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis regulates protein abundance and serves a central regulatory function in many biological processes (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination of the target protein is mediated by the ubiquitin ligases, which represent a diverse family of proteins and protein complexes. The SCF (Skp1, Cdc53/Cullin1, F-box protein) and SCF-like complexes are the largest family of ubiquitin ligases. They ubiquitinate a broad range of proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction, transcription, and development (2Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: 61-70PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates involves three components that participate in a cascade of ubiquitin transfer reactions, an ubiquitin-activation enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; LCD, leucine-charged domain; wt, wild type; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α. an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and an ubiquitin ligase (E3) that acts at the last step of the cascade (3Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The specificity of the SCF complexes derives of the variable components called the F-box proteins that serve as receptor for the target protein (4Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 2: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Myogenic differentiation is under the control of the MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (MRFs) that includes MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4/herculin/Myf-6 (5Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 1: 1-8Crossref Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Activation of muscle-specific genes by the MRFs occurs through their heterodimerization with the E protein basic helix-loop-helix factors that bind to an E-box DNA consensus sequence (CANNTG) to transactivate muscle specific genes and to efficiently convert non-muscle cells to a myogenic lineage (7Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). p300/CBP and P/CAF coactivators have acetyltransferase activities and regulate transcription, cell cycle progression, and differentiation. They are both required for MyoD activity and muscle differentiation (8Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In contrast, histone deacetylation inhibits gene activation, and the interaction between histone deacetylase 1 and MyoD prevents premature activation of the myogenic program in growing myoblasts (10Mal A. Sturniolo M. Schiltz R.L. Ghosh M.K. Harter M.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The MRFs contain several functionally distinct domains responsible for transcriptional activation, chromatin remodeling, DNA binding, nuclear localization, and heterodimerization (11McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 5: 497-504Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MyoD induces myogenesis involves both the withdrawal from cell cycle and the activation of muscle-specific gene expression. Recent data demonstrate a direct link between MyoD and cell cycle regulation (12Zhang J-M. Wei Q. Zhao X. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J-M. Zhao X. Wei Q. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6983-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and also its requirement for myogenic stem cell function in adult skeletal muscle (14Megeney L.A. Kablar B. Garrett K. Anderson J.E Rudnicki M.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) where MyoD protein levels decline from postnatal stage onward (15Asakura A. Seale P. Girgis-Gabardo A. Rudnicki M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 1: 123-134Crossref Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Accurate synchronization of dividing myoblasts revealed that MyoD is subject to specific cell cycle-dependent regulation (16Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Tintignac L.A. Leibovitch M.P. Kitzmann M. Fernandez A. Ducommun B. Meijer L. Leibovitch S.A. Exp.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MyoD at serine 200 plays a crucial role in modulating its half-life and transcriptional activity during myoblast proliferation (19Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Kitzmann M. Vandromme M. Schaeffer V. Carnac G. Labbe J-C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Linking this phosphorylation to the cell cycle-dependent drop in MyoD protein before S phase leads to a mechanism implicating Cdk2-cyclin E and up-regulation of its inhibitors (p57kip2 and p21cip1) in the tight control of MyoD levels and subsequent myoblast cell cycle progression or exit into differentiation (17Tintignac L.A. Leibovitch M.P. Kitzmann M. Fernandez A. Ducommun B. Meijer L. Leibovitch S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Reynaud E.G. Pelpel K Guillier M Leibovitch M-P. Leibovitch S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7621-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition MyoD phosphorylated on serine 200 is degraded by the proteasome and CDC34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activity (E2) (19Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Altogether these findings indicate that targeted degradation of MyoD following Cdk2-cyclin E phosphorylation of serine 200 during G1 to S phase progression in myoblasts and identify a mechanism that probably requires a SCF complex. On the other hand, recent data have shown that MyoD could be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway independently of its phosphorylation state suggesting that attachment of ubiquitin implies other(s) recognition signal(s) and/or mechanism(s). Up-regulation of the cyclin/Cdk inhibitor p57Kip2 stabilizes MyoD by direct interaction (22Reynaud E.G. Leibovitch M.P. Tintignac L.A.J. Pelpel K. Guillier M. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18767-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas specific DNA binding stabilizes MyoD (23Abu-Hatoum O.A Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro MyoD is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in HeLa nucleoplasm (24Floyd Z.E. Trausch-Azar J.S. Reinstein E. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and in differentiated myotubes, MyoD protein turns over rapidly as observed in myoblasts (25Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Altogether these data indicate that MyoD is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediated by different E3 ubiquitin ligases not identified as yet. To determine candidate molecular mediators of MyoD ubiquitination, we employed a modified version of the yeast two-hybrid screen of the human skeletal muscle library to identify proteins that first interact with human Skp1. This Skp1-enriched cDNA library was then screened to isolate F-box proteins that bind MyoD and identify positive clones. Here, we report the identification of human Atrogin-1/MAFbx (MAFbx), an E3 ubiquitin ligase up-regulated during skeletal muscle atrophy that interacts with MyoD via a novel leucine-rich interaction interface. This interface found in transcriptional coactivators mediates the binding to liganded nuclear receptors and promote its degradation. We demonstrated that the purified recombinant SCFMAFbx complex mediated ubiquitination of MyoD in vitro in a manner that appeared to depend on the presence of the lysine 133. This lysine 133 has been previously shown to play a critical role in the nuclear degradation of MyoD (26Batonnet S Leibovitch M-P. Tintignac L.A. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5413-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that up-regulation of MAFbx in proliferating myoblasts antagonizes differentiation inducing MyoD degradation and preventing muscle specific-gene activation. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and DNA Manipulations—We used the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid Kit with a human skeletal muscle cDNA library kit (Clontech). The assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The full-length cDNA clone of human Skp1 (bait) was subcloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBT9 vector, resulting in pGBT9-Skp1. We screened 6 × 106 clones (corresponding to two library titers) and selected the positive clones as suggested by the manufacturer. The liquid β-galactosidase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The Skp1-enriched cDNA library was then screened against pGBT9-MyoD (bait) and we selected 100 positive clones. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Proligo. Deletion in the F-box of MAFbx was introduced by PvuII digestion of pACT2-MAFbx and self-annealing of the resulting plasmid. The full-length coding sequences as well as mutants of MAFbx and MyoD were amplified by PCR to introduce BamHI and EcoRI sites on each side of the open reading frame and cloned as BamHI-EcoRI fragments into the eukaryotic expression vectors. The bicistronic expression plasmid for MAFbx was carrying out first by using a 1400-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and GFP from the pMIGR vector and subcloned at the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pcDNA4T0 (Invitrogen). MAFbx and the ΔF-box mutant were then subcloned at the EcoRI site of pcDNA4-IRES-GFP. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—The mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 and the fibroblast cell line 10T1/2 were maintained in growth Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and, respectively, 20 and 15% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by using the Jet PEI (QBiogene). Luciferase activity was determined using 10-μl aliquots of cell extracts from harvested cells in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) with equivalent quantities of proteins in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Two anti-MAFbx antibodies were generated by injecting rabbits with the amino acid peptide KKRKKDMLNSKTKT(C) corresponding to amino acids 61-74 and amino acid peptide KGTDHPCTANNPE(C) corresponding to amino acids 326-339 of the human MAFbx protein. Antibodies were affinity-purified against antigenic peptides. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates in IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm sodium-orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 80 μm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium-pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) were precleaned for 30 min with protein-G beads and immunoprecipitated by using standard procedures. Immunoprecipitated proteins were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels before electrophoretic transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. For detection of MyoD-ubiquitin conjugates, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 800 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were then spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was denatured and then precipitated with anti-MyoD antibody. Western blotting was performed by using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-MyoD polyclonal (C20) and anti-HA polyclonal (Y-11) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem, anti-Troponin T monoclonal (JLT-12) was purchased from Sigma, anti-HA epitope (12CA5) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics, anti-MyoD monoclonal (5.A8) was from Pharmingen, and anti-FLAG (M2) was from Kodak. To inhibit proteasome activity, cells were treated with 50 μm MG132 (Sigma) for 2 h. In Vitro and in Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—Ubiquitination assays were determined essentially as described (17Tintignac L.A. Leibovitch M.P. Kitzmann M. Fernandez A. Ducommun B. Meijer L.

The recombinant SCFMAFbx complex was produced in insect cells by infection with baculovirus encoding HA-MAFbx-His6, Skp1, Cul1, and Rbx1, purified by nickel-agarose chromatography, and added in roughly similar amount to the reaction. In vivo ubiquitination assays have been described (26Batonnet S Leibovitch M-P. Tintignac L.A. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol.

RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma). For semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis, 1 μg of RNA was used to perform reverse transcription with Superscript II RnaseH Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and hexanucleotides (Roche Diagnostics). 2 μl of each reaction served as a template for PCR analysis. Primer pairs for the amplification of the gene products were MAFbx 5′-GGGGGAAGCTTTCAACAG-3′ forward, 5′-TGAGGCCTTTGAAGGCAG-3′ reverse and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 5′-GAGCTGAACGGGAAGCTCACT-3′ forward, 5′-TTGTCATACCAGGAAATGAGC-3′ reverse. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were treated with 5% normal goat serum and immunostained with anti-MyoD mAb (5.A8) The Texas Red-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of donkey anti-mouse IgG was used to visualize the mouse monoclonal antibodies. Identification of MAFbx as an F-box Protein Interacting with MyoD—The CDC34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activity (E2) has been implicated in MyoD ubiquitination (19Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) suggesting the requirement of an Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (E3). To identify candidate molecular mediators of MyoD ubiquitination and degradation, we used a human skeletal muscle library enriched for F-box-expressing genes and MyoD as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified two positive clones with the same open reading frame, one clone (clone R8, 1.6-kb insert) coded for 350 amino acids and the second clone (clone R5, 0.95-kb insert) encoded a polypeptide of 259 amino acids (Fig. 1A) highly homologous with the mouse F-box protein Atrogin-1/MAFbx (MAFbx) (27Gomes M.D. Lecker S.H.

The full-length human MAFbx lacks the LRR and WD40 consensus motifs known to interact with protein substrates (29Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 30Wilson J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) In addition to the PDZ motif and cytochrome c family heme binding site located in the C terminus domain, MAFbx contains two potential nuclear localization signals, a leucine zipper domain and a leucine-charged residue-rich domain (LCD), which are conserved between human, rat, and mouse species (supplemental Fig. 1). The presence of various protein-protein interacting domains suggests that MAFbx could potentially recognize different substrates. Expression of MAFbx and MyoD during C2C12 Muscle Differentiation—Because little is known about the expression of MAFbx in myogenic differentiation, we initially characterized MAFbx expression during early myogenic differentiation using the C2C12 cell line, a well defined model for ex vivo differentiation. These cells proliferate as myoblasts in high serum concentrations and can be induced to differentiate by reducing the serum concentration from 20 to 2%. Under our conditions, C2C12 myoblasts fuse into myotubes within 48-60 h with an efficiency of 75-80%. A semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the MAFbx mRNA was up-regulated (2-3-fold) in the course of C2C12 differentiation (Fig. 1B). Anti-MAFbx antibodies were developed in our laboratory (see “Experimental Procedures”), and Western blot analysis revealed that the MAFbx protein is barely detectable in myoblasts and accumulates in C2C12 myotubes. By this time, MyoD is up-regulated after switching cells into the differentiation medium (DM) and then decreases during differentiation; troponin T, a skeletal muscle marker, is observed only in differentiated cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, during the course of C2C12 differentiation MyoD and MAFbx showed a contrasting pattern of expression. Phosphorylation or Acetylation of MyoD Is Not Necessary for Interaction with MAFbx—We first determined the binding of MyoD with MAFbx in mammalian cells by using a coimmuno-precipitation assay. In C2C12 myogenic cells, endogenous MyoD coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous MAFbx, and an increase in MyoD/MAFbx association was observed when proteasome activity was inhibited (Fig. 2A). In transiently transfected 10T1/2 cells, MyoD and MAFbx have a nuclear localization, and MyoD coimmunoprecipitated with MAFbx but did not associate with other F-box proteins such as Skp2 or FBX03 (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, Myf-5, the second determination factor that is also expressed in myoblasts, did not coimmunoprecipitate with MAFbx in cotransfection experiments (supplemental Fig. 2C). Posttranslational modifications of target proteins are implicated in the recognition by certain SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligases and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (4Skowyra D. Craig K.L.

On the other hand, ubiquitination of substrates requires direct binding of specific domains of the F-box protein and the substrate (33Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M. Hoffman M.A. Kim T.Y. Huang L.E.

Surprisingly MyoD-wt and the MyoD mutants all interacted with MAFbx suggesting that major phosphorylation and acetylation are not implicated in MyoD/MAFbx interaction (supplemental Fig. 2D). Altogether, these results show that independent of the phosphorylation and/or acetylation, MyoD and MAFbx form complexes in vivo LCD of MAFbx Interacts with a Highly Conserved LXXLL Motif in MyoD—The results outlined above show that MAFbx binds to MyoD, but the lack of known protein binding motifs found in other F-box proteins prompted us to search for regions of MAFbx important for substrate recognition. The domains of both proteins required for interaction were mapped by in vivo protein binding experiments. 10T1/2 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding MyoD-wt and/or MyoD deletion or substitution mutants together with MAFbx, and the immunoprecipitates were then examined for the presence of MAFbx by an immunoblot analysis (supplemental Fig. 3A). Stable association between MyoD and MAFbx was mediated by the helix 2 domain of MyoD (Fig. 2B). Sequence analysis of amino acids 143-172 revealed a LXXLL consensus sequence that mediates protein-protein interactions and was originally found in a variety of coactivators (34Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of this motif to the interaction, we mutated the leucine 164 to glutamine (L164Q) and tested its interaction with MAFbx as described above. Mutation in the LXXLL motif was sufficient to reduce MyoD interaction with MAFbx (Fig. 2C). In vivo reciprocal binding experiments were performed to define the sequence in MAFbx that contributes to complex formation with MyoD. To avoid confusion between the IgG band and the MAFbx mutants, we used a mammalian expression plasmid encoding GST-MyoD (supplemental Fig. 3B). Overlapping deletion mutant analysis showed that the central part of MAFbx (amino acids 140-222) was implicated in the MyoD binding (Fig. 2D). This region contains a LCD that shares a consensus inverted LXXLL motif flanked by LXXL and LXXXL sequences highly conserved in mammals. We found that mutation (L169Q) in the inverted LXXLL motif dramatically reduced the binding to MyoD (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrated that complex formation depends upon the integrity of the inverted LXXLL motif in MAFbx. Accelerated Degradation of MyoD by MAFbx—The effect of MAFbx expression on the MyoD half-life was investigated after blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide and/or in pulse-chase experiments. As expected the empty vector did not affect MyoD stability (half-life was to ∼45 min). Overexpression of MAFbx resulted in enhanced degradation of MyoD by decreasing its half-life to ∼30 min. By contrast Skp2 and/or FBL5 was ineffective on MyoD degradation. In cells with compromised SCFMAFbx activity, MyoD degradation was affected; the MAFbx mutant ΔF-box (deleted of the F-box domain required for Skp1 interaction) showed an increased MyoD half-life (∼150 min) (Fig. 3A). In cells with compromised LXXLL motif interaction between MyoD and MAFbx, the degradation rate of MyoD remained similar to that of MyoD-wt alone (Fig. 3, B and C). It appears that destabilization of MyoD is increased in cells with SCFMAFbx E3-ligase activity and highlights the LXXLL motif that mediates MyoD/MAFbx interaction. Overexpression of MAFbx in C2C12 myotubes results in atrophy (28Bodine S.C. Latres E. Baumhueter S. Lai V.K. Nunez L. Clarke B.A Poueymirou W.T Panaro F.J Erqian N. Dharmarajan K. Pan Z.Q. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (2665) Google Scholar), and on the other hand, during the course of C2C12 differentiation MyoD and MAFbx showed a contrasting pattern of expression (Fig. 1C). Together these data suggested that MAFbx-inducing C2C12 atrophy implicated MyoD degradation. We observed that increasing amounts of MAFbx on MyoD-mediated myogenic conversion of 10T1/2 cells caused a gradual decrease of MCK-Luc activity and MyoD protein abundance (Fig. 4A). To locate and assess the effect of MAFbx overexpression on MyoD proteins, C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with pcDNA4-MAFbx-IRES-GFP or the mutant MAFbx-ΔF-box-IRES-GFP, and 48 h later C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 4B) were stained with anti-MyoD antibodies and/or induced to differentiate in low serum medium (Fig. 4C). In C2C12 myoblasts transfected with MAFbx (green), MyoD staining was selectively lost, whereas in C2C12 myoblasts transfected with the empty vector and/or the ΔF-box mutant, MyoD staining was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). Furthermore overexpression of MAFbx-IRES-GFP was never observed during myotube formation, and the great majority of the transfected cells were lost. The few MAFbx-expressing C2C12 myoblasts (green) maintained the mononucleated, non-differentiated phenotype and did not express MyoD. In contrast, C2C12 cells transfected with empty vector expressed MyoD and fused into multinucleated myotubes, with a higher level in the presence of the mutant ΔF-box (Fig. 4C). Altogether these data suggest that high levels of MAFbx are incompatible with MyoD protein expression. Mediation of MyoD Ubiquitinat"
https://openalex.org/W1985685740,"Previously, we reported that fluid-phase endocytosis of native LDL by PMA-activated human monocytederived macrophages converted these macrophages into cholesterol-enriched foam cells (Kruth, H. S., Huang, W., Ishii, I., and Zhang, W. Y. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 34573-34580). Uptake of fluid by cells can occur either by micropinocytosis within vesicles (<0.1 μm diameter) or by macropinocytosis within vacuoles (∼0.5-5.0 μm) named macropinosomes. The current investigation has identified macropinocytosis as the pathway for fluid-phase LDL endocytosis and determined signaling and cytoskeletal components involved in this LDL endocytosis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, which inhibits macropinocytosis but does not inhibit micropinocytosis, completely blocked PMA-activated macrophage uptake of fluid and LDL. Also, nystatin and filipin, inhibitors of micropinocytosis from lipid-raft plasma membrane domains, both failed to inhibit PMA-stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Time-lapse video phase-contrast microscopy and time-lapse digital confocal-fluorescence microscopy with fluorescent DiI-LDL showed that PMA-activated macrophages took up LDL in the fluid phase by macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis of LDL depended on Rho GTPase signaling, actin, and microtubules. Bafilomycin A1, the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor, inhibited degradation of LDL and caused accumulation of undegraded LDL within macropinosomes and multivesicular body endosomes. LDL in multivesicular body endosomes was concentrated >40-fold over its concentration in the culture medium consistent with macropinosome shrinkage by maturation into multivesicular body endosomes. Macropinocytosis of LDL taken up in the fluid phase without receptor-mediated binding of LDL is a novel endocytic pathway that generates macrophage foam cells. Macropinocytosis in macrophages and possibly other vascular cells is a new pathway to target for modulating foam cell formation in atherosclerosis. Previously, we reported that fluid-phase endocytosis of native LDL by PMA-activated human monocytederived macrophages converted these macrophages into cholesterol-enriched foam cells (Kruth, H.

Macropinocytosis of LDL taken up in the fluid phase without receptor-mediated binding of LDL is a novel endocytic pathway that generates macrophage foam cells. Macropinocytosis in macrophages and possibly other vascular cells is a new pathway to target for modulating foam cell formation in atherosclerosis. Macrophage foam cell formation is an important process in atherosclerotic plaque development. Uptake and storage of plasma lipoprotein-derived cholesterol within monocyte-derived macrophages affects macrophage functions in ways that influence plaque development and stability. Whether macrophage storage of cholesterol contributes to cholesterol retention within the plaque or facilitates its removal from plaques remains to be determined (1Kruth H.S. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 633-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Kruth H.S. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D429-D455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In either case, macrophage storage of cholesterol promotes macrophage expression of proteases and tissue factor that contribute to plaque rupture and thrombosis, respectively (3Galis Z.S.

Previously, macrophage foam cell formation was thought to occur only through uptake of modified forms of low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; N.A., numerical aperture. such as oxidized or aggregated LDL (2Kruth H.S. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D429-D455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that macrophage foam cell formation can occur through uptake of native LDL in a receptor-independent fashion (6Kruth H.S. Huang W. Ishii I. Zhang W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34573-34580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Activation of human monocyte-derived macrophages with the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulates macrophage fluid-phase endocytosis. Fluid-phase endocytosis can mediate substantial macrophage uptake of LDL when LDL levels are high at about 0.5 to 2 mg/ml. While these LDL levels are high relative to levels that saturate receptor-mediated uptake of LDL, this LDL concentration range is comparable to LDL levels that occur in the normal intima of arteries and atherosclerotic plaques (7Smith E.B. Ashall C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 754: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Smith E.B. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11: 72-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hoff H.F. Gaubatz J.W. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 1424-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, consideration of two conditions that occur in atherosclerotic plaques, activated macrophages and high LDL levels, has led to our discovery of a novel mechanism of macrophage foam cell formation mediated by fluid-phase endocytosis. Fluid-phase endocytosis by cells can occur by two pathways, uptake of fluid within either micropinocytotic vesicles (micropinocytosis) or macropinocytotic vacuoles (macropinocytosis) (10Swanson J.A. Watts C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 424-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 11Amyere M. Mettlen M. Van Der Smissen P. Platek A. Payrastre B. Veithen A. Courtoy P.J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). With both micropinocytosis and macropinocytosis, solute uptake is directly proportional to the volume of fluid internalized and solute concentration. During macropinocytosis, plasma membrane ruffling occurs that can lead to membrane fusion of the plasma membrane with itself. This membrane fusion envelops extracellular fluid that enters the cell within 0.5-5.0-μm vacuoles formed during the ruffling and membrane fusion process. Ruffling of surface membranes is necessary for macropinocytosis and is mediated by many Ras superfamily GTPases (12West M.A. Prescott A.R. Eskelinen E.L. Ridley A.J. Watts C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 839-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 13Garrett W.S. Chen L.M. Kroschewski R. Ebersold M. Turley S. Trombetta S. Galan J.E. Mellman I. Cell. 2000; 102: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, ruffling alone is not sufficient for macropinocytosis as other signaling factors including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the Rab family GTPase, Rah/Rab34, have been implicated in the closure of ruffles to form macropinosomes (14Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 15Sun P. Yamamoto H. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Endo T. J. Biol.

Macropinocytosis occurs in amoeba and mammalian cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. Macropinocytosis is either constitutive as in dendritic cells or can be induced in different cells by PMA, growth factors, and modified LDLs (10Swanson J.A. Watts C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 424-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 11Amyere M. Mettlen M. Van Der Smissen P. Platek A. Payrastre B. Veithen A. Courtoy P.J. Int. J. Med.

Micropinocytosis can occur in clathrin-associated, caveolin-associated, or non-clathrin-caveolin-associated vesicles (no larger than ∼0.1 um). The latter two modes of micropinocytosis usually occur in lipid-raft domains of the plasma membrane (19Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Macropinocytosis is an actin-dependent endocytic process while micropinocytosis generally is an actin-independent process. In the current investigation, we have sought to identify the endocytic pathway that mediates PMA-stimulated macrophage uptake of native LDL. Through analysis of cytoskeletal and signaling dependence of LDL uptake, and microscopic analysis of macrophages, we have identified actin-dependent macropinocytosis mediated by Rho-GTPase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling as the mechanism of LDL-induced foam cell formation in PMA-activated macrophages. Culture of Human Monocyte-derived Macrophages—Human monocytes were purified with counterflow centrifugal elutriation of mononuclear cells obtained by monocytopheresis of normal human donors. The monocytes were cultured in pooled human AB, heat-inactivated serum (Pel-Freez) as described previously (20Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except that 0.4 × 106 monocytes/cm2 were initially seeded in 12-well (22-mm diameter) culture plates (Plastek C from MatTek). For experiments, 2-week-old monocyte-derived macrophage cultures were rinsed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with the indicated additions to RPMI 1640 medium without serum. Preparation of LDL for Use in Experiments—Before use, human LDL (Intracel) and DiI-LDL (Molecular Probes) were dialyzed against 1 liter of 0.15 m sodium chloride and 0.3 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) for 12 h at 4 °C, then against RPMI 1640 medium (2 changes, 1 liter/each change) for 24 h. Human 125I-LDL (Biomedical Technologies) was dialyzed against 0.15 m sodium chloride and 0.3 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) over 36 h at 4 °C (3 changes, 1 liter/each change). All dialysis was carried out with Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (10,000 molecular weight cut-off). After dialysis, lipoproteins were sterilized by passage through a 0.45-μm (pore size) low protein binding filter (Gelman Acrodisc). 125I-LDL specific activity was adjusted to 2.25 × 10-5 μCi/ng by adding unlabeled LDL. LDL concentration is expressed in terms of protein. Assay of Cholesterol and Protein Contents of Macrophages—After incubations, macrophages were rinsed three times each with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) plus Mg2+, Ca2+, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then DPBS plus Mg2+ and Ca2+. Macrophages were harvested from wells by scraping into 1 ml of distilled water, and then processed as described previously (20Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from an aliquot of cell suspension using the Folch method (21Folch J. Lees M. Sloan Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cholesterol content of macrophages was determined according to the fluorometric method of Gamble et al. (22Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage protein content was determined on another aliquot of cell suspension by the method of Lowry et al. using BSA as a standard (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein contents of cultures generally ranged between 0.2 and 0.3 mg/well. Assays of 125I-LDL Cell Association and Degradation—Macrophage cell-association and degradation of 125I-LDL were determined according to the methods of Goldstein et al. (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein degradation was quantified by measurement of trichloroacetic acid-soluble organic iodide radioactivity in supernatants of culture media samples that were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Values obtained in the absence of cells were <5% of those values obtained with cells. These control values were subtracted. Cell-associated 125I-LDL was determined by rinsing macrophages three times with DPBS plus Ca2+, Mg2+, and 0.2% BSA, followed by three times with DPBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+ all at 4 °C. Then, macrophages were dissolved overnight in 0.1 n NaOH at 37 °C. Aliquots of cell samples were assayed for 125I radioactivity with a gamma counter. Values were subtracted for 125I radioactivity determined for wells incubated with 125I-LDL but without macrophages. These values were <1% of the cell-associated 125I-LDL. Assay of Cholesterol Esterification—[14C]Oleate-albumin complex was added at the beginning of each incubation and was prepared as described by Goldstein et al. (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) except that the final [14C]oleate concentration was increased to 800 μm to prevent the supply of [14C]oleate from becoming rate limiting. Following incubations, macrophages were rinsed, lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol, and macrophages were harvested for determination of their protein content. Cholesteryl ester synthesis was determined as described previously by quantifying [14C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters, which were separated by thin layer chromatography (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Measurement of Fluid-phase Endocytosis—Fluid-phase endocytosis was determined by incubating macrophages with 0.8 nmol/ml [3H]sucrose (specific activity of 12.3 Ci/mmol obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals). Following incubations, macrophages were rinsed 3 times with ice-cold DPBS plus Ca2+,Mg2+, and 0.2% BSA, and then three times with DPBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+. Macrophages were scraped from wells into 1 ml of distilled water. 3H radioactivity was counted in an aliquot of cells using a liquid scintillation counter. Macrophage protein content was determined with another aliquot as described above. The amount of fluid accumulated by macrophages was calculated by dividing the amount of [3H]sucrose present in the macrophages following incubations (nmol/mg cell protein) by the concentration of [3H]sucrose in the medium. Cell-free wells were incubated with [3H]sucrose in parallel incubations, and gave a background count less than 3% of the [3H]sucrose radioactivity detected in control unstimulated macrophages. Electron Microscopic Analysis of Macrophages—For standard electron microscopy, macrophages were seeded in 2-well plastic slide chambers (Lab-Tek). After incubations, macrophages were fixed, stained with ruthenium red to distinguish extracellular from intracellular membranes, and further prepared for electron microscopy (20Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For immunolabeling of LDL, macrophages were seeded in 12-well culture plates. After incubations with PMA and LDL, macrophages were fixed, embedded in LR White resin, and prepared for immunogold labeling as described previously (20Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except that 1% dry skim milk instead of 1% BSA was used to block nonspecific staining. LDL was labeled by incubating thin sections with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified rabbit anti-human LDL antibody (cat. BT-905, BTI), and then with a 1:10 dilution of 10 nm gold-conjugated goat F(ab)2 anti-rabbit IgG (BB International). For controls, the rabbit anti-human LDL antibody was substituted with the same concentration of purified rabbit IgG. This control showed no labeling. For cytochemical analysis of the fluid-phase tracer horseradish peroxidase, macrophages were preincubated 30 min with 2 mg/ml mannan, and then incubated 24 h with 1 μg/ml PMA, 0.5 μm bafilomycin A1, 1 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 2 mg/ml mannan. Mannan has been shown to block receptor-mediated but not fluid-phase uptake of horseradish peroxidase (25Lang T. de Chastellier C. Biol. Cell. 1985; 53: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After incubation, macrophages were rinsed three times with DPBS plus Ca2+, Mg2+, and 0.2% BSA, followed by three times with DPBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+ all at 4 °C. Then, macrophages were fixed 1 h with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase was localized with diaminobenzidine and macrophages were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide as previously described (25Lang T. de Chastellier C. Biol. Cell. 1985; 53: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Malmgren L. Olsson Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Next, macrophages were dehydrated with ascending concentrations of ethanol and embedded with Epon. Control macrophages incubated without horseradish peroxidase or without diaminobenzidine showed no reaction product. Time-lapse Microscopy—Time-lapse confocal fluorescence images were obtained with a ×63 planapo objective lens (1.4 N.A.) mounted on an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal system. Macrophages were cultured in dishes with 0.17-mm thick cover-glass bottoms (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Five % CO2/95% hydrated air and 37 °C were maintained in an enclosed chamber during recording from the macrophages. 12-bit confocal images of DiI-LDL fluorescence in living macrophages were acquired with 512 × 512 pixel resolution. DiI label was excited with the 568-nm line of a Krypton laser. Specimen fluorescence passed through a DP 570-620 emission filter before images were collected at a rate of one every 5 s and recorded with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital CCD camera. The confocal optical image thickness was about 1 μm. Media Cybernetics QED InVivo software was used for stack preparation and conversion to QuickTime format. Time-lapse phase-contrast video microscopy was carried out by observing macrophages grown in a T-25 flask with a ×20 long-working distance planfluor objective lens (0.4 N.A.) mounted on an Olympus L70 inverted microscope. 5% CO2/95% hydrated air and 37 °C were maintained in an enclosed chamber during recording from the macrophages. Analogue video images were recorded using a Dage-MTI CD100 camera and JVC BR9000-U VHS video recorder. Video images were captured and digitized using MGI VideoWave software and converted to Quick-Time format using QuickTime. When viewed at standard rates (i.e. 30 frames/s), the movies prepared from the time-lapse phase-contrast videos are ×120 real time, and the movies prepared from the time-lapse confocal fluorescence images are ×300 real time. Confocal Microscopic Immunocytochemical Analysis of Endocytic Pathway Markers—Macrophages, cultured on 13-mm diameter glass coverslips, were incubated 24 h with 1 μg/ml PMA, 0.5 μm bafilomycin A1, and a mixture of 0.2 mg/ml DiI-LDL and 2 mg/ml unlabeled LDL. Following incubations, macrophages were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum (also used for later rinses), and then fixed 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde all at 4 °C. After 2 rinses, macophages were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature also used for all subsequent staining steps. Next, macrophages were rinsed three times and incubated 1 h with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies (anti-human cathepsin D, clone C5, from Biogenesis; anti-human LAMP-1, clone H4A3, from the University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; anti-human EEA1, clone 14, from BD Transduction Laboratories; and negative control purified mouse IgG1 from Dako) diluted in the rinsing solution containing 0.2% Triton X-100. For this and subsequent incubations, coverslips were inverted over a drop of antibody labeling solution. After three 5-min rinses, primary mouse monoclonal antibodies were labeled for 1 h with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (2.6 μg/ml diluted in rinsing solution)(cat. A-11001, Molecular Probes). Following three rinses, coverslip cultures were mounted on glass slides with ProLong mounting medium obtained from Molecular Probes. To assess the localization of DiI-LDL and macrophage subcellular compartment markers, images were obtained with a Leica SP1 confocal system equipped with UV-Vis lasers from Leica Microsystems. Images were acquired sequentially using a 488-nm laser line and emission between 490 and 560 nm for Alexa 488 and a 568-nm laser line and emission between 575-690 nm for DiI. High-resolution (100 nm/pixel) Z-series images were obtained from the macrophages with a ×63 (1.4 N.A.) planapochromat oil-immersion objective and analyzed for colocalization. Overlay images were assembled, zoomed, and cropped using Imaris 4.0 software form Bitplane AG. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The means were determined from three culture wells for each data point. The standard error is not shown for line graphs when its value was less than the symbol height. Actin and Microtubule Dependence of LDL Uptake and Fluid Endocytosis—PMA activation of human monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated sustained fluid endocytosis in these cells as measured by the fluid-phase tracer [3H]sucrose (Fig. 1). Previously, we showed that fluid endocytosis mediated the LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation in these PMA-activated macrophages (6Kruth H.S. Huang W. Ishii I. Zhang W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34573-34580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To learn whether fluid-phase endocytosis of LDL depended on actin microfilaments and tubulin microtubules, we examined the effects of cytochalasin D and nocodazole inhibitors on this process. Inhibition of microtubule function with nocodazole decreased [3H]sucrose, 125I-LDL uptake, and macrophage cholesterol accumulation by about 50% (Table I). This result suggests that there were both microtubule-dependent and microtubule-independent pathways that functioned in fluid-phase uptake of LDL. This result was not due to an insufficient amount of nocodazole inhibitor as shown by the dose response effect of increasing nocodazole concentration producing a maximum 50% inhibition of macrophage cholesterol accumulation (Fig. 2A).Table IEffect of microtubule and actin inhibition on PMA-stimulated macrophage uptake of LDL and fluid Macrophages were incubated 1 day with 1 μg/ml PMA and either 2 mg/ml LDL, 500 μg/ml 125I-LDL, or 0.8 nmol/ml [3H]sucrose, respectively, in experiments 1, 2, and 3. In each experiment, macrophages were incubated both without and with either 10 μm nocodazole or 4 μg/ml cytochalasin D as indicated. Following incubations, media were collected, and then macrophages were rinsed and harvested to measure their protein, cholesterol, 125I-LDL, and [3H]sucrose content. Shown is the percent inhibition by each drug of PMA-stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulation in experiment 1, total 125I-LDL uptake in experiment 2, and [3H]sucrose as a measure of fluid uptake in experiment 3. Total 125I-LDL uptake was calculated as the sum of the cell-associated and degraded 125I-LDL (i.e., trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I-LDL in the media).Experiment no.Parameter measuredInhibition of PMA-stimulated uptakeNocodazoleCytochalasin D%1Cholesterol54 ± 484 ± 12125I-LDL57 ± 591 ± 63[3H]Sucrose55 ± 482 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Nocodazole inhibition of macrophage cholesterol accumulation. A, macrophages were incubated 2 days with 2 mg/ml LDL and 1 μg/ml PMA with the indicated concentration of the microtubule inhibitor, nocodazole. Following incubations, macrophages were rinsed and harvested to measure their protein and cholesterol content. The net cholesterol accumulated by PMA-activated macrophages compared with macrophages incubated with LDL alone was considered the control and assigned a value of 100%. B, macrophages were incubated for the indicated times with 2 mg/ml LDL and 1 μg/ml PMA without and with 10 μm nocodazole. Shown below the symbols is the percent inhibition by nocodazole of PMA-stimulated cholesterol accumulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Microtubules have been implicated in transport from endosomes to lysosomes in non-macrophage cell types (27Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the inhibition of fluid-phase LDL uptake represented inhibition of transport of LDL to lysosomes. Blocking LDL transport to lysosomes could secondarily impede LDL from entering macrophages. To test this possibility, we examined the time course of nocodazole inhibition of cholesterol accumulation by PMA-activated macrophages incubated with LDL. If nocodazole inhibited cholesterol accumulation only at later times, this would suggest that nocodazole inhibition of cholesterol accumulation was secondary to buildup of LDL in endosomes and not due to a primary inhibition of fluid endocytosis of LDL. Nocodazole showed similar inhibition of cholesterol accumulation at both early and later times during incubation of PMA-activated macrophages with LDL suggesting that the initial steps of fluid-phase LDL uptake were microtubule-dependent (Fig. 2B). The effect of nocodazole on 125I-LDL degradation showed additional evidence that nocodazole inhibition of LDL uptake was not due to nocodazole inhibition of endosome to lysosome transport. If nocodazole inhibited this transport, an expected result would be that macrophage degradation of 125I-LDL would be decreased, but this was not the case. While nocodazole inhibited total uptake of 125I-LDL as discussed above (Fig. 1), nocodazole did not inhibit degradation of the 125I-LDL internalized by PMA-activated macrophages, even over a 2-day incubation: 83 ± 7% was degraded without nocodazole, and 80 ± 4% was degraded with nocodazole. Thus, these results with nocodazole inhibition show evidence for both microtubule-dependent and independent fluid-phase pathways for uptake of LDL. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin function, decreased by more than 82% macrophage accumulation of [3H]sucrose, 125I-LDL, and cholesterol showing that both the microtubule-dependent and microtubule-independent fluid-phase endocytic LDL uptake pathways were actin-dependent (Table I). Myosins are the motor proteins that function together with actin to generate movement including membrane ruffling. ML-9, an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase that phosphorylates myosin II, inhibited PMA-stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulation no more than 40% in three separate experiments (data not shown). This showed that myosin II and another myosin besides myosin II, must function in fluid-phase endocytosis of LDL. ML-9 and nocodazole were synergistic in their inhibition of cholesterol accumulation indicating that they inhibited different actin-dependent fluid-phase uptake pathways for LDL (Table II).Table IISynergism of nocodazole and ML-9 inhibition of PMA-stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulation Macrophages were incubated 1 day with the indicated additions.

https://openalex.org/W2039973219,"The proteasome plays a pivotal role in controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation in a variety of normal and tumor cells. PS-341, a novel boronic acid dipeptide that inhibits 26S proteasome activity, has prominent effects in vitro and in vivo against several solid tumors. We examined its antiproliferation, proapoptotic effects using three human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines and five primary GBM explants. PS-341 markedly inhibited proliferation of GBM cell lines and explants in liquid and soft agar culture. These cells developed a G2/M cell cycle arrest with a concomitant decreased percentage of cells in S phase ( approximately 2-fold), associated with an increased expression of p21(WAF1), p27(KIP1), as well as cyclin B1 and decreased levels of CDK2, CDK4, and E2F4. About 35-40% of the cells became apoptotic when exposed to PS-341 (10(-7) M, 24-48 h) as shown by Annexin V analysis; in concert with these findings, immunobloting showed a C-terminal 85 kDa apoptotic fragment of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and a decreased level of Bcl2 and Bcl-xl. PS-341 downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in protein levels at an early time of treatment. These changes occurred irrespective of the p53 mutational status of the cells. PS-341 activated JNK/c-Jun signaling in GBM cells, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 blocked the JNK signaling to reverse partially the PS-341 growth inhibition. PS-341 (10(-7) M, 24 h) decreased nuclear NF-kappaB levels as shown by Western blot, and reduced transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB as measured by reporter assays in these transformed cells. Also, PS-341 enhanced TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and TNFalpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) induced cell death and apoptosis (two- to five-fold) in GBM cells. In summary, PS-341 has profound effects on growth and apoptosis of GBM cells, suggesting that PS-341 may be an effective therapy for patients with gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2028307977,"The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) protein kinases exert cell cycle delay, in part, by phosphorylating Checkpoint kinase (Chk) 1, Chk2, and p53. It is well established that ATR is activated following UV light-induced DNA damage such as pyrimidine dimers and the 6-(1,2)-dihydro-2-oxo-4-pyrimidinyl-5-methyl-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinediones, whereas ATM is activated in response to double strand DNA breaks. Here we clarify the activation of these kinases in cells exposed to IR, UV, and hyperoxia, a condition of chronic oxidative stress resulting in clastogenic DNA damage. Phosphorylation on Chk1(Ser-345), Chk2(Thr-68), and p53(Ser-15) following oxidative damage by IR involved both ATM and ATR. In response to ultraviolet radiation-induced stalled replication forks, phosphorylation on Chk1 and p53 required ATR, whereas Chk2 required ATM. Cells exposed to hyperoxia exhibited growth delay in G1, S, and G2 that was disrupted by wortmannin. Consistent with ATM or ATR activation, hyperoxia induced wortmannin-sensitive phosphorylation of Chk1, Chk2, and p53. By using ATM- and ATR-defective cells, phosphorylation on Chk1, Chk2, and p53 was found to be ATM-dependent, whereas ATR also contributed to Chk1 phosphorylation. These data reveal activated ATM and ATR exhibit selective substrate specificity in response to different genotoxic agents."

EPEC infection also leads to host cell death and damage to the intestinal mucosa, which is partly dependent upon EspF, one of the effectors. In this study, we demonstrate that EspF is a mitochondrial import protein with a functional mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), because EspF activity for importing into the mitochondria was abrogated by MTS deletion mutants. Substitution of the 16th leucine with glutamic acid (EspF(L16E)) completely abolished EspF activity. Infection of HeLa cells with wild type but not the espF mutant (ΔespF) decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), leading to cell death. The ΔΨm decrease and cell death were restored in cells infected with ΔespF/pEspF but not ΔespF/pEspF(L16E), suggesting that the 16th leucine in the MTS is a critical amino acid for EspF function. To demonstrate the impact of EspF in vivo, we exploited Citrobacter rodentium by infecting C3H/HeJ mice with ΔespFCR, ΔespFCR/pEspFCR, or ΔespFCR/pEspF(L16E)CR.

Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar). EPEC attaches intimately to the intestinal epithelium and effaces brush border microvilli, forming attaching/effacing (A/E) lesions. The genes required for A/E lesions to form are encoded on a pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (2Frankel G. Phillips A.D. Rosenshine I. Dougan G. Kaper J.B.

The LEE encodes a type III secretion system (TTSS), translocators (EspA, EspB, and EspD), effectors (Tir, EspG, EspF, Map, and EspH), chaperones (CesAB, CesD, CesD2, CesF, and CesT), and regulators (Ler, GrlA, and GrlR) (2Frankel G.

Importantly, these cellular responses may be a consequence of effector translocation into host cells. For example, Tir, which is translocated into the host cytoplasmic membrane, acts as the intimin receptor required for the intimate attachment involved in inducing actin pedestal structures by recruiting host proteins required for actin polymerization (16Kenny B.

Map is reportedly targeted to the host mitochondria and interferes with membrane potential (21Kenny B. Jepson M. Cell.

Immun. 2004; 72: 2288-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One of the prominent pathogenic features of EPEC during the colonization of intestinal epithelial cells is the ability to injure the epithelial barrier and eventually kill host cells, although the meaning of this biological paradoxical activity in bacterial colonization remains largely speculative. EspF seems to play an important role in this form of cell damage (13Crane J.K. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Indeed, studies indicate that though EspF is not involved in bacterial adherence to host cells, F-actin condensation, or tyrosine phosphorylation (23McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 71-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this protein plays some role in the induction of host cell death (13Crane J.K. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and decreasing transepithelial electrical resistance via the destruction of tight junctions in the intestinal epithelium (24McNamara B.P. Koutsouris A. O'Connell C.B. Nougayréde J.P. Donnenberg M.S. Hecht G. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Recently, Viswanathan et al. (25Viswanathan V.K. Lukic S. Koutsouris A. Miao R. Muza M.M. Hecht G. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicated that EspF can interact with cytokeratin 18, and Nougayrede and Donnenberg (26Nougayrède J.P. Donnenberg M.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 1097-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have shown that EspF can migrate into host mitochondria and induce host cell death. Importantly, recent studies with C. rodentium (strain DBS100) revealed that C57BL/6, NIH Swiss, or C3H/HeJ mice, infected with the espF mutant, was partly attenuated as compared with that of wild-type C. rodentium (6Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vázquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although these studies have clearly demonstrated that EspF acts as a bacterial effector, the biological relevance of each EspF activity in bacterial infection of the intestinal mucosa remains unclear. In this context, by creating a series of single amino acid substitutions in the mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) of EspF, we investigated the biological relevance of EspF activities to migration into host mitochondria, as it pertains to bacterially induced cell death, injury of the intestinal barrier, or bacterial colonization of the intestinal mucosa. One of the single amino acid substitutions at the 16th leucine in EspF abolished the ability to migrate into mitochondria, and this was also relevant to the EspF activity of initiating the mitochondrial death pathway. The single amino acid-substituted EspF mutant was created using C. rodentium, and the cloned plasmid was introduced into the espF mutant of C. rodentium in order to evaluate the impact on the pathogenesis of bacterial infection of the murine intestine. Our data provide for the first time convincing evidence that EspF activity contributes to injury of the intestinal mucosa including cell death and enhances of bacterial colonization of the intestinal mucosa. Bacterial Strains—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. We created an EPEC (strain E2348/69) espF mutant by insertion of a kanamycin (Km)-resistant cassette gene. Two DNA fragments (FL and FR) that flank the espF gene were amplified using the chromosomal gene of EPEC as a template by PCR. FL was amplified, using the primers FLP (5′-AACTGCAGGCACGTAACCAAACAGGGCTTAACGGC-3′) and FLS (5′-TCCCCCGGGTACAAGCTGCCGCCCTAGTGTAGAAGC-3′) to obtain a 1.0-kbp fragment. RF was amplified using the primers FRS (5′-TCCCCCGGGCTGCCTATGAGCAATCGAAGAAAGGG-3′) and FRB (5′-CGGGATCCCTCTCCCGACGTTAACAAAACCCCTTC-3′) to obtain a 0.9-kbp fragment. The resulting FL and FR fragments contained restriction sites for PstI-SmaI and SmaI-BamHI, which were used to clone PCR fragments into pBlue-Script II KS(+) (Stratagene) to generate pBS-FL and pBS-FR, respectively. The FL fragment obtained by digesting pBS-FL with PstI and SmaI was subcloned into pBS-FR to generate pBS-FLR. The Km-resistant cassette gene (aphA3) of pUC18K2 (27Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) was generated by digestion with SmaI and was subcloned into the SmaI site of pBS-FLR to generate pBS-FLAR. The FLAR fragment of pBS-FLAR digested with PstI and BamHI was subcloned into the temperature- and sucrose-sensitive suicide vector pCACTUS (28Tamano K. Aizawa S. Sasakawa C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid was introduced into EPEC by electroporation. The transformants were selected as described previously (29Tatsuno I. Horie M. Abe H. Miki T. Makino K. Shinagawa H. Taguchi H. Kamiya S. Hayashi T. Sasakawa C. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The selected espF mutant (ΔespF) was determined by PCR and immunoblotting. The espF and map double mutant (ΔespF-Δmap) were created using Δmap by the same method as that used for the construction of ΔespF. The espF internal deletion mutant of C. rodentium (strain EX-33) was constructed using pCACTUS, as described above, without aphA3.Fig. 1Subcellular localization of EspF secreted from EPEC into HeLa cells. A, HeLa cells were infected with the EPEC espF mutant (ΔespF) (panels a-e) or WT (panels f-o) for 3 h at an moi of 100. Then, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with antibodies specific for EspF, mitochondrial heat shock protein70 (mtHsp70) and TO-PRO3 (specific for bacteria and cell nuclei). The stained cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. High magnification views of cells infected with WT are shown in panels k-o (bar, 5 μm). B, signal intensity.

The synthetic peptide of EspF (73CPSRPAPPPPTSGQASGA89) was conjugated to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) and injected into two male New Zealand white rabbits. Subsequently, polyclonal anti-EspF antibody was purified using epoxy-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with the EspF-(73-89) peptide.

Anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase, anti-rabbit IgG-FITC, and anti-mouse IgG-TRITC were purchased from Sigma. Anti-intimin polyclonal antibody was used as described previously (30Tatsuno I. Kimura H. Okutani A. Kanamaru K. Abe H. Nagai S. Makino K. Shinagawa H. Yoshida M. Sato K. Nakamoto J. Tobe T. Sasakawa C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions—pEspF was constructed by ligating the BamHI and XhoI fragment of the espF complementary gene (from +300 bp to -116 bp of EPEC espF) into the BamHI and SalI sites of pBR322 (ampicillin-resistant). pBREspFCR and pEspFCR were constructed by ligating the BamHI and XhoI fragment of the espFCR complementary gene (from +150 bp to -174 bp of C. rodentium espF) into the BamHI and SalI sites of pBR322 and pSU18 (chloramphenicol (CP)-resistant) (31Bartolome B. Jubete Y. de la Martinez E. Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), respectively. The full-length or truncated pEGFP-EspFs and pEspF-EGFPs were constructed as follows. The various espF gene fragments amplified by PCR were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and then ligated into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-N3 or pEGFP-C2. The point mutants on pEspF-EGFP, pEspF, and pEspFCR were created with a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pMnSOD-EGFP and pTom20-EGFP were constructed, respectively, by ligation of MnSOD and tom20 fragments amplified by RT-PCR using total cDNA of HeLa cells with pEGFP-N3. Conditions of Eukaryotic Cell Culture and Bacterial Culture—HeLa and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. In the EPEC infection experiment, bacteria were grown overnight in LB broth containing 1% mannose at 37 °C with or without appropriate antibiotics (ABPC; 50 μg/ml or CP; 25 μg/ml). The bacteria were diluted 1:10 into modified EPEC adherence medium (13Crane J.K. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) consisting of DMEM supplemented with 40 mm HEPES (at pH 7.4), 2% fetal calf serum, and 1% mannose with or without antibiotics and grown with shaking at 37 °C for 2 h. Cultured bacteria were added at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 100 in the modified EPEC adherence medium. Infection of Cultured Cells with EPECs—The state of infection was followed by the method of Crane et al. (13Crane J.K. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (2 × 105 per well) were grown (on coverslips in the experiment with immunofluorescent staining) on 12-well cell culture plates in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum for 16 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Then, the culture medium was changed to modified EPEC adherence medium prior to bacterial infection. The precultured bacteria as described above were added to HeLa cells and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. After 1 h of infection, the plate was washed with PBS three times and replaced with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 40 mm HEPES (at pH 7.4), 1% mannose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without antibiotics. Immunofluorescent Staining and Immunoblotting—The cells on a coverslip were washed with PBS three times and immunostained with the appropriate antibodies as described previously (32Toyotome T. Suzuki T. Kuwae A. Nonaka T. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Toyofuku T. Hori M. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32071-32079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The coverslips were mounted on VectorShield (Vector Laboratory) for observing by a confocal laser-scanning microscopy (MicroRadiance Plus, Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting analysis was carried out as described previously (33Asahi M. Azuma T. Ito S. Ito Y. Suto H. Nagai Y. Tsubokawa M. Tohyama Y. Maeda S. Omata M. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Intracellular Expression of EspF-EGFP Fusion Proteins—COS-7 cells (∼50% confluent on 12-well plate) on coverslips were transfected with 1 μg/ml EGFP fusion protein expression vectors (pEspF-EGFP etc.) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol in the absence or presence of 10 μm valinomycin (uncoupler of mitochondrial inner membrane potential). After 16 h of incubation, the cells were treated with 100 nm MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) in DMEM (fetal calf serum-free) for 30 min in the absence or presence of 10 μm valinomycin and then washed three times with PBS. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, coverslips were washed with PBS and then immunostained. They were observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. To determine the ratio of EspF-EGFPs localized in mitochondria, 100 cells expressing EspF-EGFPs were counted (a cell whose mitochondrial EGFP fluorescent signal was stronger than the cytosolic signal was counted as being localized in mitochondria). The counts were performed three times, independently. Fractionation of Mitochondria from HeLa Cells Infected with EPEC—The mitochondrial fractionation was based on a method described previously (34Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 35Muta T. Kang D. Kitajima S. Fujiwara T. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24363-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (2 × 107) were infected with ΔespF/pEspF or ΔespF/pEspF(L16E) for 3 h and washed with PBS four times. The following procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cells collected with a scraper were gently homogenized using a Microtube homogenizer (I.S.O) in buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 25 mm HEPES-KOH (at pH7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was used as the nuclei and unbroken cell fraction, while the supernatant was centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was the crude mitochondrial fraction including bacteria, while the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, yielding a pellet (microsome fraction) and another supernatant (cytosolic fraction). To obtain highly purified mitochondria, the crude mitochondrial fraction was layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 4.5 ml of 1.6-1.0 m sucrose from the bottom and centrifuged at 82,000 × g. After 200 min, the middle band was collected and was used as a mitochondrial fraction. Measurement of Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)— HeLa cells preincubated with the ΔΨm-sensitive dye rhodamine123 (Rho123) at 2 μg/ml (36Grouselle M. Tueux O. Dabadie P. Georgescaud D. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in DMEM (fetal calf serum-free) were washed with PBS three times and then infected with EPECs at an moi of 100 as described above. After 6 h of infection, both detached (supernatant) and adherent (trypsinized) cells were collected and the non-adherent bacteria were removed by centrifugation (200 × g, for 10 min, at room temperature). The pellets were washed three times with PBS and then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. The intensity of ΔΨm for at least 10,000 cells was analyzed by FACSCalibur™ (BD Biosciences). Time Course Imaging—HeLa cells preteated with 2 μg/ml of Rho123 for 30 min were infected with wild-type EPEC (WT) at an moi of 100. After 1 h of infection, cells were washed and replaced with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 40 mm HEPES (at pH7.4), 1% mannose, and 0.1% BSA, and 1 μg/ml of EH. Then, phase contrast and fluorescent images (Rho123 for 0.5 s, and EH for 0.2 s) were taken every 10 min for up to 6.5 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 by fluorescent microscopy (Axiovert 135-SENSYS, Zeiss). LDH Assay—Cytotoxicity induced by EPEC infection was analyzed using a CytoTox 96 cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega). The extent of cytotoxicity was assayed by measuring the amount of cytosolic LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) released by cells, which represents loss of membrane integrity. The cytotoxicity was calculated as follows: experimental LDH activity/total LDH activity × 100%. Detection of Cytochrome c Release—The cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells (4 × 106) infected with EPECs at an moi of 100 at various time points were obtained by a digitonin-based subcellular fractionation technique as described previously (37Jia J. Alaoui-El-Azher M. Chow M. Chambers T.C. Baker H. Jin S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3361-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the detection of released cytochrome c, the equal amounts of cytosolic proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c, and anti-actin antibody as an internal standard control. Detection of EspF Secreted by EPEC into the Culture Medium— The secretion of EspF was analyzed by immunoblot as described previously (29Tatsuno I. Horie M. Abe H. Miki T. Makino K. Shinagawa H. Taguchi H. Kamiya S. Hayashi T. Sasakawa C. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Infection of Mice with C. rodentium—6-week old, female C3H/HeJ mice (JC1, CLEA Japan) highly susceptible to C. rodentium (38Vallance B.A. Deng W. Jacobson K. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3443-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), were housed for a week in the animal facility of the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo in accordance with guidelines drafted by the University of Tokyo. Wild-type C. rodentium (WTCR), ΔespFCR, complementary strain ΔespFCR/pEspFCR and ΔespFCR/pEspFCR (L16E) were cultured overnight in LB broth with or without 25 μg/ml of CP at 37 °C. The respective cultures (2 ml) were centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min) at room temperature, and after the supernatant had been discarded, bacteria were resuspended with 2 ml of LB broth. In order to examine the survival assay, 200 μl of bacterial suspension (∼2 × 108 cfu/head) were inoculated into ten mice by oral gavages. Survival was assessed daily over the course of the infection for up to 20-days postinfection. For determination of the numbers of adherent bacteria on the colon and colonic weight, five mice were inoculated in the same manner. At 9-days postinfection, these mice were sacrificed, and 5.5 cm of d"
https://openalex.org/W1979551416,"The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is phosphorylated at threonine 197 and serine 338. Phosphorylation of threonine 197, located in the activation loop, is required for coordinating the active site conformation and optimal enzymatic activity. However, this phosphorylation has not been widely appreciated as a regulatory site because of the apparent constitutive nature of the phosphorylation and the general resistance of the kinase to phosphatase treatment. We demonstrate here that the observed resistance of the catalytic subunit to dephosphorylation is due, in part, to the presence of the highly nucleophilic cysteine 199 located proximal to the phosphate on threonine 197. Experiments performed in vitro demonstrated that mutation (cysteine 199 to alanine), oxidation, such as by glutathionylation or internal disulfide bond formation, or alkylation of the C-subunit enhanced its ability to be dephosphorylated. Furthermore, rephosphorylation of reduced C-subunit by PDK1 created a cycle whereby the inactive kinase could be reactivated. To demonstrate that thiol modification of PKA can lead to enhanced dephosphorylation in vivo, PC12 cells were treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Such treatment resulted in complete PKA inactivation and dephosphorylation of threonine 197. This effect of NEM was contingent upon prior treatment of the cells with PKA activators, demonstrating the resistance of the holoenzyme to thiol alkylation-mediated dephosphorylation. Our results also demonstrated that NEM treatment of PC12 cells enhanced the dephosphorylation of the protein kinase Cα activation loop, suggesting a common mechanism of regulation among members of the AGC family of kinases.

PKA is essential for numerous metabolic processes and has been implicated in a wide range of cellular activities (1Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is not surprising then that PKA activity is regulated on many levels (2Johnson D.A. Akamine P. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan M. Taylor S.S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2243-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In the absence of cAMP, the kinase exists as an inactive tetramer comprised of two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits. Upon cAMP binding to the R-subunits, the active C-subunit is released. The free C-subunit can in turn be inactivated by binding the heat-stable PKI (3Wen W. Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Feramisco J. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32214-32220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown that in addition to the classical regulatory mechanisms, kinase activity is modulated by localization of the holoenzyme to subcellular locations via A-kinase anchoring proteins and by the presence of microdomains of high concentrations of cAMP (4Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 5Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Finally, the free C-subunit can be inactivated by oxidation of the highly reactive cysteine (Cys199) located in the activation loop (6Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This cysteine is capable of forming a mixed disulfide with glutathione or an internal disulfide with Cys343 located in the C terminus, thereby inactivating the kinase in a redox-sensitive manner. Many kinases, including other members of the AGC family to which PKA belongs, are also regulated themselves by phosphorylation (7Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Although many protein kinases are activated by the transient phosphorylation of their activation loops, PKA is unusual in that it appears to be assembled in an active, fully phosphorylated state and kept inactive by the bound R-subunits (8Shoji S. Titani K. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6211-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell.

The C-subunit contains two major phosphorylation sites, one at Thr197 in the activation loop and the other at Ser338 near the C terminus (8Shoji S. Titani K. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6211-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr197 is critical, as this phosphate in the activation loop is essential for coordinating the active conformation and for optimal enzymatic activity (2Johnson D.A. Akamine P.

Removal of the Thr197 phosphate has not been widely appreciated as a regulatory mechanism, as early studies demonstrated that it is not only constitutively phosphorylated, but it is also very resistant to phosphatase treatment (8Shoji S. Titani K. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6211-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bechtel P.J. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

However, although the kinase is indeed unusually resistant to phosphatase-mediated inactivation, there is now evidence that a protein phosphatase-2A-like enzyme can catalyze the removal (13Liauw S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that the C-subunit is sensitive to oxidation-mediated inactivation, and that this was because of the presence of a highly reactive cysteine (Cys199) in the activation loop. This nucleophilic residue, conserved among the AGC family of kinases (18Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar), is part of the P + 1 loop that interacts with protein substrates. Modification of Cys199 inactivates the enzyme (6Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

Although Cys199 is not involved with the catalytic mechanism, as demonstrated by the full activity of a Cys199 to alanine mutant, we wanted to determine whether this residue's proximity to phospho-Thr197 may be an important factor in keeping the kinase protected from phosphatase-mediated inactivation. We hypothesized that modification of this residue, such as through the formation of a protein-glutathione mixed disulfide, may alter the dynamics of the activation loop in such a manner that the phosphate on Thr197 is now presented more favorably as a substrate for dephosphorylation. We show here that modification of Cys199 by mutagenesis, oxidation, or alkylation, both in vitro and in vivo, makes the enzyme sensitive to dephosphorylation. Rephosphorylation by PDK1 creates a cycle whereby the inactive kinase can be reactivated (18Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar).

Constitutively active His-tagged PDK1 and PDK1 substrate peptide were a generous gift of Dr. C. C. King (University of California, San Diego). PKA C-subunit Purification—The recombinant murine C-subunit of PKA was expressed and purified as described previously (25Herberg F.W. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Isoform III, containing 2 phosphates, was used for in all experiments. The Cys199 to alanine mutation was introduced as described by Kunkel et al. (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) and isoform III purified in the same manner as the wild-type C-subunit. Oxidation and Alkylation of PKA C-subunit—Prior to oxidation and alkylation, it was necessary to remove 2-mercaptoethanol from the C-subunit environment. Dialysis (SpectraPor, 10,000 molecular weight cutoff) was performed overnight at 4 °C into a buffer containing 40 mm KCl and 10 mm KPO4, pH 7.2 (Buffer A). C-subunit containing a Cys199–Cys343 intramolecular disulfide was prepared as described previously (6Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type C-subunit (0.3 mg/ml) was incubated for 10 min at 23 °C, pH 7.2, with 1.0 mm diamide. An aliquot of reaction mixture was then removed and analyzed for activity using the coupled assay system described by Cook et al. (27Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Less than 10% of kinase activity remained under these experimental conditions. Glutathionylation of the C-subunit was carried out as described previously (6Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, the C-subunit (0.3 mg/ml) was incubated for 15 min with 100 μm diamide and 125 μm GSH at 23 °C in Buffer A followed by measurement of kinase activity. Less than 10% of kinase activity remained under these experimental conditions. Alkylation of the kinase was performed by incubation of the kinase (0.3 mg/ml) with 250 μm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 20 min at 23 °C in Buffer A followed by the addition of 5.0 mm DTT. Less than 5% of kinase activity remained following alkylation. Following all kinase treatments, samples were again dialyzed into Buffer A to remove excess reagents. Dephosphorylation of PKA C-subunit and PDK1 Kinase Assay—The PKA C-subunit was diluted to 3.0 μg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm MnCl2. Phosphatase λ was added to 300 ng of the C-subunit, and samples were incubated for the indicated times at 23 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of either 5.0 mm vanadate or 10 mm NaF. Kinase activity was then assayed using the PepTag nonradioactive PKA assay system (Promega) in the presence or absence of 20 mm DTT. For rephosphorylation, phosphatase reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mm NaF, and then 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm ATP, 20 mm DTT, and 50 ng of PDK1 were added as indicated. Samples were incubated for an additional 60 min at 23 °C and then diluted into an SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 25 mm DTT and boiled for 10 min. PDK1 activity was assayed by incubation of PDK1 (800 ng) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 2 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 3.3 μg of PDK1 substrate peptide (SKQARANS-FVGTAQYVSRRKR). Reactions (80 μl) were carried out in the presence or absence of 20 mm DTT for 0, 5, and 10 min at 23 °C and then stopped by the addition of 25 μl of a solution containing 100 mm ATP and 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Reaction samples (80 μl) were then spotted on p81 paper (Whatman), washed three times in 0.4% phosphoric acid, and analyzed by scintillation counting. The reaction rate was determined to be linear under these experimental conditions. Inactivation of PKA by PC12 Cell Lysates—Rat neuroblastoma PC12 cells (ATCC, CRL-1721) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 6.5% fetal bovine serum (CellGro), 6.5% horse serum (Invitrogen), and containing penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were then washed with PBS, scraped and collected in 1.0 ml of PBS, and pelleted by spinning 5 min at 500 × g. Pellets were then lysed by resuspending the pellet in 200 μl of a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40 (Buffer B). After incubating on ice for 10 min, the lysate was spun for 5 min at 9300 × g, and the soluble fraction was collected. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined using the Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. PKA C-subunit samples (3.0 μg/ml) were added to cell lysates (1.0 mg/ml), incubated for 45 min at 30 °C, and then analyzed by Western blot analysis. NEM-mediated Inactivation and Dephosphorylation of PKA in PC12 Cells—Prior to treatment, cells (∼75% confluent) were washed with PBS and then placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. As indicated, PKA was activated by the addition of 250 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 250 μm 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, and 25 μm forskolin to the cells, and then the cells were incubated for 10 min at 23 °C. NEM (0.5 mm) was then added to the cells for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS, scraped and collected in 1.0 ml of PBS, and pelleted by spinning 5 min at 500 × g. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and spun again. Pellets were then lysed by resuspending the pellet in 200 μl of Buffer B containing 10 mm DTT. After incubating on ice for 10 min, the lysate was spun for 5 min at 9300 × g, and the soluble fraction was collected. Western blot analysis indicated nearly complete solubilization of PKA under these conditions. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined using the Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was determined using the PepTag nonradioactive PKA assay system (Promega) (28MacAla L.J. Hayslett J.P. Smallwood J.I. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1746-1750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For this assay, 7.0 μg of total cell lysate was added to the PepTag mixture containing 5.0 μm cAMP for 10 min, and then the reaction was stopped by the addition of the PKA-specific inhibitor PKI (50 μm final). All kinase activities were determined to be both cAMP-dependent and PKI-sensitive. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis of pure proteins (30 ng/well) or PC12 cell lysates (40 μg/well) was performed by separating the proteins by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide, NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen)). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), blocked 1 h at 23 °C with 5% milk in TTBS (Tris-bufferd saline containing 0.1% Tween 20), and then incubated for 1 h with polyclonal primary antibody. Blots were then washed 5 times for 5 min with TTBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences, 1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h. Following three washes for 5 min with TTBS, blots were incubated with Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) for 5 min and then exposed to HyperFilm (Amersham Biosciences) for 0–5.0 min. Cysteine 199 Contributes to PKA Resistance to Dephosphorylation—The C-subunit of PKA contains an essential phosphorylation site on Thr197. This phosphorylation site, located in the activation loop and required for optimal kinase activity, is largely resistant to dephosphorylation. To demonstrate this resistance, wild-type recombinant C-subunit (300 ng) containing two phosphorylation sites, one at Thr197 and the other at Ser338, was incubated with phosphatase λ (50 ng) for indicated times at 22 °C. As shown in Fig. 1A, phosphatase λ, a recombinant phosphatase that indiscriminately acts upon phosphothreonine, phosphoserine, and phosphotyrosine residues, induces minimal kinase inactivation (20% ± 6.7%) under our experimental conditions. Proximal to phospho-Thr197 is a highly reactive cysteine (Cys199). We hypothesized that this nucleophilic cysteine may contribute to the stability of phospho-Thr197. Indeed, mutant kinase in which Cys199 was mutated to an alanine (C199A) was much more susceptible to phosphatase λ-mediated inactivation (Fig. 1A). Under identical experimental conditions, 79% ± 2.5% of C199A kinase activity was lost after 45 min. To confirm that the observed loss of activity was because of dephosphorylation of the kinase at Thr197, samples were subjected to Western blot analysis and probed with phospho-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, Western blot analysis confirmed the general resistance of wild-type kinase to dephosphorylation, whereas the C199A kinase was readily dephosphorylated. Interestingly, the phosphorylation state of Ser338 paralleled that of Thr197, also being resistant to removal in wild-type kinase but readily removed in C199A. This result suggests that dephosphorylation of Thr197 likely destabilizes the protein, thereby allowing the secondary phosphate on Ser338 to be removed. From this experiment, we deduce that Cys199, which exists as a thiolate anion, either acts to repulse phosphatase or is essential in coordinating or stabilizing the activation loop in such a conformation that the phosphate is not an accessible substrate. Oxidation of the PKA C-subunit Enhances Dephosphorylation—We reported previously (6Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that the reactive nature of Cys199 renders the kinase susceptible to oxidation-dependent inactivation. Based on the results described in Fig. 1, we hypothesized that oxidation or modification of Cys199 may also alter the ability of the C-subunit to be dephosphorylated. As previously described (6Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), incubation of the C-subunit with diamide, a sulfhydryl-specific oxidant, inhibits the kinase through the formation of an internal disulfide bond between Cys199 and Cys343. This inhibition is nearly complete (90%) but largely reversible by DTT (Fig. 2A). Alternatively, in the presence of reduced glutathione and diamide, the kinase is inhibited by the formation of a protein-glutathione mixed disulfide (6Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This also results in near complete loss of kinase activity (92% decrease), but again it is largely reversible by reducing agent (Fig. 2A). Finally, modification of kinase with the alkylating agent NEM results in nearly complete loss of kinase activity (95%) and is not reversible by reducing agent (data not shown) (11Bechtel P.J. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2691-2697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidized kinase, containing either the internal disulfide bond or protein-glutathione mixed disulfide, or reduced kinase, was incubated with phosphatase λ (45 min, 22 °C). Following this incubation, oxidized kinase activity was no longer recovered by the addition of DTT (Fig. 2A). Glutathionylated C-subunit had an activity prior to phosphatase treatment of 12.9 ± 1.4 nmol × min–1 × mg–1 as compared with 5.3 ± 0.6 nmol × min–1 × mg–1 after treatment. Similarly, diamide-treated C-subunit containing an internal disulfide had an activity of 10.9 ± 1.3 nmol × min–1 x mg–1 prior to phosphatase treatment and 2.4 ± 0.3 nmol x min–1 × mg–1 after. This suggested that, in its oxidized state, the C-subunit was now susceptible to dephosphorylation. Western blot analysis was performed, and samples were probed with phospho-Thr197- and phospho-Ser338-specific antibodies. The results of the Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B) confirmed that oxidized kinase was dephosphorylated at both phosphorylation sites, whereas reduced kinase was largely resistant to dephosphorylation. We noted that upon dephosphorylation of oxidized kinase, there was a slight decrease in the total amount of the C-subunit (Fig. 2B). This was likely because of precipitation of the destabilized, unphosphorylated protein. To further demonstrate that blocking the nucleophilic Cys199 was sufficient for enhancing dephosphorylation, kinase was alkylated with NEM, incubated with phosphatase λ, and then analyzed by Western blot. Fig. 2B demonstrates that alkylation of the C-subunit also greatly enhanced its ability to be dephosphorylated. This experiment further demonstrates that neutralizing the nucleophilic Cys199 decreases the stability of the phosphate on Thr197. Reduced C-subunit Can Be Rephosphorylated by PDK1—As reported previously, Thr197 is a substrate of PDK1 (15Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was therefore of interest to see if oxidized, dephosphorylated C-subunit could be rephosphorylated by PDK1. In these experiments, oxidized C-subunit (glutathionylated or containing an internal disulfide) was dephosphorylated with phosphatase λ, and reactions were then stopped by the addition of NaF. PDK1, DTT, and MgATP were then added as indicated (Fig. 3). Samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis, utilizing phospho-specific antibodies. The results of our experiment demonstrate that dephosphorylated kinase is not rephosphorylated upon addition of DTT and MgATP alone (Fig. 3, lane 3), which was true for both forms of oxidized C-subunit examined. Furthermore, addition of PDK1 in the absence of DTT resulted in little phosphorylation of Thr197 (Fig. 3, lane 4). In contrast, addition of PDK1, MgATP, and DTT resulted in rephosphorylation of Thr197 (Fig. 3, lane 5) with concurrent PKA reactivation (data not shown). This was true for both forms of the oxidized C-subunit examined. Furthermore, control assays examining the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate a peptide substrate in the presence or absence of DTT demonstrated that reducing agent alone did not enhance kinase activity (data not shown), suggesting that DTT was acting to reduce the C-subunit and not simply acting to enhance PDK1 activity. Consistent with previous findings (16Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar),2 PDK1 preferentially phosphorylated Thr197, whereas Ser338 remained unphosphorylated (Fig. 3). It is believed that Ser338 is autophosphorylated (12Toner-Webb J. van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25174-25180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that under our experimental conditions this process occurred slowly. The results of these experiments demonstrate that in contrast to phosphatase, which preferentially acts upon oxidized kinase, PDK1 utilizes the reduced C-subunit to specifically phosphorylate Thr197. Cell Lysates Contain a Phosphatase That Preferentially Dephosphorylates Oxidized and Alkylated C-subunits—Having determined in vitro that oxidized and alkylated C-subunits are preferentially dephosphorylated by phosphatase λ, it was essential to determine whether eukaryotic phosphatases also showed this preference. For these experiments, PC12 cells were lysed and the soluble extract incubated with reduced, oxidized (glutathionylated or containing an internal disulfide) or alkylated PKA C-subunit. Samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis utilizing the phospho-specific antibodies. Under our Western blot conditions, exogenous C-subunit was in a large excess over the endogenous PKA found in the lysates. Therefore, our Western blot analysis conditions readily detected the exogenous C-subunit without background bands from the lysate (not shown). Furthermore, incubation of the exogenous C-subunit with cell lysates did not result in loss of protein as seen by constant total kinase levels under the experimental conditions (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, incubation of the reduced C-subunit resulted in minimal dephosphorylation of Thr197 and Ser338. In contrast, incubation of oxidized or alkylated C-subunit resulted in nearly complete dephosphorylation of Thr197. This dephosphorylation was prevented by the addition of the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor NaF (20 mm) or okadaic acid (25 nm). The amount of okadaic acid needed to inhibit dephosphorylation was constant with a previous report that determined Thr197 was dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase-2A-like phosphatase (13Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 258-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ser338 was also preferentially dephosphorylated in alkylated and oxidized C-subunits containing an internal disulfide but to a lesser extent when glutathionylated. Treatment of Cells with NEM Results in Kinase Inhibition and Dephosphorylation—We have demonstrated that the reduced thiol on Cys199 is critical in protecting the kinase from dephosphorylation. Oxidation or alkylation of this site in vitro by both phosphatase λ and cell lysates enhances the ability of the kinase to be dephosphorylated. We believe that such a novel mechanism could exist in cells whereby modification of this highly reactive cysteine leads to kinase dephosphorylation. To test our model, PC12 cells were treated with PKA activators (the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) for 10 min at 22 °C or left untreated as a control. Cells were then treated with the cell-permeable alkylating agent NEM (29Gaudemer Y. Latruffe N. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (500 μm, 30 min at 37 °C) as indicated, washed, harvested,"

It provides an attractive template for the design of novel antibiotic drugs and is the target of the naturally occurring antibiotic fosfomycin, which covalently attaches to Cys115 in the active site of the enzyme. Mutations of Cys115 to Asp exist in pathogens such as Mycobacteria or Chlamydia rendering these organisms resistant to fosfomycin. Thus, there is a need for the elucidation of the role of this cysteine in the MurA reaction. We determined the x-ray structure of the C115S mutant of Enterobacter cloacae MurA, which was crystallized in the presence of the substrates of MurA. The structure depicts the product state of the enzyme with enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and inorganic phosphate trapped in the active site. Kinetic analysis revealed that the Cys-to-Ser mutation results in an enzyme that appears to perform a single turnover of the reaction. Opposing the common view of Cys115 as a key residue in the chemical reaction of enolpyruvyl transfer, we now conclude that the wild-type cysteine is essential for product release only. On the basis of a detailed comparison of the product state with the intermediate state and an unliganded state of MurA, we propose that dissociation of the products is an ordered event with inorganic phosphate leaving first.

Growth and survival of bacteria relies on the functionality of the enzyme MurA (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase, EC 2.5.1.7), which catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall (1van Heijenoort J.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 364-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Fosfomycin covalently attaches to the thiol group of a cysteine (position 115 in Escherichia coli numbering) in the active site of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae MurA and thus irreversibly inhibits the enzymatic function (7Kahan F.M.

MurA catalyzes the transfer of the enolpyruvyl moiety of phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) 1The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; THI, tetrahedral intermediate; UNAG, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine; EP-UNAG, enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; THI, tetrahedral intermediate; UNAG, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine; EP-UNAG, enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. to the 3′-hydroxyl group of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG) (Fig. 1). This chemically unusual reaction, in which the C-O bond of PEP is cleaved rather than the high energy P-O bond, runs as an addition-elimination process (10Walsh C.T. Benson T.E. Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After the substrates have docked into the active site (Fig. 2), adhering to the strict binding order UNAG before PEP, a proton is added to PEP, and the resulting oxocarbenium ion is, as a whole, added to the sugar nucleotide. This addition step of the reaction yields an intermediate with a covalent link between the 3′-hydroxyl group of UNAG and C-2 of PEP, which then adopts tetrahedral configuration (11Kim D.H.

In the elimination step of the reaction a proton is removed from C-3 of the PEP moiety, leading to separation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the tetrahedral adduct and reformation of the double bond between C-2 and C-3. The only other enzyme known to catalyze a similar reaction is AroA (also called 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, EC 2.5.1.19), which is vital for the shikimate pathway in plants and numerous microorganisms (13Bentley R.

A proton is added to PEP, yielding a PEP oxocarbenium ion, whereas the target hydroxyl group of the first bound substrate UNAG gets deprotonated (A), followed by nucleophilic attack of the oxyanion on the C-2 atom of the PEP oxocarbenium ion (B), and leads to a covalent adduct of the two substrates, where the C-2 atom of the PEP moiety is in tetrahedral configuration. The elimination of phosphate may proceed through self-catalysis (C1) (26An M. Maitra U. Neidlein U. Bartlett P.A. J. Am. Chem.

In concert with the domain movement in MurA, a 10-residue loop, Pro112-Pro121, from the top domain moves toward the active site and closes the interdomain cleft like a lid. This loop hosts Cys115 in MurA from E. cloacae and E. coli. Cys115 has been shown to be critical for MurA activity (8Marquardt J.L. Brown E.D. Lane W.S. Haley T.M. Ichikawa Y. Wong C.H. Walsh C.T.

Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Walsh C.T. Duncan K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Such a dual role for Cys115 as an acid-base catalyst in the addition-elimination reaction has recently been questioned by crystallographic analysis of the D305A mutant of MurA crystallized in the presence of UNAG and PEP (12Eschenburg S. Kabsch W. Healy M.L. Schonbrunn E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49215-49222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This structure revealed the genuine tetrahedral reaction intermediate of the enzyme, which is S-configured at the C2 of the attached PEP molecule. The S configuration was also found for the genuine tetrahedral intermediate of the AroA reaction using the corresponding mutant enzyme D313A. Bartlett and co-workers (25Alberg D.G. Lauhon C.T.

Soc. 2003; 125: 12759-12767Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) deduced the same S configuration of the intermediate of the AroA reaction by chemical studies. However, the stereochemical course of the enolpyruvyl transfer reactions is a matter of debate, partly because of the lack of understanding the role of Cys115 in MurA catalysis and because an active site residue such as Cys115 is not present in AroA. In this work, we present evidence that Cys115 may not be involved in the transfer of the enolpyruvyl moiety from PEP to UNAG but in fact appears to be crucial for product release. We engineered a single-site mutant from E. cloacae MurA, which carries serine instead of the wild-type cysteine in position 115, and crystallized the mutant enzyme in the presence of the substrates of MurA: UNAG and PEP. Subsequent x-ray analysis to 2.3 Å resolution surprisingly revealed the product state of the enzyme with enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (EP-UNAG) and Pi trapped in the active site. Kinetic analysis confirmed that this mutant enzyme catalyzes a single turnover only. We discuss the implications from this structure for the catalytic mechanism and the possible role of Cys115 in the domain movement of MurA associated with catalysis. PEP (potassium salt) and UNAG were purchased from Sigma. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Coomassie reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard. The mutation C115S was introduced to wild-type E. cloacae MurA using a Kwik Change mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and appropriate primers. The pET-Vector 9d (Novagen) containing the open reading frame of the wild-type enzyme was used as template for the point mutation of MurA. C115S-MurA was overexpressed in a STBL2-DE3 E. coli cell. The overexpressed protein was purified as described (21Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Krekel F. Luger K. Amrhein N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Crystallography—The mutant enzyme was concentrated to ∼100 mg/ml using Centricon 30 devices (Amicon) at 4 °C. C115S-MurA was crystallized at 19 °C from 10 mm MES, pH 6.4, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000 in the presence of 5 mm UNAG and 5 mm PEP. Diffraction data were recorded from a single flash frozen crystal on a R-axis IV2+ image plate detector (Molecular Structure Corporation, The Woodlands, TX) using the rotation method (x-rays, CuKα, focused by mirror optics (Molecular Structure Corporation); generator, RU300 (Rigaku, Molecular Structure Corporation)). Data processing, phasing and refinement, and model building were performed with the program packages HKL suite (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Diffraction data were limited to low resolution reflections 20.0-6.0 Å in the cross-rotation and translation search. From the 30 highest peaks of the cross-rotation function, eight solutions could be successfully translated into the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Exploiting the point group symmetry, the eight independent solutions were rearranged in the asymmetric unit. This rearrangement revealed that the asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two tetramers of MurA molecules. Rigid body refinement of the asymmetric octamer, with the two globular domains of each of the eight MurA molecules refined independently, lowered the initial Rfree from 50.3 to 36.1%. Refinement was performed using data to the highest resolution with no σ cut-off applied. Most of the protein regions were constrained exploiting the noncrystallographic symmetry between the eight molecules, except for the active site and intermolecular contact regions. Solvent molecules were added to the model at chemically reasonable positions. The ligands were modeled according to the clear electron density map. Residue 67 of each of the eight molecules was modeled as iso-aspartate (30Eschenburg S. Schonbrunn E. Proteins. 2000; 40: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

To measure C115S MurA activity, we made use of two assays; one uses MurB as a coupling enzyme to detect the product enolpyruvyl-UNAG (EP-UNAG). We have recently used the MurB coupled assay for a reevaluation of the mode of action of fosfomycin on E. cloacae MurA (17Schonbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Amrhein N. Koch M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The coupled reaction starts with MurA converting UNAG and PEP to UNAG-EP, which is then reduced to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid by MurB, using one equivalent of NADPH. To compensate for the diaphorase activity of MurB, a glucose oxidase/glucose system was exploited. This resulted in a stable base line prior to initiation of the MurA reaction. The second assay, the Lanzetta assay, was used to detect the second product, Pi (35Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). We have previously utilized the Lanzetta assay to characterize Pi release from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (36Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purified C115S mutant MurA contains trace amounts of genomic E. coli MurA, which would interfere with the kinetic analysis, especially using the high concentrations of mutant enzyme used here. Therefore we selectively inactivated the wild-type enzyme using fosfomycin. Inhibition of MurA by fosfomycin is solely due to covalent attachment to Cys115, whereas the C115S mutant enzyme is not affected (8Marquardt J.L. Brown E.D. Lane W.S. Haley T.M. Ichikawa Y. Wong C.H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10646-10651Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To test C115S MurA activity using the MurB coupled assay, a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm glucose, 20 units of glucose oxidase, 0.20 mm NADPH, 40 μg of MurB, 5 mm UNAG, 10 μm fosfomycin, and 1.8 mg of C115S MurA (0.04 mm), in a final volume of 1 ml, was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. A base-line time course was run for ∼30 s prior to the addition of 5 mm PEP to start the reaction. The decrease in NADPH absorbance was recorded at 340 nm. In the Lanzetta assay the enzyme (0.05 mm) was incubated in 100 μl of the same assay mixture for 10 min before the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm PEP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 800 μl of the Lanzetta reagent. Color development was stopped after 5 min by the addition of 100 μl of 34% (w/v) sodium citrate. The change in optical density was measured at 660 nm, and the amount of Pi was determined by comparison with phosphate standards. To determine whether the C115S MurA is capable of catalyzing the conversion of UNAG and PEP to UNAG-EP and Pi but is unable to release the products (single turnover), several denaturants were used to test whether the trapped products could be detected after denaturation of the enzyme-ligand complex. This was accomplished by incubating a mixture containing reaction buffer and 40 mg/ml C115S MurA (0.9 mm) in a final volume of 400 μl at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm PEP and allowed to proceed for 5 min. To stop the reaction and denature the mutant enzyme a final concentration of 6 m urea or 5% trichloroacetic acid was added and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. Alternatively, the reaction was heated at 100 °C for 10 min. To test for the product UNAG-EP, the coupled assay with varied concentrations of the denaturation mixture (0.4-2.9 mg/0.01-0.07 mm) was employed. A stable reading was established prior to the start of the reaction by the addition of 40 μg of MurB, and the decrease in NADPH absorbance was recorded. Control experiments were conducted throughout with C115S MurA treated in the same way but omitting PEP during the reaction time. Testing the amount of Pi produced in the reaction failed because of the noncompatibility of the Lanzetta reagent with high protein concentrations. Notably, the mutant enzyme does not precipitate out of urea solutions and thus cannot be separated from EP-UNAG using centrifugation. Heat and trichloroacetic acid, which denature and precipitate the mutant enzyme, were not suitable; nonreacting PEP hydrolyzes rapidly at elevated temperatures to pyruvate and Pi, thereby producing too high background levels, and as low as 0.2% trichloroacetic acid interferes with the Lanzetta reagent. Enzyme-Products Complex—Under the crystallization conditions used, C115S-MurA oligomerizes to densely packed tetramers (Fig. 3), of which two constitute the asymmetric unit of the crystal. X-ray analysis to 2.3 Å resolution revealed the products of the enzymatic reaction, EP-UNAG and Pi, trapped in the active site of each of the eight crystallographically independent C115S-MurA molecules (Fig. 4). The products uniformly occupy all MurA molecules of the crystal. Refined at unit occupancy, and the mean temperature factor of the atoms of the products lies with 17.0 Å2 yet below the mean temperature factor of the protein of 23.9 Å2.

Overexpression of wild-type InsP6K2 augments the cytotoxic actions of multiple cell stressors in diverse cell lines, whereas transfection with a dominant negative InsP6K2 decreases cell death. During cell death, InsP6 kinase activity is enhanced, and intracellular InsP7 level is augmented. Deletion of InsP6K2 but not the other forms of InsP6K diminishes cell death, suggesting that InsP6K2 is the major InsP6 kinase involved in cell death. Cytotoxicity is associated with a translocation of InsP6K2 from nuclei to mitochondria, whereas the intracellular localization of the other isoforms of the enzyme does not change. The present study provides compelling evidence that endogenous InsP6K2, by generating InsP7, provides physiologic regulation of the apoptotic process.

In the present study we show that transfection of InsP6K2 in multiple cell lines augments apoptotic actions of several cell stressors, accompanied by major increases in InsP7 formation. Although transfection of all three subtypes of InsP6K increases cell death, deleting InsP6K2, but not InsP6K1 or InsPK3, prevents apoptosis. Additionally, apoptotic stimuli elicit translocation of InsP6K2 from nuclei to damaged mitochondria, whereas no alteration in the intracellular localizations of InsP6K1 or InsP6K3 is demonstrable. Cell Lines and Cell Death Assays—HeLa cells, PC12 cells, Jurkat T cells, and OVCAR-3 cells were transfected with indicated constructs using a Lipofectamine 2000 transfection kit (Invitrogen) and a protocol provided by the manufacturer (17Luo H.R. Hattori H. Hossain M.A. Hester L. Huang Y. Lee-Kwon W. Donowitz M. Nagata E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11712-11717Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We routinely obtained a transfection efficiency of over 70% in these cells. HL-60 cells, a promyelocytic cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm glutamine. HL-60 cells could not be transfected by Lipofectamine reagent, and we utilized a newly invented Nucleofection™ system (Amaxa, Inc.) to introduce DNA construct into these cells. We regularly obtained a transfection efficiency of over 50% in HL60 cells. The cells were plated at 5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plastic plates 1 day before the experiment, and cell death was induced by the addition of cisplatin (30 μm), staurosporine (1 μm), etoposide (25 μm), or hydrogen peroxide (750 μm) (18Okuno S.

For generating hypoxia condition, the transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C for 20 h in a Gas-Pak anaerobic chamber (BD Biosciences, Cockeysville, MD). In parallel, cells grown for the same duration under normoxic conditions served as controls. Toxicity was assayed 12-14 h after drug exposure by microscopic examination with computer-assisted cell counting. The numbers of total and dead cells were determined by nuclear staining with 100 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and propidium iodide (10 μm), respectively. After 10 min of incubation, the cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) with excitation at 360 nm. Cell death was determined as the ratio of dead-to-total cell number and quantified by counting 1,000 cells. For staining of dead cells by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline and then stained using a TUNEL assay kit following protocols provided by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). InsP6 Kinase Assay—Apoptosis of OVCAR-3 cells was initiated by treating cells with 30 μm cisplatin. The cells were lysed at indicated time points, and the resulting lysate was used for activity assay. InsP6 kinase enzymatic activity was assayed as preciously described (11Saiardi A.

Radiolabeling and Detection of Inositol Phosphates in Intact Cells— The OVCAR-3 cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/35-mm plate and incubated with [3H]inositol (final concentration, 100 μCi/ml) for 4 days. The cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold DB buffer (10Luo H.R. Huang Y.E. Chen J.C. Saiardi A. Iijima M. Ye K. Huang Y. Nagata E. Devreotes P. Snyder S.H.

The cell pellets were lysed in 0.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (2 m perchloric acid, 0.1 mg/ml InsP6, 2 mm EDTA). The Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was neutralized with K2CO3 as described previously (5Saiardi A. Sciambi C. McCaffery J.M. Wendland B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Inositol phosphates were resolved by HPLC as described above. Disruption of InsP6K Expression by RNA Interference—The double-stranded RNAs used in RNA interference experiment were synthesized using a Silencer™ siRNA mixture kit (Ambion, Inc.). The PCR amplification of each target site (InsP6K1, InsP6K2, and InsP6K3) was performed using primers that contained T7 promoter sequences. We used the following sequences: InsP6K1 (5′ primer, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA TGT GTG TTT GTC AAA CC, and 3′ primer, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CAG GCT GGC TTT CTC), InsP6K2 (5′ primer, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA TGA GCC CAG CCT TCA GGG, and 3′ primer, 5′-CTAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC GGG AAG TCA GGT TTT CCA), and InsP6K3 (5′ primer, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC AGA TGC CGG GGA CAT GAG, and 3′ primer, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC TCC TAA TGA CAG AGA GG). After synthesis of each double-stranded RNA, siRNA were produced using RNase III, and each siRNA was transfected into HEK293 cells using siPORT™ XP-1 transfection agent (Ambion, Inc.). For Northern blotting analysis, total RNAs from cells transfected with InsP6K1, InsP6K2, and InsP6K3 siRNAs were extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and prepared using LiCl precipitation methods. RNA (30 μg) was loaded on 1% agarose/formaldehyde/MOPS gel and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Probes for InsP6K1, InsP6K2, and InsP6K3 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using oligonucleotide labeling. InsP6K2 Translocation—HEK293 cells (80% confluent) were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing GFP, GFP-InsP6K1, GFP-InsP6K2, and GFP-InsP6K3. After 48 h, transiently transfected cells were incubated with staurosporine (1 μm) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) plus MG132, a proteinase inhibitor from Sigma, for 4 h. The cells were then immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h and stained with anti-Bax antibody (DAKO). Images of the fluorescent cells were obtained on an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope.

We have extended these findings to multiple cell lines and apoptotic stimuli (Figs. 1 and 2). In ovarian carcinoma cells treated with cisplatin, InsP6K2 transfection augments cell death monitored by Mitotracker staining for healthy mitochondria, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining for nuclear structure, propidium iodide (PI) staining for membrane structure, and TUNEL staining for DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1). With all assays InsP6K2 transfection increases cell death by about 50%. To ascertain whether endogenous InsP6K2 mediates apoptotic actions of cisplatin, we transfected cells with kinase-dead InsP6K2, which markedly reduces cisplatin-induced cell death, consistent with a physiologic role for endogenous InsP6K2 in regulating apoptosis. InsP6K2 transfection fails to influence the modest basal level of cell death in untreated ovarian carcinoma cells. To assess the generality of the role of InsP6K2 in apoptosis, we examined five additional cell lines: HEK293 cells, HeLa cells, PC12 cells, Jurkat T cells, and HL60 cells (Fig. 2). We also employed multiple cell stressors including hydrogen peroxide, staurosporine, etoposide, and hypoxic-ischemia (Fig. 2). In all cell lines with all stressors, transfection of InsP6K2 increases apoptosis. By contrast, the kinase-dead InsP6K2 prevents cell death in all instances. This prevention is most marked, about 80%, for Jurkat T and HL60 lymphocyte cell lines treated with etoposide, whereas the least anti-apoptotic actions, about 40%, are in staurosporine-treated PC12 cells. Cell Stressors Augment InsP7 Formation, and Deletion of InsP6K2 Selectively Prevents Cell Death—Lindner and co-workers (15Morrison B.H. Bauer J.A. Hu J. Grane R.W. Ozdemir A.M. Chawla-Sarkar M.

We have explored the influence of cell stressors on inositol pyrophosphate levels and the link of the three InsP6K enzymes to cell death. We monitored inositol pyrophosphate formation in intact ovarian carcinoma cells treated with cisplatin (Fig. 3). Cisplatin elicits a major increase in InsP7 formation with a more modest augmentation of InsP8 generation. Maximal increases in InsP7 levels, about 8-fold, occur at 8 and 18 h. By 30 h, the levels of both InsP7 and InsP6 decrease to base-line values, suggesting that the decline reflects cell death rather than intrinsic regulation of enzyme activity. We also detect an 8-fold increase in InsP7 generation from [3H]InsP6 in cell lysates 8 h following cisplatin treatment. The increased InsP6K catalytic activity is the same even with diluted cell lysates (data not shown), indicating that the stimulatory action of cisplatin is not exerted upon some soluble constituent distinct from InsP6K. Western blot analysis fails to reveal altered levels of InsP6K1, InsP6K2, or InsP6K3 following cisplatin treatment (data not shown), implying that the stimulation of enzyme activity reflects a covalent modification of the protein such as phosphorylation. Lindner and co-workers (15Morrison B.H. Bauer J.A. Hu J. Grane R.W. Ozdemir A.M. Chawla-Sarkar M. Gong B. Almasan A. Kalvakolanu D.V. Lindner D.J.

To ascertain differential roles of the three InsP6K isoforms, we transfected the isoforms and monitored InsP7 formation in intact cells following staurosporine treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). In untransfected cells staurosporine elicits a 5-fold increase in InsP7 generation. Transfection with each of the three InsP6K isoforms causes a 10-20-fold increase in InsP7 formation with no additional augmentation following staurosporine treatment. The three isoforms are also equally capable of eliciting cell death. Transfection of the three InsP6Ks in untreated cells leads to a 2-4-fold increase in cell death. In staurosporine-treated cells, transfection of the three enzymes doubles the cytotoxic actions of staurosporine. Essentially the same effects are observed with hypoxia treatment.Fig. 2InsP6K2 as a mediator of apoptosis in multiple mammalian cancer cell lines. HeLa, HEK293, PC12, and Jurkat cells were cultured and maintained as previously described (17Luo H.R. Hattori H. Hossain M.A. Hester L. Huang Y. Lee-Kwon W. Donowitz M. Nagata E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11712-11717Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These cells were transfected with indicated constructs using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). As in Fig. 1, a construct expressing GFP was co-transfected, permitting monitoring of transfection of InsP6K2 gene. HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line (28Collins S.J. Gallo R.C. Gallagher R.E. Nature. 1977; 270: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 4 mm glutamine. HL-60 cells could not be transfected by Lipofectamine reagent, and we utilized a newly invented Nucleofection™ system (Amaxa, Inc.) to introduce DNA construct into these cells. Nucleofection is an electroporation based technique and uses a combination of special electrical parameters and specific solutions to deliver the DNA directly to the cell nucleus. We regularly obtained a transfection efficiency of over 50% in HL60 cells. Cell death was assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. All of these assays provided essentially the same results.

OVCAR-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected with indicated constructs using a Lipofectamine 2000 transfection kit (Invitrogen) and a protocol provided by the manufacturer. InsP6K2-K/A is a dominant negative InsP2K2. A construct expressing GFP was co-transfected (the ratio between GFP and HA-InsP6K2 constructs is 1:4), permitting monitoring of transfection of IP6K2 gene. Immunostaining with anti-HA antibody confirmed that more than 95% of cells expressing GFP also express HA-tagged fusion proteins (data not shown). The cells were treated with 30 μm anti-cancer drug cisplatin, and toxicity was assayed 14 h after the treatment. In each assay, at least three separate experiments were performed with a minimum of 500 cells counted per data point. Cell death was determined as the ratio of dead-to-total cell number. The results are the means of three independent experiments. The bars indicate the means ± S.D. A, cell viability assessed by fluorescence microscopy following Mitotracker staining. The cells were incubated with 500 nm Mitotraker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 20 min. CMXRos is a cell-permeant mitochondrion-selective dye. The uptake of this dye is dependent on mitochondrial membrane potential; therefore the depolarized mitochondria in apoptotic cells will not be stained by CMXRox. For quantitative analysis, a cell was scored as “dead” if less than 100 CMXRos staining positive mitochondria were detected in this cell. B, cell viability assessed by fluorescence microscopy following 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear staining. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole is membrane-permeable and stains both healthy and dead cells. Cells containing obvious condensed nucleus were regarded as “dead” cells. C, cell viability assessed by PI staining. PI is membrane impermeable and can only stain the broken (dead) cells. D, cell viability determined by the TUNEL assay. Incorporated bromodeoxyuridine into the fragmented DNA was detected using Fluor 488-conjugated anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody.

Accordingly, we depleted the three InsP6K isoforms by RNA interference treatment obtaining similar reductions in RNA levels for the three enzymes (Fig. 5). Whereas deletion of InsP6K2 reduces cell death by 60%, deletion of the other two isoforms does not alter cytotoxicity. Thus, physiologically, InsP6K2 selectively regulates cell viability. Cytotoxic Stimuli Cause Translocation of InsP6K2 from Nucleus to Mitochondria—We wondered whether cell stressors might alter the intracellular localization of InsP6K isoforms and, accordingly, treated HEK293 cells with staurosporine and ovarian carcinoma cells with cisplatin (Fig. 6, A and B). As reported previously (12Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), under basal conditions InsP6K2 is almost exclusively nuclear, whereas InsP6K1 and InsP6K3 are both cytosolic and nuclear. The cell stressors do not affect the intracellular localization of InsP6K1 or InsP6K2 but do cause a reduction of nuclear InsP6K2 associated with its appearance in granular structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm. To ascertain the identity of the granular structures, we looked for possible co-localization of InsP6K2 with targeting sequences for endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and peroxisomes conjugated with red fluorescent protein. InsP6K2 does not co-localize with any of these markers (data not shown). We evaluated healthy and apoptotic mitochondria stained, respectively, for Mitotracker and Bax (Fig. 6C). Only modest co-localization of InsP6K2 is evident with Mitotracker. By contrast, InsP6K2 co-localizes almost completely with Bax. The selective co-localization of InsP6K2 with Bax, which is well known to translocate from cytosol to mitochondria during apoptosis (19Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 20Tsuruta F. Sunayama J. Mori Y. Hattori S. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Yoshioka K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar), implies an association of InsP6K2 with mitochondria related to the apoptotic process. The present study provides compelling evidence that endogenous InsP6K2, by generating InsP7, provides physiologic regulation of the apoptotic process. Thus, multiple cell stressors in diverse cell types all augment InsP7 formation. Deletion of InsP6K2 but not the other forms of InsP6K diminishes cell death. Cytotoxicity is associated with a translocation of InsP6K2 from nuclei to mitochondria, whereas the intracellular localization of the other isoforms of the enzyme does not change. Transfection of InsP6K2 augments the cytotoxic actions of multiple cell stressors in diverse cell lines, whereas in untreated cells, the transfection increases cell death in some but not other cell lines. We are unable to discern specific factors that explain the differential cytotoxicity of InsP6K2 for various types of untreated cells. Transfection with kinase-dead InsP6K2 decreases cell death in all cell types examined with different stressors. This finding, similar to what was observed by Lindner and co-workers (15Morrison B.H. Bauer J.A. Hu J. Grane R.W. Ozdemir A.M. Chawla-Sarkar M. Gong B. Almasan A. Kalvakolanu D.V. Lindner D.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1882-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Morrison B.H.

Cell stress leads to an 8-fold increase of InsP7 synthesis, which we detect both in intact cells and in cell lysates with no associated increase in protein levels for any of the three InsP6K isoforms. These observations are best explained by some covalent modification of one of the InsP6K proteins, conceivably by phosphorylation. Alternatively, translocation of InsP6K2 from nuclei to mitochondria may lead to more detectable enzyme activity. The regulation of apoptosis by InsP6K depends on its catalytic activity. Thus, reducing InsP7 formation by a kinase-dead InsP6K2 diminishes cell death. Moreover, increased generation of InsP7 by transfecting any of the three isoforms augments cell death. Nonetheless, the physiologic regulation of apoptosis appears to selectively involve InsP6K2, because its deletion by RNA interference treatment markedly reduces cell death, whereas deletion of InsP6K1 and InsP6K3 is ineffective. This finding fits with the observations of Lindner and co-workers (15Morrison B.H. Bauer J.A. Hu J. Grane R.W. Ozdemir A.M. Chawla-Sarkar M. Gong B. Almasan A. Kalvakolanu D.V. Lindner D.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24965-24970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) who first implicated InsP6K2 in this process by showing that InsP6K2 fully accounted for the ability of a library of antisense constructs to reverse cell death elicited by interferon β. Cytotoxic stimulation elicits a selective translocation of InsP6K2 from nuclei to mitochondria. InsP6K2 co-localizes with mitochondria stained for Bax, reflecting mitochondria damaged during the apoptotic process, but not with Mitotracker, which stains only healthy mitochondria. This finding implies that cell stress causes InsP6K2 to transit from nuclei to mitochondria, where it plays a causal role in initiating the apoptotic process. This possibility is consistent with the ability of InsP6K2 deletion to prevent apoptosis. We do not know what accounts for the translocation of InsP6K2 from the nucleus. We have failed to detect any nuclear export signal in InsP6K2. Conceivably cell stress causes a chaperone protein to bind InsP6K2 and move it to mitochondria. How might InsP7 elicit apoptosis? Known molecular actions of InsP7 include competition with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 for binding to PH domains of proteins (10Luo H.R. Huang Y.E. Chen J.C. Saiardi A. Iijima M. Ye K. Huang Y. Nagata E. Devreotes P. Snyder S.H.

By displacing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate from Akt, InsP7 diminishes activation of Akt, which is a known survival factor (22Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem.

Light chain subunits regulate clathrin assembly in vitro by suppressing spontaneous self-assembly of the heavy chains. The residues that play this regulatory role are at the N terminus of a conserved 22-amino acid sequence that is shared by all vertebrate light chains. Here we show that these regulatory residues and others in the conserved sequence mediate light chain interaction with Hip1 and Hip1R. These related proteins were previously found to be enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles and to promote clathrin assembly in vitro. We demonstrate Hip1R binding preference for light chains associated with clathrin heavy chain and show that Hip1R stimulation of clathrin assembly in vitro is blocked by mutations in the conserved sequence of light chains that abolish interaction with Hip1 and Hip1R. In vivo overexpression of a fragment of clathrin light chain comprising the Hip1R-binding region affected cellular actin distribution. Together these results suggest that the roles of Hip1 and Hip1R in affecting clathrin assembly and actin distribution are mediated by their interaction with the conserved sequence of clathrin light chains.

The triskelion-shaped clathrin molecule is composed of trimerized clathrin heavy chains (HCs), each with a bound light chain (LC) subunit. Triskelia assemble into polyhedral lattice-coated cellular membranes. Most known regulatory and adaptor proteins influence coat assembly, membrane association, membrane fission, and uncoating by binding to sites on the HCs (1Brodsky F.M. Chen C.-Y. Knuehl C.

Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar), which themselves can self-assemble into a lattice. The LC subunits suppress spontaneous lattice assembly in vitro and thus allow cellular clathrin assembly to be controlled and subjected to regulation by additional proteins (3Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12710-12714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ybe J.A. Greene B. Liu S.-H. Pley U. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Other roles for the LCs have not yet been clearly defined, despite the fact that LCs appear to be composed of multiple functional domains (5Brodsky F.M. Hill B.L. Acton S.L. Na ̈thke I. Wong D.H. Ponnambalam S. Parham P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 208-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we establish that the function of a conserved sequence in vertebrate LCs is to bind to the CCV-enriched proteins, Hip1 and Hip1R (referred to henceforth as Hip1/R). The potential roles for this LC-Hip1/R interaction in the network of CCV regulation are characterized.In vertebrate clathrin, there are two types of LCs, LCa and LCb, encoded by different genes. These LCs are expressed in all tissues at varying relative levels (6Acton S. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and are heterogeneously distributed in clathrin triskelia (7Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2481-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Near the N termini of LCs there is a 22-residue sequence, shared by LCa and LCb and completely conserved in all vertebrate LCs, which is also highly conserved in LCs from non-vertebrate species (5Brodsky F.M. Hill B.L. Acton S.L. Na ̈thke I. Wong D.H. Ponnambalam S. Parham P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 208-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The first three residues of this conserved sequence are a triplet of negatively charged residues (EED) that regulate clathrin assembly (4Ybe J.A. Greene B. Liu S.-H. Pley U. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). If these residues are neutralized by mutation, the LCs no longer suppress in vitro clathrin assembly (4Ybe J.A. Greene B. Liu S.-H. Pley U. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Residues to the N-terminal side of the conserved sequence in LCb are the target for casein kinase phosphorylation and residues to the C-terminal side in LCa constitute a site that can be bound by Hsc70 (5Brodsky F.M. Hill B.L. Acton S.L. Na ̈thke I. Wong D.H. Ponnambalam S. Parham P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 208-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a protein involved in CCV uncoating. Central to both LCs is a helical region that associates with HCs (8Chen C.-Y. Reese M.L. Hwang P.K. Ota N. Agard D. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6072-6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). C-terminal to this region are sites for short inserted sequences that are present because of alternate splicing of LC RNA in neurons (5Brodsky F.M. Hill B.L. Acton S.L. Na ̈thke I. Wong D.H. Ponnambalam S. Parham P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 208-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These sequences influence calmodulin binding to the LC C termini (9Pley U.M. Hill B.L. Alibert C. Brodsky F.M. Parham P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). LCs bind to the triskelion hub, a domain formed by the C-terminal third of the HCs through trimerization near their C termini. Thus LCs have the potential to regulate molecular interactions in the central region of the triskelion, whereas the majority of known clathrin-binding proteins interact with HC terminal domains at the ends of the triskelion legs.Hip1/R proteins were recently shown to bind LCs (10Engqvist-Goldstein A ̊.E.

Hip1 was identified as a protein that loses binding to mutant huntingtin and has thus been implicated in Huntington's disease (14Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. McCutcheon K. Graham R.K. Nichol K.

They have different developmental expression patterns (13Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J. Hayden M.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol.

We had previously shown that transfection of cells with the hub fragment caused both LC and Hip1R dissociation from clathrin, suggesting that Hip1R was binding to LCs associated with the overexpressed hubs (11Bennett E.M. Chen C.-Y. Engqvist-Goldstein A ̊.E. Drubin D.G. Brodsky F.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hub overexpression disrupted the characteristic offset alignment of clathrin-coated pits with the actin cytoskeleton (11Bennett E.M. Chen C.-Y. Engqvist-Goldstein A ̊.E. Drubin D.G. Brodsky F.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We consequently hypothesized that the CCV link to actin might be mediated by Hip1R binding to the LC subunits of clathrin. Recent Hip1R RNA silencing experiments showed that decreasing Hip1R levels caused clathrin-coated pits to become more tightly associated with actin instead of being offset from actin filaments (21Engqvist-Goldstein A ̊.E. Zhang C.X. Carreno S. Barroso C. Heuser J.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1666-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), further corroborating a role for Hip1R in linking CCVs to actin dynamics.Here we map Hip1/R binding to the conserved sequence of clathrin LCs. Mutations in this LC sequence abolished interaction with Hip1/R and abolished the ability of Hip1R to promote clathrin assembly in vitro, suggesting that the Hip1R effects on assembly result from binding the regulatory residues of LCs. In vivo overexpression a LC fragment comprising the conserved Hip1/R binding sequence affected the cellular distribution of actin. These results indicate that the conserved sequence of LCs bind Hip1/R and coordinate Hip1/R action on clathrin and the actin cytoskeleton.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Assays—LCb fragments were amplified from bovine brain cDNAs (22Jackson A.P. Seow H.-F. Holmes N. Drickamer K. Parham P. Nature. 1987; 326: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and cloned into the BamHI site of pACT2 (Clontech). Hip1-(124–1037) was amplified from a human brain cDNA library (Clontech, provided by Suwon Kim, University of California, San Francisco) and cloned into the SalI/SmaI sites of pGBT9 (Clontech) or SmaI/XhoI sites of pACT2. Mouse Hip1R cDNA, provided by David Drubin, University of California, Berkeley, was amplified and cloned into the SalI site of pGBT9 or the BamHI/XhoI sites of pACT2. HC fragments were amplified from bovine brain cDNAs (23Liu S.-H. Wong M.L. Craik C.S. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and cloned into the BamHI-SalI sites of pGBT9 (Clontech). Rat AP2 β-hinge ear (616–937) was amplified (24Greene B. Liu S.-H. Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and cloned into the SmaI/XhoI sites of pACT2. Reverse yeast two-hybrid screens were carried out as previously described (8Chen C.-Y. Reese M.L. Hwang P.K. Ota N. Agard D. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6072-6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the reporter assays were performed following the Clontech yeast protocols handbook. Single residue mutations were generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).In Vitro Binding Assays—Mouse Hip1R-(346–655) was amplified and cloned into the SalI site of pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed as a GST fusion protein following the manufacturer's protocol. Bovine hub fragment with an N-terminal His tag and bovine brain LCb were prepared as described previously (23Liu S.-H. Wong M.L. Craik C.S. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). The in vitro binding assay was carried out as follows. About 10 μg of GST-Hip1R-(346–655) or GST alone were bound to 20 μl of 80% glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm imidazole, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing once, indicated molar ratios of LCb and/or Hub were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. In sequential binding experiments, Hub or LCb were added and incubated for another hour. After washing 2–3 times with the same buffer with 10 mm extra imidazole, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the conserved region of LCs (25Acton S.L. Wong D.H. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. Jackson A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and mouse monoclonal antibodies against the His tag (His6, Clontech) and against the GST tag (GST, Covance). Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit antiserum (ZyMed), the binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). In the peptide competition experiments, 3.5 μg (∼50 pmol) of GST-Hip1R-(346–655) were bound to resins as described above. The peptide of the conserved region (either wild-type, EEDPAAAFLAQQESEIAGIEND, or mutant EEVPAAAFLAQQESEAAGIAND, 80% purity, SynPep) was added in a 500-μl binding reaction and incubated for 30 min. 9 μg (∼300pmol) of recombinant LCb were added directly into the mixture and incubated for 1 h. The bound fractions were assayed by immunoblotting as described above.Clathrin Assembly Assays—Hip1R-(346–655) was prepared by cleaving the GST tag off from the fusion construct using factor Xa following the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). The assays were modified according to Ref. 24Greene B. Liu S.-H. Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. His tag hub was preincubated with excess LCb at 4 °C for at least 1 h to saturate the hub with the LC subunits. The mixture was loaded onto Nanosep 30,000 concentrators (Pall Corp.) and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.7, to wash away the unbound LCb. After a 5-min spin to remove aggregates, indicated proteins were loaded in mini-dialysis units (Slide-A-Lyzer, 10,000, Pierce) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against assembly buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.7, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride). The mixtures were then centrifuged at 109,000 × g for 45 min to separate the assembled lattices (pellets) from the free forms (supernatant). Equivalent proportions of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. For quantification of band intensities, gels were scanned and analyzed using NIH Image software.Immunoprecipitation—Bovine brain LCa was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with the HA sequence incorporated immediately subsequent to the ATG codon. Mouse Hip1R-(1–655) was cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pFlag-CMV2 (Sigma) for expression as an N-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion protein. Human 293T cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with both HA-tagged LCa (or mutants) and FLAG-tagged Hip1R (or the empty vector) for 2 days. The lysates were collected in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.75% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG tag (M2, Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After a 2–3 h incubation, the resins were washed 3 times with the same buffer. The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies to the FLAG and HA (HA.11, Covance) tags.Subcellular Fractionation of Assembled Clathrin—293T cells transfected for 2 days were homogenized in buffer D (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) as described previously (25Acton S.L. Wong D.H. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. Jackson A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice with the buffer, and lysed using a Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes) and by passaging twice through 28.5-gauge needles. Unbroken cells were spun away at 1,000 × g for 1 min. The lysates were fractionated at 1,000 × g for 15 min into low-speed pellets (P1, enriched with nuclei, plasma membrane) and supernatant, which were further spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min to high-speed pellets (P2, enriched with Golgi, endocytic compartments and CCVs), and supernatants (S, cytosolic components). Equivalent proportions of each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies to HC (TD.1), Hip1R (BD Biosciences), and actin (AC-40, Sigma) or rabbit antiserum against green fluorescent protein (GFP) (BD Biosciences).Indirect Immunofluorescence—Bovine brain LCb-(1–44) (or mutant) was amplified and cloned into the BglII/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) so that the LC fragment was expressed at the C terminus of GFP. Human 293T cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the GFP constructs for 2 days, and prepared as described (26Towler M.C. Gleeson P.A. Hoshino S. Rahkila P. Manalo V. Ohkoshi N. Ordahl C. Parton R.G. Brodsky F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3181-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hip1R and cortactin were labeled, respectively, with monoclonal anti-Hip1R (BD Biosciences) and anti-cortactin (4F11, Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies, followed by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to stain F-actin. Images were collected by an API DeltaVision DV3 Restoration microscope using a MicroMax 5 MHz cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific), and deconvolution was carried out using the API SoftWoRx software.RESULTSHip1/R Binding to Clathrin Light Chains—To characterize the interaction of Hip1/R with clathrin, a yeast two-hybrid assay was used to map the binding sites for Hip1/R in clathrin components. Consistent with reported properties of the yeast orthologue Sla2p (27Wesp A. Hicke L. Palecek J. Lombardi R. Aust T. Munn A.L. Riezman H. Mol. Biol.

In the assays neither Hip1 nor Hip1R interacted with any portion of the HC, terminal domain (residues 1–495), distal leg (546–1073), or hub (1074–1675). Hip1 was previously shown to interact with the HC terminal domain (13Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J. Hayden M.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol.

Terminal domain constructs (1–495 and 1–546) were tested in the study, but we were restricted to data for the shorter fragment because the other gave positive signals regardless of the presence of any partner. We could not rule out the possibility that the interaction of Hip1/R with HC exists, but based on these assays HC did not seem to have a strong binding site. In contrast, Hip1/R interacted robustly with both LCs (LCb in Fig. 1 and not shown for LCa), consistent with conclusions of earlier protein binding and genetic studies of Hip1R, Hip1, and yeast Sla2p (10Engqvist-Goldstein A ̊.E.

Dimerization and LC interaction were detected for the central region of Hip1R (residues 346–655, Fig. 1B). Hip1 bound weakly to the hinge ear fragment (residues 616–937) of the β-subunit of the AP2 adaptor molecule, but Hip1R did not (Fig. 1B). Presumably, this is because of the presence of the β-ear-binding DPF motif in Hip1 and its absence in Hip1R (13Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J. Hayden M.R.

Hip1 or Hip1R bound the N-terminal portion of both LCa and LCb, but not their central region where HC binds, nor the C terminus (Fig. 2A and not shown for LCa). To identify essential interaction residues, random PCR mutagenesis of the N-terminal region of LCb (residues 1–77) was used to generate mutations that abolished the interaction with Hip1. Hip1 was chosen as a testing partner because its combination with LC gave a stronger signal in the yeast two-hybrid assay than Hip1R (Fig. 2A). Most mutations in the loss-of-binding LC mutants were scattered throughout the first 40 residues, including the conserved LC sequence (residues 20–41, Fig. 2B). This was consistent with the quantitative yeast two-hybrid data, in which the fragment comprising LCb residues 1–44 showed the strongest binding to Hip1 or Hip1R of all the truncated LC fragments tested (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Hip1 and Hip1R bind to the conserved sequence of clathrin light chains LCa and LCb.A, mapping the binding region of Hip1 and Hip1R in bovine brain LCb. Yeast SFY526 cells were co-transformed with human Hip1-(124–1037) or mouse Hip1R-(1–1068) (in pGBT9) and the indicated LCb fragments (in pACT2). Quantitative β-galactosidase assays were performed using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate and results are shown in β-galactosidase units. Units are defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside per min per cell, as described in the Clontech yeast protocols handbook. Above the fragments tested, a diagram of full-length LCb is delineated with the conserved and HC binding regions shaded. Similar results (not shown) were obtained with the equivalent fragments of bovine brain LCa. B, sequences of the mutant fragments of bovine brain LCb-(1–77) that were unable to bind Hip1. AH109 cells harboring Hip1-(124–1037) (in pGBT9) were co-transformed with mutated PCR products of LCb-(1–77) and a gapped prey vector, pACT2. The inserts of the recombinant clones (numbered mutants) unable to interact with Hip1-(124–1037) were sequenced. Mutated residues from the screens are in bold (black and color). Mutation sites tested individually by site-directed mutagenesis are in color: green, no effect on Hip1 binding; orange, a mild effect; and red, eliminated Hip1 binding. Residues of the conserved sequence (20Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol.

The individual mutations generated in the LCb mutants were based on the screen results (Fig. 2B), except for changing residues 32–34 to alanine as part of an initial alanine mutation scan. Quantitative β-galactosidase (β-gal) assays were performed in SFY526 cells harboring bovine brain LCb or mutants (in pACT2) and mouse Hip1R-(1–1068). The results are shown in β-galactosidase units as the mean, and error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate determinations. Asterisks (*) indicate that these mutants showed very weak interaction with Hip1R in a more sensitive filter assay. D, peptide competition assay. The GST Hip1R-(346–655) fragment was first bound to glutathione-Sepharose resins. The indicated concentration of conserved peptide (wild-type, WT; or mutant with changes D22V, I35A, and E39A, MT) was added for 30 min, followed by incubating with recombinant LCb for 1 h. Proteins bound to the affinity resins were assayed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to GST to detect GST-Hip1R or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the conserved region of LCs. As a control, full-length LCb with mutations I35A and E39A were combined with GST-Hip1R and its binding was not detected. E, co-immunoprecipitation of LCa with Hip1R. Human 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Hip1R-(1–655) (or empty vector) and HA-tagged LCa (or mutants with changes I38A or D25V) and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to the FLAG tag. Immunoprecipitateswere analyzed for the presence of Hip1R and LCa by immunoblotting, respectively, with monoclonal antibodies to the FLAG and HA tags. Th"

In a normal population the CAG repeat is polymorphic not only in length but also in the number and localization of its CAA interruptions. The aim of this study was to determine the structure of the repeat region in the normal and mutant SCA2 transcripts and to reveal the structural basis of its normal function and dysfunction. We show here that the properties of the CAA interruptions are major determinants of the CAG repeat folding in the normal SCA2 transcripts. We also show that the uninterrupted repeats in mutant transcripts form slippery hairpins, whose length is further reduced by the base pairing of the repeat portion with a specific flanking sequence.

More than 20 different autosomal dominant SCAs are clinically recognized. For 12 of them the respective genes and implicated mutations are known. In six SCA subtypes, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17, the underlying mutations are the expansions of trinucleotide CAG repeats present in the translated sequences of the functionally unrelated genes. The mutated CAG repeats give rise to expanded polyglutamine tracts in the encoded proteins, and the corresponding SCAs together with Huntington's disease, dentatorubralpalidoluysian atrophy, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy are known as polyglutamine expansion disorders (4Orr H.T.

Typically it is positioned closer to the 3′-end of the CAG repeat and is followed by eight 3′ repeats. Because these SCA2 alleles range in length from 14 to 30 repeats, the pure CAG repeat tracts are most variable in their 5′-part (6-20 repeats). The alleles containing two interruptions occur most frequently in the 8-1-4-1-8 configuration (the interruptions are underlined). Their variants differ by one CAG triplet in one of the three pure repeat tracts (25Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J. Human Mutat. 2004; 24: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Only two SCA2 variants are known to contain three interruptions. They are composed of either 27 or 29 repeats in the 8-1-4-1-4-1-8 and 8-1-4-1-4-1-10 configurations, respectively. In all of the populations studied so far, the most prevalent are two SCA2 alleles containing 22 repeats in the 8-1-4-1-8 and 13-1-8 configurations. They account for about 90% of chromosomes. Uninterrupted normal SCA2 alleles are very rare, whereas the expanded mutant alleles usually lack interruptions (22Pulst S.M. Nechiporuk A. Nechiporuk T. Gispert S. Chen X.N. Lopes-Cendes I.

We have asked intriguing questions related to the possible physiological functions of the SCA2 repeats in RNA and the possible involvement of the mutant transcript structures in SCA2 pathogenesis. More specifically, the questions we have asked were: What is the precise structural role of the CAA interruptions within the CAG repeats? What are the similarities and differences between the repeat interruption systems operating in the SCA1 (16Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41563-41572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and SCA2 transcripts? To gain a still wider insight into the role of the repeat interruptions in RNA, we have extended these comparisons to transcripts from several other human genes containing interrupted CAG repeats. We have also compared the structures of the repeat regions in various normal and mutant SCA2 transcripts and discussed the structural features of the mutant transcripts that could make them involved in RNA-mediated pathogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of DNA Templates and in Vitro Transcription—DNA templates for in vitro transcription were synthesized by PCR from gel-purified SCA2 amplification products (primer sequences SCA2-F, 5′-GCGTTCCGGCGTCTCCTTGG, and SCA2-R, 5′-GGCTTGCGGACATTGGCAGC; GenBank™ NM_002973 positions from 564 to 755) containing different sequence variants of the CAG repeat tracts as described earlier (25Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J. Human Mutat. 2004; 24: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In amplification reactions the forward primer (SCA2-FT7) containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (underlined) 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCCTCACCATGT and reverse primer (SCA2-R) 5′-GGCTTGCGGACATTGGCAGC were used. The PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing: a DNA template (gel-purified PCR product), 1 μm of each primer SCA2-FT7 and SCA2-R, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2,50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm of each of the dNTPs, and 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 s, 60 °C for 1 s, and 72 °C for 30 s.A transcription reaction carried out in a 50-μl volume contained about 10 pmol of DNA template (10-20 μl of the PCR product described above), 400 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Epicenter), 3 mm guanosine, 0.5 mm each of ribo-NTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, and 50 units of RNazin. Incubation was at 37 °C for 1 h. The transcription products were purified in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels, visualized by Stains-all (Serva) staining, extracted from the gel slices by diffusion for 2 h at room temperature in 0.3 m NaOAc, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5 mm EDTA, and recovered by ethanol precipitation. 5′-End labeling was performed with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Epicenter) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol; ICN) at 37 °C for 5 min, and RNA was repurified by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 7.5 m urea and extracted as described above.Nuclease Digestions and Lead Cleavages—Prior to structure probing reactions, the 32P-labeled RNAs were subjected to a denaturation and renaturation procedure in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, by heating the sample at 80 °C for 1 min and then slowly cooling to 37 °C. Limited RNA digestion was initiated by mixing 5 μl of the RNA sample (50,000 cpm) with 5 μl of a probe solution containing either lead ions or nuclease S1 or ribonucleases T1, T2 in three different concentrations: Pb2+, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mm; S1 nuclease, 0.5, 1, and 2 units/μl (1 mm ZnCl2 was present in each reaction); RNase T1, 0.5, 1, 1.5 units/μl; RNase T2, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 unit/μl. RNase H digestion was performed by adding to the transcript solution, after denaturation and renaturation procedure (as above), one of the following three types of oligodeoxynucleotides: libraries of random 6-mers (100 pmol) or random 7-mers (100 pmol) or complementary to CAG repeats oligonucleotide (ctg-ODN) with sequence 5′-TGCTGCT (5 pmol), and RNase H to the final concentration of 0.10 or 0.25 unit/μl. All of the reactions were performed at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (7.5 m urea and 20 mm EDTA with dyes) and sample freezing.Analysis of the Reaction Products—To determine the cleavage sites, the products of lead-induced hydrolysis and nuclease digestion were separated in 10-15% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 19/1) containing 7.5 m urea, 90 mm Tris borate buffer, and 2 mm EDTA, along with the products of alkaline hydrolysis and limited T1 ribonuclease digestion of the same RNA. The alkaline hydrolysis ladder was generated by the incubation of the labeled RNA in formamide containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 at 100 °C for 10 min. The partial T1 ribonuclease digestion of the RNAs was performed under semi-denaturing conditions (10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 3.5 m urea) with 0.2 unit/μl of the enzyme during incubation at 55 °C for 10 min. The cleavage sites characteristic for nucleases S1 and H were determined by comparison with the homologous S1 ladder (not shown). The RNA fragments generated by nucleases S1 and H terminate with 3′-hydroxyls and migrate slower than the corresponding formamide and T1 fragments. Electrophoresis was performed at 1500 V and was followed by autoradiography at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. The products of the structure-probing reactions were also visualized and analyzed by phosphorus imaging (Typhoon; Molecular Dynamics).Electrophoresis in Nondenaturing Conditions—RNA structure homogeneity was analyzed for each transcript by the electrophoresis of radiolabeled samples in 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (dimension, 150/140/1 mm; acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29/1) buffered with 45 mm Tris borate at a fixed temperature of 37 °C. Prior to gel electrophoresis, the 32P-labeled transcripts were subjected to a denaturation and renaturation procedure in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 40 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 by heating the sample at 80 °C for 1 min and slowly cooling it to 37 °C and mixed with an equal volume of 7% sucrose with dyes. Electrophoresis was conducted at a constant power of 15 W.RNA Secondary Structure Modeling—RNA secondary structure prediction was performed using the mfold program version 3.1 (www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold) (30Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). This program is designed to determine the optimal and suboptimal secondary structures of RNA by free energy minimization using the nearest neighbor energy parameters, calculated for 1 m NaCl solution (pH 7.0) at 37 °C.RESULTSAnalyzed Transcripts and Structure Probes—Fourteen different SCA2 transcripts were analyzed in this study (Table I). They included 12 of the 24 normal variants of the SCA2 triplet repeat known to occur in a general population (25Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J. Human Mutat. 2004; 24: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These 12 variants represented all different types of the repeated sequence configuration found in the SCA2 gene. In all transcripts the repeat regions were surrounded by the same specific flanking sequences: 27 nt at the 5′-end and 32 nt at the 3′-end of the repeats. Seven transcripts contained a single CAA interruption at various locations within the repeat tract, and the repeats of three other transcripts harbored two interruptions separated by four pure CAG repeats. In the remaining two normal transcripts, the three centrally located CAA triplets, which were also separated by the (CAG)4, were present (Table I). Two mutant SCA2 transcripts contained the 36 and 37 uninterrupted CAG repeats typical for SCA2 mutations.Fig. 3SCA2 CAG repeats containing one CAA interruption form different branched hairpin structures; variable module M2. A, patterns of nuclease S1 cleavages in three SCA2 transcripts 10-1-8, 12-1-8, and 15-1-8 containing one CAA interruption (marked by a red arrowhead) variably located in the repeat region. Vertical green lines show differences in cleavage patterns between transcripts. Transcripts are ordered according to the increasing total number of repeats. Other designations are as described in the Fig. 1A legend. B, nuclease S1 cleavage patterns generated in three similar SCA2 transcripts containing the following repeat configurations: 13-1-8, 13-1-9, and 14-1-8 (other designations as in Fig. 1A). C, proposed secondary structure of the SCA2 transcripts containing one CAA interruption and either an odd (14-1-8) or an even (13-1-8) total number of repeats. Positions of selected G residues of the CAG repeats are marked, and the localization of the A residues of the CAA interruptions is shown by red ovals. For both transcripts two alternatively folded structural modules M2 are presented (conformer I and conformer II). Each is composed of two hairpins either M2a and M2b or M2a′ and M2b′. The designations of internal loops (a and a′) and hairpin terminal loops (b and c or b′ and c′) are also shown. Invariant structure modules M1 and M3 are not presented except for the uppermost structure. Other designations are as in the legend to Fig. 1C. D, left panel, patterns of ribonuclease T1 cleavages in two transcripts (CAG)17cl and (CAG)16cl(described in Ref. 13Sobczak K. de Mezer M. Michlewski G. Krol J. Krzyzosiak W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5469-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) containing 17 and 16 pure CAG repeats surrounded at both sides with additional complementary sequences, which are marked as G-C clamp in the presented structure models. These transcripts form fixed secondary structures containing either a 7-nt or a 4-nt terminal loop (13Sobczak K. de Mezer M. Michlewski G. Krol J. Krzyzosiak W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5469-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The ranges of cleavages generated by nucleases in these terminal loops are marked with a blue bracket in the electropherograms. The cleavage sites and intensities are shown for three enzymatic probes (as in C) in the terminal loops of the established hairpin structures. Right panel, RNase T1 cleavages generated in the loop b (b′) regions of two SCA2 transcripts 12-1-8 and 13-1-8 representing transcripts with an odd and even total number of repeats. The ribonuclease T1 cuts specific for the alternative terminal loops b and b′ are shown by green and blue lines, respectively. In the 12-1-8 transcript the 7-nt loop b comprises both G5 and G6 residues, and loop b′ harbors G6 and G7 residues. In 13-1-8-transcript the smaller 4-nt terminal loops b and b′ contain only one G residue, G6 or G7, in conformer I and conformer II, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1Cleavage patterns in SCA2 transcripts containing different numbers and localization of CAA interruptions and proposed secondary structure of the repeat flanking regions. A, cleavages generated in three 5′-end-labeled transcripts containing one, two, and three CAA interruptions in the following repeat configurations: 15-1-8, 8-1-4-1-8, and 8-1-4-1-4-1-10 (interruptions are underlined in the figure legend and in addition shown in red in the figure panels). The transcripts were treated with: lead ions (panel Pb), RNase T1 (panel T1), RNase T2 (panel T2), and S1 nuclease (panel S1) at three different probe concentrations (increasing from left to right) specified under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane Ci, incubation control (no probe); lane F, formamide ladder; lane T, guanine-specific ladder obtained with T1 ribonuclease. The positions of nucleotides in the sequences flanking the repeats are italicized. Positions of selected G residues (G1, G2, etc.) of the CAG repeats (roman capital letters) and positions of CAA interruptions (red A letters and red arrowheads) are also shown. Blue arrowheads in the electropherograms show the positions of cleavages, which are similar in all of the analyzed transcripts and discussed in this paper. The S1 cuts in the repeat region, which are different in different transcripts, are indicated by vertical green lines. Fragments of autoradiograms corresponding to sequences forming the structure modules M1, M2, and M3 are also indicated. B, cleavages generated in the 3′-part of the 14-1-8 transcript, forming the M3 module, induced by lead ions, S1 nuclease, and T1 ribonuclease (other designations are as in A). The observed pattern of cleavages in this region is very similar in all of the analyzed transcripts. C, secondary structure model of the repeat region of SCA2 transcripts with invariable structures of the repeat flanking sequences shown in details. The cleavage sites, which are similar in all of the analyzed transcripts, are indicated for each probe used (see figure inset for probe designations and cleavage intensity classification). The RNA structure modules (M1, M2, and M3) are marked. The CAG repeat sequence is shown in red and spanned by arrows. The variable structure of the M2 module is shown schematically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ICharacteristics of repeat interruption patterns in the analyzed SCA2 RNA fragments and the names of in vitro transcriptsNumber of repeatsSequence configurationaThe CAA interruptions are underlinedTranscript nameaThe CAA interruptions are underlinedOne CAA interruption 14(CAG)8CAA (CAG)58-1-5 19(CAG)10CAA (CAG)810-1-8 21(CAG)12CAA (CAG)812-1-8 22(CAG)13CAA (CAG)813-1-8 23(CAG)14CAA (CAG)814-1-8 23(CAG)13CAA (CAG)913-1-9 24(CAG)15CAA(CAG)815-1-8Two CAA interruptions 22(CAG)8CAA(CAG)4CAA(CAG)88-1-4-1-8 23(CAG)8CAA (CAG)4CAA(CAG)98-1-4-1-9 23(CAG)9CAA(CAG)4CAA(CAG)89-1-4-1-8Three CAA interruptions 27(CAG)8CAA(CAG)4CAA(CAG)4CAA(CAG)88-1-4-1-4-1-8 29(CAG)8CAA(CAG)4CAA(CAG)4CAA(CAG)108-1-4-1-4-1-10No interruptions 36bMutant variants derived from SCA2 patients(CAG)36pure(CAG)36 37bMutant variants derived from SCA2 patients(CAG)37pure(CAG)37a The CAA interruptions are underlinedb Mutant variants derived from SCA2 patients Open table in a new tab Structure analysis of all transcripts was performed using five well characterized probes.

https://openalex.org/W2144115944,"Huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) is a component of clathrin coats. We previously demonstrated that HIP1 promotes clathrin assembly through its central helical domain, which binds directly to clathrin light chains (CLCs). To better understand the relationship between CLC binding and clathrin assembly we sought to dissect this interaction. Using C-terminal deletion constructs of the HIP1 helical domain, we identified a region between residues 450 and 456 that is required for CLC binding. Within this region, point mutations showed the importance of residues Leu-451, Leu-452, and Arg-453. Mutants that fail to bind CLC are unable to promote clathrin assembly in vitro but still mediate HIP1 homodimerization and heterodimerization with the family member HIP12/HIP1R. Moreover, HIP1 binding to CLC is necessary for HIP1 targeting to clathrin-coated pits and clathrin-coated vesicles. Interestingly, HIP1 binds to a highly conserved region of CLC previously demonstrated to regulate clathrin assembly. These results suggest a role for HIP1/CLC interactions in the regulation of clathrin assembly. Huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) is a component of clathrin coats.

Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). The formation of CCPs and CCVs is initiated by the assembly of clathrin triskelia into polyhedral cages that drive membrane curvature directly or through the recruitment of proteins that influence membrane dynamics (2Legendre-Guillemin V. Wasiak S. Hussain N.K. Angers A. McPherson P.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Clathrin triskelia are composed of three copies of the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) linked together through a trimerization domain at their C termini (3Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Extending from the trimerization domain are proximal and distal leg segments that end in a globular N-terminal domain (3Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Clathrin assembly occurs through multiple weak interactions between the leg segments (4Wakeham D.E. Chen C.Y. Greene B. Hwang P.K. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4980-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are a variety of proteins that regulate clathrin assembly during endocytosis, most notably the clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP-2). Additional assembly proteins include AP180, epsin, HIP1, and its family member HIP12/HIP1R (5Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Each of these proteins bind directly to clathrin triskelia as well as membrane phospholipids and these properties contribute to their ability to stimulate clathrin assembly at specific sites on the plasma membrane (6Hao W.

Within triskelia, each CHC is generally thought to be bound to one of two clathrin light chains (CLCs), CLCa and CLCb. There is an established role for CLCs in inhibiting clathrin assembly (15Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12710-12714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu S.H. Wong M.L. Craik C.S. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which may be explained by the orientation of CLCs on the CHC. Through a domain in the central region, CLCs bind to the proximal leg of the CHC with their C termini oriented toward the trimerization domain (17Chen C.Y. Reese M.L. Hwang P.K. Ota N. Agard D. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6072-6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Ybe J.A. Ruppel N. Mishra S. VanHaaften E. Traffic. 2003; 4: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The N termini may make a U-turn halfway along the proximal leg folding back toward the trimerization domain (19Nathke I.S. Heuser J. Lupas A. Stock J. Turck C.W. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 899-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or they may extend along the proximal leg (20Kirchhausen T. Toyoda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10268-10273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In either scenario, the N-terminal region could be oriented on the proximal leg in a manner that could inhibit the self-association of CHCs necessary for assembly. Interestingly, the N termini of the CLCs contain a domain that is conserved among all isoforms and throughout evolution (21Brodsky F.M. Hill B.L. Acton S.L. Nathke I. Wong D.H. Ponnambalam S. Parham P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 208-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and this domain has been implicated in the ability of CLCs to regulate clathrin assembly (22Ybe J.A. Greene B. Liu S.H. Pley U. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The identification of binding partners for CHC and CLCs has allowed for an increased understanding of the regulation of clathrin assembly but the mechanistic details of this process remain poorly defined. HIP1 is a newly described component of the coats of CCVs that binds to the N-terminal domain of the CHC through a clathrin box sequence LMDMD and to AP-2 through sequences that match consensus AP-2-binding motifs DPF and FXDXF (10Metzler M.

Electron microscopic analysis of the cages formed by HIP12/HIP1R-mediated assembly reveals that 85% are 60–80 nm in diameter similar to the cages formed with other assembly proteins such as AP-2 and AP180 (11Engqvist-Goldstein A.E.

Together, these properties demonstrate a role for HIP1 and HIP12/HIP1R in the regulation of clathrin assembly. To further understand the relationship between the function of HIP1 to assemble clathrin in vitro and its direct binding to CLCs, we have identified the sites in HIP1 that mediate CLC interactions and have generated point mutations that block CLC binding and in vitro clathrin assembly. Moreover, we have determined that HIP1 binds to the N-terminal domain of the CLCs that has been implicated in the regulation of clathrin assembly. These data further support a role for HIP1 in the formation of CCPs and CCVs.

After 48 h, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 154 mm NaCl, 58 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4) and then lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.4, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. Lysates were centrifuged at 245,000 × gmax for 15 min and the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with various GST fusion proteins pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were subsequently washed 3 times in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. For other binding assays, purified His6-tagged fusion protein (15 μg) in buffer A was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were subsequently washed 3 times in buffer A. For all assays, proteins specifically bound to the beads were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Overlays of enriched fractions of coat proteins prepared from adult rat brain CCVs were performed as described (14Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J.

CCV Purification and Clathrin Assembly Assays—Clathrin from brain CCVs and CCVs from transfected HEK-293 cells were purified as described previously (14Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M.

Clathrin assembly assays were performed with 0.5 μm purified clathrin and different concentrations (0.5–2 μm) of fusion proteins in a final volume of 90 μl of clathrin assembly buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5). Assembly was conducted at physiological pH and was initiated at 4 °C by addition of 10 μl of 1 m MES, pH 6.5–6.7. The mixture was kept on ice for 45 min and then centrifuged at 400,000 × gmax for 6 min. The proteins in the supernatant and pellet were separated by SDS-PAGE and were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, transfected with 0.8 μg of DNA with Genejuice (Novagen) and were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using standard protocols. A Motif within the Helical Domain of HIP1 Is Necessary for CLC Binding and Clathrin Assembly—Through its helical domain, HIP1 promotes clathrin assembly in vitro and binds directly to the CLC (14Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J. Hayden M.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19897-19904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To better understand the relationship between these two activities, we sought to identify the CLC-binding site by designing a series of HIP1 helical domain deletion constructs that were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1A) and tested for binding to CLCb in pull-down assays. Sequential deletion of residues from 610 to 456 does not markedly affect the binding of HIP1 to CLCb (Fig. 1B). Although slightly lower levels of binding were observed for GST-HIP1-(336–463) and GST-HIP1-(336–456) compared with the full-length helical domain, this is likely because of the lower levels of fusion protein expressed for these constructs (Fig. 1B). In contrast, deletion to residues 449, 442, or 435 abolishes CLCb interactions (Fig. 1B). These data suggest a CLC-binding site in HIP1 between residues 449 and 456. Surprisingly, GST-HIP1-(436–463) containing this site does not bind to CLCb (data not shown), suggesting that a region upstream of residue 436 is also necessary for CLCb binding. We next tested whether HIP1 deletion constructs promote clathrin assembly in vitro. GST-HIP1-(336–546) and GST-HIP1-(336–463), which bind to CLCb stimulate clathrin assembly, whereas GST-HIP1-(336–435) neither binds to CLCb nor promotes assembly (Fig. 1C and data not shown). We also performed assembly assays with GST-HIP1-(276–335) and GST-HIP12-(302–348), two fusion proteins that bind to the terminal domain of the CHC (10Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J. Hayden M.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19897-19904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Neither construct promotes assembly (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that GST fusion protein binding to clathrin is by itself not sufficient to cause clathrin sedimentation. These results provide a correlation between the ability of HIP1 to bind to CLC and stimulate clathrin assembly in vitro. The region between residues 450 and 456 in HIP1 contains the tripeptide 450DLL. DLL motifs have been implicated in the clathrin assembly activity of AP180 although this appears to involve binding to the CHC (28Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Hao W. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8667-8676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of HIP1 with HIP12/HIP1R revealed an ELL tripeptide in HIP12/HIP1R at position 463 that aligns with the HIP1 450DLL motif, as well as a DLL tripeptide starting at position 569. We thus generated GST-HIP1- and GST-HIP12-helical domain fusion proteins in which the DLL or ELL tripeptides were replaced with AAA (Fig. 2A). In contrast to GST-HIP1-(336–610) and GST-HIP12-(349–644), which bind directly to CLCb, mutation of 450DLL in HIP1 and 463ELL in HIP12 abolish CLCb binding (Fig. 2B). Mutation of 569DLL in HIP12 has no effect on this interaction (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the DLL and ELL sequences in HIP1 and HIP12/HIP1R, respectively, contribute to CLC binding. To support that the fusion proteins were properly expressed, we performed pull-down assays with wild-type and mutant fusion proteins using lysates from cells transfected with HIP1 or HIP12. Mutation in the CLC-binding site on HIP1 and HIP12 does not affect the ability of these fusion proteins to form heterodimers or homodimers (Fig. 2C). We next tested for the ability of the mutated fusion proteins to promote clathrin assembly in vitro. GST-HIP1-AAA does not promote assembly as compared with reactions performed in the absence of fusion protein, whereas HIP12-AAA-DLL shows slight assembly activity (Fig. 2D). Both of these constructs show significantly less assembly activity than GST-HIP12-ELL-AAA, for which clathrin appears in the pellet fraction at the expense of the supernatant (Fig. 2D). These results provide further evidence that HIP1 and HIP12/HIP1R promote clathrin assembly through interactions with CLCs. CLC Interactions Target HIP1 to CCPs and CCVs—We previously observed that a HIP1 construct lacking the helical domain failed to enrich on CCVs isolated from transfected HEK-293 cells (10Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To test if the localization of HIP1 is dependent on CLC interactions, we generated full-length HIP1-450AAA mutants tagged with FLAG. In pull-down assays, Flag-HIP1-450AAA failed to bind to GST-CLCb, whereas binding was readily detected for the WT protein (Fig. 3A) and both proteins bound equally well to a GST construct encoding the α-ear of AP-2 (data not shown). As described previously, Flag-HIP1-WT, like CHC, is enriched on CCVs isolated from transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, Flag-HIP1-450AAA is not enriched on CCVs compared with the homogenate. We next examined the intracellular localization of these constructs in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence. Flag-HIP1-WT shows a discrete punctuate staining that is similar to that seen for endogenous HIP1 (10Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and which is highly co-localized with endogenous AP-2 (α-adaptin) at CCPs (Fig. 3C). In contrast, Flag-HIP1-450AAA has a diffuse distribution displaying little co-localization with α-adaptin (Fig. 3C). Essentially identical results are obtained using Ds-Red-tagged HIP1 constructs (data not shown). A slight enrichment of both Flag-HIP1-WT and Ds-Red-HIP1-WT in a perinuclear pool likely corresponding to the trans-Golgi network was observed in a proportion of transfected cells (29Carreno S. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Zhang C.X. McDonald K.L. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and this staining was also lost in 450AAA mutants (data not shown). These data suggest that the binding of HIP1 to CLC is necessary for its targeting to CCPs and CCVs. HIP1 Binds Directly to the Regulatory Region of the CLCb—We next sought to identify the binding site for HIP1 on the CLC. Based on the work of Brodsky and colleagues (17Chen C.Y. Reese M.L. Hwang P.K. Ota N. Agard D. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6072-6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we designed various deletion constructs of the CLCb (Fig. 4A) and tested them for binding to the purified His6-tagged HIP1 helical domain. As expected, full-length GST-CLCb binds to His6-HIP1-(336–610) (Fig. 4B). Similar binding is observed for a C-terminal deletion construct, GST-CLCb-(1–165) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, a construct with an N-terminal deletion, GST-CLCb-(77–228), and a construct encoding the CHC binding site, GST-CLCb-(90–157), fail to bind to HIP1 (Fig. 4B). The N-terminal segment of CLCb-(1–77) contains a region encompassing residues 20–41, which has been described previously to be a regulatory domain for clathrin assembly activity (22Ybe J.A. Greene B. Liu S.H. Pley U. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Importantly, a full-length CLCb construct with a deletion of this region, GST-CLCb-(Δ20–41), fails to bind HIP1 (Fig. 4B). Within this domain are 3 acidic residues critically important for the regulatory activity (22Ybe J.A. Greene B. Liu S.H. Pley U. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a GST construct encoding full-length CLCb, in which these residues are mutated to uncharged residues (GST-CLCb-(EED/QQN)), fails to bind HIP1 (Fig. 4B). To ensure that the CLCb constructs used in these experiments are functional, we tested them in overlay assays on purified coat fractions from adult rat brain CCVs. As shown in Fig. 4C, GST-CLCb-(1–228) recognizes a band that corresponds to the CHC and a second band that corresponds to HIP12/HIP1R, the major HIP isoform expressed in adult rat brain CCVs (14Legendre-Guillemin V.

In contrast, GST-CLCb-(Δ20–41) and GST-CLCb-(EED/QQN) recognize only the CHC and not HIP12/HIP1R (Fig. 4B). GST alone does not recognize any proteins (Fig. 4B). Together, these results suggest that HIP1 and HIP12/HIP1R bind directly to the regulatory region of the CLC and are in fact the first binding partners described for this important domain. The demonstration that acidic residues in the regulatory region of CLCb are necessary for HIP1 binding is not ob"

We have used NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling to provide direct evidence that tetrameric platelet factor-4 (PF4) and dimeric interleukin-8 (IL8), two members of the CXC chemokine family, readily interact by exchanging subunits and forming heterodimers via extension of their antiparallel β-sheet domains. We further demonstrate using functional assays that PF4/IL8 heterodimerization has a direct and significant consequence on the biological activity of both chemokines. Formation of heterodimers enhances the anti-proliferative effect of PF4 on endothelial cells in culture, as well as the IL8-induced migration of CXCR2 vector-transfected Baf3 cells. These results suggest that CXC chemokine biology, and perhaps cytokine biology in general, may be functionally modulated at the molecular level by formation of heterodimers. This concept, in turn, has implications for designing chemokine/cytokine variants with modified biological properties.

CXC chemokines, which are known to self-associate as dimers and tetramers, exhibit high sequence and three-dimensional structural homology at both the tertiary (monomer) and quaternary (dimer and tetramer) levels. Each folded CXC chemokine monomer has an aperiodic, two-disulfide bond-stabilized N-terminal segment, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet domain, and a C-terminal α-helix that is folded onto the generally amphipathic β-sheet (5Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Dimers are formed by intermolecularly extending the monomer β-sheet into a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (originally termed AB-type dimer (6St Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Tetramers are formed by β-sheet sandwiching of two AB-type dimers (6St Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native PF4 dimers associate asymmetrically into tetramers (6St Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in an N-terminal PF4 chimera (PF4M2), dimers associate symmetrically into tetramers with little change in biological activity (7Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Milius R. Barker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). IL8 forms AB-type dimers and is not known to tetramerize (8Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 9Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Baldwin E.T.

A. 1991; 88: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Despite sequence and structure similarities, PF4 and IL8 mediate different biological activities. Although first recognized to bind heparin and act as an anticoagulant, PF4 is also known as an anti-angiogenic agent (11Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IL8 binds heparin more weakly and can promote angiogenesis (11Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). The angiogenic functional difference may be due, at least in part, to N-terminal sequence differences. PF4 lacks the IL8 N-terminal tripeptide Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif, which is known to mediate IL8 receptor binding and subsequent signal transduction (13Strieter R.M. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Arenberg D.A. Burdick M.D. Kasper J. Dzuiba J. Damme VanJ. Walz A. Marriott D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27348-27357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). In addition, PF4 tetramer formation may also contribute to these functional variations. Given biophysically determined dissociation constants (Kd) (14Burrows S.D. Doyle M.L. Murphy K.P. Franklin S.G.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and taking into account normal physiological concentrations (nano- to picomolar range), these CXC chemokines would exist in solution mostly dissociated as monomers for IL8 and as a distribution of monomers, dimers, and tetramers for PF4. However, because Kd values were determined by using chemically pure proteins and nonphysiological conditions, the actual aggregate state distribution in vivo remains unknown because of the milieu of other biomolecules with which these proteins could interact. In vitro, IL8 has been shown to function both as a monomer and dimer (17Clark-Lewis I. Kim K.S. Rajarathnam K. Gong J.H. Dewald B. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In its well known capacity to bind heparin, PF4 functions optimally as a tetramer in vitro (18Mayo K.H. Ilyina E. Roongta V. Dundas M. Joseph J. Lai C.K. Maione T. Daly T.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Mikhailov D. Young H.C. Linhardt R.J. Mayo K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25317-25329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and presumably as a tetramer in vivo due both to the presence of heparan sulfate normally found on the surface of cells and because it is released from α-granules of platelets in relatively large quantities upon tissue injury. Previous studies (20Dudek A.Z. Nesmelova I. Mayo K. Verfaillie C.M. Pitchford S. Slungaard A. Blood. 2003; 101: 4687-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Broxmeyer H.E. Sherry B. Cooper S. Lu L. Maze R. Beckmann M.P. Cerami A. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3448-3458PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that mixing various chemokines in solution can significantly modify their biological activities, but no thorough explanation as to why this occurs has been given. Here we use NMR spectroscopy and computational modeling to demonstrate that when present together in solution, CXC chemokines PF4 and IL8 interact with each other and exchange subunits to form AB-type heterodimers. Although structurally highly similar in their monomer folds, native PF4 and the PF4M2 N-terminal chimera were both used in these NMR studies with IL8, because they do show key differences in their quaternary structures at dimer interfaces, as well as in their dimer and tetramer dissociation constants. Moreover, PF4M2 yields better defined NMR spectra, primarily because of its forming symmetric tetramers and exhibiting less chemical exchange broadening. In biological terms, we demonstrate that formation of PF4/IL8 heterodimers is biofunctionally correlated, by examining the concentration-dependent influence of PF4 on IL8-induced migration of vector-transfected Baf3 cells, as well as the influence of IL8 on anti-proliferative effects of PF4 against endothelial cells (EC). These findings further suggest that heteroassociation between/among other structurally homologous members of the chemokine family, and perhaps among members of various cytokine subfamilies, may be a general occurrence and may be responsible for modulating chemokine/cytokine biology on the molecular level in vivo. Proteins—Recombinant PF4, PF4M2, and IL8 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (22Yang Y. Daly T.J. Barry J.K. La Rosa G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—Uniformly 15N-labeled freeze-dried PF4 or PF4M2 were dissolved in H2O/D2O (9:1) mixture containing 20 mm NaCl. pH was adjusted to 5.0 by adding 1-μl increments of 0.1 m HCl or 0.1 m NaOH to the samples. These solutions of PF4 or PF4M2 were used alone and with the addition of increasing concentrations of unlabeled IL8. After each addition, the pH of the solution was adjusted to maintain the same value. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of PF4 and PF4M2 were recorded to monitor chemical shift changes upon addition of increasing concentrations of IL8. The chemical shifts are quoted in parts per million (ppm) downfield from sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane sulfonate. HSQC spectra were acquired at 40 °C on a Varian Unity Inova 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with an H/C/N triple-resonance probe and x/y/z triple-axis pulse field gradient unit. The solvent deuterium signal was used as a field-frequency lock. Carrier frequencies for 15N and 1H were positioned at 116.5 and 5.2 ppm, respectively. A gradient sensitivity-enhanced version of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC was applied with 400 (t1) × 2048 (t2) complex data points and spectral widths of 2500 Hz in t1(15N) and 9000 Hz in t2(1H) dimensions. Raw data were converted and processed by using NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11278) Google Scholar) and were analyzed by using NMRview (24Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). NMR Diffusion Measurements—Diffusion measurements were performed on the same NMR spectrometer. The maximum magnitude of the gradient, g, was calibrated using Varian deuterated water standard. Measurements were performed using WIF-PGSE pulse sequence (25Nesmelova I.V. Idiyatullin D. Mayo K.H. J. Magn. Res. 2004; 166: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), an improved pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) pulse sequence that employs water flip-back and WATERGATE (26Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3486) Google Scholar) combined with a heteronuclear filter and allows determination of the diffusion coefficient of labeled protein in a mixture. The diffusion coefficient, D, of the molecule of interest, was estimated from the diffusion attenuation of spin-echo by using Equation 1, A(g2)=A(0)exp(−γ2δ2g2D(Δ−δ/3(Eq. 1) where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio for protons; δ is the duration of the pulsed field gradient, and Δ is the spacing between the front edges of pulsed field gradients. Determination of Equilibrium Constants Using Diffusion Data—Using diffusion data and known dissociation equilibrium constants for pure native PF4, PF4M2, and IL8 (7Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the equilibrium dissociation constant, KHD, was estimated for PF4/IL8 and PF4M2/IL8 heterodimers as described below. The distribution of PF4 and IL8 homoaggregates in the solution is readily obtained by using the following Equations 2 and 3, c=cM+2⋅cD+4⋅cT(Eq. 2) KD=cM⋅cMcD; KT=cD⋅cDcT=cM4KD2⋅cT(Eq. 3) where c is the total molar concentration of protein; cM, cD, and cT are the concentrations of monomers, dimers, and tetramers, respectively, and KD and KT are the equilibrium dissociation constants for dimer and tetramer, respectively. When PF4 and IL8 are mixed together, aggregate redistribution occurs according to Equation 4, amp;KTamp;TPF4amp;↔amp;DPF4+DPF4amp;KDamp;DPF4amp;↔amp;MPF4+MPF4amp;KDamp;DIL8amp;↔amp;MIL8+MIL8amp;KHDamp;HDamp;↔amp;MPF4+MIL8(Eq. 4) where M, D, T, and HD denote monomer, dimer, tetramer, and heterodimer, respectively. Equation 2, which gives the total concentration of protein, can therefore be rewritten to include the concentration of heterodimers, cHD, as shown in Equation 5, c=cM+2⋅cD+4⋅cT+cHD(Eq. 5) Here there are four unknowns. Thus, three additional equations are required to calculate the concentration of monomers, homodimers, homotetramers, and heterodimers. By assuming that the equilibrium dissociation constants for homoaggregation remain the same upon mixing IL8 and PF4 (or PF4M2), two of these equations are known (see Equation 3), and the third (Equation 6) describes the diffusion coefficient for PF4, amp;D2D1=PMDM+PDDD+PHDDD+PTDTPMDM+PDDD+PTDTamp;PM=cMc, PD=2⋅cDc, PT=4⋅cTc, PHD=cHDc(Eq. 6) D1 and D2 are diffusion coefficients for pure PF4 and for PF4 upon addition of IL8. PM, PD, PT, PHD are populations of monomers, dimers, tetramers, and heterodimers, respectively. To greatly simplify analysis, we assume that dimers and tetramers are spherical, allowing us to express the diffusion coefficient using the Stokes-Einstein relationship, D = kT/6πηR, where T is the temperature, R is the radius of the molecule, and η is the viscosity of pure solvent as shown in Equation 7, DD=123DM, DT=143DM(Eq. 7) Solving Equations 3, 5, and 6 yields the concentration of monomers, homodimers, homotetramers, and heterodimers. The PF4/IL8 heterodimer dissociation constant, KHD, was estimated by using Equation 8, KHD=cM(of PF4)⋅cM(of IL8)cHD(Eq. 8) Molecular Dynamics Simulations—The x-ray or NMR structures of PF4 (6St Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PF4M2 (7Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Milius R. Barker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and IL8 (8Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) were taken from the Protein Data Bank (27Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26207) Google Scholar). The Protein Data Bank entries were 1RHP, 1PFN, and 1IL8. Crystallographic water molecules were deleted. Hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structure by using the HBUILD module of CHARMM (28Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13765) Google Scholar). The ionization state of the system was set at pH 5.0, the pH value used in experimental studies. At this pH value, the total charge on monomers was +9e (PF4), +11e (PF4M2), and +6e (IL8). Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for homodimers of IL8, PF4, and PF4M2 and heterodimers of PF4/IL8 and PF4M2/IL8. In all instances, two types of dimers were constructed, AB-type and β-sheet sandwiched type. PF4/IL8 and PF4M2/IL8 AB-type heterodimers were formed by manually replacing one of the monomer subunits from an AB-type dimer of native PF4 or PF4M2 with a monomer subunit from IL8, following superposition of PF4 or PF4M2 and IL8 homodimers. To construct PF4/IL8 and PF4M2/IL8 β-sheet sandwiched heterodimers, two adjacent and overlapping monomers from each AB-type dimer in the PF4 tetramer were first removed, leaving the β-sheet sandwiched homodimer. Then an IL8 monomer was superimposed onto one of the sandwiched monomer subunits and that PF4 subunit was deleted. All initial structures were built using the Insight-II program (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA). Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the c29b2 version of CHARMM (28Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13765) Google Scholar). A one nanosecond trajectory was simulated for each hetero- and homodimer. The time step in these simulations was 1 fs, and coordinates were saved at 1-ps time intervals. All dimers were simulated in a 74 × 63 × 63 Å3 explicitly solvated periodic box. After solvation, water molecules closer than 2.8 Å from the protein, as well as from other water molecules, were removed. To make the total charge of the box 0, Cl- ions were added to the water box. Simulations were carried out using the version 22 all-hydrogen force field (29MacKerell A.D.J. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L.J. Evanseck J. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph D.

Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11420) Google Scholar) with a dielectric constant of 1.0. Van der Waals interactions were truncated at 13 Å by using a shifted smoothing function, and electrostatic interactions were calculated with the particle mesh Ewald method (30Darden T.A. York D.M. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). Each simulation was initialized with 2000 steps of steepest descent minimization, followed by gradual heating to 300 K and 5000 steps of system equilibration. The temperature during simulations was maintained at 300 K. Bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE method (31Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16333) Google Scholar). Endothelial Cell Proliferation—Human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (HUVEC) were harvested from normal human umbilical cords by perfusion with 0.125% trypsin/EDTA. Harvested HUVECs were cultured in gelatin-coated tissue culture flasks and subcultured 1:3 once a week in culture medium (RPMI 1640 with 20% human serum, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin). Proliferation of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated (10 ng/ml) HUVEC cultures was measured by quantification of [3H]thymidine incorporation and expressed as mean counts/min of triplicate cultures in three independent experiments (±S.E.). EC were seeded at 5000 cells/well in flat-bottomed fibronectin-coated tissue culture plates and grown for 3 days in the absence or presence of regulators, in culture medium. During the last 6 h of the assay, the culture was pulsed with 0.3 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine/well. Chemotaxis of Vector-transfected Baf3 Cells—Migration of Baf3 cells, bone marrow-derived pro-B-cell line transfected with the human CXCR1 or CXCR2 receptors, in response to IL8 in the absence and presence of PF4 was tested using Boyden chambers following standard procedure (32Leonard E.J. Sylvester I. Yoshimura T. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Warren S. Current Protocols in Immunology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 Baf3/hCXCR2 or Baf3/hCXCR1 cells were plated in 100 μl of Gey's balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin into the upper chamber of a 96-well chemotaxis plate (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) equipped with a 5-μm pore size polycarbonate filter. The average number of receptors per cell was estimated to be 1 × 106 as determined by using fluorescently labeled receptor antibodies and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Varying concentrations of chemoattractants (IL8 alone or together with PF4) were added to the lower chamber in aliquots of 75 μl. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °Cina5%CO2 incubator, cells that migrated to the lower chamber were transferred to a new 96-well plate and stained overnight at 37 °C with Reasurin (R & D Systems). The relative fluorescence from each well was determined using a spectrofluorimeter equipped with filters for excitation at 544 nm and emission at 590 nm. The number of migrated cells was expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU). Chemotaxis dose-response curves were analyzed using the following hyperbolic function shown in Equation 9, RFU=RFUmax⋅[D⋅R][D⋅R]+KE(Eq. 9) where [D·R] is the molar concentration of IL8 dimer (D)-receptor (R) complexes, and KE is the value of [D·R] that elicits half-maximal RFU. Assuming that IL8 dimers bind to receptor as expressed in Equation 10, amp;KDRamp;D+Ramp;↔amp;D⋅R(Eq. 10) the concentration [D·R] is found using the law of mass action and is expressed in terms of the total number of receptors, R0, as given in Equation 11, [D⋅R]=[R0]⋅[D]KDR+[D](Eq. 11) where [D] is the concentration of IL8 dimers, and KDR is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the D·R complex. Combining Equations 9 and 11 yields the following dependence of RFU on the IL8 dimer concentration as shown in Equation 12, RFU=RFUmax⋅[R0]⋅[D][R0]⋅[D]+KE([D]+KDR)(Eq. 12) The same equation for PF4/IL8 heterodimer receptor binding was obtained by assuming that binding of the heterodimer to the receptor is described by the following equilibrium shown in Equation 13. amp;KHDRamp;HD+Ramp;↔amp;HDR(Eq. 13) Interactions between PF4 (PF4M2) and IL8 Defined Using NMR—To investigate molecular interactions between PF4 and IL8, nonisotopically enriched IL8 was titrated into a solution of uniformly 15N-enriched PF4, and chemical shift changes in 15N-PF4 were monitored by recording 1H-15N HSQC spectra upon addition of IL8. Fig. 1A shows two overlayed HSQC spectra, one with 15N-PF4 alone (blue cross-peaks) and the other with 15N-PF4 and IL8 at a molar ratio of 1:1 (red cross-peaks). Notice in Fig. 1A that PF4 cross-peaks are not all symmetric and, in fact, appear as multiple resonances for most spin systems. This arises for two reasons. 1) PF4 exists in solution in a distribution of monomer-dimer-tetramer states that undergo slow exchange on the chemical shift time scale (15Chen M.J. Mayo K.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6402-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Mayo K.H. Chen M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 2) PF4 monomer/dimer subunits associate into tetramers asymmetrically (6St Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of the present experiments, the latter reason is primary because PF4 tetramers predominate (33Mayo K.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this regard, PF4 resonance assignments cannot be definitively made but can be tentatively made for some residues by analogy with 1H-15N HSQC spectra of homologous PF4M2 as presented in Fig. 1B (blue cross-peaks). PF4M2 is a PF4 chimera in which the N terminus of PF4 is replaced with the N terminus of IL8. Because PF4M2 forms symmetric tetramers resulting in a well defined set of cross-peaks, complete 1H/15N resonance assignments and structure analysis were possible (7Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Milius R. Barker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By comparing 1H-15N HSQC spectra for PF4M2 and native PF4, some tentatively assigned cross-peaks for native PF4 have been labeled in the Fig. 1A. Addition of IL8 to 15N-PF4 induces chemical shift changes in many resonances. Some sets of multiple resonances for a given residue appear to coalesce or to vary in their intensity ratios as exemplified in Fig. 2 for residues His-23, His-35, Ala-43, and Gly-48. In other instances, apparent single cross-peaks merely shift. This is illustrated for residues Ile-42 and Ile-63 at the bottom of Fig. 2. Overall, observed chemical shift changes for 1H and 15N range up to 0.06 and 0.5 ppm, respectively. Some resonances are more affected than others, whereas some apparently are not affected, supporting the idea that interactions between PF4 and IL8 are specific. The change in chemical shift for tentatively assigned residues is plotted in bar graph format in Fig. 3A. The largest chemical shift changes (for cross-peaks that could be assigned) are observed for residues located at the interface of monomer subunits, which from analysis of the x-ray structure of native PF4 (6St Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are as follows: β-strands 1 and 2 of the antiparallel β-sheet along with the loop that connects them (residues 25–45), the hairpin which connects β-strands 2 and 3 (residues 46–49), a part of the C-terminal α-helix (residues 64–70), and various residues within the N terminus like His-23. Tyr-60 changes significantly, most likely because it is a bulky aromatic residue that is sandwiched between the affected C-terminal helix and the β-sheet.Fig. 2Expanded regions of 1H-15N HSQC spectra from Fig. 1A. The addition of IL8 to 15N-PF4 causes some sets of multiple resonances for a given residue to coalesce, vary their intensity ratios, or merely shift. This is exemplified for residues His-23 and Ala-43, His-35 and Gly-48, and Ile-42 and Ile-63, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 31H and 15N chemical shift differences, Δδ, between pure PF4 (A) and PF4M2 (B) and PF4 (or PF4M2) to which IL8 has been added at a molar ratio of 1:1, averaged according to ((Δδ(1H))2 + 0.2(Δδ(15N))2)1/2.

We recently demonstrated that glucocorticoids and β2-agonists additively or synergistically suppress tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced production of chemokines eotaxin and interleukin-8 (IL-8), respectively, in human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, which may partly explain their combined benefits in asthma. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) also modulate inflammatory gene expression. We reported here that the PPARγ agonists 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) and troglitazone, but not PPARα agonist WY-14643, inhibited TNFα-induced production of eotaxin and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) but not IL-8. Eotaxin inhibition was transcriptional and additively enhanced by the glucocorticoid fluticasone and the β2-agonist salmeterol, whereas MCP-1 inhibition was post-transcriptional and additively and synergistically enhanced by fluticasone and salmeterol, respectively. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that 15d-PGJ2 induced a protein-protein interaction between PPARγ and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in TNFα-treated HASM cells, which was enhanced by fluticasone and salmeterol. 15d-PGJ2, fluticasone, and salmeterol all inhibited TNFα-induced histone H4 acetylation at the eotaxin promoter and NF-κB p65 binding to the eotaxin promoter and induced PPARγ and GR association with the eotaxin promoter, as analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Our data suggest that chemokine expression in HASM cells is differentially regulated by PPARγ agonists and that the interaction between PPARγ and GR may be responsible for the additive and synergistic inhibition of chemokine expression by PPARγ agonists, glucocorticoids, and β2-agonists, particularly the chromatin-dependent suppression of eotaxin gene transcription. The interaction may have wide applications and may provide a potential target for pharmacological and molecular intervention.

The interaction may have wide applications and may provide a potential target for pharmacological and molecular intervention. Asthma is a common chronic disease featured by airway inflammation. Inflammatory cells are key players in the inflammatory process of asthma and are attracted to the airways by a network of chemokines (1Chung K.F. Barnes P.J. Thorax. 1999; 54: 825-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Mast cells and eosinophils are the most important inflammatory cells in asthmatic airways (2Wills-Karp M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), and neutrophil infiltration is associated with asthma exacerbations (3Fahy J.V. Kim K.W. Liu J. Boushey H. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Eosinophils are attracted by chemokines such as eotaxin, IL-5, 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Act D, actinomycin D; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Flut, fluticasone; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GCs, glucocorticoids; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; HASM, human airway smooth muscle; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; IP, immunoprecipitation; IPs, immunoprecipitates; 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; Salme, salmeterol; TRO, troglitazone; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; ENH, enhancer; PRM, promoter; ANOVA, analysis of variance.1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Act D, actinomycin D; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Flut, fluticasone; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GCs, glucocorticoids; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; HASM, human airway smooth muscle; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; IP, immunoprecipitation; IPs, immunoprecipitates; 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; Salme, salmeterol; TRO, troglitazone; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; ENH, enhancer; PRM, promoter; ANOVA, analysis of variance. and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), and neutrophils are recruited by chemokines such as IL-8 (4Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. Page C.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 515-596PubMed Google Scholar). Eotaxin and IL-8 are also mast cell chemotactic factors (5Brightling C.E. Bradding P. Pavord I.D. Wardlaw A.J. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2003; 33: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and MCP-1 also attracts T-lymphocytes and monocytes (4Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. Page C.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 515-596PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated that human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells produce a number of important chemokines such as IL-8 (6Pang L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2509-2515PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), eotaxin (8Pang L. Knox A.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), MCP-1 (9Wuyts W.A. Vanaudenaerde B.M. Dupont L.I. Demedts M.G. Verleden G.M. Eur. Respir. J. 2003; 22: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), RANTES, and GM-CSF (10Hallsworth M.P. Twort C.H.C. Lee T.H. Hirst S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and is an important source of chemokines in the airways, consequently contributing to the orchestration and perpetuation of airway inflammation. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms of chemokine gene expression and regulation in HASM cells will have important implications for the regulation of airway inflammation in asthma. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to a subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are potentially important transcription factors that modulate inflammatory responses (11Blanquart C. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Glineur C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). PPARs are comprised of three isoforms, α, β(δ), and γ, and are activated by a heterogeneous group of structurally dissimilar endogenous and synthetic agonists. Of these PPAR agonists, the prostaglandin D2 metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) is a direct-binding natural ligand for PPARγ (12Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). It has been documented that PPARγ agonists may play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory process and may become a new class of anti-inflammatory compounds (11Blanquart C. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Glineur C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 13Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3227) Google Scholar, 14Su C.G. Wen X. Bailey S.T. Jiang W. Rangwala S.M. Keilbaugh S.A. Flanigan A. Murthy S. Lazar M.A. Wu G.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that regulation of chemokine expression by PPARγ activation is cell-, stimulus-, and gene-specific. For instance, 15d-PGJ2 induces IL-8 expression, reduces MCP-1 expression, and has no effect on RANTES expression in human monocytes/macrophages (15Zhang X. Wang J.M. Gong W.H. Mukaida N. Young H.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7104-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas it reduces both IL-8 and MCP-1 gene expression in colon epithelial cells (14Su C.G. Wen X. Bailey S.T. Jiang W. Rangwala S.M. Keilbaugh S.A. Flanigan A. Murthy S. Lazar M.A. Wu G.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We have shown that PPARα and -γ are constitutively expressed in HASM cells and that activation of PPARγ, but not PPARα, induces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (16Pang L. Nie M. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PPARγ activation also inhibits GM-CSF and G-CSF production, whereas glucocorticoid dexamethasone inhibits only GM-CSF in HASM cells (17Patel H.J. Belvisi M.G. Bishop-Bailey D. Yacoub M.H. Mitchell J.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2663-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the effects of PPAR agonists on other chemokine expression in HASM cells have not been investigated so far. Glucocorticoid receptors (GR), like PPAR, are ligand-activated nuclear receptors, and glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly applied in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. β2-Agonists promote bronchodilation by increasing intracellular cAMP and stimulating cAMP-dependent protein kinases. We have recently reported that β2-agonists synergistically and additively enhance the inhibitory effect of GCs on TNFα-induced IL-8 and eotaxin production, respectively (7Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Pang L. Knox A.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), from HASM cells, which may partially explain their combined benefits in asthma therapy (18Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). However, many patients have persistent symptoms despite these treatments. Approaches seeking new therapeutic targets for asthma treatment are therefore required. The study of crystal structures has revealed that nuclear receptors share highly conserved ligand-binding domain, denominated activation function-2, which is necessary for transcriptional activation (19Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Because steroids estrogen, progesterone, and GCs interact with each other (20Meyer M. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and GCs also interact with β2-agonists on chemokine production (7Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Pang L. Knox A.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PPARγ agonists, 15d-PGJ2 in particular, could interact with GCs and β2-agonists on chemokine expression. In unstimulated cells, DNA is packaged into a highly organized and dynamic protein-DNA complex known as chromatin. The fundamental subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped twice around an octomer core of four histones (two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) (21Beato M. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This nucleosomic structure prevents the access of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to their respective recognition sequences and the initiation of transcription (22Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). When the cells are stimulated with inflammatory mediators, histones undergo an array of post-transcriptional modifications on N-terminal domains, including acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation (23Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar), which result in chromatin remodeling and transcription factors binding to specific gene promoters, leading to the initiation of gene transcription (24Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The local hyper-acetylation of histone H4 at a specific gene promoter plays a key role in the regulation of gene transcription (24Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 25Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2349) Google Scholar). GR activation has been shown to suppress inflammatory gene transcription by inhibiting histone acetylation associated with specific gene promoters (24Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 26Ito K. Jazrawi E. Cosio B. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30208-30215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); whether PPARγ has a similar effect is not yet known. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulation of TNFα-induced eotaxin, MCP-1, and IL-8 expression by PPAR agonists, either alone or in combination with GCs and β2-agonists and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin and streptomycin, l-glutamine, amphotericin B, recombinant human TNFα, Me2SO, actinomycin D (Act D), and other unspecified chemicals were all purchased from Sigma; fetal calf serum was from Seralab (Loughborough, UK); WY-14643, 15d-PGJ2, and troglitazone (TRO) were from Calbiochem; salmeterol (Salme) and fluticasone propionate (Flut) were kindly supplied by Professor Malcolm Johnson (Glaxo-SmithKline, Middlesex, UK); ELISA kits for human eotaxin, MCP-1, and IL-8 were from R&D Systems (Abingdon, Oxon, UK); RNeasy mini kit was from Qiagen (West Sussex, UK); Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase was from Invitrogen; and FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was from Roche Diagnostics. Anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Milton Keynes, UK); anti-p65, -PPARγ, and -GRα antibodies and normal rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—Primary HASM cells were prepared from explants of HASM as reported previously (27Pang L. Knox A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (4 mm) in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. This protocol was approved by the Nottingham City Hospital Research Ethics Committee. Cells at passage 6 were used for all experiments. We have shown previously that the cells grown in this manner depict the immunohistochemical and morphological features of typical HASM cells (27Pang L. Knox A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). HASM cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates and growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to experiments in fresh serum-free medium unless otherwise stated. Because we have reported previously that HASM cells produce ample amounts of eotaxin (8Pang L. Knox A.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and IL-8 (7Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) after 8 h of stimulation with TNFα (10 ng/ml), this time point was chosen to examine the drug effects. In the concentration-response or drug combination experiments, the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations or a single concentration of drug(s) or the drug vehicle Me2SO (maximum concentration 0.4%) for 0.5 h and then stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 8 h. The supernatants were collected and stored at –20 °C until ELISA for chemokines, whereas in some experiments total RNA was extracted from the cells and stored at –20 °C until further detection of mRNA by RT-PCR. Chemokine Assays—The concentrations of eotaxin, MCP-1, and IL-8 in the culture media were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions as reported previously (7Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Pang L. Knox A.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the ELISA kits at our hands was at least 5 pg/ml, which was consistent with the manufacturer's specifications. According to the kit insert, there is no significant cross-reactivity or interference with other human cytokines and chemokines. RT-PCR—After treatment, total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer's protocol and transcribed into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase. cDNA from one sample was simultaneously applied to detect levels of eotaxin, MCP-1, and IL-8 mRNA and the internal control GAPDH mRNA. The primer sequences were as follows: GAPDH forward, 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′; eotaxin forward, 5′-GGATCCAACATGAAGGTCTCCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAATTCTTATGGCTTTGGAGTTGGAG-3′; MCP-1 forward, 5′-GATCTCAGTGCAGAGGCTCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCTTGTCCAGGTGGTCCAT-3′; IL-8 forward, 5′-ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTC-3′. cDNA samples were annealed at 95 °C for 5 min and amplified for 30 cycles (eotaxin, 95 °C for 1 min, 63 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 10 s; IL-8 and MCP-1, 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 10 s, 72 °C × 10 s) followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were separated on 3% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. RNA Stability—Confluent and growth-arrested HASM cells were incubated with or without TNFα for 2 h and then treated with the drugs or drug vehicle Me2SO for 2 h before adding Act D (5 μg/ml) for the times indicated to block new transcript generation. Total RNA was then extracted from the cells, and eotaxin mRNA level was analyzed by RT-PCR using the full-length eotaxin coding region primers described above. Plasmids and Transient Transfection—The firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs in pGL3-basic vectors containing the full-length eotaxin promoter fragment (–1363) were obtained from Professor Robert Schleimer (Johns Hopkins University) and were described previously (28Matsukura S. Stellato C. Plitt J.R. Bickel C. Miura K. Georas S.N. Casolaro V. Schleimer R.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6876-6883PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8 promoter fragment (–1481 to +44) was digested with XhoI and HindIII from the IL-8 PUX-CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter plasmids (a gift from Professor Kouji Matsushima, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan, see Ref. 29Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was then ligated into the XhoI-HindIII site of the pGL3-basic plasmid upstream to the translation initiation site of the firefly luciferase gene. The resulting construct was verified by sequencing. Because deletion analysis has shown that the transcription of MCP-1 is manipulated by two 5′-flanking regions, the distal enhancer region (ENH) and the proximal promoter region (PRM) (30Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okuno T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar), we obtained the 167-bp human MCP-1 PRM between –107 and +60 by digesting with XhoI and HindIII of the pGLM-PRM (a gift from Professor Atsuhisa Ueda, Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan, see Ref. 31Ueda A. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31092-31099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and the 230-bp human MCP-1 ENH between –2742 and –2513 by digesting with KpnI and XhoI of the pGLM-ENH (also from Professor Atsuhisa Ueda, see Ref. 31Ueda A. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31092-31099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The juxtaposed MCP-1 ENH fragment (–2742/–2513) and PRM fragment (–107/+60) were then ligated into the KpnI-HindIII site of the pGL3-basic plasmid to generate firefly luciferase reporter gene construct pGL3-MCP-1-ENH-PRM. The pCMX vectors expressing wild-type PPARγ were the generous gift from Professor Mitchell Lazar (University of Pennsylvania) and were described previously (32Wang C. Fu M. D'Amico M. Albanese C. Zhou J.N. Brownlee M. Lisanti M.P. Chatterjee V.K. Lazar M.A. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3057-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was performed as described previously (16Pang L. Nie M. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Nie M Pang L. Inoue H. Knox A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9233-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HASM cells in 24-well plates were grown to 60–70% confluence and then transfected with 0.4 μg/well of the reporter gene plasmids for 16 h. Transfected cells were pretreated with or without drugs for 0.5 h and then incubated with or without TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. To assess the roles of PPARγ agonists, cells were cotransfected with increasing concentrations of pCMX-PPARγ together with the reporter gene plasmids for 16 h, and transfected cells were pretreated with or without 15d-PGJ2 (1 μm) for 0.5 h before incubation with or without TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. Firefly luciferase activity was determined as described before (16Pang L. Nie M. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Nie M Pang L. Inoue H. Knox A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9233-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). ChIP Assay—ChIP assay was performed as described previously (24Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 33Nie M Pang L. Inoue H. Knox A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9233-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent and serum-deprived HASM cells in 90-mm dishes were pretreated with or without drugs for 0.5 h and then incubated with or without TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 2.5 h. The cells were then incubated with 1% formaldehyde to fix protein-DNA complexes. Chromatin pellets from these cells sheared by sonication were pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA-saturated protein A- and G-Sepharose. One portion of the soluble chromatin was used as DNA input control, and the remains were sub-aliquoted and then precipitated using specific antibodies against acetylated histone H4 or transcription factors NF-κB p65, PPARγ, or GRα (the most abundant GR isoform). The purified DNA from the immunoprecipitated complexes of antibody-protein-DNA was detected by semi-quantitative PCR (28 cycles) using the following specific primer pairs spanning promoter regions that contain major regulatory elements such as NF-κB: for eotaxin promoter, forward, 5′-CTTCATGTTGGAGGCTGAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGATCTGGAATCTGGTCAGC-3′; for IL-8 promoter, forward, 5′-TTCACCAAATTGTGGAGCTT-3′, and reserve, 5′-GAAGCTTGTGTGCTCTGCTG-3′. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Confluent and serum-starved HASM cells were pretreated with or without the drugs for 0.5 h and then incubated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. Nuclear proteins were extracted from the cells, and protein concentrations were measured as described previously (16Pang L. Nie M. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Nie M Pang L. Inoue H. Knox A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9233-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was conducted as described previously (26Ito K. Jazrawi E. Cosio B. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. J. Biol.

After microcentrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-PPARγ, anti-GRα rabbit polyclonal antibody, or normal rabbit IgG overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads for 3 h. The immune complexes were washed with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and pelleted by gentle centrifugation, and the presence of GRα in the resulting immunoprecipitates (IPs) was analyzed by Western blotting (19Glass C.K.

Effects of PPAR Agonists Flut and Salme on TNFα-induced Chemokine Production—Because only PPARα and PPARγ are expressed in HASM cells (16Pang L. Nie M. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J.

As shown in Fig. 1, the production of eotaxin, IL-8, and MCP-1 was markedly increased by TNFα treatment (10 ng/ml, 8 h). Both 15d-PGJ2 and TRO markedly inhibited TNFα-induced eotaxin production (Fig. 1A) and partially but significantly inhibited MCP-1 production (Fig. 1E) in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on IL-8 production (Fig. 1C). In contrast, WY-14643 had no effect on the production of all three chemokines (Fig. 1, A, C, and E). The glucocorticoid Flut concentration-dependently inhibited TNFα-induced eotaxin (Fig. 1B), IL-8 (Fig. 1D), and MCP-1 production (Fig. 2F), whereas the β2-agonist Salme partially inhibited eotaxin production (Fig. 1B) but had no effect on IL-8 (Fig. 1D) and MCP-1 production (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that TNFα-induced chemokine production in HASM cells is differentially regulated by PPARγ agonists as well as GCs and β2-agonists.Fig. 2Effects of 15d-PGJ2 together with Flut or Salme on TNFα-induced eotaxin, IL-8, and MCP-1 production.

Flut alone at 0.001 and 0.01 μm also inhibited the production.

MYH has been shown to interact with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in both human and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe systems. Here we show that S. pombe (Sp) MYH physically interacts with all subunits of the PCNA-like checkpoint protein heterotrimer, SpRad9/SpRad1/SpHus1, in yeast extracts and when the individual subunits are expressed in bacteria. The SpHus1 and SpPCNA binding sites are located in discrete regions of SpMYH. Immunoprecipitation assays reveal that the interaction between SpHus1 and SpMYH increases dramatically after hydrogen peroxide treatment, and this increase in the SpHus1-SpMYH interaction correlates with the presence of SpHus1 phosphorylation. In contrast, the interaction between SpPCNA and SpMYH after hydrogen peroxide treatment remains nearly unchanged. SpMYH associates with SpHus1 in a complex of ∼450 kDa, the reported native molecular mass of the SpRad9/SpRad1/SpHus1-MYC complex. A larger portion of SpMYH shifts to the 150–500-kDa regions after hydrogen peroxide treatment in comparison with untreated extracts. SpHus1 phosphorylation is substantially reduced in SpMYHΔ cells after hydrogen peroxide treatment. These data suggest that MYH may act as an adaptor to recruit checkpoint proteins to the DNA lesions.

Cell cycle checkpoints are surveillance mechanisms that monitor chromosome structure and coordinate DNA repair during cell cycle progression (1Canman C.E. Curr.

Defects in proper checkpoint controls are associated with a number of human pathologies (4Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 5Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The checkpoint controls are highly conserved from yeast to humans. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, six genes known as the rad checkpoint genes (rad9, rad1, hus1, rad17, rad3, and rad26), are required for proper functioning of the checkpoints and DNA replication under stress (6Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Each of these checkpoint genes has a mammalian homolog. It has been reported that Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 form a heterotrimer complex (referred to as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; 9-1-1 complex, Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 heterotrimer complex; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related protein; GO or 8-oxoG, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; h, human; HA, hemagglutinin; MSH, MutS homolog; OGG1, 8-oxoG glycosylase; MYH, MutY homolog; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Sc, S. cerevisiae; Sp, S. pombe. -like 9-1-1 complex) and are related in structure to the PCNA sliding clamp (6Caspari T.

Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The S. pombe (Sp) Rad17 protein is homologous to the largest subunit of replication factor C, the clamp loader. SpRad3, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein, is homologous to human ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein) and ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related protein) kinases. SpRad3 plays a central role in cell cycle check point regulation. It acts to initiate cell cycle arrest by transducing the DNA damage signal through phosphorylation of SpChk1 and SpCds1 kinases in a SpRad9/Rad1/Hus1 and SpRad17-dependent manner. SpHus1 is also phosphorylated by SpRad3 in response to DNA damage (9Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The SpRad26 protein is the homolog of human ATR-interacting protein and forms a complex with SpRad3. Because myriad forms of DNA lesions are caused by endogenous and environmental factors, the mode through which checkpoint proteins recognize these various forms of DNA damage is still poorly understood. Human ATM/human ATR/SpRad3 and Rad17 are proposed to act at an early step to sense DNA damage (10Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these checkpoint proteins may detect a common intermediate, such as single-stranded DNA coated by replication protein A, which is processed by various DNA repair pathways (11Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar), or they may require a series of “adaptors” to recognize DNA damage. Potential candidates for such adaptor proteins are the DNA damage recognition proteins. Recently, a few DNA damage recognition proteins involved in mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and double-strand break repair have been shown to interact with checkpoint proteins (12Brown K.D. Rathi A. Kamath R. Beardsley D.I. Zhan Q. Mannino J.L. Baskaran R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Giannattasio M. Lazzaro F. Longhese M.P. Plevani P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15387-15392Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These reports support a hypothesis that DNA repair proteins recognize the lesions and provide signals for checkpoint factors. In this work, we investigate the possible association of S. pombe checkpoint proteins with the base excision repair protein MutY homolog (MYH). Cells possess several DNA repair pathways for dealing with the many different types of DNA lesions. Reactive oxygen species are the most prevalent source of DNA lesions in aerobic organisms. Oxidative damage to DNA can result in mutagenesis, in some cases leading to degenerative diseases. One of the most abundant and highly mutagenic forms of oxidative damage to DNA is 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG or GO), which causes G:C to A:T transversions. Although the eukaryotic mismatch repair protein MSH2/MSH6 (MutSα) heterodimer can recognize A/GO mismatches (16Mazurek A. Berardini M. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 8260-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Ni T.T. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 439-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the GO lesions in DNA are repaired mainly by base excision repair pathways. The 8-oxoG glycosylase (OGG1) protein, a functional eukaryotic homolog of Escherichia coli MutM, can remove both ring-opened purine lesions and mutagenic GO adducts if they are paired with cytosines (18Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Radicella J.P. Dherin C. Desmaze C. Fox M.S. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, no OGG1 or MutM homolog has been found in S. pombe. S. pombe possesses a MutY homolog (SpMYH) that is an adenine DNA glycosylase able to remove adenines misincorporated on the template DNA strand containing G or GO, thus preventing G:C to T:A mutations (22Lu A.-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fission yeast deficient in SpMYH have a spontaneous mutation rate ∼40-fold higher than the wild type cell and express higher sensitivity to oxidative agents (23Chang D-Y. Gu Y. Lu A.-L. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have shown that MYH directly associates with PCNA in both S. pombe and human cells (24Chang D.Y. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11853-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S-H. Singh K.K. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We also provided direct evidence that the association between MYH and PCNA is important biologically for MYH function in mutation avoidance (24Chang D.Y. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11853-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that the base excision repair pathway may be coupled with DNA replication through the MYH interaction with PCNA, targeting repair toward the daughter DNA strands (24Chang D.Y.

A similar mechanism for mismatch repair to target the daughter DNA strands has also been proposed (29Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), although PCNA has been demonstrated to modulate the polarity of excision steps during mismatch repair (32Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate for the first time that SpMYH physically interacts with all three subunits of the SpHus1/SpRad1/pRad9 complex. SpHus1 interacts with SpMYH at a region that is separate from the SpPCNA-interaction motif. Moreover, the interaction of SpMYH and SpHus1 is enhanced after hydrogen peroxide treatment through which the resulting oxidative stress promotes phosphorylation of SpHus1. However, both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated SpHus1 interact with SpMYH. Hydrogen peroxide treatment and deletion of SpHus1 alter the elution profiles of SpMYH during gel filtration chromatography. SpHus1 phosphorylation is dependent on SpMYH expression after hydrogen peroxide treatment. These results support a model in which the DNA damage recognition protein MutY serves as an “adaptor” for checkpoint protein recognition of DNA lesions.

Construction of Hemagglutinin (HA)- and His-tagged SpHus1, SpRad1, SpRad9 Fusion Proteins—The cDNA of SpHus1, SpRad1, and SpRad9 were amplified by PCR from an S. pombe cDNA library in pGADGH (kindly provided by D. Beach, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the appropriate primers (listed in Table I). To construct HA-tagged proteins, the SpHus1 and SpRad1 cDNA were amplified with the primer pairs Hus-5-Xho/Hus-3-HA and Rad1–5-Xho/Rad1–3-HA, respectively. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and BamHI, cloned into pSLF172, and transformed into S. pombe 201402 by electroporation. Transformed cells with the ura+ phenotype were selected on Edinburgh minimal medium plates supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml leucine and adenine (33Morera S. Klar A. Nurse P. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 795-863Google Scholar). To produce His-tagged proteins, SpHus1, SpRad1, and SpRAD9 cDNA were cloned into pET21a using the primer pairs Hus-5-Nde/Hus-3-Hind, RAD1–5-NDE/RAD1–3-BAM, and Rad9–5-Nhe/Rad9–3-PET, respectively. The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, cloned into pET21a, transformed into E. coli BL21-Star cells (Invitrogen), and selected via ampicillin resistance. All clones were confirmed through DNA sequencing.

The truncated SpMYH cDNA fragments were PCR-amplified using appropriate primers (listed in Table I) from the template pGEXSPMYH and were ligated into pGEX-4T-2 at the BamH1 site and transformed into E. coli BL21-Star cells (Invitrogen). The sequences of the cloned genes were confirmed through DNA sequencing. GST Pull-down Assay—GST-pull-down assays were performed in a manner similar to previously described procedures (25Parker A.

E. coli (BL21Star/DE3) cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) harboring the expression plasmids were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 25 °C. Protein expression was induced at an A590 of 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were harvested 16 h later by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The cell paste from a 1-liter culture was resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4). After sonication, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. To the supernatant (10 ml), 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Bioscience) in PBS was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The GST fusion proteins bound to the beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and then washed 5 times with 5 ml of PBS. The beads were suspended in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) to form a 50% slurry and stored at 4 °C. GST constructs (300 ng) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with PBS, then incubated with 500 μg of E. coli or yeast extracts prepared as described by Chang et al. (23Chang D-Y. Gu Y. Lu A.-L. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) overnight in 200 μl of PBS at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min, the supernatant was saved, and the pellets were washed 5 times with 1 ml of PBS. The pellets and supernatants were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blot analysis (34Towbin H.T. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). A control was run concurrently with immobilized GST alone. Nickel-agarose Affinity Binding—The His-tagged SpHus1 expressed in BL21-star cells was bound to nickel-agarose (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Purified SpMYH (200 ng) expressed in E. coli (22Lu A.-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were incubated with the beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with buffer N (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) containing 50 mm imidazole, the bound proteins were eluted by buffer N containing 250 mm imidazole. The unbound and eluting fractions were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Affinity-purified SpMYH polyclonal antibodies (35McGoldrick J.P. Yeh Y-C. Solomon M. Essigmann J.M. Lu A.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for Western blotting analysis. Treatment of S. pombe with H2O2—Fission yeast (hus1-MYC) and (SpMYHΔ hus1-MYC) cells (250 ml) were grown in YEPD medium (20 g of peptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of dextrose/liter) to an A595 of ∼0.6. Hydrogen peroxide was added to the culture at a final concentration of 6 mm. After shaking at 30 °C for 1 h, cells were spun down and transferred to fresh YEPD medium without hydrogen peroxide. After various recovery time intervals, cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS for protein extraction via sonication. λ-Phosphatase Treatment—For λ phosphatase treatment, 10 μg of yeast (hus1-MYC) cell extract was added to a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.01% Brij35. The dephosphorylation reaction was carried out with 2 μl (800 units) of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 30 °C for 1 h. Dephosphorylation of SpHus1 protein was determined by Western blot analysis using a c-Myc antibody (Santa Crutz Biotechnology, Santa Crutz, CA). Co-immunoprecipitation—Extracts of yeast (hus1-MYC) in PBS containing Sigma protease inhibitor mixture were prepared as described by Chang et al. (23Chang D-Y. Gu Y. Lu A.-L. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and precleared by the addition of 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1–4 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min, the supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of anti-SpMYH antibody (35McGoldrick J.P. Yeh Y-C. Solomon M. Essigmann J.M. Lu A.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) was added and incubated for 4–12 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was saved, and the pellet was washed 5 times with 800 μl of PBS. The pellet was then reconstituted in 1× SDS loading buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). The pellet fractions were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analyses (34Towbin H.T. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar) for SpMYH, SpPCNA, and SpHus1 were performed utilizing antibodies against SpMYH (35McGoldrick J.P. Yeh Y-C. Solomon M. Essigmann J.M. Lu A.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hPCNA (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), and c-Myc (Santa Crutz Biotechnology, Santa Crutz, CA), respectively. Size Fractionation—Yeast cells were grown to log phase in 1 liter of YEPD medium. Hydrogen peroxide treatment was performed as described above followed by cell recovery for 2 h in fresh YEPD medium lacking hydrogen peroxide. After being harvested by centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 10 ml of PBS and sonicated for 6 cycles of 10 s sonication followed by 20 s of rest. After centrifuging at 10,000 rpm in a SS34 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (approximate 15 ml) was treated with 65% ammonium sulfate. The protein precipitant was resuspended in buffer S (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Nonidet P-40), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) and dialyzed against the same buffer for 3 h. The dialyzed protein sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant (1 mg of protein in 0.5 ml) was loaded onto a 24-ml Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer S. The flow rate was set to 0.25 ml per min, and 0.25-ml fractions were collected. The column was calibrated using size makers (blue dextran, thyroglobin, apoferritin, β-amylase, bovine serum albumin, oval albumin, and carbonic anhydrase) from Sigma/Aldrich. Physical Interaction between SpMYH and SpHus1 in S. pombe—The PCNA sliding clamp has been shown to interact with many proteins containing a common motif (36Zhang P. Mo J.Y. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L.

In light of the observation that the Hus1/Rad1/Rad9 heterotrimer is structurally related to the homotrimer PCNA (6Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we tested whether SpMYH is able to interact with SpHus1. The physical interaction between SpMYH and the SpHus1 protein was demonstrated using a GST pull-down assay. GST-SpMYH fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with extracts derived from fission yeast cells expressing HA-tagged SpHus1. Detection of bound SpHus1 was performed via Western blot analysis using an antibody against the HA peptide. As shown in Fig. 1A, HA-SpHus1 could be pulled down by GST-SpMYH (lane 4) but not by GST alone (lane 2). To determine a direct interaction between SpHus1 and SpMYH, His-tagged SpHus1, expressed in E. coli, was bound to Ni2+-agarose and incubated with purified SpMYH protein. SpMYH was found to bind to Ni2+-agarose-bound SpHus1 but not to Ni2+-agarose beads associated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that SpMYH can directly associate with SpHus1 in the absence of SpRad1 and SpRad9. SpPCNA and SpHus1 Bind to Separate Regions of SpMYH—It has been reported that the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex resembles the PCNA homotrimer but contains unique features likely adapted to its role in checkpoint control (39Kaur R. Kostrub C.F. Enoch T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3744-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have shown that the SpPCNA binding site is located at the C terminus of SpMYH, involving residues 434–448 (24Chang D.Y. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11853-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test whether SpPCNA and SpHus1 bind to the same region of SpMYH, we analyzed the ability of SpHus1 to bind to a GST-fused truncated SpMYH (N433 containing residues 1–43"

The ApoA-I structure was analyzed to detect the site bound by Hpt. ApoA-I was treated by cyanogen bromide or hydroxylamine; the resulting fragments, separated by electrophoresis or gel filtration, were tested by Western blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for their ability to bind Hpt. The ApoA-I sequence from Glu113 to Asn184 harbored the binding site for Hpt. Biotinylated peptides were synthesized overlapping such a sequence, and their Hpt binding activity was determined by avidin-linked peroxidase. The highest activity was exhibited by the peptide P2a, containing the ApoA-I sequence from Leu141 to Ala164. Such a sequence contains an ApoA-I domain required for binding cells, promoting cholesterol efflux, and stimulating LCAT. The peptide P2a effectively prevented both binding of Hpt to HDL-coated plastic wells and Hpt-dependent inhibition of LCAT, measured by anti-Hpt antibodies and cholesterol esterification activity, respectively. The enzyme activity was not influenced, in the absence of Hpt, by P2a. Differently from ApoA-I or HDL, the peptide did not compete with hemoglobin for Hpt binding in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments. The results suggest that Hpt might mask the ApoA-I domain required for LCAT stimulation, thus impairing the HDL function. Synthetic peptides, able to displace Hpt from ApoA-I without altering its property of binding hemoglobin, might be used for treatment of diseases associated with defective LCAT function.

All the cells are supplied with cholesterol and cholesteryl esters by endocytosis of another major class of lipoproteins, namely the low density lipoprotein, but some cell types (steroidogenic cells) use docking receptors to bind just ApoA-I to allow the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL (1Acton S.

The ratio of cholesteryl ester to unesterified cholesterol in HDL, a value correlated with the total cholesterol amount in the lipoprotein (HDL-C), is therefore assumed to reflect the LCAT activity in vivo (17Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. Witt R.T. Lipids. 1997; 32: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Sorci-Thomas M.G. Thomas M.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ApoA-I structure have been reported to be associated with low HDL-C and decreased stimulation of enzyme activity (18Sorci-Thomas M.G. Thomas M.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is conceivable that any factor interacting with ApoA-I might interfere with such activity or, more generally, the reverse cholesterol transport. ApoA-I can bind haptoglobin (Hpt) in blood (19Rademacher B.E. Steele W.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Kunitake S.T. Carilli C.T. Lau K. Protter A.A.

Abrescia P. Zygote. 1999; 7: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hpt is a plasma oligomeric glycoprotein exhibiting enhanced levels during the acute phase of inflammation; it presents in humans three distinct phenotypes (determined by genetic polymorphism) with different prevalence in several diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (22Langlois M.R. Delanghe J.R. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). This binding was suggested to influence the role of HDL in cholesterol transport. Actually, Hpt was found to inhibit ApoA-I-dependent LCAT activity in vitro (23Balestrieri M. Cigliano L. De Simone M.L. Dale B. Abrescia P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and to associate with low reverse cholesterol transport in human ovarian follicular fluid (24Cigliano L. Spagnuolo M.S. Dale B.

Balestrieri M. Abrescia P. Steroids. 2001; 66: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hpt has long been known to capture and transport free hemoglobin (Hb) to the liver in the pathway of iron recycling for erythropoiesis (29Sutton H.E. Prog. Med. Genet. 1970; 7: 163-216PubMed Google Scholar). Hb has been reported to compete with ApoA-I for binding Hpt, although Hb interacts with an Hpt site that is different from that involved in the ApoA-I binding (30Spagnuolo M.S. Cigliano L. Abrescia P. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The inhibitory role of Hpt in the regulation of the HDL-dependent removal of cholesterol excess from peripheral cells, though of great interest in studies on diseases associated with cholesterol accumulation, has been poorly investigated. Hpt-dependent masking of the ApoA-I site involved in the LCAT stimulation was suggested to be responsible for decreased enzyme activity (23Balestrieri M. Cigliano L. De Simone M.L. Dale B. Abrescia P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Spagnuolo M.S. Cigliano L. Abrescia P. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, high Hpt levels, as present in the acute phase of inflammation, might impair cholesterol removal from peripheral cells, including vascular cells, and play an important role in worsening vascular endothelial dysfunction and accelerating atherosclerosis. Mapping the Hpt binding site of ApoA-I was therefore required to get more information about the biochemical mechanism(s) underlying the negative control of Hpt on reverse cholesterol transport. Major aims of this work were to identify the Hpt binding site in the amino acid sequence of ApoA-I by using protein chemical fragmentation and peptide synthesis techniques and to demonstrate that peptides sharing the sequence of this site are able to compete with ApoA-I or HDL for binding Hpt. The effect of such peptides on Hpt in LCAT inhibition and Hb binding experiments was also studied. Use of these peptides in therapy of diseases associated with defective reverse cholesterol transport is proposed. Chemicals of the highest purity, BSA, human serum albumin, cholesterol, cholesteryl linoleate, human Hpt (mixed phenotypes: Hpt 1–1, Hpt 1–2, Hpt 2–2), rabbit anti-human Hpt IgG, GAR-HRP, GAR-P, p-nitrophenylphosphate, o-phenylenediamine, avidin-HRP, CNBr, HA, piperidine, 1,2-ethandithiol, triisopropylsilane, and molecular weight markers were purchased from Sigma. Human ApoA-I and rabbit anti-human ApoA-I IgG were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol (45 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sephadex G-50F (Amersham Biosciences), and PVDF transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were used. Amino acids and HATU were purchased from Novabiochem. Organic solvents from Romil (Cambridge, UK), polystyrene 96-well plates from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark), and Sil-G plates for thin layer chromatography (0.25 mm thickness) (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) were used. ApoA-I Cleavage and Chromatography of the Fragments—Cleavage of ApoA-I with CNBr or HA was performed as previously described (31Corsico B. Toledo J.D. Garda H.A. J. Biol.

The digestion products (100–150 μg) were loaded onto a column of Sephadex G-50F (0.6 × 24 cm) and eluted in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) with a 3.5-ml/h flow rate at room temperature. Fractions of 90 μl were collected and 45-μl aliquots, as duplicates, were assayed by ELISA with anti-ApoA-I and GAR-HRP IgG. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The electrophoresis of peptides from ApoA-I cleavage by CNBr or HA was performed in denaturing and reducing conditions essentially as previously described (33von Schagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), but 2-mm-thick gels (length, 10 cm) with 20 or 16.5% polyacrylamide, respectively, were used. Triosephosphate isomerase, myoglobin, α-lactalbumin, aprotinin, and insulin chain B (26.6, 17, 14.2, 6.5, and 3.5 kDa, respectively) were used as molecular mass markers. After electrophoresis (7 h, 100 V), the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid containing 25% isopropanol, stained with Coomassie R-250 (0.05% in the fixing solution), and destained in 10% acetic acid. Fixing and staining were omitted when the gel was processed for immunoblotting. Western blotting onto PVDF membrane and staining by antibodies were carried out essentially as previously described (21Porta A. Cassano E. Balestrieri M. Bianco M. Picone R. De Stefano C. Abrescia P. Zygote. 1999; 7: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In particular, proteins were transferred under electric field, using a semi-dry blot unit (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) for 3 h at 4 °C. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 mg/ml Hpt in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS). After treatment (1 h, 37 °C) with rabbit anti-Hpt IgG (1:100 dilution in T-TBS), the membrane was incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with GAR-HRP IgG (1:300 dilution) and finally stained. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides partially overlapping the ApoA-I sequence were synthesized by solid phase, using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (34Chan W.D. White P.D. Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar) with acetylated or biotinylated N termini and amidated C termini. The synthesis of the amide peptides was performed in a model 348Ω Advanced Chemtech multiple peptide synthesizer using a PAL-PEG-PS resin (Perseptive Biosystem, Hamburg, Germany). The N-terminal residue was labeled using two equivalents of N-(+)-biotinyl-6-aminoexanoic acid (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany), two equivalents of HATU, and four equivalents of N,N diisopropylethylamine in N,N dimethylformamide overnight at room temperature. Cleavage of peptides from the resin was achieved by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, triisopropylsilane, water, 1,2-ethandithiol (90:2.5:2.5:5, v:v:v:v) at room temperature. Then all peptides were precipitated by ethyl ether, dissolved in appropriate mixtures of acetonitrile and water, and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (Juppiter; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). In high performance liquid chromatography, linear increasing gradients of acetonitrile in water (in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) were used. All peptides were recovered by lyophilization. Peptide purity was checked by analytical high performance liquid chromatography. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight by a Voyager instrument (Perseptive Biosystems) was used to ascertain peptide identity. ELISA—ELISA was performed essentially as previously reported (30Spagnuolo M.S. Cigliano L. Abrescia P. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In particular, microtiter plate wells were coated by incubation with a 45-μl aliquot from separated chromatography fractions or 1 μg of antigen (Hpt, HDL, or Hb) in 50 μl of 7 mm Na2CO3, 17 mm NaHCO3, 1.5 mm NaN3 (pH 9.6). Wells were incubated with 55 μl of primary antibody, 45 μl of ApoA-I cleavage products from G-50F, or 55 μl of biotinylated peptide (1, 3, 10, 30 μm). Anti-Hpt IgG (1:1500 dilution in T-TBS supplemented with 0.25% BSA) or anti-ApoA-I IgG (1:1000 dilution) was used as primary antibody. Bound immunocomplexes or peptides were incubated (1 h at 37 °C) with 60 μl of GAR-HRP IgG or avidin-HRP diluted as primary antibody, 1:3000 and 1:10000, respectively. Color development was monitored at 492 nm as previously described (21Porta A. Cassano E. Balestrieri M. Bianco M. Picone R. De Stefano C. Abrescia P. Zygote. 1999; 7: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In experiments of competition of peptide with ApoA-I for Hpt binding, wells were coated with Hpt. Mixtures of 1.5 μm biotinylated peptide with different amounts of ApoA-I (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.5 μm) in T-TBS supplemented with 0.25% BSA were incubated in the wells for 2 h at 37 °C. Peptide binding was detected by avidin-HRP as mentioned above. In experiments of competition of peptide with HDL for Hpt binding, the wells were coated with HDL. Mixtures of Hpt (1 μm) with peptide (0, 1, 5, 10, or 20 μm) or ApoA-I (10 μm) in CB-TBS buffer (5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% BSA, 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3) were kept for 2 h at 37 °C and then incubated in the wells (2 h, 37 °C). The binding of Hpt was detected by anti-Hpt IgG and GAR-HRP IgG as described above. In experiments of competition of peptide with Hb for Hpt binding, mixtures of Hpt (1 μm) with different amounts (0, 3, 6, 10, or 20 μm) of peptide or ApoA-I or HDL in CB-TBS buffer were kept for 2 h at 37 °C and then incubated in Hb-coated wells (2 h, 37 °C). The binding of Hpt to Hb was detected by anti-Hpt IgG, GAR-P, and color development at 405 nm as previously described (30Spagnuolo M.S. Cigliano L. Abrescia P. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Commercial preparations of Hpt (mixed phenotypes) contain isoforms of different relative abundance. The protein molarity was expressed as concentration of monomer, that is the Hpt unit containing one subunit β (40 kDa) and one subunit α (α1, 8.9 kDa, or α2, 16 kDa) (22Langlois M.R. Delanghe J.R. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The protein mixture was analyzed, and a molecular mass of 53.5 kDa was assigned to the unit αβ. In particular, the Hpt subunits were fractionated by electrophoresis in denaturing conditions, and the intensities of the Coomassie-stained bands were measured by densitometry (35Cigliano L. Spagnuolo M.S. Abrescia P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 416: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ratio of α1 (present in phenotypes Hpt 1–1 and Hpt 1–2) to α2 (present in phenotypes Hpt 1–2 and Hpt 2–2) was determined to calculate the molar contribution of α1β and α2β to the amount of used Hpt. LCAT Assay—A pool of plasma samples, treated with 0.08% DS (50-kDa molecular mass) in 0.16 m CaCl2 to remove low density and very low density lipoprotein, was used as source of LCAT (DS-treated plasma). The enzyme activity was measured using a proteoliposome (ApoA-I:lecithin:cholesterol = 1.5:200:18 molar contribution) as substrate, essentially according to published procedures (36Chen C-H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In detail, 8 μl of 50 mg/ml egg lecithin in ethanol were mixed with 18 μl of 1 mg/ml cholesterol in ethanol, 40 μl of [1,2-3H]cholesterol (1 μCi/ml) into a glass vial. The solvent was carefully evaporated under nitrogen stream at room temperature, and 170 μl of a suspension medium (85 mm sodium cholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) were added to the dried lipids. After vigorous whirling (3 min, room temperature), the micelle suspension was incubated (90 min, 37 °C) and repeatedly shaken every 10 min until clear. 90 μl of 1.21 mg/ml ApoA-I were added to the lipid suspension, which was further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The resulting proteoliposome suspension was extensively dialyzed against TBE (140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3), at 4 °C to remove cholate. The volume of the dialyzed suspension was adjusted to 285 μl using TBE. The reaction mixture (1 ml final volume) was prepared by putting 697 μl of TBE containing 5 mm CaCl2,83 μlof 6% human serum albumin, and 160 μl of proteoliposome suspension (diluted 1:20 in TBE) into a screw-capped tube and heating at 38 °C for 30 min. The assay was carried out by addition of 2.5 μl of 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 3.5 μl of DS-treated plasma to 100 μl of reaction mixture, which was rapidly divided into three aliquots of 32 μl and incubated (1 h, 37 °C). The reaction was stopped by addition of 130 μlof ethanol to each aliquot. Lipids were extracted in 600 μl of hexane containing 10 μg/ml cholesterol and 10 μg/ml cholesteryl linoleate. After recovering the organic phase, the aqueous phase was twice treated with 500 μl of the extraction solution, and the three extracts were pooled. Hexane was removed under nitrogen stream, and the dried lipids were dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform. Cholesteryl esters were separated from cholesterol by thin layer chromatography, using petroleum ether, diethyl ether, and acetic acid (90:30:1, v:v:v) as mobile phase. The lipid spots were visualized under iodine vapor and recovered for scintillation analysis. The enzyme activity was expressed as nmol of cholesterol esterified/h/ml of plasma. Statistical Analysis—ELISA was carried out with single aliquots from chromatography fractions, whereas at least three replicates were processed in all other cases. Samples in the LCAT assay were analyzed in triplicate. The program “Graph Pad Prism 3” (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA) was used to obtain trend curves and perform regression analysis or t test. Fragmentation of ApoA-I and Identification of the Fragments Binding Hpt—To map the ApoA-I region interacting with Hpt, the apolipoprotein was fragmented with CNBr or HA and the resulting peptides were analyzed for their binding to Hpt. Four peptides were predicted to result from the ApoA-I fragmentation by CNBr (Fig. 1), but more molecular species including the undigested protein were observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane c). This finding indicates that incomplete cleavage occurred at the residues Met86, Met112, and Met148, producing nine fragments (CB-1: aa 87–243, 18.1 kDa; CB-2: aa 1–148, 17.2 kDa; CB-3: aa 113–243, 14.9 kDa; CB-4: aa 1–112, 12.9 kDa; CB-5: aa 149–243, 10.5 kDa; CB-6: aa 1–86, 9.8 kDa; CB-7: aa 87–148, 7.5 kDa; CB-8: aa 113–148, 4.3 kDa; CB-9: aa 87–112, 3.2 kDa) (Fig. 1).Fig. 2Electrophoresis of the ApoA-I fragments produced by cleavage with CNBr or HA. ApoA-I was fragmented by CNBr or HA, and the reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis in denaturing and reducing conditions on 20 or 16.5% polyacrylamide gel, respectively. The fragments from CNBr digestion were stained by Coomassie (lane c) or, after blotting onto PVDF membrane and incubation with 0.1 mg/ml Hpt, by rabbit anti-Hpt IgG and GAR-HRP IgG (lane b). The fragments from HA digestion were stained by Coomassie (lane f) or, after blotting onto PVDF membrane and incubation with 0.1 mg/ml Hpt, by rabbit anti-Hpt IgG and GAR-HRP IgG (lane g). Lanes d and e show the Coomassie-stained pattern of electrophoresis markers. Lanes a and h show undigested ApoA-I from 20 or 16.5% gel, respectively, following Hpt treatment and antibody staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After peptide transfer on PVDF membrane, the blotted material was incubated with Hpt and then treated with rabbit anti-Hpt IgG. The immunocomplexes, detected by GAR-HRP IgG, stained two bands with the same electrophoretic mobilities as CB-1 and CB-3 (Fig. 2, lane b). This means that the sequence of CB-9, as present in CB-1 but absent in CB-3, might not be required for binding Hpt. After another limited digestion by CNBr, the produced fragments were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50F and analyzed by ELISA for their ability to bind Hpt. In detail, aliquots of the elution fractions were incubated in Hpt-coated wells and the complexes detected by rabbit anti-ApoA-I IgG and GAR-HRP IgG. Again, CB-1 was found to bind Hpt (Fig. 3A). The data shown above strongly suggested that the amino acid sequence from Ser87 to Gln243 (i.e. CB-1) harbors the binding site for Hpt. It is worth noting that neither CB-5 nor CB-7, which are joined together in the primary structure of CB-1, was able to bind Hpt. In a further experiment, ApoA-I was cleaved by HA at its unique Asn184-Gly185 bond (Fig. 1), and the reaction products were analyzed as the CNBr fragments. A slight band, migrating in electrophoresis like the N-terminal fragment (HA-1: aa 1–184, 21.8 kDa) was bound by Hpt and detected by anti-Hpt IgG (Fig. 2, lane g). After gel filtration and ELISA, ApoA-I was detected by anti-ApoA-I IgG together with HA-1 and the C-terminal fragment (HA-2: aa 185–243, 6.4 kDa) (Fig. 3B). Binding of HA-1 to Hpt was comparable with that of ApoA-I, whereas complexes of HA-2 with Hpt were not found (Fig. 3B). Analysis of ApoA-I digestion by HA indicated that the sequence from Gly185 to Gln243 is not required for binding ApoA-I to Hpt. These results, together with the data from the protein digestion by CNBr, strongly suggested that the Hpt binding domain of ApoA-I contains the CNBr cleavage site at Met148 and spans from Glu113 to Asn184. Use of Synthetic Peptides to Identify the Hpt Binding Site of ApoA-I—To localize the Hpt binding site within the ApoA-I amino acid sequence from Glu113 to Asn184, three biotinylated peptides with partial ApoA-I amino acid sequences, namely P1 (Glu113-Gln133), P2 (Leu134-Ala164), and P3 (Pro165-Asn184), were synthesized and incubated in Hpt-coated wells. Binding of P2 was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than that of P1 or P3 (Fig. 4, upper panel). Shorter biotinylated peptides, partially overlapping the P2 sequence, were synthesized to further define the Hpt binding site. These peptides, namely P2a (Leu141-Ala164), P2b (Met148-Ala164), and P2c (Val156-Ala164), were processed for ELISA as above. Peptide P2a exhibited the highest level of Hpt binding (p < 0.01), and such a level was comparable with that of P2 (Fig. 4, lower panel). This result suggested that the difference in sequence length between P2 and P2a, i.e. residues 134–140, corresponds to a region of ApoA-I that is not required in the interaction with Hpt. To compare the binding affinities of P2a and ApoA-I for Hpt, the following experiment was carried out. Different amoun"
https://openalex.org/W2022273982,"Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 are phosphorylated in response to microtubule inhibitors, but the kinase(s) responsible and the functional significance have remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 phosphorylation in KB-3 carcinoma cells treated with vinblastine. In both asynchronous and synchronous cell cultures, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 underwent a well-defined and coordinated cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, with a lengthy period of phosphorylation preceding apoptosis induction, and with dephosphorylation closely correlated with initiation of apoptosis. Internally, validated inhibitors of JNK, ERK, p38MAPK, or CDK1 failed to inhibit vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2. In vitro, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 were poor substrates relative to c-Jun and ATF2 for active recombinant JNK1. Both Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 were localized primarily to the mitochondrial fraction in both control and vinblastine-treated cells, indicating that phosphorylation did not promote subcellular redistribution. Bcl-xL kinase activity was demonstrated in mitochondrial extracts from vinblastine-treated, but not control, cells. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of these key antiapoptotic proteins may be catalysed by a novel or unsuspected kinase that is activated or induced in response to microtubule damage. Furthermore, the same kinase and phosphatase system may be operating in tandem on both proteins, and phosphorylation appears to maintain their antiapoptotic function, whereas dephosphorylation may trigger apoptosis. These results provide evidence for a novel signaling pathway connecting microtubule damage to apoptosis induction, and help to clarify some of the controversy concerning the role of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in microtubule inhibitor-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1977569407,"There are currently 40 million individuals in the world infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a significant reduction in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, up to 25% of patients discontinue their initial HAART regimen. Current HIV-1 inhibitors target the fusion of the virus to the cell and two viral proteins, reverse transcriptase and protease. Here, we examined whether other targets, such as an activated transcription factor, could be targeted to block HIV-1 replication. We specifically asked whether we could target a cellular kinase needed for HIV-1 transcription using CYC202 (R-roscovitine), a pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. We targeted the cdk2-cyclin E complex in HIV-1-infected cells because both cdk2 and cyclin E are nonessential during mammalian development and are likely replaced by other kinases. We found that CYC202 effectively inhibits wild type and resistant HIV-1 mutants in T-cells, monocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells at a low IC50 and sensitizes these cells to enhanced apoptosis resulting in a dramatic drop in viral titers. Interestingly, the effect of CYC202 is independent of cell cycle stage and more specific for the cdk2-cyclin E complex. Finally, we show that cdk2-cyclin E is loaded onto the HIV-1 genome in vivo and that CYC202 is able to inhibit the uploading of this cdk-cyclin complex onto HIV-1 DNA. Therefore, targeting cellular enzymes necessary for HIV-1 transcription, which are not needed for cell survival, is a compelling strategy to inhibit wild type and mutant HIV-1 strains.

The resurgence and development of an additional 16,000 new HIV-1 infections were calculated to take place daily, with 95% of these cases occurring in developing countries and 50% in women (1Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, World Health Organization (2000) UNAIDS, Geneva, SwitzerlandGoogle Scholar, 2Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, World Health Organization (2001) UNAIDS, Geneva, SwitzerlandGoogle Scholar). Only two viral proteins, reverse transcriptase and protease, are currently targets for HIV-1 inhibitors. However, virologic failure of antiretroviral therapy is common and primarily associated with the emergence of drug resistance (3Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 4Coffin J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 5Nijhuis M. Deeks S. Boucher C. Curr.

Virol. 2002; 76: 7000-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The emergence of resistance when viral loads are low during HAART or other antiviral treatments is explained by the selection for those viral variants that are less fit for replication as evident in the quasi-species theory, where viral populations are a mixture of distinct but related variants; the dominant wild type strain and mutants with varying degrees of fitness, i.e. mutants that are “over” and “under” fit (7Perelson A.S. Neumann A.U. Markowitz M. Leonard J.M. Ho D.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1582-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (2834) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is widely believed that the success in HIV-1 treatment will require targeting of other HIV and/or host cellular proteins. To that end, we selected to focus on HIV-1 transcription events postintegration and its functional and physical interaction with the host cell cycle machinery. Although HIV-1 entry, an early stage of infection, occurs regardless of cell cycle status, active high titer virion production of either M- or T-tropic viruses requires the host cell to be at the late G1 or S phase of the cell cycle (8Chun T.W.

Tat has been shown to interact with a number of cellular factors, which may or may not be important for HIV-1-specific activated transcription (33Benkirane M. Chun R.F. Xiao H. Ogryzko V.V.

However, one complex, Tat-cdk9-cyclin T1 (p-TEFb), has emerged as a significant binding partner for elongation of transcription from the LTR. This complex has been shown to associate with and phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol II, thereby enhancing elongation of transcription (34Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J.

In vivo treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes and purified resting CD4+ T-lymphocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, phytohemagglutinin, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, or TNF-α also results in an increase in cdk9 and cyclin T1 protein levels and an increase in TAK (Tat-associated kinase) enzymatic activity (38Ghose R. Liou L.Y. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11336-11343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cdk9 expression during the cell cycle is periodic and peaks at the G1/S border (40Kiernan R.E. Emiliani S. Nakayama K. Castro A. Labbe J.C. Lorca T. Nakayama Ki K. Benkirane M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7956-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, a growing body of evidence has indicated the role of yet another cdk-cyclin complex, namely cdk2-cyclin E, in Tat-activated transcription. Cdk2-cyclin E is the major cdk-cyclin complex whose maximal activity is observed at the late G1/S boundary regulating the release of Rb sequestered factors, including E2F (41Obeyesekere M.N. Herbert J.R. Zimmerman S.O. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have shown previously that the increased kinase activity of cdk2-cyclin E complexes in HIV-1 latently infected cells is the result of the loss of p21/waf1 (42Clark E. Santiago F. Deng L. Chong S. de La Fuente C. Wang L. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Lanka V. Mozafari F. Okamoto T. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5040-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cdk2-cyclin E isolated from phytohemagglutinin-treated human primary T-cells phosphorylated RNA pol II CTD (43Nekhai S. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7436-7441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies revealed that maximal activity of the kinase was during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle, which coincides with the maximal activity of the cdk2-cyclin E complex (43Nekhai S. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7436-7441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and that cdk2-cyclin E has been shown to be necessary for Tat-dependent transcription in vitro and in reconstituted transcription assays (45Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfery A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33922-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that during late G1, Tat transactivation is transactivation response-dependent, whereas at G2, Tat transactivation is transactivation response-independent (46Kashanchi F. Agbottah E.T. Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Duvall J. Kumar A. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, we asked whether we could target a cellular kinase needed for HIV-1 transcription using CYC202 (R-roscovitine), a pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (PCI). We specifically decided to target the cdk2-cyclin E complex in HIV-1-infected cells because both cdk2 and cyclin E are not essential for viable mammalian development, as demonstrated by mouse knock-out models (47Berthet C. Aleem E. Coppola V. Tessarollo L. Kaldis P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1775-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 48Geng Y. Yu Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Schneider J.E.

Genet. 2003; 35: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting cellular enzymes necessary for HIV-1 transcription, which are not essential for the survival of the vast majority of uninfected cells, is a compelling strategy to inhibit wild type and mutant HIV-1 strains. We found that CYC202 effectively inhibits wild type and resistant HIV-1 mutants in T-cells, monocytes, and PBMCs at a low IC50. Interestingly, the effect of CYC202 is independent of cell cycle stage and more specific for the cdk2-cyclin E complex. Finally, we show that cdk2-cyclin E is in fact loaded onto the HIV-1 genome in vivo and that CYC202 is able to inhibit the uploading of this cdk-cyclin complex onto HIV-1 DNA. Cells and Reagents—OM10.1, ACH2, and U1 cells are HIV-1-infected lymphocytic and monocytic cells, respectively. OM10.1 and ACH2 contain a single integrated copy of a wild type genome in parental CEM (12D7) cells, whereas U1 cells harbor two copies (one wild type and one mutant) of the viral genome in parental U973 cells (46Kashanchi F. Agbottah E.T. Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Duvall J. Kumar A. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HLM1 cells (HIV-1+/Tat- (51Deng L. de la Wang D. Fuente C. Wang L. Li H. Lee C.G. Donnelly R. Wade J.D. Lambert P. Kashanchi F. Virology. 2001; 289: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) contain a single copy of full-length HIV-1 provirus with a triple termination codon at the first AUG of the Tat gene. These cells can be made to produce HIV-1 virion in the presence of wild type Tat, TNF-α, or sodium butyrate. MT-2 cells are infected with several copies of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and produce full-length viral particles. CEM and H9 (T-lymphocytes), HL-60 (promyelocytic), and THP-1 (monocytic) cells are uninfected and have been described previously (46Kashanchi F. Agbottah E.T. Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Duvall J. Kumar A. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured at 37 °C with up to 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (except HLM-1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and treated with a mixture of 1% streptomycin and penicillin antibiotics and 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Tat protein (both wild type and K41A mutant) was produced in Escherichia coli and purified using Sephacryl S-200 followed by C18 reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The purified Tat proteins were then dried and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.01% bovine serum albumin prior to use. HLM1 cells (HIV-1+/Tat-) were blocked in complete medium with low serum (0.1% fetal bovine serum) for 3 days. Cells were subsequently released in the presence of complete medium (10% fetal bovine serum) and transfected with 1 μg of either purified wild type or mutant Tat protein. Next, cells were plated with 0.5 μm CYC202 or m-CYC202, 100 nm wortmannin, 10 μm Lys 294002, 5 μg of wild type Tat peptide (CTKALGC-GG-YGRKKRRQRRR), or 5 μg of a dominant negative Tat peptide with mutations at positions 41 and 44 (CTAALSC-GG-YGRKKRRQRRR). The cyclized Tat peptides contain two cysteines at amino and carboxyl termini of each peptide, followed by the addition of two glycine residues for flexibility, and the Tat basic nuclear translocation signal sequence. Cells were kept at 37 °C for 12 days, and supernatants were collected for p24 ELISA. Antibodies against cdk1, cdk2 (M-2), cdk7 (C-19), cdk9 (L-19), cyclin E (M-20), cyclin A (H-432), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP (N-20), caspase-3 (H-277), cyclin D1, and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The cdk inhibitor CYC202 (6-benzylamino-2-(R-1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-9-isopropylpurine) and the kinase-inactive acid metabolite of CYC202, m-CYC202PMF (6-benzylamino-2-(R)-((1-(carboxy)propyl)amino)-9-isopropylpurine) (Cyclacel Ltd., Dundee, Scotland, UK) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mm stock concentrations. m-CYC202 has been shown to inhibit other kinases in vitro, including cdk4-cyclin D1 (IC50 of 46.2 ± 5.57 μm), cdk7-cyclin H (IC50 of 24.4 ± 2.28 μm), and cdk2-cyclin A (IC50 of 78.13 ± 11.01 μm). These IC50 values are 5–100-fold greater than those observed for CYC202 (52McClue S.J. Blake D. Clarke R. Cowan A. Cummings L. Fischer P.M. MacKenzie M. Melville J. Stewart K. Wang S. Zhelev N. Zheleva D. Lane D.P. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 102: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed with immunoprecipitates from both infected and uninfected cells using anti-cdk2-cyclin E, anti-cdk4-cyclin D, anti-cdk7-cyclin H, and anti-cdk9-cyclin T antibodies in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 ng of GST-CTD or 200 ng of histone H1 in TTK kinase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 6 mm EGTA, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated GST-CTD or histone H1 was resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography and quantitation with a PhosphorImager. Phosphorylation of p53 by GSK3β was carried out according to a procedure published previously (53Turenne G.A. Price B.D. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 37 of p53 by DNA-PK has been shown to create a site for GSK3β phosphorylation at serine 33 in vitro. Therefore, 3 μg of wild type GST-p53 (42Clark E. Santiago F. Deng L. Chong S. de La Fuente C. Wang L. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Lanka V. Mozafari F. Okamoto T. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5040-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was incubated with DNA-PK (20 units, Promega Corp., Madison, Wl) for 5 h at 30 °C in the following buffers (40 μl final volume): 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCI, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 ng of DNA, 4.2 mm spermidine, 10 μm ATP. Samples were then incubated at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate DNA-PK and the reaction subsequently incubated for 30 min with GSK3β in GSK3 kinase buffer (KGB buffer: 8 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP) in a final volume of 40 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and GST-p53 phosphorylation was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For the peptide kinase assays, we used our previously published procedure (54de la Fuente C. Santiago F. Chong S.Y. Deng L. Mayhood T. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Coffman F. Azimi N. Mahieux R. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7270-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared from OM10.1 cells and PBMCs in IP buffer. Lysates (2 mg) were treated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) to avoid nonspecific binding and were centrifuged. The supernatants were incubated with antibodies against cdk2 and cdk4 and then with protein A- and G-agarose beads. After centrifugation, the immunoprecipitates were washed five times with IP buffer. The immunopurified cyclins and substrates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in R buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA) that contained 50 μm ATP and 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 25 μl with 5 μg of Rb peptides (J and G1), incubated for 30 min, and run on an 18% SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette. The Rb peptide J sequence was: 818GLPTPTKMTPRSRIL, and peptide G1 was 775RPPTLSPIPHIPR. Immunoblotting—Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and lysed with lysis buffer (55de la Wang D. Fuente C. Deng L. Wang L. Zilberman I. Eadie C. Healey M. Stein D. Denny T. Harrison L.E. Meijer L. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7266-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The lysate was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. Total cellular protein was separated on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.) overnight at 0.08 A. After transfer, the blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TNE50 (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Membranes were probed with a 1:200 to 1:1,000 dilution of antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by three washes with TNE50 plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The next day, the blots were incubated with 10 ml of 125I-labeled protein G (Amersham Biosciences; 50-μl/10 ml solution) in TNE50 plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 2 h at 4 °C. Finally, the blots were washed twice in TNE50 plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and placed on a PhosphorImager cassette for further analysis. MTT Viability Assay—The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay has been described previously (56Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were counted, and 105 cells/well in flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates were used for each MTT assay. Medium containing 75 μg/ml MTT was added, and the cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The resulting formazan crystals were solubilized in 115 μl of 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol. The optical density of the solubilized formazan was read at 575 and 650 nm with a SpectraMax 340 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) plate reader. The reduction in optical density was used as a measurement of cell viability, normalized to cells incubated in control medium, which were considered 100% viable. Flow Cytometry—For cell cycle analysis, cells treated with or without drugs were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and then fixed with 70% ethanol. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, cells were stained with a mixture of propidium iodide buffer (PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 10 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide) followed by cell sorting analysis. The acquired FACS data were analyzed by ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc.). Cells were washed twice with cold PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, resuspended in 1× binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) and 5 μl of propidium iodide/105 cells, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were acquired and analyzed using CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). DNA Fragmentation Assay—CYC202-treated and untreated cells were lysed with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100, and the fragmented DNA in the lysate was separated from the unfragmented chromosomal DNA by precipitation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Fragmented DNA in the supernatant was then digested with 100 ng/ml ribonuclease A (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml protease K (Invitrogen), and 1% SDS at 37 °C for 45 min, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, and precipitated with ethanol/sodium deoxycholate. The DNA was then electrophoresed on a 1.6% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. PBMC Infection—Phytohemagglutinin-activated PBMCs were kept in culture for 2 days prior to each infection. Isolation and treatment of PBMCs were performed by following the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control (55de la Wang D. Fuente C. Deng L. Wang L. Zilberman I. Eadie C. Healey M. Stein D. Denny T. Harrison L.E. Meijer L. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7266-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 106 PBMCs were infected with either an SI (UG/92/029 Uganda strain, subtype A envelope, 5 ng of p24 gag antigen) or an NSI (THA/92/001, Thailand strain, subtype E envelope, 5 ng of p24 gag antigen) strain of HIV-1. Other HIV-1 mutant viruses (AZT, 3TC, TIBO, and protease) were also used for PBMC infections (50 ng of p24 gag antigen/virus). All viral isolates were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. After 8 h of infection, cells were washed and fresh medium was added. Drug treatment was performed (only once) immediately after the addition of fresh medium. Samples were collected every 6th day (for SI and NSI viruses) and stored at 20 °C for p24 gag ELISA. For HIV-1 p24 ELISA, media from infected cell lines were centrifuged to pellet the cells, and supernatants were collected and diluted to 1:100 to 1:1,000 in RPMI 1640 prior to analysis. Supernatants from the infected PBMCs were collected and used directly for the p24 antigen assay. The p24 gag antigen level was analyzed using the HIVAG-1 monoclonal antibody kit (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostics Division). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—5–10 million OM10.1 cells in log phase were incubated for 2 h with or without 5 μg/ml TNF-α to induce transcription of latent proviral DNA (57Zhou M. Deng L. Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. Shatkin A.J. Kumar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12666-12671Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were subsequently left untreated or treated with siRNA or the cdk inhibitor (CYC202, m-CYC202). After 48 h, cells were cross-linked (1% formaldehyde, 10 min at 37 °C), and samples were sonicated to reduce DNA fragments to 200–800 nucleotides for ChIP assays. Specific transcription complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against cdk2, cdk4, cdk7, and cdk9. Specific DNA sequences in the immunoprecipitates were detected by PCR by using primers specific for the HIV-1 LTR (forward primer, 5′-ACTTTTCCGGGGAGGCGCGATC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCCACTGCTAGAGATTTCCACACTG-3′) or Env region (forward primer, 5′-CCTTG(T)GAGCCAATTCCCATA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TAACAAATGCTCTCCCTGGTC-3′). siRNA Analysis—siRNA sequences were designed using the Oligoengine Work station (www.oligoengine.com) and were purchased from Qiagen-Xeragon. Candidate sequences were chosen based on general siRNA design criteria, including a % GC content between 45 and 55% and avoiding more than three consecutive guanosines. Selected target sequences were also BLA"
https://openalex.org/W1983410692,"Downstream signaling that results from the interaction of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) with the receptor tyrosine kinase Met plays critical roles in tumor development, progression, and metastasis. This ligand-receptor pair is an attractive target for new diagnostic and therapeutic agents, preclinical development of which requires suitable animal models. The growth of heterotopic and orthotopic Met-expressing human tumor xenografts in conventional strains of immunocompromised mice inadequately replicates the paracrine stimulation by human HGF/SF (hHGF/SF) that occurs in humans with cancer. We have therefore generated a mouse strain transgenic for hHGF/SF (designated hHGF-Tg) on a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) background. We report here that the presence of ectopically expressed hHGF/SF ligand significantly enhances growth of heterotopic subcutaneous xenografts derived from human Met-expressing cancer cells, including the lines SK-LMS-1 (human leiomyosarcoma), U118 (human glioblastoma), and DU145 (human prostate carcinoma), but not that of M14-Mel xenografts (human melanoma that expresses insignificant levels of Met). Our results indicate that ectopic hHGF/SF can specifically activate Met in human tumor xenografts. This new hHGF-Tg strain of mice should provide a powerful tool for evaluating drugs and diagnostic agents that target the various pathways influenced by Met activity."

Glucosylation leads to the functional inactivation of Rho GTPases and causes disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. A cDNA microarray revealed the immediate early gene rhoB as the gene that was predominantly up-regulated in colonic CaCo-2 cells after treatment with toxin A. This toxin A effect was also detectable in epithelial cells such as HT29 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, as well as NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The expression of RhoB was time-dependent and correlated with the morphological changes of cells. The up-regulation of RhoB was approximately 15-fold and was based on the de novo synthesis of the GTPase because cycloheximide completely inhibited the toxin A effect. After 8 h, a steady state was reached, with no further increase in RhoB. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 reduced the expression of RhoB, indicating a participation of the p38 MAPK in this stress response. Surprisingly, newly formed RhoB protein was only partially glucosylated by toxin A, sparing a pool of potentially active RhoB, as checked by sequential C3bot-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. A pull-down assay in fact revealed a significant amount of active RhoB in toxin A-treated cells that was not present in control cells. We demonstrate for the first time that toxin A has not only the property to inactivate the GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by glucosylation, but it also has the property to generate active RhoB that likely contributes to the overall picture of toxin treatment.

Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The activation of MAPK results from cellular or genotoxic stress and involves Rho GTPases independently of their role as regulators of the cytoskeleton (11Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenström P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 are the predominant Rho GTPases that are involved in the regulation of the different MAPK, i.e. extracellular-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2864) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases are involved positively in the signal transduction because dominant-negative mutant forms of Rac and Cdc42 inhibit these pathways. Accordingly, the inhibition of Rho family GTPases by C. difficile toxin B also blocks c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in gentamycin-treated auditory hair cells (13Bodmer D. Brors D. Pak K. Gloddek B. Ryan A. Hear. Res. 2002; 172: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and interleukin-1-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 MAPK, and NFκB in murine EL-4 thymoma cells (14Dreikhausen U.

The RhoB GTPase also belongs to the Rho GTPase family and shows an identity to RhoA of 86% at the amino acid level. RhoB, which is constitutively poorly expressed, has been reported as an immediate early inducible gene product formed in response to genotoxic stress caused by UV irradiation or alkylating agents (15Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and in response to growth factors (16Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). RhoB is exclusively membrane bound and is localized to the plasma membrane and early endosomes (17Adamson P. Paterson H.F.

It contributes to transforming and apoptotic processes presumably by regulating the intracellular transport of cell surface receptors (20Singh S.P. McDonald D. Hope T.J. Prabhakar B.S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DNA damage-induced apoptosis especially requires RhoB (21Liu A. Du W. Liu J.P. Jessel T.M. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell.

Ther. 2003; 2: 281-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), although RhoB does not directly mediate apoptosis. Early observations (16Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), however, have reported that RhoB is more of a regulator than an inducer of apoptosis. Its role as a cellular target for farnesyl transferase inhibitors makes RhoB a promising target for anticancer therapy. Only a few signal pathways involving RhoB have been reported in more detail. RhoB reduces the NFκB activity induced by tumor necrosis factor-α or genotoxic stress by decreasing the degradation of the inhibitory κB-α (25Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3115-3122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RhoB plays a role in the Akt survival pathway in endothelial cells (26Adini I. Rabinowitz I. Sun J.F. Prendergast G.C. Benjamin L.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2721-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In RhoB-depleted cells, Akt was excluded from the nucleoplasm and was degraded in a proteosome-dependent manner. Taken together, RhoB is induced by cellular stress, especially genotoxic stress, and is involved in various pathways regulating apoptotic processes. In this context, the induction of RhoB by C. difficile toxin A is most remarkable and offers new insight into the cellular response to Rho-modifying toxins. The dilemma of RhoB, that it can be both induced by toxin A and serve as substrate for toxin A at the same time, was the focus of this study. Materials—The RNeasy® kit, Oligotex mRNA mini kit, and QIA-quick™ were from Qiagen. RNasin was from Promega. Superscript™II enzyme, First Strand buffer, RNaseH, and endothelial serum-free basal growth medium were obtained from Invitrogen. FluoroLink™ Cy3/5-dCTP, HiTrap chelating HP column, glutathione-Sepharose, and benzamidine beads were from Amersham Biosciences. Bacillus megaterium protoplasts were from MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany. All cell culture media were from Biochrome AG, Berlin, Germany. G418 was purchased from Sigma. Thrombin was from Roche Applied Science. [32P]Nicotin-amide adenine dinucleotide was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal anti-RhoB (C-5) and monoclonal anti-p38 MAPK (A-12) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Monoclonal antibody against double phosphorylated (Thr-180/Tyr-182) p38 MAPK (clone 28B10) was from Cell Signaling. cDNA Array—cDNA arrays were obtained from Memorec Biotec GmbH (Cologne, Germany). According to the manufacturer's information, the defined 200–400-bp fragments of selected cDNAs were generated by RT-PCR using Superscript™ II enzyme, sequence-specific primers, and RNA derived from appropriate human tissue and cell lines. All amplified inserts were transferred to a 384-well plate and double spotted on treated glass slides using a customized ink jet spotter. The cDNA microarray was performed as described in detail by Borlak and Bosio (27Borlak J. Bosio A. Crucial Issues in Inhalation Research—Mechanistic, Clinical and Epidemiologic. IRB Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany2002Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cultured CaCo-2 cells (107 cells) using an RNeasy® kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA (40 μg) was combined with a control RNA consisting of an in vitro transcribed Escherichia coli genomic DNA fragment carrying a 30-nucleotide poly(A)+-tail (EC17), and mRNA was isolated using an Oligotex mRNA mini kit. 0.8 μg of mRNA or 2 μg of amplified RNA was diluted to 17 μl and combined with 2 μl of a second control RNA, a mixture of the three different transcripts EC7, EC20, and EC21. mRNA and amplified RNA were reverse-transcribed by adding a mixture consisting of 8 μl of 5× first strand buffer (Superscript™ II) 2 μl of primer mix (oligo(dT)), randomeres for mRNA or randomeres only for amplified RNA, 2 μl of low C dNTPs (10 mm dATP, 10 mm dGTP, 10 mm deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate, 4 mm dCTP), 2 μl of FluoroLink™ Cy3/5-dCTP, 4 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of RNasin (20–40 units). 1 μl (200 units) of Superscript™ II enzyme was added and incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. This step was repeated once. 0.5 μl of RNaseH was added and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min to hydrolyze RNA. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled samples were combined and cleaned using QIAquick™. Image capture and signal quantification of hybridized PIQOR™ cDNA arrays were carried out with the ScanArray3000 (GSI Lumonics) and ImaGene software version 2.0 (BioDiscovery). The local background was subtracted from the signal to obtain the net signal intensity and the ratio of Cy5/Cy3. Subsequently, the mean of the ratios of two corresponding spots representing the same cDNA was computed. The mean ratios were normalized to the median of all mean ratios using only spots for which the fluorescent intensity in one of the two channels was three times the negative control. The negative control for each array was computed as the mean of the signal intensity of two spots representing herring sperm and two spots representing spotting buffer only. Expression and Purification of C. difficile Toxin A—The purification of native and recombinant toxin A was described previously (28Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins—Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 159-167Google Scholar) and in detail by Just et al. (1Just I. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Immun. 1987; 55: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (thyroglobulin affinity purification), and Burger et al. (30Burger S. Tatge H. Hofmann F. Just I. Gerhard R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (recombinant toxin A). In brief, native toxin A was purified from C. difficile (strain VPI 10463) culture supernatants by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and subsequent thyroglobulin affinity purification. Recombinant toxin A was expressed as His-tagged protein using the B. megaterium expression system. The His-tagged toxin A was purified from the soluble fraction by single step affinity chromatography using HiTrap chelating HP column loaded with Ni2+. Cell Culture—All cells used for this study were cultured under standard conditions. The appropriate medium for each cell line (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for CaCo-2, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and MDCK, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium for HT29, and Iscove's basal medium for human mast cells (HMC-1)) was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml penicillin. The medium for His-RhoB-transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was supplemented additionally with 500 μg/ml G418. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured in endothelial serum-free basal growth medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 1 μg/ml heparin. Cells were subcultured twice/week. Expression of GST Fusion Proteins RhoB and Clostridium botulinum Exoenzyme C3bot—RhoB and the exoenzyme C3bot were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli (31Ahnert-Hilger G. Höltje M. Grobe G. Pickert G. Mucke C. Nixdorf-Bergweiler B. Boquet P. Hofmann F. Just I. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Affinity purification was performed using glutathione-Sepharose. The GST fusion proteins were cleaved by thrombin. Thrombin was removed from the RhoB or C3bot-containing supernatant by precipitation with benzamidine beads. ADP-ribosylation Assay—After toxin treatment the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in ribosylation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm thymidine, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 μm NAD, 0.01% SDS). C3bot (2 μg/ml) and [32P]NAD (0.5 μCi) were added to start the ADP-ribosylation reaction. The ADP-ribosylation assay was stopped after 15 min by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by filmless autoradiography (Packard). For the gel shift assay, ADP-ribosylation was performed in the absence of radiolabeled NAD. Western blot analysis for the detection of ADP-ribosylated and non-ADP-ribosylated RhoB was performed using RhoB-specific antibody. Pull-down Assays—Pull-down experiments were performed as described previously by Reid et al. (32Reid T. Furayashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). After toxin treatment, the culture medium was removed, and cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were gently shaken at 4 °C for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (10 mg of protein) was used for pull-down experiments. 20 μl of bead slurry consisting of GST-Rhotekin (C21) containing ∼20 μg of protein each were added to each sample and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and washed twice with lysis buffer. Pull-down experiments with recombinant RhoB were performed under the same conditions using lysis buffer, which was supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to prevent unspecific binding of RhoB to Sepharose beads. The exchange of nucleotides was performed as described previously by Sehr et al. (33Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Quantitative glucosylation of recombinant RhoB was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis. In this study we investigated the expression of the immediate early gene product RhoB in response to the toxin treatment of cells with C. difficile toxin A. The first evidence of an effect of toxin A was the cDNA array. The mRNA coding for RhoB increased by approximately 15-fold in toxin-treated cells compared with untreated cells. RhoB was the predominant gene that was up-regulated in CaCo-2 cells after 4 h of treatment with 1 μg/ml toxin A (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the expression of only a few other genes was altered significantly, and these genes will be the topic of a separate study. To prove directly the increase of RhoB at the protein level, we confirmed RhoB expression by Western blot analysis. The immunoblot showed a time-dependent expression of the RhoB GTPase starting at 2 h after toxin treatment (Fig. 2A). The maximum level of RhoB was observed approximately 8 h after the addition of the toxin and continued for at least 24 h. After 8 h of toxin treatment, a steady state of RhoB expression was reached. The up-regulation of RhoB correlated well with the morphological changes of cells (Fig. 2B), indicating a relationship with the cytosolic action of toxin A. However, the inhibition of RhoB synthesis by cycloheximide did not prevent or delay rounding up of cells, excluding a major role of RhoB in cytoskeleton reorganization (data not shown). Several cell lines were tested and found to respond positively to toxin A with expression of RhoB (Fig. 2C). Among them were epithelial cell lines, such as CaCo-2, HT29, and MDCK cells, and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. RhoB was detected neither in HMC-1 nor in HUVEC after toxin A treatment. However, we cannot exclude very low induction escaping Western blot detection To get further insight into the pathway involved in RhoB expression, we studied signal pathways that might possibly be involved. In fact, toxin A induced an increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation as shown by Western blot against the double phosphorylated form (Thr-185/Tyr-187) (Fig. 3A). The activation of p38 MAPK started approximately 1 h after the addition of toxin A. As a positive control, osmotic shock by 500 mm sorbitol was applied. This signal was likely to reflect the maximum stimulation of p38 MAPK. Interestingly, p38 MAPK activation correlated well with the increase in RhoB expression. To test whether there was a causative correlation, toxin A-induced RhoB up-regulation was performed in the presence of the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB202190 (10 μm). The inhibitor decreased toxin A-induced RhoB protein expression (Fig. 3B). SB202190 itself, however, did not induce RhoB expression to a detectable level. Because p38 MAPK are regulated positively by Rho GTPases, toxin A-catalyzed glucosylation of the GTPases should have resulted in the inhibition of p38 MAPK rather than its activation, as observed in this study. Therefore, we tested whether toxin A stimulated p38 MAPK in a Rho-independent way, i.e. through a ligand-like interaction with membrane receptors. If this were the case, inhibition of cytoplasmic delivery of toxin A should not prevent RhoB up-regulation. To test this, the entry of toxin A into the cytoplasm was blocked by bafilomycin A1, which entraps the receptor-bound toxin within the endosomes by preventing acidification. Bafilomycin (2 μm) completely prevented the toxin A-induced up-regulation of RhoB (Fig. 3C) as well as the morphological changes (not shown). Thus, the RhoB-inducing effect of toxin A is an intracellular effect, and a mere receptor-mediated effect can be excluded. The cellular RhoB amount was elevated for the whole observation period of 24 h. The question arose as to whether RhoB was formed continuously or whether its degradation was inhibited. To test both notions, CaCo-2 cells were intoxicated with toxin A for 8 h to reach the maximum cellular RhoB concentration in the steady state. At this time point, the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB202190) or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide were applied to the cells, and toxin A treatment was continued for an additional 2 and 8 h, respectively (Fig. 4A). The RhoB levels were checked by immunoblot analysis at the time points given. In control cells, which were treated only with toxin A, there was an almost stable (89 ± 7%) RhoB content over 8 h. In SB202190-treated cells, in which p38 MAPK was inhibited, the RhoB amount decreased slightly (87 ± 12%) after 2 h and to approximately 70 ± 25% after 8 h. In cycloheximide-treated cells, the RhoB level decreased to 45 ± 27% after 2 h and remained at this level for another 6 h (42 ± 12%). This experiment showed a long lasting induction of RhoB protein expression rather than an inhibition of RhoB degradation. The treatment of CaCo-2 cells with cycloheximide prior to the addition of toxin A completely prevented the increase in the amount of RhoB (Fig. 4B). Thus, the up-regulation of cellular RhoB by toxin A was achieved by continuous de novo synthesis of the GTPase. RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 have been reported to be the major cellular substrates of toxin A. To test whether RhoB is also an intracellular substrate of toxin A, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with His-RhoB were used (25Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3115-3122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). His-RhoB reveals two advantages. First, because of its higher molecular mass, radiolabeled His-RhoB can be easily detected separately from radiolabeled endogenous RhoA by phosphorimaging. Second, His-RhoB did not underlie an up-regulation induced by toxin A. The glucosylation of RhoB was first verified by sequential exoenzyme C3bot-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Cell lysates of controls and of cells treated with recombinant toxin A were used for in vitro [32P]ADP-ribosylation by C3bot. In those cells treated with toxin A, the 23-kDa signal of [32P]ADP-ribosylated GTPases was decreased strongly compared with the control (Fig. 5), indicating a previous glucosylation of part of the Rho GTPase pool by toxin A in the intact cell. Furthermore, the weakly expressed His-tagged RhoB (28 kDa) of toxin A-treated cells was not the substrate for C3bot, verifying cellular RhoB as the substrate for toxin A. The 35-kDa-labeled band represented endogenous ADP-ribosylation and served as a marker to show identical protein concentration. Thus, endogenous RhoB is considered to be the substrate for toxin A. Two pools of RhoB were present within the toxin A-treated cell: (i) potentially active RhoB supplied by continuous de novo expression and (ii) inactive RhoB supplied by continuous modification catalyzed by toxin A. To estimate the pool of potentially active RhoB, i.e. non-glucosylated, we performed ADP-ribosylation of lysates from toxin A-treated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The ADP-ribosylation of previously non-glucosylated RhoB could be followed by a gel shift assay combined with a subsequent Western blot analysis. In control cells, no RhoB was detectable (Fig. 6A, upper panel), whereas a strong signal of RhoB was detectable in toxin A-treated cells. Non-glucosylated RhoB subjected to ADP-ribosylation shifted to a higher apparent molecular weight. This pool of RhoB was counted for potentially active RhoB. The amount of shifted RhoB (approximately 40%) revealed a surplus of unmodified and therefore potentially active RhoB.Fig. 6Toxin A treatment increases the level of unmodified and active RhoB.A, Western blot analysis of the gel shift assay reveals the amount of still unmodified RhoB after toxin A-treatment. The rationale is that ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by C3bot results in an apparent shift in the molecular weight of Rho. Only Rho that was not previously glucosylated is the substrate for C3bot. The upper band shows the shifted ADP-ribosylated RhoB (not previously glucosylated), and the lower band is the non-ADP-ribosylated form of RhoB (previously glucosylated by toxin A) in comparison with the non-ribosylated sample (right lane). B, pull-down assay of recombinant RhoB using the Rho-binding domain C21 of Rhotekin. GTPγS-loaded RhoB (200 ng) was precipitated by GST-C21, whereas GDP-bound RhoB did not bind to GST-C21. Glucosylated RhoB (gluco-RhoB), either GDP-bound or GTPγS-bound, did not bind to GST-C21. C, the pull-down assay was performed to estimate the pool of active RhoB in control and toxin A-treated cells. RhoB was detected by Western blot analysis only in the lysate of toxin A-treated cells, which were precipitated by C21, verifying the presence of non-glucosylated GTP-bound RhoB (upper panels). The identical blot membrane was analyzed for RhoA (lower panels). The level of active RhoA decreased in toxin A-treated cells compared with control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To prove directly the presence of active RhoB, we performed a pull-down assay using the Rho-binding domain C21 of Rhotekin. A study of the binding of GTPγS-loaded RhoB to the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin was described by Reid et al. (32Reid T. Furayashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), whereas Gampel and Mellor (34Gampel A. Mellor H. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) applied the Rhotekin-based pull-down assay for activation studies of RhoB. We first excluded nucleotide-independent binding of recombinant glucosylated RhoB in a pull-down assay. RhoB bound only to GST-C21 beads in the GTP-bound form (Fig. 6B). Glucosylated RhoB did not bind to GST-C21, GTPγS, or GDP. The validated pull-down assay was then applied to cell lysates. Active GTP-bound RhoB was precipitated from toxin A-treated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts but not from control cells because of the missing RhoB amount (Fig. 6C). In contrast to RhoB, active GTP-bound RhoA was precipitated from control cells but was hardly precipitated from toxin A-treated cells. The blot showed less RhoA in toxin A-treated lysates, which was caused by the high affinity of inactive glucosylated RhoA to the particulate fraction (35Genth H. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29050-29056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This pull-down assay confirmed the presence of active GTP-bound RhoB in toxin A-treated cells. C. difficile toxin A is an intracellular acting exotoxin that inactivates the Rho-GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by monoglucosylation. The most prominent outcome of glucosylation that allows easy detection is the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton accompanied by morphological changes. The inactivation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 is thought to be highly sp"

They consist of a single polypeptide chain that exhibits no obvious transmembrane domains and contains one molecule of FAD with the exception of the archaebacterial enzymes that, presumably as an adaptation to thermic habitats, carry covalently attached FMN instead. In most plants and fungi, multiple isoforms of NADH dehydrogenases are expressed in the same species. The active site of the membrane-associated enzymes may be directed to the external or internal face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, two external (SCNDE1 and SCNDE2) and one internal (SCNDI1) alternative NADH dehydrogenases are found (13Luttik M.A.H. Overkamp K.M.

The obligate aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has only a single external alternative enzyme, YLNDH2 (5Kerscher S. Okun J.G. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2347-2354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that this external enzyme can be transformed into an internal version simply by adding a targeting signal for the mitochondrial matrix (14Kerscher S. Eschemann A. Okun P.M. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3915-3921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there are no specific protein interaction partners for its membrane association. It remains unclear how the largely hydrophilic enzyme interacts with its highly hydrophobic substrate, ubiquinone. NADH, the other substrate of alternative NADH dehydrogenases, is highly hydrophilic. Inspection of the YLNDH2 sequence revealed two βαβ-dinucleotide-binding domains that consist of two parallel β-strands connected by an α-helix (5Kerscher S. Okun J.G. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2347-2354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence G(X)XGXXG, which marks the connection between the first β-strand and the connecting α-helix, makes close contact with the diphosphate moiety of dinucleotide substrates or cofactors. The end of the second β-strand is often occupied by an acidic residue, which forms hydrogen bonds to the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose (15Lesk A.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the amino-terminal dinucleotide fold of Y. lipolytica NDH2, the acidic residue is replaced by serine. It has been suggested that this motif binds FAD (8Björklöf K. Zickermann V. Finel M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This proposal is consistent with the position of the FAD cofactor in the crystal structure of two different homologous lipoamide dehydrogenases (16Mattevi A. Schierbeek A.J. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 975-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Sokatch J.R. Betzel C. Hol W.G.J. PROTEINS: Struct. Funct. Bioinf. 1992; 13: 336-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the Escherichia coli sequence, a patch of highly basic amino acids that may contribute to membrane attachment by electrostatic interactions is found downstream of the G(X)XGXXG motif at positions 30–35. This pattern is missing at the corresponding position in Y. lipolytica NDH2, but the clustering of basic amino acids is observed immediately upstream of this motif. Two conserved regions almost exclusively consisting of apolar and aromatic residues have been proposed to form a possible interaction site for the hydrophobic substrate ubiquinone (5Kerscher S. Okun J.G. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2347-2354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no evidence is available that would experimentally identify the domains forming a binding pocket for the hydrophobic substrate ubiquinone. Here we have characterized HDQ 1The abbreviations used are: HDQ, 1-hydroxy-2-dodecyl-4(1H)quinolone; DBQ, n-decylubiquinone; DQA, 2-decyl-4-quinazolinyl amine; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.

Strains and Growth of Cells—Y. lipolytica strain PIPO (NUGM-Ht2, lys11–23, ura3–302, leu2–270, xpr2–322, MatA (18Kerscher S. Dröse S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) was used for studies on the reaction mechanism. Complex I deletion strain nuamΔ/pUB 7 (nuam::URA3, his-1, leu2–270, xpr2–322, NDH2i (14Kerscher S. Eschemann A. Okun P.M. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3915-3921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and NDH2 deletion strain GB 5.2 (ndh2::URA3, his-1, leu2–270, xpr2–322, MatB) were used for characterization of the inhibitor HDQ. Y. lipolytica cells were grown in complete medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) with 2% glucose at 27 °C. Preparation of Mitochondrial Membranes and Kinetic Measurements— 5–10 g of cells were vortexed 13 × 1 min in 10 ml of ice-cold 600 mm sucrose, 20 mm Na+/Mops, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm PMSF and 10 g of glass beads. After washing the glass beads with the same buffer, unbroken cells and cell fragments were sedimented at 2000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 25,000 × g for 1 h to pellet mitochondrial membranes that were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, shock-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. The steady-state NADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity of membranes was measured as NADH oxidation at 340–400 nm (ϵ = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1) or 366–400 nm (ϵ = 3.3 mm–1 cm–1). The concentration of HDQ was measured at 329 nm (ϵ329 = 9.4 mm–1 cm–1). To discriminate between NADH dehydrogenase activities in Y. lipolytica mitochondrial membranes, alternative dehydrogenase was measured in the presence of the complex I inhibitor DQA (2 μm) or using the complex I deletion strain nuamΔ/pUB 7. Complex I activity was determined using dNADH as electron donor, which is oxidized specifically by complex I (19Matsushita K. Ohnishi T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7732-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or NADH with the NDH2 deletion strain GB 5.2. Tests were carried out at 30 °C in 20 mm Na+/Mops, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm KCN either in a stirred cuvette using a Photodiode array spectrophotometer (Multi Spec 1501, Shimadzu) or in a microtiter plate using a Microplate spectrophotometer (SPEKTRAmax® PLUS384, Molecular Devices). The application of the Michaelis-Menten equation to enzymatic reactions involving highly hydrophobic substrates like ubiquinone in the presence of a membrane phase requires careful analysis of the primary data. In the case of alternative NADH dehydrogenase, we observed a non-linear dependence of the catalytic rate at low substrate concentrations. The data could not be fitted to either the standard Michaelis-Menten or to the Hill equation. Apparently, low concentrations of substrate were not available for reaction with alternative NADH dehydrogenase. The exact reason for this anomaly remained unclear. To deal with this experimental problem, we assumed that the substrate concentration [S] relevant for the rate v of alternative NADH dehydrogenase had to be corrected by an offset (in the range from 0 to 5 μm) that had to be determined for every data set. We corrected the added substrate concentration [S]added by this offset value c to obtain [S] as the substrate concentration available for binding and catalysis as shown in Equation 1. [S]=[S] added−c(Eq. 1) When we applied this correction, the experimental data were described very well by standard steady state kinetic equations. Michaelis-Menten parameters and the offset value c were determined by direct fit using the ENZFITTER software package (Biosoft). Reactivity of NDH2 with Different Electron Acceptors—We measured electron transfer rates with different electron acceptors to test the substrate specificity of alternative NADH dehydrogenase from Y. lipolytica. The activities were measured in the presence of 150 μm NADH and 60 μm of the respective electron acceptor in four different preparations at a membrane concentration of 20 μg/ml (Table I). A rather high variability of the absolute specific activities seemed to reflect some variability in the quality of the mitochondrial membranes and possibly also variable expression levels of YLNDH2. However, relative to DBQ, the activities with the different electron acceptors were very similar in all of the preparations. Remarkably, the highest rates were obtained with hydrophilic ubiquinone-1 and not with DBQ, which with respect to its hydrophobicity came closest to the physiological substrate ubiquinone-9. Somewhat lower electron transfer rates were observed with duroquinone and bicyclic menadione. The artificial electron acceptor dichlorophenol-indophenol, which is known to accept electrons from many NADH-dependent dehydrogenases, also gave catalytic activities that were even higher than with DBQ.Table ICatalytic activities of NDH2 with different electron acceptorsAcceptorActivity+ 10 μm HDQμmol min-1 mg-1%% InhibitionDBQ1.4 ± 0.310082 ± 3Ubiquinone-12.1 ± 0.4152 ± 479 ± 2Duroquinone0.7 ± 0.253 ± 823 ± 13Menadione0.7 ± 0.253 ± 5No inhibitionDichlorophenol-indophenol1.5 ± 0.3111 ± 515 ± 3 Open table in a new tab HDQ Is a Potent Inhibitor of YLNDH2—In a search for potent inhibitors of alternative NADH dehydrogenase, we tested the inhibitory effect of HDQ (Fig. 1) on the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of Y. lipolytica mitochondrial membranes from strain nuamΔ/pUB 7 that lacks complex I. With DBQ as a substrate, 80–90% YLNDH2 activity was inhibited by 10 μm HDQ. Ubiquinone-1 reductase was inhibited to the same extent, but the inhibitor had no or only minor effects on the reduction rates of the other electron acceptors tested (Table I). Using the same assay with increasing inhibitor concentrations, we determined the HDQ concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of alternative NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity (IC50) as 200 nm (Fig. 2). HDQ was found to also inhibit complex I decylubiquinone reductase activity in membranes from strain GB 5.2 lacking YLNDH2. However, at an IC50 of 2 μm, it acted ten times less efficiently on this enzyme (Fig. 2, insert).Fig. 2HDQ is a potent inhibitor of YLNDH2. The concentration of 1-hydroxy-2-dodecyl-4(1H)quinolone required for half-maximal inhibition (I50) of YLNDH2 was determined at a concentration of 30 μg/ml protein in the presence of 60 μm DBQ and 100 μm NADH. To selectively assay YLNDH2 activity, membranes of strain nuamΔ/pUB7 were used (IC50 = 200 nm).

Mitochondrial membranes from strain PIPO in the presence of 2 μm DQA were assayed at increasing DBQ concentrations using five different concentrations of NADH. In a Hanes (20Hanes C.S. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 1406-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) diagram ([S]/v over [S] in Fig. 3), the lines crossed very close to the y axis. This is consistent with a ping-pong reaction mechanism for which ideally the lines cross on the ordinate. Enzymes that operate by a ping-pong mechanism cannot form a ternary complex with both substrates. A (random or ordered) sequential mechanism could be excluded, as in these cases the lines would cross in the fourth quadrant of the Hanes diagram. Based on this result of the bisubstrate kinetics, we applied Equation 2 for a ping-pong mechanism for further kinetic analysis. v=Vmax[NADH][Q]KmQ[NADH]+KmNADH[Q]+[NADH][Q](Eq. 2) Refined fitting of the experimental data (not shown) using this equation resulted in Km values of 16.5 μm for NADH and 7.0 μm for DBQ. HDQ Exhibits Non-competitive Inhibition Kinetics for Both Substrates of YLNDH2—To determine the inhibition mode of the quinolone derivative HDQ, we performed steady-state inhibition kinetics for both substrates of alternative NADH dehydrogenase, NADH and DBQ. Initial analysis of the data (not shown) clearly suggested non-competitive inhibition for both substrates with similar values for the two inhibition constants. This conclusion appeared counterintuitive, because one would have expected that the hydrophobic inhibitor HDQ would compete with the hydrophobic substrate DBQ for a similar domain on the enzyme. However, there is a case of bisubstrate kinetics for which the observed pattern is predicted, namely if an enzyme operates by a pingpong mechanism and if the inhibitor blocks both the enzyme, in our case, oxidized YLNDH2 = E-FAD in Scheme 1, and the intermediate state, in our case reduced YLNDH2 = E-FADH2 in Scheme 1 (21Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 173-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic calculations, as described in the following, demonstrated that our data are consistent with a model in which the inhibitor also interacts with a complex consisting of enzyme and one of its substrates, presumably NADH. This situation is described by Scheme 1, where E is the enzyme, I is the inhibitor, Q is the oxidized, and QH2 is the reduced quinone. The rate equation describing this situation (21Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 173-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is shown in Equation 3. v=Vmax[NADH][Q]KmQ[NADH](1+[I]Kii)+KmNADH[Q](1+[I]Ki)+[NADH][Q](1+[I]Ki)(Eq. 3) When Equation 3 is inverted the following double-reciprocal form is obtained as shown in Equation 4. 1v=1Vmax×KmQ[Q](1+[I]Kii)+1Vmax×KmNADH[NADH](1+[I]Ki)+1Vmax(1+[I]Ki)(Eq. 4) Fig. 4 shows the corresponding double-reciprocal plots for inhibition kinetics with both substrates. As evident from increasing slopes and the fact that the lines do not intercept on the ordinate, inhibition kinetics were non-competitive for both substrates. If [NADH] is kept constant, the slope m in the double-reciprocal plots is given by Equation 5, m=KmQVmax+KmQVmax×Kii×[I](Eq. 5) and, as Equation 4 is symmetrical for [Q] and [NADH], if [Q] is kept constant by Equation 6. m=KmNADHVmax+KmNADHVmax×Ki×[I](Eq. 6) The inhibition constants Ki and Kii then can be derived directly from the x axis intercepts of the linear secondary plots m over [I] (Fig. 5A). The resulting inhibition constants were Kii = 340 nm (Equation 5) and Ki = 290 nm (Equation 6). Thus, within experimental error, both dissociation constants are the same. Similarly, the inhibition constants can be derived from the y axis intercepts b of the double reciprocal plots (Fig. 4) as shown in Equations 7 and 8. b=1Vmax(KmNADH[NADH]+1)+1Vmax×Ki(KmNADH[NADH]+1)×[I] for [NADH]=constant(Eq. 7) b=1Vmax(KmQ[Q]+1)+1Vmax(KmQ[Q]×Kii+1Ki)×[I] for [Q]=constant(Eq. 8) For Equation 7, the x axis intercept of the secondary plots b over [I] (Fig. 5B) directly gives the inhibition constant Ki as 380 nm. Equation 8 contains both inhibition constants and therefore only gives a unique solution if Ki = Kii, but it can be derived from our previous kinetic analysis that this condition holds for HDQ and NDH2. The resulting inhibition constant then again can be derived directly from the x axis intercept as 300 nm. The mean dissociation constant for HDQ of 330 ± 40 nm derived from all four secondary plots fits rather well to the directly obtained IC50 value of ∼200 nm (cf. Fig. 2). A simulation (see supplementary material) based on the above kinetic model reveals that the IC50 value is critically affected by the steady-state concentration of E-FADH2 that in turn depends on the ratio of the catalytic constants for the reduction of FAD and reoxidation of FADH2, kcatNADH and kcatQ. Using the parameters obtained from the kinetic analysis, it can be deduced that quinone reduction should be at least ten times faster than NADH oxidation, which is likely to occur by hydride transfer. With an IC50 of 200 nm, HDQ is the most potent inhibitor of alternative NADH dehydrogenase identified so far. At 95 μm, the IC50 of the commonly used inhibitor flavone is almost 500-fold higher (4de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As a hydrophobic quinolone derivative, HDQ was likely to act as ubiquinone analogue in a competitive manner. However, steady-state inhibition kinetics of HDQ followed a classical non-competitive pattern for both substrates, NADH and the hydrophobic ubiquinone derivative DBQ. This unexpected result could be explained based on a ping-pong mechanism that was deduced independently from the bisubstrate kinetics of alternative NADH dehydrogenase. Our data are consistent with a model in which the inhibitor HDQ shows competitive inhibition with the hydrophobic substrate DBQ and classical non-competitive inhibition with the hydrophilic substrate NADH. It should be noted that our data would also be consistent with a model in which both substrates are inhibited in a non-competitive fashion. However, this seems unlikely considering the structure and physicochemical properties of HDQ and ubiquinone. Moreover, the central conclusion that alternative dehydrogenase operates by a ping-pong mechanism would hold also in this case. Results obtained by classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics have to be interpreted with great caution if membrane-associated enzymes are analyzed that react with highly hydrophobic substrates, as is the case for alternative NADH dehydrogenase. However, the fact that direct measurement of the IC50 value, inhibition kinetics, and bisubstrate kinetics gave fully consistent results strongly supported our conclusion that the reaction of alternative NADH dehydrogenase with NADH and ubiquinone operates by a ping-pong mechanism. A ping-pong mechanism was also deduced from kinetic studies with partially purified SCNDI1 (22Velásques I. Pardo J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, these authors used the artificial hydrophilic electron acceptor dichlorphenol-indophenol as the second substrate. As indicated by the fact that this reaction is not inhibited by the quinone analogue HDQ (Table I), no conclusions on the physiological reaction mechanism can be drawn from this study. The absence of a ternary complex of alternative NADH dehydrogenase, NADH, and ubiquinone implied by the ping-pong mechanism can be interpreted in two ways. 1) Either there are two independent binding sites that are linked by a very strong anti-cooperative effect, or 2) both substrates bind competitively to a common binding pocket of the enzyme. A strong anti-cooperative effect of the required type is rarely found, and it is hard to see why this would be required for the simple electron transfer reaction catalyzed by alternative NADH dehydrogenase. However, mutually exclusive binding of hydrophilic NADH and hydrophobic ubiquinone to a common binding pocket also does not seem very likely at first sight. Although a definitive answer cannot be given based on kinetic analysis, the observed substrate specificity clearly favors the latter option. The reactivity of alternative dehydrogenase with quinone-like compounds seems to have no specific requirements, as it was shown to catalyze the reduction of quite different electron acceptors with similar efficiency. The fact that HDQ could only inhibit the reaction if the electron acceptor carried a ubiquinone headgroup suggested that the different substrates interacted in rather different ways with the enzyme. Overall, this lends little support to an electron transfer mechanism involving strong anti-cooperativity that would imply highly specific binding interactions and strict control of the electron transfer reaction. On the other hand, alternative NADH dehydrogenase seems not to discriminate too much between hydrophilic and hydrophobic quinones (Table I), suggesting that its actual active site interacts predominantly with the hydrophilic ubiquinone headgroup and that there may be no specific interaction with the hydrophobic tail of ubiquinone. This proposal is in line with the x-ray structure of the analogous mammalian quinone reductase QR1 (23Faig M. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Chen S. Winski S. Ross D. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3177-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) that catalyzes electron transfer from NAD(P)H to water soluble quinone-like compounds. Cocrystallization with NADPH and duroquinone revealed that both substrates bind in a similar fashion: The same side of the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor is stacked on to the duroquinone or the nicotineamide ring of NADPH. In summary, we conclude that alternative NADH dehydrogenase is highly likely to contain a common binding pocket for NADH and the ubiquinone headgroup. Download .pdf (.05 MB) Help with pdf files"

Chem. 2003; 278: 8846-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) recently postulated that a dynamic equilibrium exists between H1-NASP complexes and H1 bound to DNA. Previous studies on NASP (9Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in vivo the somatic linker histones H1a-H1e (see Ref. 12Wang Z-F. Sirotkin A.M. Buchold G.M. Skoultchi A.I. Marzluff W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar for mouse histone H1 nomenclature) were co-precipitated with NASP from somatic cell lysates, indicating that NASP is not selective for H1 subtypes. Of the several different subtypes of H1 histones, H1a, b, c, d, and e are found in most cells, whereas H1t is restricted to the testis. H1t is expressed during spermatogenesis, representing as much as 50% of the total H1 histones in pachytene spermatocytes (13Meistrich M.L. Bucci L.R. Trostle-Weige P.K. Brock W.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Drabent B. Bode C. Miosge N. Herken R. Doenecke D.

Gene (Amst.). 2003; 304: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and is preceded by tNASP expression in preleptotene spermatocytes. Although their exact function during spermatogenesis is unknown, gene-targeting experiments (16Lin Q. Inselman A. Han X. Xu H. Zhang W. Handel M.A. Skoultchi A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23525-23535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have shown that the absence of H1t and H1a in double null mice does not compromise spermatogenesis because compensation by H1c, H1d, and H1e most likely maintained normal spermatogenesis despite a reduced H1/nucleosome ratio (16Lin Q.

Under these conditions the major H1 histone binding activity of tNASP could have shifted from H1t to H1c, H1d, and H1e in double null mice. Unfortunately neither the relationship between tNASP, H1t, and other proteins nor the ability of tNASP to transport H1s into the mammalian cell nucleus has been characterized. Therefore we have studied tNASP in spermatogenic cells to understand more about the role of NASP-H1t complexes and now report that H1t binds tNASP in mouse germ cells in a complex in the cytoplasm that contains HSP90, which facilitates the initial loading of linker histones to tNASP. Moreover, tNASP can transport both H1t and somatic linker histones into nuclei. All of the chemicals and reagents used in this study were molecular biology grade. The restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Purification of plasmid DNA and PCR products were carried out using QIAprep Miniprep and QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen), and sequencing was performed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill automated sequencing facility. Rabbit anti-histone H1 (FL-219) polyclonal antiserum and mouse monoclonal IgG2a anti-HSP90 (F-8) antiserum were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-H1t antibody was a gift from Dr. M. Meistrich (Department of Experimental Radiation Oncology, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX). Rabbit antisera to the N terminus of NASP (nucleotides 96-1099) were prepared as described previously (9Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J.

Rabbit antisera to full-length recombinant NASP (nucleotides 92-2405) were made by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Somatic linker histones from calf thymus were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Construction of Expression Vectors—The entire coding sequence of mouse tNASP (nucleotides 92-2406, GenBank™ accession number AF034610) was amplified from mouse testis Quick-clone cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (8Alekseev O.M.

A tNASP deletion mutant (NASP-ΔTPR; nucleotides 92-1590), that lacked all tetratricopeptide repeats (nucleotides 1591-1891) was PCR-amplified, cloned into pCR® T7/CT-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), expressed, and purified identically to the full-length construct (8Alekseev O.M.

Preparation of the NLS deletion mutant (NASP-ΔNLS) has been described previously (8Alekseev O.M. Bencic D.C. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol.

Isolation, Separation, and Short Term Culture of Spermatogenic Cells—Isolation, separation, and short term culture of spermatogenic cells were carried out as described previously (17Bellve A. Millette C. Bhatnagar Y. O'Brien D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18O'Brien D.A. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 3A: 246-264Google Scholar). The cells were grown in plastic flasks for 16-18 h to allow Sertoli cells and other somatic cells to adhere to the bottom of the flask, and spermatogenic cells were collected from the supernatant. Harvested mouse spermatogenic cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and Earle's balanced salt solution (5.3 mm KCl, 117 mm NaCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm NaH2PO4, and 5.6 mm glucose) and resuspended in 10 volumes of RBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (catalog number 8340; Sigma). The nuclei were prepared essentially as described (19Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1998: 43.7Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were transferred to a prechilled glass Douncetype homogenizer and subjected to 10-12 quick strokes of the pestle. The nuclei were removed from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated for 20 s. The supernatant (nuclear fraction) was cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g. Microscopic examination of the nuclei and Western blotting (staining for histones) of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions confirmed their separation. In Vitro Nuclear Transport Assay—The nuclear import assay was performed on permeabilized HeLa cells as described previously (20Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on 22 × 22-mm glass coverslips in six-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY) and washed in ice-cold import buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The cells were permeabilized in ice-cold import buffer containing 40 μg/ml digitonin (40 mg/ml stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 8 min. Digitonin containing buffer was replaced by ice-cold import buffer, and the cells were washed in several changes of import buffer for 30 min with gentle rocking. The complete import mixture contained 50% (v/v) cytosol (the cytoplasmic fraction of HeLa cells centrifuged at 60 000 × g; total protein concentration was 10 mg/ml), 1 mm adenosine-5′-triphosphate, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Calbiochem), and 10 μm biotin-labeled histone H1t. Mouse tNASP or NASP-ΔNLS was added to a final concentration of 5 μm. The coverslips were inverted over 150 μl of complete import mixture on a sheet of parafilm in a humidified plastic box and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The transport reaction was stopped by fixation in 3% formaldehyde for 15 min. The coverslips were incubated in Texas Red Avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h, briefly washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole nucleic acid stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 min. The coverslips were mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes) and examined with a Zeiss Axiophot as described previously (21Lea I.A. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2004; 2: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Chromatography—Immunoaffinity chromatography was carried out as described previously (8Alekseev O.M. Bencic D.C. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8846-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For the preparation of NASP-enriched fractions from testis, lysates of 50 mouse testes (Pel-Freez® Biologicals, Rogers, AR) were prepared in 2 ml of MPER reagent (Pierce) with Protease (catalog number 8340; Sigma) and Proteasome (catalog number 539160; Calbiochem) inhibitors added. The cells were vortexed thoroughly and rocked for 10 min at room temperature. Debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 12,000 rpm), and the supernatant was applied to a 21 × 600-mm Bio-Sep SEC-S 3000 size exclusion HPLC column equipped with a 75 × 21.2-mm precolumn (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 252 mm NaCl. 1650 μl were injected per run at a flow rate of 7 ml/min, and fractions were collected every 0.25 min for 27 min. 500-μl aliquots of the collected fractions were concentrated in Amicon (Beverly, MA) microcentrifuge filters (molecular weight cut-off = 10,000 Daltons), boiled with SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by Western blotting. NASP-positive fractions were pooled (see Fig. 2A). Linker histones were purified from mouse testes (Pel-Freez® Biologicals) according to the method of Brown and Sittman (22Brown D.T. Sittman D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 713-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized histones were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a C-18 reverse phase column (Waters, Milford, MA; Delta-Pak, 15 μm, 300 Å, 3.9 × 300 mm) as described previously (8Alekseev O.M.

H1t fractions were pooled and used for further experiments. Mass Spectrometry Identification of tNASP-binding Partners—Water-soluble cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis-(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate (DTSSP; 2 mm; Pierce) with a spacer arm length of 12 Å was added to the Bio-Sep SEC-S 3000 column NASP pooled fraction (described above), incubated (at room temperature for 30 min), and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Western blots probed with anti-NASP antibody identified a high molecular weight NASP-positive band. A strip of gel containing the high molecular weight NASP-positive band was excised from a second identical gel, incubated in 50 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma; at 37 °C for 30 min), placed horizontally into a well of a 10% acrylamide gel (1 mm thick), and separated in the second dimension in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. The resulting gel was stained by 0.01% Bio-Rad R-250 Coomassie in 10% acetic acid overnight. Protein staining bands located below the position of the noted high molecular weight NASP-positive band (∼200 kDa) were excised and prepared for MALDI-TOF analysis. Digestion of the selected bands was accomplished using the Genomic Solutions ProGest with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The resultant peptide solution was then lyophilized and reconstituted in 45% methanol, 45% water, 10% formic acid. This solution was combined on the MALDI target with a saturated matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid. MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF were performed on the AB 4700 Voyager Proteomics Discovery System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting peptide peaks were searched against the MSDB and NCBI databases using the MASCOT search engine of GPS Explorer software. Mass spectrometry identification was done in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Proteomics Core Laboratory. ATPase Assay—The amount of ATP in solution was detected by the ENLITEN® ATP Assay System Bioluminescence Detection Kit (Promega). Bioluminescence was measured on a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). The assays were performed in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10-8 m ATP (Calbiochem). Typical protein concentrations were 0.2 μm for HSP90 and albumin and 0.2 μm for tNASP unless otherwise indicated. The temperature was set to 37 °C. Background (nonspecific) readings were subtracted from the total activity. Relative light units were normalized for comparing the results from different experiments. As ATPase activity increases the relative light units decrease. Significance was determined by the Student's t test. Co-immunoprecipitation—For binding experiments reverse phase HPLC purified H1t was biotin-labeled and mixed with recombinant tNASP (10 μg) in a 500-μl volume of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 5 mm MgCl2 and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. As required by the experiment, HSP90 (2 μg) and/or ATP (1 mm) were added. The precipitations were carried out with affinity-purified rabbit anti-recombinant NASP antibodies. Antibody-protein complexes were collected by Ultra Link® immobilized protein A/G (Pierce) and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were separated in 10-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) by electrophoresis, and the amount of co-immunoprecipitated H1t was calculated from background-subtracted images using Gel Expert software (Nucleotech, San Carlos, CA). Association of H1t Histones with tNASP—Isolation of NASP from mouse testis lysates by affinity chromatography with anti-NASP antibodies resulted in co-purification of H1 histones. Previous studies on NASP (9Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the somatic linker histones were co-precipitated with NASP. The presence of linker histone H1t was identified by probing Western blots with specific H1t antibody (Fig. 1, lane 3). Western blot analysis of the H1t co-purified with tNASP and H1t histones extracted from the mouse testis and isolated by reverse phase HPLC indicated that they had identical SDS-PAGE profiles (Fig. 1, lane 4). Identification of tNASP-binding Partners—To identify additional binding partners that may be complexed with tNASP in mouse germ cells, we used size exclusion chromatography and gel electrophoresis to isolate tNASP complexes. tNASP complexes were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-NASP antibodies following size exclusion HPLC separation of a mouse testis lysate on a Bio-Sep SEC-S 3000 column (Fig. 2A). NASP complexes were pooled and cross-linked with DTSSP. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the cross-linked complexes indicated the appearance of an ∼200-kDa NASP-positive band (Fig. 2B, asterisk). This cross-linked complex was cleaved by incubation of the gel in dithiothreitol, and the gel lane was subsequently placed horizontally and electrophoresed in the second dimension. Immediately under the reduced NASP complex two major protein-staining bands were revealed (Fig. 2C, bands 1 and 2). Initial identification of band 1 by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 3A) and additional confirming MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis of its peaks 1485.82 and 1187.67 (Fig. 3, B and C) identified this band as an endoplasmic reticulum protein 99 precursor (accession number A29317; tumor rejection antigen gp96). This protein belongs to the heat shock protein 90 family and has a histidine kinase-like ATPase domain. Band 2 (Fig. 2C) was identified as mouse heat shock protein 90α (accession number P070901; HSP86-1, tumor-specific transplantation 86-kDa antigen) with MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis of peaks 1264.59 and 1513.77 (Fig. 4). Heat shock protein 90 is a molecular chaperone with ATPase activity.Fig. 4A, MALDI-TOF of tryptic peptides recovered from sample 2 of the second dimension gel of tNASP-binding partners demonstrates peaks typical for HSP90. B and C, two peaks, m/z 1264.59 and 1513.77 (from A) sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) confirmed the HSP90 sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Affinity chromatography with anti-NASP antibodies confirmed the interaction between tNASP and HSP90 in mouse testis lysates (Fig. 5A). Moreover, as expected from the cross-linking studies of the HPLC (Bio-Sep SEC-S 3000 column) tNASP complexes, HSP90 was present in significant amounts (Fig. 5A). The distribution of tNASP and HSP90 in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments was also studied to confirm the interaction between tNASP and HSP90 in mouse germ cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, tNASP and HSP90 appear unequally distributed between nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of mouse spermatogenic cells. Somatic NASP was present in small amounts in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 5B) and probably represents a contaminant from nonspermatogenic cells in testis. The quality of the nuclear and cytoplasmic preparations was monitored by the presence of histone H1 staining (Fig. 5C). Affinity chromatography with anti-NASP antibodies confirmed that the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of mouse germ cells contain tNASP (Fig. 5D, lanes 1 and 2). However, HSP90 co-purified with tNASP only from the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 5D, lane 4) and HSP90 alone did not bind to the anti-NASP affinity column (Fig. 5D, lane 5). ATPase Activity of HSP90 Is Stimulated by tNASP—Nonactivated mammalian HSP90 has very low ATPase activity (23Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HSP90 ATPase activity, in the presence of ATP, was not significantly different from ATP alone or ATP + tNASP alone or ATP + HSP90 + bovine serum albumin (Fig. 6A). However, in the presence of tNASP the ATPase activity of HSP90 increased significantly (Fig. 6A; p < 0.03), and increasing amounts of tNASP (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 μm) resulted in increasing HSP90 ATPase activity (Fig. 6B). The presence of a TPR domain has been reported from a variety of proteins to interact with HSP90 (24Cheung-Flynn J. Roberts P. Riggs D. Smith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17388-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NASP contains TPR domains; therefore we tested a mutant tNASP lacking the TPR sites (NASP-ΔTPR). When the HSP90-ATP reaction mixture was incubated with NASP-ΔTPR, the HSP90 ATPase activity was strongly activated, although somewhat lower in activity than with intact tNASP (Fig. 6C). The tNASP TPR domains are apparently not required for the activation of HSP90 ATPase activity. H1t Binding in the Presence of HSP90—Previous studies demonstrated that NASP binds somatic linker histones (9Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and in the present study we have demonstrated that tNASP binds mouse testis-specific histone H1t. Because NASP stimulates HSP90 ATPase activity, we tested whether or not NASP binding H1t would increase in the presence of HSP90 and ATP. Fig. 7 demonstrates that the binding of H1t to NASP significantly increases in the presence of HSP90 and ATP (p < 0.04). Nuclear Transport of Linker Histones by tNASP—Protein nuclear import requires soluble cytoplasmic factors (20Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), and linker histones may use importin β and importin 7 heterodimers for nuclear transport (25Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bishoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, tNASP has both a functional nuclear localization signal (10O'Rand M.G. Batova I. Richardson R.T. Goldberg E. The Testis: From Stem Cell to Sperm Function. Springer, New York2000: 143-150Crossref Google Scholar) and functional linker histone-binding sites (9Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested the ability of tNASP to transport biotin-labeled H1t and somatic H1 histones into the nucleus utilizing an in vitro nuclear transport assay (20Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8 (A, B, and G) and Table I and as described previously (25Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bishoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), permeabilized HeLa cell nuclei do not transport H1 histones into the nucleus without the presence of cytoplasmic factors. Strikingly, tNASP (Table I) can completely replace the cytoplasmic factors and transport both H1t (Fig. 8C) and somatic H1 histones (Fig. 8H) into the nucleus. Transport by tNASP does not proceed at 4 °C (Fig. 8D), in the absence of ATP (Fig. 8E), or in the absence of the nuclear localization signal (Fig. 8F), indicating that transport is an energy-dependent process that requires the NLS.Table ITranslocation of linker histones into HeLa cell nucleiAverage number of cells counted ± S.D.

We have shown that tNASP and HSP90 are present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of mouse germ cells; significantly HSP90 is bound to NASP only in the cytoplasm, leading to the conclusion that one function of HSP90 may be to chaperone the proper folding of NASP to bind linker histones. The timing of the stage-specific expression of HSP90, tNASP, and H1t supports the conclusion that the tNASP-H1t-HSP90 complex forms in the cytoplasm because HSP90 is expressed beginning on day 10 postpartum and approximately 2 days before the rapid increase in tNASP expression (Ref. 26Shima J.E. McLean D.J. McCarrey J.R. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar; Mammalian Reproductive Genetics Data Base, mrg.genetics.washington.edu/). Expression of HSP90 and tNASP precede the expression of H1t in pachytene spermatocytes (13Meistrich M.L. Bucci L.R. Trostle-Weige P.K. Brock W.A. Dev.

EMBO Reports. 2003; 4: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Surprisingly tNASP activation of HSP90 did not depend upon binding to any of the three TPR sites found in the C terminus of NASP. TPR sites have previously been reported (29Blatch G. Laässle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) as protein-protein interaction sites between heat shock proteins and a number of functionally unrelated proteins. Our observation that NASP-HSP90 complexes occur only in the cytoplasm implies that there is a mechanism to release NASP from the complex. HSP90 can autophosphorylate serine (30Park M. Young K. Krishna P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 185: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or threonine (23Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol.

Weber B. Lee P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32822-32827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to HSP90 ATPase activation and increased H1t binding, this study demonstrated that tNASP transports H1t as well as somatic H1 histones into the nucleus. Linker histones have not been reported to be free in the cytoplasm and with the help of HSP90 ATPase activity are likely to be immediately bound by tNASP upon completion of their synthesis in the cytoplasm. Released from the HSP90 complex, tNASP-H1t would then translocate to the nucleus using the NASP NLS, which has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for NASP transport into the nuclei of Xenopus oocytes (10O'Rand M.G. Batova I. Richardson R.T. Goldberg E. The Testis: From Stem Cell to Sperm Function. Springer, New York2000: 143-150Crossref Google Scholar). Linker histones do not have an NLS; however H1 histones can translocate into the nucleus in the presence of a cytoplasmic factor(s) (36Kurz M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or importin β and importin 7 heterodimers (25Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bishoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), processes that are both temperature- and ATP-dependent. Similarly tNASP, in the absence of any other cytoplasmic factors, transports linker histones into the nucleus in an energy- and NLS-dependent manor. Consequently we hypothesize that after the synthesis of linker histones in the cytoplasm, they are bound to a complex containing NASP and HSP90, whose ATPase activity is stimulated by binding NASP. NASP-H1 is subsequently released from the complex and translocates to the nucleus where the H1 is released for binding to the DNA (8Alekseev O.M. Bencic D.C. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G.

https://openalex.org/W2050588267,"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been implicated as a promising anticancer agent by inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in certain types of cancer cells. This study explored the antimetastasis property of arsenic, drew potential link between arsenic use and radiotherapy, and uncovered the specific mechanisms underlying these remarkable responses. Using gelatin invasion assay and intravasation assay, we report the novel finding that low-dose ATO (1 muM) reduced the intrinsic migration ability of HeLa cells and significantly inhibited radiation-promoted tumor invasive potential of CaSki cells without inducing apoptotic cell death. Using the murine Lewis lung carcinoma model, the control animals and ATO treatment animals (1 mg/kg i.p., twice weekly) displayed similar in vivo growth kinetics, whereas the radiation (30 Gy in one fraction) and concurrent treatment groups showed considerable growth inhibition. Importantly, although concurrent treatment did not enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy to the primary tumor, further examination of the lungs revealed that all animals succumbed to radiation-accelerated lung metastases could be effectively treated by combination of ATO and radiation. Radiation-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression was significantly inhibited by ATO using sequential analysis of the expression of MMPs in xenografts. Supporting this observation, ATO directly downregulates radiation-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB activity in human cervical cancer cells. In sum, concurrent arsenic-radiation therapy not only achieves local tumor control but also inhibits distant metastasis. Experimental results of this study highlight a novel strategy in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2027651219,"Our previous studies conducted in MCF7-ptsp53 cells have demonstrated that overexpression of the wild-type (wt) p53 at permissive temperature 32°C leads to growth arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. To identify novel p53-regulated genes that are responsible for the p53-induced G2/M arrest, we conducted cDNA microarray analyses. The array results indicated that the mRNA level of protein regulator of cytokinesis (PRC1) was significantly decreased when the p53 transactivation activity was turned on, suggesting that PRC1 transcription could be downregulated by p53. In this study, we have extensively examined the functional role of p53 in the regulation of PRC1, a cell cycle protein that plays important roles during cytokinesis. We demonstrate that increased expression of the wt p53 either by exogenous transfection or chemical induction results in reduced mRNA and protein expression of PRC1 in HCT116 p53+/+, HCT116 p53−/−, MCF-7, T47D, and HeLa cells. Importantly, we show that the decreased PRC1 expression is accompanied by the appearance of binucleated cells, indicating the process of cell division after mitosis being inhibited. By isolation and characterization of a 3 kb genomic fragment containing the 5′-flanking region and part of exon 1 of PRC1 gene, we demonstrate that p53 directly suppresses PRC1 gene transcription. We further locate the p53-responsive sequence to the proximal promoter region −214 to –163, relative to the transcriptional start site. The in vivo interaction of p53 with PRC1 gene promoter is further demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Taken together, these new findings suggest that p53 may have important roles in the regulation of cytokinesis through controlling the transcription of PRC1."
https://openalex.org/W1992159618,"Fatty acid catabolism by β-oxidation mainly occurs in mitochondria and to a lesser degree in peroxisomes. Poly-unsaturated fatty acids are problematic for β-oxidation, because the enzymes directly involved are unable to process all the different double bond conformations and combinations that occur naturally. In mammals, three accessory proteins circumvent this problem by catalyzing specific isomerization and reduction reactions. Central to this process is the NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. We present high resolution crystal structures of human mitochondrial 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase in binary complex with cofactor, and the ternary complex with NADP+ and substrate trans-2,trans-4-dienoyl-CoA at 2.1 and 1.75 Å resolution, respectively. The enzyme, a homotetramer, is a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase with a distinctive catalytic center. Close structural similarity between the binary and ternary complexes suggests an absence of large conformational changes during binding and processing of substrate. The site of catalysis is relatively open and placed beside a flexible loop thereby allowing the enzyme to accommodate and process a wide range of fatty acids. Seven single mutants were constructed, by site-directed mutagenesis, to investigate the function of selected residues in the active site thought likely to either contribute to the architecture of the active site or to catalysis. The mutant proteins were overexpressed, purified to homogeneity, and then characterized. The structural and kinetic data are consistent and support a mechanism that derives one reducing equivalent from the cofactor, and one from solvent.

Essential fatty acids and derivatives that mammals acquire from exogenous sources or by endogenous biosynthesis fulfill critical functions in numerous metabolic pathways, in endocrine, and signaling processes (1Reddy J.K.

Fatty acids also provide much of the cells energy following degradation in a sequence of four enzyme-catalyzed reactions termed the β-oxidation cycle (1Reddy J.K. Hashimoto T. Annu. Rev.

The initial step leading into β-oxidation is fatty acid activation by formation of a thiolester bond with CoA in a reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. The oxidation of the Cα–Cβ bond produces an olefin, then hydration and oxidation produce a carbonyl group at Cβ. The fourth step is cleavage of the β-keto ester in a reverse Claisen condensation resulting in a new acyl-CoA derivative truncated by two C atoms, which are used to produce acetyl-CoA. These reactions proceed until eventually only acetyl-CoA is produced. Extensive studies have afforded a very clear picture of structure, mechanism, and specificity of the four enzymes (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-l-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and β-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase), which form this β-oxidation cycle (5Kim J.J. Battaile K.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Saturated fatty acids are simply processed in a continuous fashion by these four enzymes. However, most unsaturated fatty acids of biological origin contain cis-double bonds, and, if additional double bonds are present, they occur at three carbon intervals and so are unconjugated. Such molecules are problematic for the β-oxidation cycle, and in mammals three auxiliary enzymes are required to generate the conformation suitable for oxidation. The first such auxiliary enzyme is enoyl-CoA isomerase, the product of which can proceed to a further complete round of β-oxidation and then the initial oxidation step to produce a 2,4-dienoyl-CoA. This is a poor substrate for enoyl-CoA hydratase, and another auxiliary enzyme 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (DECR) now comes into play. DECR has broad substrate specificity and can process all unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds originating at even-numbered positions and most of those with the double bonds originating at odd-numbered positions irrespective of the double bond stereochemistry (3Kunau W.H.

Two structurally unrelated forms of DECR are known, both of which exploit NADPH to catalyze the reduction of a 2,4-dienoyl-CoA to an enoyl-CoA. A monomeric Escherichia coli enzyme, typical of that found in bacteria, contains the prosthetic groups flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, and a 4Fe-4S cluster in a three-domain structure (7Hubbard P.A.

Our interest is in mammalian DECR, which produces a trans-3-enoyl-CoA (Fig. 1). This CoA derivative is subsequently isomerized by the third auxiliary enzyme dienoyl-CoA isomerase to trans-2-enoyl-CoA, a conformation suitable for β-oxidation. DECR activity is present in mitochondria and peroxisomes (8Cvetanovic M. de la Garza Moreno M. Dommes D.L. Kunau W.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 9-56Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 9Hakkola E.H.

The presence of the mitochondrial reductase (mDECR) ensures that levels of CoA are not depleted to a level that could severely impair the oxidative function of that organelle. Peroxisomal DECR is more active toward longer chain substrates than mDECR (14De Nys K. Meyhi E. Mannaerts G.P. Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); indeed a function of peroxisomal β-oxidation is to modify the longer chain fatty acids into forms readily processed by the mitochondrial enzymes. It is worth noting that, among the three auxiliary enzymes, DECR may catalyze the rate-limiting step. The Vmax of the two isomerases are in the range of several hundreds up to 1000 μmol/min/mg, whereas the Vmax of mDECR is 30 μmol/min/mg. Thus DECR may be the control site for unsaturated fatty acid oxidation. This would be consistent with the importance of the enzyme activity for human survival, because deficiency of DECR is lethal (16Roe C.R. Miliington D.S. Norwood D.L. Kodo N. Sprecher H. Mohammed B.S.

Human mDECR carries five of these motifs that are implicated in aspects of structure stability and cofactor binding but lacks two that occur in the catalytic site. DECR, though similar, is distinct from other enoyl-thiolester reductases, because it catalyzes an unusual addition onto a conjugated diene, whereas the other enzymes are generally involved in fatty acid elongation in which they reduce a 2,3 (or α,β) double bond. A detailed, elegant biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance study of rat liver mDECR by Fillgrove and Anderson (24Fillgrove K.L. Anderson V.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12412-12421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) identified that the stereochemical course of the reduction is novel and that a specific lysine is essential for catalysis. In classic SDRs this lysine occurs in combination with a tyrosine in an active site YXXXK motif (where X is any amino acid) but in enoyl reductases the motif is YXXMXXXK. In the amino acid sequence of mDECR the nearest tyrosine is some 14 residues on the N-terminal side of the essential lysine. A serine is generally in direct association with the catalytic tyrosine, but analysis of mDECR sequences does not reveal a candidate for this residue. Structural information was sought to identify the “ubiquitous” tyrosine-serine pair or indeed to identify if different residue types contribute to the function of DECR. The gene for human mDECR encodes a polypeptide of 335 amino acids, but it is thought likely that the mature enzyme is truncated by removal of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (10Koivuranta K.T. Hakkola E.H. Hiltunen J.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have characterized a truncated version of recombinant human mDECR lacking the N-terminal 34 residues, which is active (15Chu X. Yu W. Chen G. Li D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and provides highly ordered crystals. Molecular replacement calculations were unsuccessful, and so phases were first obtained from a selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative. Subsequently, we obtained a ternary complex structure and in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analyses were able to test ideas concerning the contributions of specific residues to enzyme activity. We now detail the enzyme structure, the determinants of cofactor and substrate recognition, the identification of key residues, and their contributions to mDECR function. Sample Preparation and Crystallization—The plasmid carrying the gene encoding truncated mDECR with an N-terminal His6 tag was heat-shock transformed into a bacterial expression system (E. coli BL21(DE3), Novagen) and used according to established methods (15Chu X. Yu W. Chen G. Li D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To prepare SeMet mDECR the plasmid was transformed into the methionine auxotrophic strain of E. coli, B834(DE3) (Novagen), and selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin. Bacteria were cultured in M9 minimal media containing SeMet and expression induced at mid-log phase with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cell growth continued overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2,500 × g, 4 °C for 10 min), resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), and, following the addition of deoxyribonuclease-I and lysozyme, were lysed using a One-shot Cell Disrupter (Constant Systems). Insoluble debris was separated by centrifugation (27,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min), and the supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm syringe filter and applied to a Ni2+-resin column (Amersham Biosciences HiTrap). Following a wash with 50 mm potassium phosphate and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, the product was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient from 0 to 500 mm. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing mDECR were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The sample was then subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a 6-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing mDECR were again pooled and dialyzed overnight in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm EDTA then concentrated to ∼10 mg ml-1 for crystallization. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE confirmed that highly purified enzyme had been obtained, and SeMet was fully incorporated in the derivative. Isomorphous crystals of native and SeMet mDECR in complex with NADP+ and in ternary complex with substrate grew under similar conditions. Monoclinic blocks with space group P21, of dimensions ∼0.4 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3, appeared overnight from a drop consisting of 1 μl of protein solution, 1 μl of reservoir (16% polyethylene glycol 4000 w/v, 180 mm ammonium sulfate, 80 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6) to which had been added 20% glycerol, 4 mm NADP+), and 0.5 μl of 30% ethylene glycol. A ternary complex of mDECR with the oxidized cofactor and a substrate was prepared by incubating the protein solution with 4 mm NADP+ and 120 mm trans-2,trans-4-hexadienoyl-CoA (50-fold excess) for several hours prior to crystallization. All crystals were placed in a solution of artificial mother liquor containing 10% ethylene glycol for ∼10 s and flash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at -170 °C, characterized using in-house facilities, and then transported to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data were measured from SeMet mDECR in binary complex with NADP+ at a wavelength selected to maximize the anomalous dispersion from selenium, and the data (ESRF beam line ID29, Dataset 1, Table I) were recorded on an ADSC Quantum210 charge-coupled device detector. Another crystal of the SeMet protein, grown in a solution containing the reaction product (3-hexenoyl-CoA) and NADP+, provided Dataset 2 from beam line ID14 EH2 using an ADSC Quantum Q4 charge-coupled device detector. Subsequent analysis showed that the reaction product was not ordered, and this therefore represents a binary complex similar to that produced from Dataset 1, which, for completeness sake, is detailed in Table I. Data from a ternary complex of native mDECR (Dataset 3) were also measured on beam line ID14 EH2. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using either MOSFLM (25Leslie A.G.W.

The Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients derived from the phasing calculations and the NCS were included as restraints in the early stages of refinement. Rounds of refinement with REFMAC5 (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

The structure of the ternary complex was solved by rigid body refinement of the SeMet protein model and completed with similar refinement procedures. Several residues were truncated to alanine on the basis that the side-chain density was ill defined, and multiple side-chain conformations were also modeled for several residues.

Construction of Human mDECR Mutants—The Plasmid Mini kit and synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Tech Dragon Co. of Hong Kong. A QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in conjunction with the plasmid pLM1::HDER (15Chu X. Yu W. Chen G. Li D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) as template was used to construct the N148A, T197A, Y199A, S210A, K214A, E310A, and E310Q mutant expression plasmids. The following primers and their antisense primers (not shown) were used to introduce the mutated sequence: 1) g ata aac aat gca gca ggg gct ttt att tct cct act gaa ag (N148A); 2) gca gca ttt ctt tct att act gct atc tat gct gag act gg (T197A); 3) ctt tct att act act atc gct gct gag act ggt tca gg (Y199A); 4) ca ggt ttt gta gta cca gct gct tct gcc aaa gca gg (S210A); 5) cca agt gct tct gcc gca gca ggt gtg gaa gcc (K214A); 6) gta ctt att tca ggg gca ttc aac gac ctg ag (E310A); and 7) gta ctt att tca ggg caa ttc aac gac ctg ag (E310Q). PCR amplification was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase, and samples were subjected to 13 cycles of 0.5 min of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 60–63 °C, and 12 min of elongation at 72 °C in a Mastercycler (Eppendorf). The mutant-carrying plasmid was transformed into E. coli HB101 competent cells (Novagen) by electroporation (Bio-Rad) for screening purposes. Positive clones were identified, and the DNA sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of any PCR-generated random mutations. Plasmids were then transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells for expression purposes. Expression and Purification of Human mDECR Wild-Type and Mutant Proteins—Established methods were again used to prepare the samples (15Chu X. Yu W. Chen G. Li D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The proteins, all observed with >95% purity by SDS-PAGE, were stored at -80 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Activity Assay and Kinetic Studies—The trans-2,trans-4-hexadienoyl-CoA thiolester was synthesized from the corresponding free acid and CoA by the mixed anhydride method and purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The assay mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 100 μm EDTA, 125 μm NADPH, and 1 μg of enzyme in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The mixtures were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature, reactions were initiated by the addition of 40 μm trans-2,trans-4-hexadienoyl-CoA, and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for 60 s. One enzyme unit was defined as the activity that converts 1 μmol of trans-2,trans-4-hexadienoyl-CoA to trans-3-hexenoyl-CoA per minute. Determination of Km and the Vmax values was performed using the same assay buffer with substrate concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μm (15Chu X. Yu W. Chen G. Li D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Measurements were made at five substrate concentrations, and averages of two assays were used for each point.

An electron density map of excellent quality resulted from the experimentally derived phases (Fig. 2A). This structure provided the starting model for the analysis of the isomorphous DECR·NADP+·substrate ternary complex. The structures were refined satisfactorily using high resolution data, and the resulting models display good stereochemistry as indicated by analysis with PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W.

Over 90% of residues in each structure are in favorable regions with respect to φ/Ψ combinations in Ramachandran plots (not shown).

A combination of bioinformatics tools was used to predict a three-dimensional model for Arabidopsis FatB (AtFatB), which comprises a fold similar to that of Escherichia coli TEII, an enzyme that is functionally similar to plant TEs but lacks significant sequence similarity and displays different inhibitor sensitivity. The catalytic residues in AtFatB, Cys-264 and His-229, localize to the same region of the model as catalytic residues found in other enzymes with helix/multi-stranded sheet motifs (hot dog folds). Based on the model, we identified Asn-227 as a possible third member of the proposed papain-like catalytic triad. The conversion of Asn-227 to Ala resulted in a loss of detectable activity (>200-fold reduction), similar to the result seen for the equivalent mutation in papain. Mapping of plant TE specificity-affecting mutations onto the structural model showed that these mutations all cluster around the catalytic triad. Also, superposition of the crystallographically determined structures of the complexes of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA TE with substrate and β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase with inhibitor onto the AtFatB model showed that the substrate and inhibitor localize to the same region as the AtFatB catalytic triad in their respective structures. Together these data corroborate the structural model and show that the hot dog fold is common to enzymes from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and that this fold supports at least three different catalytic mechanisms.

Plant acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; TE, thioesterase; 4HBT, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase; AtFatB, Arabidopsis FatB; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; TE, thioesterase; 4HBT, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase; AtFatB, Arabidopsis FatB; PDB, Protein Data Bank. thioesterases (TEs) hydrolyze acyl-ACP thioester bonds, releasing free fatty acids and ACP. Their activity represents the terminal step in the plastidial fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. The resulting free fatty acids enter the cytosol where they are esterified to coenzyme A and further metabolized into membrane lipids and/or storage triacylglycerols. Acyl-ACP TEs have characteristic chain-length specificities that vary from 8–18 carbons, and the substrate preferences of individual TEs have been shown to play a key role in determining the composition of storage lipids (1Hills M.J. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 421-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 2Voelker T.A. Worrell A.C. Anderson L. Bleibaum J. Fan C. Hawkins D.J. Radke S.E. Davies H.M.

Because of this role, several studies have focused on engineering TEs with altered substrate specificities as a strategy for tailoring specialty seed oils (4Facciotti M.T. Yuan L. Fett Lipid. 1998; 100: 167-172Crossref Google Scholar). Although partially successful, these efforts have been hampered by the lack of structural information regarding the plant TEs.Plant TEs are a class of enzymes considered different from those of animals and bacteria because of their lack of sequence similarity (2Voelker T.A. Worrell A.C. Anderson L. Bleibaum J. Fan C. Hawkins D.J. Radke S.E. Davies H.M. Science. 1992; 257: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and differences in inhibitor sensitivities. Specifically, plant TEs exhibit sensitivity to thiol inhibitors, whereas animal and bacterial TEs are sensitive to serine-reactive reagents (5Davies H.M. Anderson L. Fan C. Hawkins D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Pollard M.R. Anderson L. Fan C. Hawkins D.J. Davies H.M. Arch. Biochem.

Genetica. 2003; 118: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting that the plant enzymes employ a cysteine in catalysis. Conversion of the only conserved cysteine in plant TEs to serine resulted in an enzyme that retained ∼60% activity and converted inhibitor sensitivity from thiol reagents to serine reagents (8Yuan L. Nelson B.A. Caryl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3417-3419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on these results and the identification of a conserved histidine within all plant TE sequences that is required for catalysis, the plant enzymes have been proposed to contain a papain-like catalytic triad (8Yuan L. Nelson B.A. Caryl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3417-3419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) containing Cys-264 and His-229 and an unidentified asparagine or aspartic acid.Plant acyl-ACP TEs are nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted globular proteins (2Voelker T.A. Worrell A.C. Anderson L. Bleibaum J. Fan C. Hawkins D.J. Radke S.E. Davies H.M. Science. 1992; 257: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) that are functional as dimers (9McKeon T.A. Stumpf P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12141-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hellyer A. Leadlay P.F. Slabas A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 763-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence alignments, the plant TEs have been shown to cluster into two families: FatAs, which show marked preference for 18:1 ACP with minor activity toward 18:0 and 16:0 ACPs, and FatBs, which hydrolyze primarily saturated acyl-ACPs with chain lengths that vary between 8 and 18 carbons (3Voelker T. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering. 18. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 111-133Google Scholar, 11Ginalski K. Rychlewski L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3291-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Jones A. Davies H.M. Voelker T.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). FatAs and FatBs both contain predicted ∼60-amino acid transit peptides; however, FatBs have an additional conserved hydrophobic 18-residue domain that can be removed without affecting activity and that has been proposed to form a helical transmembrane anchor (4Facciotti M.T. Yuan L. Fett Lipid. 1998; 100: 167-172Crossref Google Scholar). With the exception of two short regions that are unique to each class, the FatA and FatB sequences contain a core region of ∼210 residues that show dispersed sequence similarity throughout.In the absence of a crystal structure of either a plant TE or sequence homolog, we employed the program 3D-Jury meta-predictor (13Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) to compile the output of several individual predictive servers and generate a consensus secondary structural map of FatB. 3D-Jury then compared the FatB map to those of proteins with structures in the protein data bank and identified potential templates for modeling a three-dimensional structure of the plant acyl-ACP TEs. The FatB secondary structural map consisted of the 210-residue core that contained two repeats of a helix and multistranded sheet fold common to the so-called hot dog fold proteins. A search was performed to identify matches to the first and second domains individually. Models of these elements were subsequently manually assembled into a single structural model using the crystallographically determined structure of the Escherichia coli TEII protein as an alignment guide. The model is consistent with the existence of a papain-like catalytic triad and contains a conserved asparagine that our mutagenesis experiments show is important for activity. The model is also consistent with previous results from site-directed mutagenesis and chimeragenesis experiments on plant TEs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSequences—All sequences were obtained from NCBI. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were produced using Vector NTI Align (InforMax, Inc., Bethesda, MD). Three-dimensional coordinates for known structures were obtained from the PDB. All numbering of AtFatB residues is relative to the mature AtFatB protein sequence (see Fig. 1) (14Dormann P. Voelker T.A. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Structure Prediction and Analysis—The structure of the plant TE was predicted using the program 3D-Jury metapredictor (13Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). 3D-Jury provides both the secondary structure consensus as well as a list of scored proteins that, based on similarities between secondary structure, could serve as templates for molecular modeling. For each query sequence, 3D-Jury also provides BLAST scores from a search for trivial homologs in the PDB as well as PDB-BLAST scores from a more in-depth PSI-BLAST-based homolog search against the PDB. In CASP5, 3D-Jury showed an 86% correlation between the score output and correctly positioned residues in LiveBench 6 (15von Grotthuss M. Pas J. Wyrwicz L. Ginalski K. Rychlewski L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 3: 418-423Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Once the most common high scoring protein was identified from the ranked 3D-Jury list, the Arabidopsis FatB (AtFatB) sequence was threaded onto that three-dimensional structure using the homology-modeling program ESyPred3D (16Lambert C. Leonard N. de Bolle X. Depiereux E. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1250-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) that is based on a strategy using neural networks to evaluate sequence alignments. ESyPred3D uses the program MODELLER to build the final structural model. To assemble the final structure, each portion of the plant TE was modeled individually and then manually aligned using the backbone of E. coli TEII (PDB code 1C8U) as a guide with the use of Rasmol molecular graphics (17Sayle R. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). Images of the structures were produced using DeepView (18Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9474) Google Scholar). Ramachandran plots were produced and evaluated using the program RAMPAGE (19Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B. II I de Bakker P.I.W. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2002; 50: 437-450Crossref Scopus (3794) Google Scholar).Testing of the Model—Based on the location of the proposed active sites of the plant TE and multiple sequence alignments of this region of various plant TEs, we identified Asn-227 as the prime candidate for the third member of the catalytic triad. We used overlap extension PCR to design the AtFatB-N227A mutant and tested its activity in an E. coli expression system (20Yuan L. Voelker T.A. Hawkins D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10639-10643Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Voelker T.A. Davies H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7320-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli Expression System—The coding sequence of the mature AtFatB was amplified from plasmid TE3-2 (14Dormann P. Voelker T.A. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with primers 5′SpeFatBf (5′-GACTAGTTTACCTGACTGGAGCATGCTTCTTGC-3′) and FatB(X)R (5′-CGGCTCGAGGGTAGTAGCAGATATAGTT-3′) and cloned into the pBC expression plasmid using XhoI and SpeI restriction sites. The final plasmid construct pBC(AtFatB-parent) contains three amino acid residue differences (I176L, E178D, L202S) as compared with the GenBank™ sequence (accession number Z36911). Primers for the overlap extension PCR to build the N227A mutant were NAF (5′-TGACCTAGATGTTGCACAGCATGTGAAT-3′) and NAR (5′-ATTCACATGCTGTGCAACATCTAGGTCA-3′). Plasmids were transformed into the K27 strain of E. coli (CGSC5478), which has a mutation in the FadD enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis that prevents uptake of free fatty acid from the medium. Thus, when an acyl-ACP TE is expressed in this system, the free fatty acid product of the thioesterase reaction accumulates in the medium (20Yuan L. Voelker T.A. Hawkins D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10639-10643Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This assay has been used and validated for FatBs and FatAs in several studies (12Jones A. Davies H.M. Voelker T.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 14Dormann P. Voelker T.A. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7320-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fatty Acid Analysis—Fatty acid content of the medium from various cell cultures was determined by the production and measurement of fatty acid methyl esters. Briefly, 22 μl of glacial acetic acid and 1 ml of 1:1 (v:v) chloroform:methanol containing 18:3 as an internal standard were added to 0.5 ml of medium from pelleted cells corrected to give equivalent cell density based on A600. After mixing by inversion, phases were separated by centrifugation, and the lower phase was transferred to a fresh glass tube. The chloroform was evaporated by N2 stream, 1 ml of 2% H2SO4 in methanol was added, and the samples were incubated at 90 °C for 1 h. Samples were extracted once with 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl and 2 ml of hexane. The organic phase was transferred to a fresh tube and dried under N2 and then resuspended in 50 μl of hexane. 3-μl samples were analyzed with the use of a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 5973 mass selective detector and a J&W DB-23 capillary column (60 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The injector was held at 225 °C, the oven temperature was varied (100–160 °C at 25 °C/min, then 10 °C/min to 240 °C), and a helium flow of 1.1 ml/min was maintained.RESULTSSecondary Structure—The amino acid sequences of 10 plant TEs were submitted to 3D-Jury (Table I). The secondary structures predicted by each of the three programs included in the metaserver analysis were similar for all of the TEs (Fig. 1). Following an initial region of variable secondary structure, each of the plant TEs contained a tandem repeat of a helix/4-stranded sheet motif separated by a linker region of variable length and structure.Table I3D-Jury results The most common match in every case was 4HBT (PDB code 1BVQ). Other high scoring matches were E. coli hypothetical protein Ybaw (1NJK) and E. coli hypothetical protein Ec709 (1S5U).

The most common high scoring match for each was the structure for 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA TE (4HBT) from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3 (PDB code 1BVQ). The active 4HBT is a homotetramer that comprises a dimer of dimers (22Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Liu R. Taylor K.L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Holden H.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11152-11160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The 4HBT structure contains a long helix packed against a 5-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (24Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Zhuang Z. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33572-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 3D-Jury predicts a tandem repeat of domains equivalent to the 4HBT structure within a single FatB monomer (Fig. 1), the first domain with 21.2% identity and the second with 17.3% identity as calculated by ESyPred3D. Within the FatA monomer, 3D-Jury only identifies a single equivalent region to the 4HBT structure, although the secondary structures of FatA and FatB are very similar overall, suggesting that it, too, will comprise a similar structure.Other common high scoring secondary structural matches for the plant TE secondary structural maps were 1S5U (E. coli hypothetical protein Ec709; Swiss-Prot accession no. P08999) and 1NJK (E. coli hypothetical protein Ybaw; Swiss-Prot accession no. P77712), both of which also share the hot dog motif. All other predicted matches also shared this motif and included 1Q4S (Arthrobacter sp. strain Su 4-hydroxybenzoyl CoA TE), 1J1Y (Thermus thermophilus Hb8 Paai), 1PSU (E. coli PaaI), and 1VH5 (Ydii putative TE). The ribbon structure of 1BVQ chain A and the predicted structure of the N-terminal domain of AtFatB are strikingly similar (Fig. 2), as are the structures of high scoring matches 1NJK and 1S5U.Fig. 2Ribbon diagrams of known three-dimensional structures for monomers of 4HBT, E. coli hypothetical protein Ybaw, and E. coli hypothetical protein Ec709 (PDB codes 1BVQ, 1NJK, and 1S5U, respectively). AtFatB is the unrefined model of the N-terminal domain (residues 52–178) of the plant TE threaded onto the 4HBT (1BVQ) monomer structure (0.93 Å root mean square deviation over 119 Cα atoms). Strands are shown in yellow and helices in red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because 3D-Jury predicted that AtFatB contains two domains with similarity to the 4HBT structure, we searched the PDB for proteins with a tandem repeat of the 4HBT core domain. The E. coli TEII protein has a tandem repeat of the helix/4-stranded sheet motif as part of a structure consisting of 12 strands and six helices (26Li J. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Smith S. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The active site of TEII is located near the interface between the two individual hot dog domains and contains a catalytic triad of Asp, Gln, and Thr, which orients a water molecule that initiates a nucleophilic attack on the substrate (26Li J. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Smith S. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Apart from the core secondary structural motif (i.e. tandem repeats of helix/4-stranded sheet (HEEEE) separated by a linker region), the secondary structure of AtFatB is quite different from that of TEII, particularly in the regions immediately preceding each of the repeated domains. For example, the N terminus of TEII preceding the first repeat contains a helix followed by two short sheets and a coil region (26Li J. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Smith S. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas the N terminus of AtFatB contains a long helix followed by a long coil region and a long sheet (Fig. 1). Given these differences in secondary structure, it is not surprising that TEII was not among the structures identified by 3D-Jury. Furthermore, because of the differences in secondary structure and sequence between TEII and AtFatB, we were unable to thread AtFatB directly onto the TEII structure. However, we were able to build separate models of the two individual domains of AtFatB based on their individual highest secondary structure matches. The model of the N-terminal domain of AtFatB was based on the structure of the monomeric protein 4HBT; the model of the C-terminal domain of AtFatB was based on the monomeric protein E. coli Ybaw (PDB code 1NJK). The two individual AtFatB domains were assembled using the model of TEII (Fig. 3) as a guide. Specifically, the Cα atoms of the β-sheets of the two individual AtFatB models were used to align the overall model of AtFatB with respect to the corresponding Cα atoms in TEII. A series of close contacts, primarily at the interface between the two manually aligned domains, were identified with the use of DeepView. The majority of these close contacts were resolved by performing a single round of manual refinement with DeepView to minimize steric hindrance. The AtFatB model was deposited at PDB under accession number 1XXY.Fig. 3a, the AtFatB model (light blue and blue for each of the domains) overlapped onto the structure of E. coli TEII (orange). The catalytic residues of AtFatB (Cys-264, His-229, and Asn-227) are shown in black. b, Ramachandran plot for the predicted model of AtFatB.

The stereochemistry of the model was evaluated using RAMPAGE (19Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B. II I de Bakker P.I.W. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

The Ramachandran plot shows that in the predicted AtFatB model, 91.3% of the residues are in the favored region, 7.3% in the allowed region, and 1.4% in the outlier region (Fig. 3b). The three outlier residues are Pro-99, Glu-178, and Trp-316. Residues 178 and 316 are in loops near the end of the modeled regions. For comparison, the crystallographically determined 4HBT structure contains 97.1% of the residues in the favored region and 2.9% in the allowed region (22Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Liu R. Taylor K.L.

Thus, the predicted structure of the AtFatB shows a modular organization of the active site in that residues that affect specificity occur within the N-terminal domain, whereas the catalytic residues occur within the C-terminal domain.Fig. 4a, a stereo view composite model of the active site regions of several TEs with the helix/multistranded sheet secondary structure motif.

Finally, loop Asn-122–Leu-127 of 4HBT has been implicated in inhibitor binding both because it is located near the pyrophosphate moiety of the inhibitor and because it changes structure upon ligand binding (25Thoden J.B.

https://openalex.org/W1964220441,"Recently, we have identified a novel 1.8 kb human Notch4/Int3 RNA species (designated h-Int3sh). The h-Int3sh RNA encodes a protein that is missing the CBF1-binding region (RAM23) of the Notch 4/Int3 intracellular domain (ICD). Expression of h-Int3sh in the MCF10A 'normal' human mammary epithelial cell line has been previously shown to induce changes characteristic of oncogenic transformation, including anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. To study the consequences of h-Int3sh expression in vivo on mammary gland development and tumorigenesis, three transgenic mouse lines were established, in which the transgene is the Whey acidic protein (WAP) promoter linked to h-Int3sh. Expression of WAP-Int3sh was detectable in the mammary gland at day 15 of pregnancy in each transgenic line. Mammary gland development in all founder lines is normal and the females can lactate. WAP-h-Int3sh females from each of the founder lines develop mammary tumors, but with a long latency (average age of 18 months). Tumor development was associated with activation of Notch pathway, as evidenced by upregulation of Hes-1. The long latency of mammary tumors in WAP-h-Int3sh mice could be due in part to the subcellular localization of h-Int3sh. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected COS-1 cells showed that h-Int3sh is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, while Int3-ICD is detected only in the nucleus. We speculate that the Notch4/Int3 ICD-induced block to mammary gland development and tumorigenesis are consequences of an increasing gradient of CBF1-dependent Notch4/Int3 signaling."

Several tDNA-tagged lines were isolated, including two that were determined to be allelic to an EMS-mutagenized line denoted acn1 for ac non-utilizing. Following conventions, the tDNA-tagged mutants were designated acn1-2 and acn1-3. Both mutants displayed identical behavior to acn1-1 on a variety of fluorinated and nonfluorinated organic acids, indicating that resistance was specific to fluoroacetate. Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR identified the sites of tDNA insertion in both mutants to be within different exons in a gene, which encoded a protein containing an AMP-binding motif. Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed that the gene was not expressed in the mutants, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that the gene is expressed in imbibed seeds and increases in amount during establishment. The wild type AMP-binding protein cDNA was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the expressed protein was purified by nickel chelate chromatography. The enzyme was identified as an acyl-CoA synthetase that was more active with acetate than butyrate and was not active with fatty acids longer than C-4. The enzyme was localized to peroxisomes by enzymatic analysis of organellar fractions isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Labeling studies with [14C]acetate showed that acn1 seedlings, like those of the isocitrate lyase mutant icl-1 (isocitrate lyase), are compromised in carbohydrate synthesis, indicating that this enzyme is responsible for activating exogenous acetate to the coenzyme A form for entry into the glyoxylate cycle.

During seed germination and establishment, catabolism of fatty acids by glyoxysomal β-oxidation produces large quantities of acetate as acetyl-CoA, which is converted to sucrose via the sequential actions of the glyoxylate cycle, trichloroacetic acid cycle, and gluconeogenesis (1Beevers H. Stumpf P.K. The Biochemistry of Plants. 4. Academic Press, Inc. New York1980: 117-130Google Scholar, 2Gerhard B. Moore T.M. Lipid Metabolism in Plants. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 527-565Google Scholar). In seeds, in which oil is stored in the endosperm, storage lipid is converted completely to sucrose (3Canvin D.T. Beevers H. J. Biol.

Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 72-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggest that acetate utilization during seedling establishment of some oilseed species may be more complex than described by classical gluconeogenic models. In Arabidopsis, exogenous acetate is respired within mitochondria as well as being converted to sucrose (5Eastmond P.J. Germain V. Lange P.R. Bryce J.H. Smith S.M. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dorne A-J. Long D. Coupland G. Mache R. Carol P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2161-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The importance of acetate as a respiratory metabolite has been demonstrated also by acetate/glucose diauxic growth studies of rice cell cultures (7Lee T.K. Lee W.S. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), where acetate was found to be utilized preferentially by inhibiting glucose uptake (8Lee T.K. Lee S.M. Lee W.S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1046-1052Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The preferential use of acetate was accompanied by an increase in the activity of glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase, which supported the proposal that acetate was a positive regulator of glyoxylate cycle enzyme and gene expression in plants (9Kudielka R.A. Theimer R.R. Plant Sci. Lett. 1983; 31: 237-244Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Graham I.A. Leaver C.J. Smith S.M. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Acetate has also been shown to inhibit photosynthetic gene expression and may help regulate the switch from heterotrophy to autotrophy in developing seedlings (11Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). We have undertaken a program to identify Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in their ability to sense acetate as a regulatory metabolite affecting gene expression (12Hooks M.A. Turner J.E. Murphy E. Graham I.A. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2004; 271: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have adapted for Arabidopsis a method employing the biotoxin monofluoroacetic acid, which was successfully used to isolate the acetate regulatory gene facB from Emericella (Aspergillus) nidulans (13Apirion D.

Genet. 1997; 254: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to identifying an important acetate regulatory gene, studies of fluoroacetate-resistant mutants of filamentous fungi have revealed many acetate metabolism genes required for growth on acetate as a sole carbon source, such as those encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes (15Flavell R.B. Fincham J.R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Owen N.E. Chaure P.T. Connerton I.F. J. Gen.

Domínguez A.I. Turner G. Laborda F. Arch.

Domínguez A.I. Valenciano S. Turner G. Laborda F. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By employing the screening strategy of resistance to FAc, we predicted that we would also identify plant acetate utilization genes as well as potential regulatory genes. Characterization of two tDNA-tagged mutants revealed independent mutations in a short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase gene of unknown biological function (19Shockey J. Fulda M.S. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Based on resistance to FAc, we hypothesized that the enzyme may activate exogenously supplied acetate for entry into the glyoxylate cycle in establishing seedlings (12Hooks M.A. Turner J.E. Murphy E. Graham I.A. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2004; 271: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the enzyme is responsible for this process, and we discuss the function of the enzyme relating to potential sources of acetate production within cells.

All seeds were surface-sterilized and imbibed in the dark at 4 °C for 3 days before sowing onto agar plates. For all experimental conditions, seeds were germinated at 20 °C at 70 μmol of photons (m2)–1 s–1 constant illumination. Standard agar media plates contained 0.8% agar, half-strength Murashige and Skoog salts (21Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-496Crossref Scopus (53968) Google Scholar), and 20 mm sucrose. The media, prior to the addition of agar and subsequent autoclaving, were adjusted to pH 5.7 with 0.1 n KOH. For the genetic screen, 200 seeds from each batch were sown onto standard agar media plates containing 0.5 mm sodium FAc acid (Sigma). FAc was prepared as a concentrated stock solution, filter-sterilized, and added to the standard agar media after autoclaving. After 7 days, resistant seedlings were rescued onto standard agar media plates minus FAc. Surviving seedlings were transferred to soil after 4 days. Upon request, all novel materials described in this publication will be made available in a timely manner for noncommercial research purposes. Comparative Germination and Growth Studies—Comparative germination tests of the mutants using the various selective agents were conducted as described in Hooks et al. (12Hooks M.A. Turner J.E. Murphy E. Graham I.A. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2004; 271: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Segregation of progeny for glufosinate resistance was conducted at a concentration of 30 μg ml–1. Seedling growth studies were conducted by using standard agar plates with the specified concentrations of acetate and butyrate replacing sucrose. Standard agar plates were used for purposes of normalizing seedling fresh weights as not all seed batches among the wild types and mutants gave equivalent seedling weights under standard conditions. After 7 days of growth, seedlings were harvested, counted, and the average fresh weight per seedling determined. Identification of Flanking Sequences and Characterization of Mutant Loci—Genomic DNA was isolated from leaf material from acn1-2 (ac non-utilizing) and acn1-3 using the PUREGENE® DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

Reaction conditions and cycling times were identical to those reported, except that a denaturation cycle of 93 °C for 1 min and 95 °C for 1 min was inserted at the start of the secondary and tertiary PCR sequences.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) against all Arabidopsis entries in The Arabidopsis Information Resource data base. tDNA copy number was determined by Southern blotting of genomic DNA using a tDNA-specific probe, which overlapped the unique EcoRI site within the tDNA. Digoxigenin-labeled probe synthesis and filter hybridization was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The ACN1-specific primers, 5′-ATCCGACCAGAAAATCTGTGATT-3′ for exon 1, 5′-CAACTATATCGAGATCAAGGACA-3′ for exon 2, and 5′-TTCCTATAACCTGCTTCTTGGTA-3′ for exon 3, were used in conjunction with the left border primers (see above) or right border primers, 5′-TGGCTTCTACAAATGCCATCATTG-3′, 5′-AAGGAAAGGCTATCGTTCAAGAT-3′, and 5′-TTCAAAGCAAGTGGATTGATGTG-3′ to determine the orientation of tDNAs at each locus. RT-PCR and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from seedling and leaf material using the Purescript™ RNA isolation kit (Flowgene Instruments, Shenstone, Leicestershire, UK) or the hot phenol method (24Kay R. Chan A. Daly M. McPherson J. Science. 1987; 236: 1299-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Two-tube RT-PCR was performed on total RNA using the Qiagen Omniscript™ Reverse Transcriptase and HotStarTaq™ kits according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK). Reverse transcription was conducted in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 0.5 μg of total RNA, 1× reaction buffer, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 0.35 μm oligo(dT)15 primer, 40 units of RNase inhibitor (rRNasin™, Promega), and 4 units of Omniscript™ reverse transcriptase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. PCR was conducted in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 5 μl of RT product, 1× PCR Master Mix, 0.5 μm sense primer, 5′-TAAACAAATCGAGGGATCCAGATATG-3′, and 0.5 μm antisense primer, 5′-TTATCATTTGAAAGTCGACACACAAG-3′. The cycling conditions were as follows: 15 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C, followed by 5 min at 72 °C. Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted according to Penfield et al. (25Penfield S. Rylott E.L. Gilday A.D. Graham S. Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2705-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for reverse transcription consisted of 5 μg of DNase-treated total RNA, 1× buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2), 10 μm dithiothreitol, 2.5 ng μl–1 oligo(dT), 0.15 mm dNTPs, and 200 units of Sensiscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RNase-free water was added to make a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 min at 70 °C in order to denature the RNA and was chilled on ice for 2 min. The reverse transcriptase was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. PCR was conducted on the ABI Prism 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR®-green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The sense and antisense primers, respectively, for the 18 S ribosomal RNA were 5′-TCCTAGTAAGCGCGAGTCATC-3′ and 5′-CGAACACTTCACCGGATCAT-3′. The sense and antisense primers, respectively, for acn1 were 5′-CGGTTCTTGAAGCCTCTGTTGT-3′ and 5′-ACAAACGCACACGGAGATTCTT-3′. Heterologous Expression in Escherichia coli and Protein Purification—A cDNA library constructed into λZAP II (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) with RNA isolated from 3-day-old etiolated hypocotyls (26Kieber J.J. Rothenburg M. Roman G. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. The ACN1 cDNA was amplified from the library by PCR using the primers 5′-TAAACAAATCGAGGGATCCAGATATG-3′ and 5′-TTATCATTTGAAAGTCGACACACAAG-3′, which have integral BamHI and SalI restriction sites, respectively. The fragment was directionally cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of the expression vector pQE31, and the resulting construct was transformed into E. coli M15[pREP4] cells. Protein was expressed and column-purified on Ni-NTA resin according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Ltd.). Tissue Extraction and Subcellular Fractionation—Fractionation of seedling organelles was conducted as described by Eastmond et al. (5Eastmond P.J. Germain V. Lange P.R. Bryce J.H. Smith S.M. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5669-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The tissue used consisted of ∼7000 4-day-old dark-grown seedlings, which were ground in a smooth mortar with pestle in 5 ml of grinding buffer. Two ml of filtered extract were layered onto an 8-ml, 55 to 30% linear sucrose density gradient sitting on a 1-ml cushion of 55% sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 3 h in a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge using an SW-28 swing out rotor. Enzyme Assays—Acyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured either spectrophotometrically in a coupled reaction with citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase according to Millerd and Bonner (27Millerd A. Bonner J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1954; 49: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or radioactively by using 14C-labeled short-chain fatty acids according to Huang (28Huang K.P. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 37: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The radioassay was expected to give lower rates than the continual monitoring of the spectrophotometric assay. The radioassay was an end point assay that required separation of product from substrate by TLC. Product losses from the recovery process and subsequent scintillation counting could cause a substantial underestimation of the amount of product formed. Other procedural factors, such as enzyme dilution, may have also contributed to the lower rates. Therefore, each assay protocol was separately optimized to ensure that enzyme was running at Vmax. Short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity was measured according to Hryb and Hogg (29Hryb D.J. Hogg J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Activity of cytochrome c oxidase and triose-phosphate isomerase was determined according to Tolbert (30Tolbert N.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 734-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Total protein amount was measured according to Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as quantification standard. Chlorophyll amounts were determined according to Wintermans and de Mots (32Wintermans J.F.G.M. de Mots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 109: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Labeled Acetate Feeding—The [14C]acetate feeding experiments were adapted from Eastmond et al. (5Eastmond P.J. Germain V. Lange P.R. Bryce J.H. Smith S.M. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5669-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. One hundred 2-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were bubbled for 4 h in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0.2 ml of 1 mm sodium [2-14C]acetate (20.5 MBq·mmol–1) and 50 mm MES, pH 5.2. Two consecutive 0.15-ml aliquots of 5 n KOH were used to trap respired CO2. Both fractions were combined for scintillation counting. After 4 h, the seedlings were washed, extracted, and fractionated (3Canvin D.T. Beevers H. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 988-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the proportion of radioactivity in each component was determined on a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter using 10 ml of PerkinElmer Life Sciences™ Optiphase HiSafe3 liquid scintillation mixture. The ethanol-insoluble material was combusted using a Biological Material Oxidizer OX400 (R. J. Harvey Instrument Corp.). The CO2 was trapped in 15 ml of Oxosol™ 14C (National Diagnostics, Hessle, East Riding of Yorkshire, UK) and counted directly. FAc Screen of tDNA Mutagenized Populations—A screen of 83 seed pools of tDNA activation-tagged lines (20Weigel D. Ahn J.H. Blázquez M.A. Borevitz J.O. Christensen S.K. Frankhauser C. Ferrándiz C. Kardailsky I. Malancharuvil E.J. Neff M.M. Nguyen J.T. Sato S. Wang Z-Y. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Harrison M.J. Lamb C.J. Yanofsky M.F. Chory J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) yielded, among others, two seed lines that were well established in the presence of 500 μm FAc. The established resistant seedlings were evident among the background of seeds exhibiting delayed germination (Fig. 1). From seed stock numbers N21328 and N21343 (NASC, Nottingham, UK) one and seven resistant seedlings, respectively, were rescued. PCR analyses of the tDNA/genomic junctions of each mutant showed that those from batch N21343 were siblings. A genetic analysis of reciprocal crosses of the mutants to the parental wild type Col-7 (Columbia) demonstrated that each was recessive with respect to FAc resistance, and, therefore the phenotype was because of a loss of function mutation. Reciprocal crosses of the mutants to the EMS mutant acn1 demonstrated allelism of the mutations with all F1 and F2 progeny being Fac-resistant (12Hooks M.A. Turner J.E. Murphy E. Graham I.A. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2004; 271: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, the EMS mutant allele was referred to as acn1-1 and the tDNA-tagged alleles as acn1-2 (N21343) and acn1-3 (N21328), respectively. The mutants were examined for the specificity of FAc sensitivity by growth analyses on a variety of compounds through which FAc toxicity may be manifested (Fig. 2). The compounds were tested at concentrations equivalent to that of FAc used in the screen, except for fluorocitrate, which was used at 1 mm in order to give 0.5 mm of the L stereoisomer. Wild type responses of acn1-2 and acn1-3 to the FAc equivalent concentrations of sodium acetate and sodium butyrate were observed for both mutants showing that enhanced tolerance to cytosolic acidification was not the basis of FAc resistance (Fig. 2). Wild type-like sensitivity of both mutants to fluorocitrate demonstrated that aconitase activity or mechanisms of citrate transport were not compromised in the mutants and thus were not the basis of FAc resistance. Only with FAc was any difference observed between wild type and mutants, which indicated that resistance to FAc was a specific metabolic phenomenon. Seedling fresh weights of acn1-2 were compared with those for the wild types, Col-7 and Col-0, and the EMS mutant acn1-1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of the weak acids acetate and butyrate (Fig. 3). Both wild types and both mutants exhibited no effects to the exogenous acetate at concentrations of 1 and 2 mm. At 3.5 mm acetate, wild type growth was decreased 30–40% whereas that of the mutants was decreased 50–60% (Fig. 3A). At this acetate concentration, chlorophyll levels in the mutants were ∼30% those in the wild types (data not shown). These results indicate that the mutants are more sensitive to exogenous acetate than wild type and may be disrupted in an important mechanism of acetate utilization and detoxification. Higher steady-state acetate levels in the mutant would lead to a relatively lower cytosolic pH because of the weak acid properties of acetate. Arabidopsis seedlings were also sensitive to exogenous sodium butyrate (Fig. 3B). With butyrate, a decrease in average seedling weight comparable with that on 3.5 mm acetate was achieved for both wild types at an exogenous butyrate concentration of only 1 mm. However, a significant effect of the mutation on growth was not apparent at this concentration and was only observed upon increasing the concentration to 3.5 mm. Chlorophyll levels were unaffected at the two lower butyrate concentrations and were not able to be determined in the mutants at 3.5 mm (data not shown). A reduced tolerance of seedlings to butyrate relative to acetate would reflect a lesser ability to detoxify it. Identification and Characterization of tDNA Insertion Sites for acn1-2 and acn1-3—-Thermal Asymmetric InterLaced PCR (22Liu Y.G. Mitsukawa N. Oosumi T. Whittier R.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar) was performed on acn1-2 and acn1-3 to generate cDNA fragments containing the junction of the tDNA left border and genomic sequence. This technique utilized a series of three PCRs involving a set of nested tDNA-specific and degenerate primers in order to amplify a cDNA product that spanned the tDNA/genomic junction. The product from the third amplification was cloned and sequenced to obtain the genomic sequence flanking the tDNA. BLAST (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) analysis of the flanking genomic sequences revealed that tDNAs for both lines resided in a putative AMP-binding protein located on the top arm of chromosome III (At3g16910). This is the same gene termed AAE7 (acyl-activating enzyme) by Shockey et al. (19Shockey J. Fulda M.S. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutants acn1-2 and acn1-3 resulted from insertions in exons 3 and 2, respectively (Fig. 4A). The acn1-2 locus had a tandem tDNA insertion. Both inserts were lying in the same orientation with the left border facing the start of transcription. The upstream tDNA was intact, whereas the left border of the downstream tDNA had been truncated by ∼1 kbp. The acn1-3 locus had a triple repeat with a left border at each tDNA/genomic junction. Southern hybridization data and segregation analysis of glufosinate resistance for each of the mutants, backcrossed to Col-7, showed that there was only one insertion site within each genome (data not shown). The orientation of the tDNAs within acn1-3, such that left borders are at both genomic junctions, demonstrated that resistance was not likely due to expression of a genomic sequence driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S enhancers, which lie at the right borders of intact tDNAs. Expression analysis of ACN1 was done in order to verify the lack of transcript in the mutants and to determine the relative transcript levels in developing seedlings of wild type plants. RT-PCR (Fig. 4B) showed that it was expressed in seedlings and leaves of wild type, confirming previous reports (19Shockey J. Fulda M.S. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), but ACN1 transcript was not present within either tissue of the mutant. A quantitative RT-PCR approach was employed to monitor relative transcript levels throughout early seedling development (Fig. 4C). Levels of ACN1 transcript were compared with the 18 S RNA (25Penfield S. Rylott E.L. Gilday A.D. Graham S. Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2705-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33Kim B-R. Nam H.-Y. Kim S.-U. Kim S.-I. Chang Y.-J. Biotechnol. Lett. 2003; 25: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Compared with 18 S RNA, the commonly used RT-PCR control actin-2 had an expression profile that mirrored that of ACN1 (data not shown). The observation that ACN1 was expressed in imbibed seeds was consistent with the observed ability of FAc to delay seed germination. The expression increased up to day 8 and stayed relatively high in mature organs as shown by the expression levels in leaves and roots from 2-week-old plants. Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity and Substrate Specificity of ACN1—The disrupted gene encodes a predicted protein of 571 amino acids with a molecular mass of 57 kDa. From amino acids 49–486, the predicted protein showed high similarity to the family of AMP-dependent synthetases and ligases (PFAM, PF00501) with the characteristic S/T/G-rich domain at region 204–216 and the conserved PKG tripeptide at position 214–216 (34Smith D.J. Earl A.J. Turner G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The S/T/G-rich domain is required for the adenylate activation of carboxylic acids (35Fulda M. Heinz E. Wolter F.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Karan D. David J.R. Capy P. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ACN1 had the PTS I-type terminal peptide SRL indicating that it is targeted to peroxisomes. By using an E. coli-based membrane preparation, Shockey et al. (19Shockey J. Fulda M.S. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) had shown that the enzyme possessed a relatively low level of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase activity with acetate. A bioinformatic analysis of the primary sequence of ACN1 suggested that it was likely to be a soluble enzyme and thus would be amenable to overexpression in E. coli and native purification on Ni-NTA resin. This was confirmed by PCR cloning of the ACN1 and overexpressing it in E. coli as a His tag conjugate. Protein determination assays and SDS-PAGE showed that overexpr"

Recent reports show that triple helicase activity is initiated by the hemopexin C domain of membrane type 1-MMP, whereas catalytically inactive full-length interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) exhibits full triple helicase functionality pointing to active site determinants that are needed to complete the triple helicase mechanism. In MMP-8, the neutrophil collagenase, a conserved Gly at the S3′ substrate specificity subsite is replaced by Asn188 that forms a highly unusual cis bond with Tyr189, a conserved active site residue in the collagenases. Only in MMP-1 is the S3′ Gly also replaced, and there too a cis configured Glu-Tyr occurs. Thus, this high energy peptide bond coupled to the canonical Tyr may be important in the collagenolytic process. In a systematic mutagenesis investigation of the MMP-8 S3′ subsite we found that introducing an S3′ Gly188 into MMP-8 reduced collagenolytic efficiency by ∼30% with a corresponding reduction in cleavage of a synthetic peptide fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate analogue of the α2(I) collagen chain cleavage site. The substitution of Asn188 to Leu, a hydrophobic residue of similar size to the highly polar Asn and designed to retain the cis bond, revealed the importance of hydrogen bonding to bound substrate with both collagenolytic and peptidic activities reduced ∼3-fold. In contrast, the specificity for type I collagen of the mutant Y189F dropped 3-fold without any significant alteration in general peptidase activity. Therefore, S3′ and in particular the hydrogen bonding potential of Tyr189 is a specific molecular determinant for MMP-8 triple helicase activity. The cis bond connection to Asn188 juxtaposes these two side chains for closely spaced hydrogen bonding with substrate that improves collagenolytic and general catalytic efficiency that could be exploited for new collagenase-specific inhibitor drugs.

During wound healing neutrophils debride the focus of inflammation of bacterial and foreign matter, damaged collagen, and other tissue components (4Sylvia C.J. J. Wound Care. 2003; 12: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a process in which the activity of MMP-8 and other neutrophil proteases are well suited. In the Mmp8 knock-out mouse, a surprisingly exaggerated neutrophil accumulation and delayed clearance of inflammatory cells after application of carcinogens leads to enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis (5Balbin M. Fueyo A. Tester A.M. Pendas A.M. Pitiot A.S. Astudillo A. Overall C.M. Shapiro S.D. López-Otín C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This neutrophil phenotype may result from incomplete collagen debridement with a retention of associated chemotactic signals. Clearly, the biological role of MMP-8 collagenolysis and neutrophil function in innate host defense is incompletely understood, which is a knowledge deficiency that impedes target validation in developing new antiproteolytic drugs for inflammatory diseases and cancer (6Overall C.M.

Collagen is a triple helical macromolecule that is one of the most complex of the extracellular matrix to synthesize, fold, and assemble into fibrils (8Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A.

Therefore, before cleavage of the individual α-chains can occur the triple helical structure must be opened in a process termed triple helicase activity. This is difficult, as reflected by kinetic analyses (11Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Stricklin G.P. Roswit W.T. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol.

Unlike peptides, binding and cleavage of native collagen by collagenase involves additional contacts with exosites on regions of the enzyme outside of the active site, which lowers Km thus improving kcat/Km (24Bode W.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), have since been demonstrated to be critical for collagenolysis. Indeed, very recent studies have shown that the hemopexin C domain of MT1-MMP alone (23Tam E.M. Moore T.R. Butler G.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43336-43344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or of an inactive MMP-1 E200A mutant (32Chung L. Dinakarpandian D. Yoshida N. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. Visse R. Nagase H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) can initiate triple helicase activity by inducing localized conformational changes in native collagen that are separable from collagen cleavage. In MMP-2, however, a different mechanism of triple helicase occurs as reflected by a different role for the hemopexin C domain that does not bind collagen (23Tam E.M. Moore T.R. Butler G.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43336-43344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Overall C.M. Mol.

Here the fibronectin type II modules of the MMP-2 collagen binding domain (34Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that are inserted adjacent and aminoterminal to the S3′ subsite are crucial and form the major exosite for collagen binding and triple helicase activity (23Tam E.M. Moore T.R. Butler G.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43336-43344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, full triple helicase activity requires more than just interaction with exosite domains. Attempts to impart collagenolytic activity on non-collagenolytic MMPs by domain swaps using the MMP-1 hemopexin C domain have been unsuccessful (35Hirose T. Patterson C. Pourmotabbed T. Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Sanchez-Lopez R. Alexander C.M. Behrendtsen O. Breathnach R. Werb Z. J. Biol.

Although this may be because of domain clashes or misorientation (26Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) these chimera results point to the presence of other molecular determinants of collagenolytic activity. The importance of the linker or hinge region of the collagenases (35Hirose T. Patterson C. Pourmotabbed T. Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39005-39014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Tam E.M. Moore T.R. Butler G.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43336-43344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) confirmed the necessity in collagenolysis for multiple enzyme substrate contacts (26Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the chimera approach only successfully recaptured significant collagenase activity when the entire hemopexin C domain, linker, and catalytic subdomain up to and just beyond the S3′ region of the active site of MMP-3 (stromelysin) were replaced with that of collagenase MMP-1 (41Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the resulting collagenolytic activity is not altogether surprising because the collagen contacting interface is MMP-1-like layered on the MMP-3 hydrophobic core, it pointed to the potential importance of the S3′ subsite. This too was also indicated in very recent work where the E200A MMP-1 mutant was greater than 4-fold more effective than the MMP-1 hemopexin C domain alone in inducing triple helicase activity and collagenolysis in trans by non-collagenolytic proteases (32Chung L. Dinakarpandian D. Yoshida N. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. Visse R. Nagase H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, MMP-7 and trypsin in trans could not exploit the structural perturbations induced in collagen following binding by the recombinant MT1-MMP linker hemopexin C domain (23Tam E.M. Moore T.R. Butler G.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43336-43344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Together, this shows that triple helicase activity is not completely recapitulated by the linker hemopexin C domain alone and revealed that important contributions are required from the active site to complete the triple helicase process. Indeed, triple helicase activity was abrogated by sterically blocking the E200A MMP-1 active site with a hydroxymate inhibitor (32Chung L. Dinakarpandian D. Yoshida N. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. Visse R. Nagase H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, few site-directed mutagenesis studies have been performed of the catalytic domain of collagenases or, indeed, of any MMP (42Gomis-Ruth F.X. Mol Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). MMP scissile bond specificity is dominated by S1′ interactions. Unlike most MMPs, which have deep and variably contoured S1′ pockets (42Gomis-Ruth F.X. Mol Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), in MMP-1 it is relatively shallow (43Lovejoy B. Welch A.R. Carr S. Luong C. Broka C. Hendricks R.T. Campbell J.A. Walker K.A. Martin R. Van Wart H. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This accommodates the P1′ Ile and Leu of the α1(I) and α2(I) chain scissile 775-776 bonds in type I collagen (43Lovejoy B. Welch A.R. Carr S. Luong C. Broka C. Hendricks R.T. Campbell J.A. Walker K.A. Martin R. Van Wart H. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 44Bode W. Fernandez-Catalan C. Tschesche H. Grams F. Nagase H. Maskos K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) but by excluding more bulky residues spares many other substrates. There is a considerable difference between the S1′ binding pocket of MMP-1, which is significantly occluded by an Arg residue, and that of MMP-8, which is large. Hence, one key difference seen in P1′ preference between MMP-1 and -8 is that although MMP-8 activity is enhanced nearly 4-fold by the presence of aromatic residues, MMP-1 is intolerant for such P1′ residues (45Netzel-Arnett S. Fields G.B. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Fields G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6747-6755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So, the S1′ pocket does not appear critical for triple helicase activity per se but rather for peptide bond specificity within collagen and between collagen types (46Stams T. Spurlino J.C. Smith D.L. Wahl R.C. Ho T.F. Qoronfleh M.W. Banks T.M. Rubin B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is concluded that other sites in the catalytic domain are important for triple helicase activity. New active site structural features in MMP-8 were revealed in the crystal structure of MMP-8 in complex with the inhibitor RO200-1770 (47Brandstetter H. Grams F. Glitz D. Lang A. Huber R. Bode W. Krell H.W. Engh R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17405-17412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A previously unreported, very rare cis peptide bond between Asn188 and Tyr189 (see Fig. 1) was found, which otherwise only occurs at the homologous bond in MMP-1 (48Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). The location of this cis bond is at the amino terminus of the active site α-helix B on a loop of the S3′ substrate-specificity subsite. Here, the importance of the conserved S3′ Tyr in MMP-1 had been shown by mutagenesis to Thr, which reduced collagenolytic activity 5-fold (41Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the cloning and expression of rat MMP-8 (GenBank™ AJ007288), we had previously determined that a cloning mutation to Lys of the rat homologue of human Asn188 reduced catalytic efficiency (49Overall C.M. Lowne D. Wells G. Burel S. McCulloch C.A.G. Clements J.M. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 458Google Scholar). This too pointed to the critical importance of the S3′ subsite for the triple helicase activity of the collagenases. Following this initial observation we undertook a site-directed mutagenesis approach to systematically explore the molecular determinants of collagenase substrate specificity in S3′ of human MMP-8. Our results showed that hydrogen bonding to the substrate by the side chains of Asn188 and Tyr189, which the cis bond closely positions together, is crucial for efficient catalytic and collagenolytic activities. Hence, our work identified S3′ subsite interactions with collagen as being a critical component of triple helicase activity that is initiated by the linker hemopexin C domain and completed by active site interactions. Sequence and Three-dimensional Modeling Analyses—The S3′ substrate specificity subsite of human MMP-8 was examined by three-dimensional modeling of structural data coordinates (PDB IDs 1JAN, 1JAP, 1MNC, 1KBC, 1A85, and 1A86) using Swiss-PdbViewer v3.7 (GlaxoSmithKline). Residues of interest for mutagenesis were selected from the structure models and analysis of collagenolytic MMP protein sequences (see Fig. 2). Target nucleotide bases for mutagenesis were identified by sequence analysis of human neutrophil collagenase cDNA (GenBank™ J05556). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Six site-directed mutations of the S3′ subsite of MMP-8 (N188G, N188K, N188L, Y189A, Y189F, and N190L) and of the catalytic general base glutamate, E198A, were designed and modeled. Complementary oligonucleotides (Table I) were used to introduce point mutations in a double-stranded template of full-length human MMP-8 in the pGW1HG expression plasmid under regulation of a human cytomegalovirus promoter (50Morrison C.J.

Stable MMP-8-expressing clones were identified by Western blotting with T93-5660 or T25-88 anti-MMP-8 antibody (generously provided by Dr. H.

Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—MMP-8-expressing clones were expanded to confluence in roller bottles and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and incubated in 100 ml of serum-free CHO-S-SFM™ II medium (Invitrogen). Conditioned medium was collected every 1-2 days for up to 8 days. To remove gelatinases the medium was chromatographed over gelatin-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) (Vt 10 ml) connected in tandem with a Red-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Biosciences) (Vt 25 ml). The MMP-8 protein peak was eluted from Red-Sepharose with 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and then loaded on a column of Zn2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) (Vt 10 ml). The unbound fraction containing MMP-8 was chromatographed over lentil lectin-agarose-Sepharose 4B (Sigma-Aldrich) (Vt 2 ml) and eluted with 100 mm α-d-methylmannopyranoside (Sigma), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Purified enzyme was exchanged into collagenase assay buffer (200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) through a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Murine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified (52Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M.

Synthetic Peptide Cleavage Assays—MMP-8 mutant and wild type proteins (0.35 pmol/ml) were activated with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate for 2 h, 37 °C. The concentrations of activated enzymes were determined by active site titration against the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (53Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W.

Rates of wild type and mutant protease cleavage of FRET peptide QF24 (1 μm) were measured at 37 °C by continuous assay in fluorescence assay buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) in 96-well fluorimetry plates. Fluorescence was measured in a FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) using a 320 nm excitation and 405 nm emission filter pair. Peptide cleavage was quantitated by calibration using serial dilutions of 10 pmol of (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-NH2 (Bachem). Vmax was calculated in the linear portion (500-1000 s) of the initial rate of substrate cleavage. Collagenase Assays—Biotin-labeled porcine type I collagen (22Tam E.M. Wu Y.I. Butler G.S. Stack M.S.

The absence of collagen degradation in trypsin control assays (1:10 enzyme:substrate) confirmed the triple helical nature of the collagen during assay. Reaction products were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by in-gel detection using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) at 700 nm after incubation of the gels with 2 μg/ml streptavidin Alexa Fluor 680 conjugate (Molecular Probes) for 2 h. Specific activities of MMP-8 and mutants (units of collagenase activity·fmol-1 enzyme) were determined from densitometric analysis of intact collagen and the collagenase-specific 3/4-collagen αA-chain cleavage products detected by the biotin-specific probe. One unit of collagenase activity degrades 2 fmol of type I collagen to 50% completion·h-1 at 28 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis of S3′ Residues—The MMP-8 S3′ residues Asn188, Tyr189, and Asn190 targeted by site-directed mutagenesis are located at the amino end of α-helix B that forms the base of the active site cleft (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2110846716,"In the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-resistant glioma cells, treatment with TRAIL in combination with subtoxic doses of rottlerin induced rapid apoptosis. While the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 by TRAIL was partially blocked in these cells, treatment with rottlerin efficiently recovered TRAIL-induced activation of caspases. Treatment with rottlerin significantly decreased Cdc2 activity through the downregulation of cyclin A, cyclin B, and Cdc2 proteins, whereas the sensitizing effect of rottlerin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was independent of PKCδ activity. Furthermore, treatment with rottlerin downregulated the protein levels of survivin and X-chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), two major caspase inhibitors. Forced expression of Cdc2 together with cyclin B attenuated rottlerin-potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis by over-riding the rottlerin-mediated downregulation of survivin and XIAP protein levels. Taken together, inhibition of Cdc2 activity and the subsequent downregulation of survivin and XIAP by subtoxic doses of rottlerin contribute to amplification of caspase cascades, thereby overcoming resistance of glioma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Since rottlerin can sensitize Bcl-2- or Bcl-xL-overexpressing glioma cells but not human astrocytes to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, this combined treatment may offer an attractive strategy for safely treating resistant gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2002803108,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix is one of the most frequent cancers affecting women worldwide. Carcinomas arise from cervical intraepithelial lesions, in which infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types has led to deregulated growth control through the actions of the viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins. The molecular mechanisms underlying progression to invasive tumor growth are poorly understood. One important feature, however, is the escape from growth inhibition by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Loss of chromosomal arm 18q is among the most frequent cytogenetic alterations in cervical cancers and has been associated with poor prognosis. Since the TGF-β response is mediated by Smad proteins and the tumor suppressor gene Smad4 resides at 18q21, we have analysed the Smad4 gene for cervical cancer-associated alterations in cell lines and primary carcinomas. Here, we report Smad4 deficiency in four out of 13 cervical cancer cell lines which is due to an intronic rearrangement or deletions of 3′ exons. All cell lines, however, showed either absent or moderate responsiveness to TGF-β irrespective of their Smad4 status. In 41 primary squamous cervical carcinomas analysed, 10 samples showed loss of Smad4 protein expression and 26 samples a reduced expression. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that Smad4 gene alterations are involved in cervical carcinogenesis."

UBF1 must be activated to increase transcription from the rDNA promoter (1Grummt I. Progr. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 109-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7Grummt I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and the general consensus is that activation of UBF1, resulting in increased transcription from the rDNA promoter, is largely regulated by phosphorylation, especially of its C terminus (8Voit R.

UBF1 phosphorylation and activity increase in proliferating cells, where rRNA synthesis is known to be increased markedly over quiescent, resting cells (3, 10, and 12). Variations in UBF levels in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts in culture have also been reported (13Hannan R.D. Luyken J. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol.

The binding of IRS-1 to UBF1 suggested a molecular explanation for the role of IRS-1 in regulating cell and body size (23Bohni R. Riesco-Escovar J. Oldham S. Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Andruss B.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 109-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, binding to UBF1 does not necessarily lead to increased RNA polymerase I activity. There are at least three proteins that bind UBF1 and actually inhibit transcription from the rDNA promoter. These proteins are the retinoblastoma proteins (25Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J.

Oncogene. 1998; 19: 1119-1124Google Scholar), and the interferon-inducible p204 nucleolar protein (29Liu C. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Growth-regulated phosphorylation of UBF has already been demonstrated (8Voit R. Schnapp A. Kuhn A. Rosenbauer H. Hirschmann P. Stunnenberg H.G. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), but the stimulatory factor in most cases was serum (10Voit R. Hoffmann M. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and little is known of the mechanisms by which IGF-IR signaling may regulate UBF1 activity and rDNA transcription. IRS-1 has no known kinase activity, but we have reported recently that nuclear IRS-1 binds to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, which directly phosphorylates UBF1 through its catalytic subunit (30Drakas R. Tu X. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9272-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PI3K is strongly stimulated by IRS-1 (16Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3816-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The purpose of this investigation was to study whether IGF-IR signaling can activate UBF1 and the rDNA promoter, and how it accomplishes an eventual activation. We used two different cell lines for the reasons given below: a myeloid cell line (32D cells) and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We found that IGF-I up-regulates UBF1 and rDNA promoter activity and that the regulation is complex. In both myeloid cells and MEFs, IGF-I stimulation induces UBF1 phosphorylation. In MEFs, the C terminus and other peptides have been identified as phosphorylated by IGF-I. In myeloid cells (but not in MEFs), an activated IGF-IR and IRS-1 stabilize UBF1 protein levels. The importance of these studies resides in the fact that IGF-IR/IRS-1 signaling controls cell and body size (about 50%) in animals and cells in culture (23Bohni R. Riesco-Escovar J. Oldham S.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 371-412Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIRS-1 Mutants and Miniribosome Genes—PHPTB IRS-1 comprises only the PH and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains of IRS-1, approximately the first 300 amino acids (18Prisco M. Santini F. Baffa R. Liu M. Drakas R. Wu A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32078-32085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The miniribosome gene (see below) has been described by Voit and Grummt (9Voit R. Grummt I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13631-13636Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A second reporter gene, in which the rDNA promoter drives the SV40 T antigen, has been described by Surmacz et al. (37Surmacz E. Kaczmarek L. Ronning O. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Cell Lines—The original R- cells are 3T3-like fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR genes (38Liu J-P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). R-/T cells are R- cells expressing the SV40 T antigen, whereas R+ cells are R- cells expressing abundant copies of the human IGF-IR. These three cell lines were described in the original paper by Sell et al. (39Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). For experiments, MEFs are generally made quiescent in serum-free medium (SFM) and subsequently stimulated with IGF-I (50 ng/ml, unless otherwise indicated). In other experiments, we used 32D-derived cells. 32D cells are murine myeloid cells that require Interleukin-3 (IL-3) for growth and undergo apoptosis when IL-3 is removed. The 32D-derived cells we used are described under “Results.”Determination of Miniribosome Gene Activity—The activation of the rDNA promoter by IGF-I was carried out by the transient transfection of the miniribosome gene described by Voit et al. (40Voit R. Kuhn A. Sander E.E. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has almost 2000 bases before the starting site of rRNA synthesis (mouse sequence), a brief stretch of transcribed rDNA, and termination sequences. Just before the termination sequence, a unique in-frame viral sequence provides the specific sequence for Northern blots. The cells were transfected, and the amount of transcribed miniribosome gene was determined by Northern blots.Northern Blots—Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, after which the RNA was UV cross-linked. Two different methods were used for labeling the probes. For Figs. 1 and 5, we used the digoxigenin-labeled method. A probe spanning a 523-bp fragment in the miniribosome gene was obtained by a PCR, generated with a random priming kit (Roche Applied Science). We then used a Dig high prime DNA labeling and detection starter KitII for Northern blots; prehybridization was first carried out for 0.5 h at 42 °C followed by hybridization with 25 ng/ml digoxigenin-labeled probe carried out overnight at 50 °C (Roche Applied Science). The membrane was then washed under stringent conditions: 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes of 15 min each in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. After incubation with 1% blocking solution, the filter was incubated with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments). Detection of chemiluminescence was carried out by standard methods. For the conventional Northern blots, the UBF probe was made by standard methods with a full-length UBF1 cDNA, labeled with [32P]dCTP. Hybridization with 200 ng/ml of the 32P-labeled probe was carried out following a protocol essentially similar to that described for the digoxigenin-labeled probes. The hybridized membrane (32P- or digoxigenin-labeled) was autoradiographed at room temperature for the digoxigenin-labeled probes and at -80 °C for 24 h for the 32P-labeled probe.Fig. 1Activity of the miniribosome gene in R--derived cells. A, activity of the miniribosome gene in R- and R+ cells, stimulated with IGF-I (+) or unstimulated (-). In both cell lines, activity was determined in SFM and 24 h after stimulation with IGF-I. β-Actin RNA levels were used to monitor the RNA amounts. The figure beneath gives the level of expression as determined by densitometry (arbitrary units). The methodology is described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, time course of activation of the miniribosome gene in R+ cells. R+ cells growing in normal growth medium (10% serum) were made quiescent in SFM. The miniribosome gene (40Voit R. Kuhn A. Sander E.E. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected into R+ cells and its activity determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” at various times after IGF-I stimulation. 0h are cells left in SFM, and the other lanes are hours after stimulation with IGF-I. The results were quantitated by densitometry of the bands. The bars (under the blots) show the mean ± S.D. of three separate observations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of UBF1—R+, R-/T, and R- cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in growth medium and eventually transferred to SFM for 48 h. The cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml IGF-I for the appropriate times. The cells were then labeled for 4 h with 32Pi at a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml (ICN Biochemicals, Inc., Cleveland, OH) in phosphate-free medium (Invitrogen). After labeling, the cells were collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and the protease mixture from Roche) to obtain whole cell lysates, which were then immunoprecipitated with an antibody to UBF, followed by Western blots. After running the SDS-PAGE and transfer to membranes, the membranes were autoradiographed for 24 h at -80 °C. 32D PHPTB IGF-IR and 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml IGF-I (Invitrogen) for the indicated times. The 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells were shifted to phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) for 1 h. The cells were then labeled for 4 h with 32Pi at a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml (ICN Biochemicals) in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium. After labeling, the cells were collected by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The rest of the procedure was the same as for MEFs (see above).Labeling with [35S]Methionine—32D-derived cell cultures were starved for 24 h on methionine-free growth medium. Cells were labeled with the same medium supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 h. After washing, the cells were replated for 0, 6, 16, and 24 h in complete medium. After lysis at the times indicated, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-UBF antibody, and the precipitate was blotted. After autoradiography, the UBF bands were cut out from the membrane and counted in a liquid scintillation counter.Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping Analysis—The technique was essentially the same as described by Voit et al. (10Voit R. Hoffmann M. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, R+,R-/T, and R- cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in growth medium and eventually transferred to SFM for 48 h. The cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml IGF-I for the appropriate times. The cells were then labeled for 4 h with 32Pi at a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml (ICN Biochemicals, Inc.) in phosphate-free medium (Invitrogen). After labeling, the cells were collected by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for whole cell lysates. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by autoradiography. Labeled UBF was cut out and processed for tryptic phosphopeptide mapping analysis. Briefly, labeled UBF cut out from nitrocellulose was eluted into solution with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, labeled UBF protein was oxidized and then digested with trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Digested peptides were resolved by electrophoresis for 40 min at 1,000 V on thin layer cellulose plates (EM Science) in pH 1.9 buffer in the first dimension followed by ascending chromatography in isobutyric acid buffer in the second dimension.Phosphopeptide Fingerprinting—Stained protein bands were excised from the polyacrylamide gel and stored at -20 °C until further analysis. Proteins were digested with 20 ng/μl Lys-C (Roche Applied Science) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 16 h at 37 °C. Peptide mass fingerprinting were done using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization and on a Ciphergen PBS II Instrument (Fremont, CA). Proteins were identified by comparing observed peptide mass fingerprints with those theoretically derived from the NCBI data base using the Profound data base searching algorithm (Rockefeller University). The procedure is essentially similar to those of Guo et al. (41Guo L. Kozlosky C.J. Ericssonm L.H. Daniel T.O. Cerretti D.P. Johnson R.S. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 1022-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Knight et al. (42Knight Z.A. Schilling B. Row R.H. Kenski D.M. Gibson B.W. Shokat K.M. Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) to identify ligand-induced phosphopeptides of the EGF receptor.Western Blots—For whole cell lysates, before stimulation with IGF-I, cells were serum starved for 48 h. The quiescent cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml IGF-I for 8 h. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS, detached with trypsin, and pelleted at 1500 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 10 min, and after vortex centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, supernatant was collected for Western blotting. Aliquots of lysates (50 μg/sample) were resolved by 4-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. They were then probed with the antibodies and developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Antibodies—For Western blots we used the following antibodies: anti-IRS-1(Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-IRS-1 (N-ter, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-IRS-1 (C-ter, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-UBF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Secondary antibodies were peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG (Oncogene Science Inc., Manhasset, NY) and peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG (Oncogene). The Western blotting detection reagent was ECLTM (Amersham Biosciences). The expression of T antigen with the reporter gene was monitored with a monoclonal antibody to SV40 T antigen (37Surmacz E. Kaczmarek L. Ronning O. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe purpose of these experiments was to study the mechanisms by which IRS-1 regulates UBF1 activity. Because the IGF-IR itself is also involved in the control of cell and body size (see “Discussion”), it was necessary to determine the respective contributions of the receptor and IRS-1 in regulating UBF1 activity and the rDNA promoter. For this reason, we had to use two different cell culture systems. 32D-derived cells have the advantage that the parental cells do not express IRS-1 or IRS-2 (43Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 44Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B.

D'Ambrosio C. Li S. Surmacz E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D.

When expressing the human IGF-IR (32D IGF-IR cells), they survive and grow for 48 h when shifted from IL-3 to IGF-I, then they stop growing and undergo granulocytic differentiation (44Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of IRS-1 in 32D IGF-IR cells (32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells) inhibits differentiation, and the cells grow indefinitely in the absence of IL-3 (35Valentinis B. Navarro M. Zanocco-Marani T.

Unfortunately, 32D cells are fastidious cells that grow in suspension, have very little cytoplasm, and present a number of problems when one wishes to purify nuclei or to collect large amounts of proteins. MEFs, like R--derived cells, are more suitable for these purposes. R- cells are 3T3-like MEFs (39Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For this purpose, we used two different reporter systems. The first reporter was the miniribosome gene constructed by Grummt and co-workers (10Voit R. Hoffmann M. Grummt I.

https://openalex.org/W2007353065,"Mutations in the tumor suppressor protein PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) enhance cell migration, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely uncharacterized. Loss of PTEN in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) correlates with striking cortical actin accumulation. However, how loss of PTEN leads to cortical actin formation and whether the presence of cortical actin contributes to the increased cell migration are unclear. Here we show that overexpression of dominant-negative forms of (DN) PTEN, RhoA or its kinase-dead (KD) effector, PKN, inhibited cortical actin formation, indicating that cortical actin of Pten−/− MEFs is mediated by the PTEN/Rho/PKN pathway. However, neither DN RhoA nor KD PKN inhibited the enhanced migration of Pten−/− cells, in contrast to the inhibitory effect of DN Rac. In agreement with the previous observation that DN Akt inhibits migration of Pten−/− cells, we demonstrate here that overexpression of KD PDK-1, the Akt kinase, reduces Pten−/− cell migration. Furthermore, overexpression of DN forms of Akt, Rac, or PDK-1, all of which inhibit migration of Pten−/− cells, had no effect on cortical actin accumulation. Our findings suggest that PDK-1/Akt signaling pathway plays a major role in regulating cell migration induced by PTEN deficiency."

Understanding these processes is difficult due to the large number of polymerases and the kinetic complexity of the replication process. Cellular systems are useful in assessing biological significance but not necessarily for understanding mechanistic details of interactions of polymerases with DNA because of the plethora of polymerases and repair systems (7Burgers P.M.J.

Because the polymerization catalytic cycle (Scheme 1) is complex and different polymerases are often used, those results have often been difficult to interpret. In many studies, the focus is on “full-length” extension, which involves multiple reactions and is not particularly amenable to defined kinetic analysis of a single reaction (5Goodman M.F.

(i) How do these adducts affect the full-length extension and 1-base insertion reactions by polymerases? (ii) What are the effects of these adducts on the steady-state kinetics of dNTP incorporation, and how do the adducts differ compared with each other? (iii) Do burst kinetics occur? (iv) How will the adducts affect the kinetic parameters koff and Kd for the DNA·polymerase(·dNTP) complex? (v) Are kinetic elemental effects significant, and can rate-limiting steps be discerned based on these? These questions have been addressed in a series of experiments with a total of six modified oligonucleotides (Scheme 2). Chemicals—Chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from the following sources: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, lysozyme, poly(ethyleneimine), yeast extract (Sigma); isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Anatrace, Maumee, OH); casein hydrolysate (ICN, Aurora, OH); dCTPαS and dATPαS (Amersham Biosciences); dTTPαS (IBA, Göttingen, Germany); [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX) or Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA), except the adducted 11- and 13-mer oligonucleotides, which were synthesized in the Vanderbilt facility using general phosphoramidite technology (28Carmical J.R.

FAM-tagged and 3′-(3-hydroxy)propyl-substituted (propyl at the 3′-position of deoxyribose to prevent elongation) oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland. Polymerases—RT was expressed and purified in this laboratory as previously described (10Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), using stock plasmids provided by S. Hughes (Frederick Cancer Facility, Frederick, MD). Protein concentrations were estimated using an ϵ280 value of 522 mm–1 cm–1 (12Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4818-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Polymerase T7– was expressed and purified using a new procedure based on earlier work by the laboratory of K. A. Johnson (41Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding T7– DNA polymerase, pG5X (Amp) (obtained from K. A. Johnson, University of Texas, Austin, TX), was transformed into BL21-Gold (DE3)/pLysS cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cells were plated on ampicillin/LB media and incubated at 37 °C for 14 h. A single colony was picked and used to inoculate 120 ml of NZCYM media (42Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A1Google Scholar), including ampicillin (50 μg ml–1) and chloramphenicol (12.5 μg ml–1). The culture was shaken at 250 rpm (37 °C) for 14 h (G76 gyrotory water bath shaker; New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ). An aliquot (10 ml) of the culture was added to each 1 liter of NZY media (12 liters total), which contained ampicillin (50 μg ml–1) but no chloramphenicol. The cultures were grown at 37 °C (240 rpm) until the A600 reached 0.3–0.4 (Innova 4330 shaker; New Brunswick). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration 0.4 mm) and chloramphenicol (final concentration 12.5 μg ml–1) were added, and the culture was shaken (240 rpm) at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 20 min (Sorvall RC3Bplus centrifuge; Kendro, Newtown, CT), and the pellets were stored at –20 °C overnight. Cells were lysed with buffer (240 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 10% sucrose (w/v)), followed by the addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.5 ml of a 0.5 m stock in acetone, to yield 1 mm final concentration) and lysozyme (20 mg). The cell pellets were sonicated at a 59% power setting for 30 s (Branson Digital Sonifer, Danbury, CT). Sodium cholate was added to the sonicated solution to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), and the solution was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. Poly(ethyleneimine) was slowly added to the above lysed cells to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) with stirring at 4 °C. The solution was stirred for another 15 min, followed by the addition of NaCl (5 m stock) to a final concentration of 0.5 m and stirred for an additional 30 min. The mixture was separated by centrifugation at 1.6 × 104 × g for 20 min. The crude enzyme preparation (supernatant) was purified further using (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) and phosphocellulose chromatography according to a previous procedure (41Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using ϵ280 = 144 mm–1 cm–1 for T7–. The overall yield of purified T7– protein was about 1 mg liter–1. Escherichia coli thioredoxin was expressed and purified as described previously (10Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ligation of Carcinogen-adducted Oligonucleotides (Schemes3and4)—Carcinogen-bound 11- and 13-mer oligonucleotides had been synthesized previously using phosphoramidite chemistry (43Harris C.M. Zhou L.

Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 3555-3558Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, short oligonucleotides are poor substrates for polymerases, particularly the processive polymerases T7– and RT (10Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 41Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Patel P.H.

Therefore, extending the adducted DNA to lengths of 35–40 nucleotides was necessary for performing the polymerization reactions. Ligation reactions were performed using the following strategy (Scheme 4). Three oligonucleotides (designated as left, middle, and right fragments) were ligated, with the middle one containing carcinogen (shown in boldface type in Scheme 4). This ligation procedure was carried out in “one-pot” reactions with inactivation of the enzymes at appropriate steps. Short scaffolds were not useful because of the effects of the adducts in reducing base pairing, and long scaffolds were problematic because of the difficulty in removal (we relied on HPLC purification because of the need to avoid using strong UV light to visualize oligonucleotides in preparative gel electrophoresis, which might damage the adducts). The left and middle oligonucleotides were first treated with a kinase to add phosphate at the 5′-end, and the kinase was subsequently inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 20 min. Oligonucleotide mixtures (18-mer (20 nmol) and 11-mer, containing the adduct (20 nmol)) were incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (40 units; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and ATP (3.3 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 60 μl. The reaction mixture was then heated at 95 °C for 20 min to inactivate T4 polynucleotide kinase, which was a crucial step in preventing multiple ligation. With the addition of the third oligonucleotide (the right oligonucleotide), the three oligonucleotides were annealed to a complementary strand containing uracil bases instead of T. The uracil-containing scaffold (33-mer, 20 nmol) and 5′-end 11-mer oligonucleotides (20 nmol) were added to the above reaction (final volume 86 μl). Annealing was carried out by heating the reaction at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling over 3 h to room temperature. The reaction was kept at 4 °C for more than 2 h before the next step. The fragments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (1600 units; New England Biolabs) at 16 °C for 48 h. Additional ligase (800 units) and ATP (2.5 mm) were added after 24 h of incubation. The reaction was heated at 65 °C fo"
https://openalex.org/W2025152386,"PKCα and Ets1 are both associated with breast cancer progression. Our previous studies suggested that these proteins are likely to functionally interact with one another. Here, we show that attenuation of endogenous PKCα expression (siPα) by RNA interference leads to reduced Ets1 protein expression in a variety of cancer cells. Pulse-chase experiments and treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 revealed that siPα interferes with both Ets1 protein synthesis and stability. The effect of siPα on Ets1 expression could be partially prevented by KN-93, suggesting that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), a modulator of Ets1 activity, may play a role in PKCα-dependent Ets1 regulation. In contrast, Ets1-regulating kinases ERK1/2 were not found to be involved in this process. To assess the importance of the PKCα/Ets1 interaction, we compared the biological responses of MDA-MB-231 cells to PKCα- and Ets1-specific siRNAs (siE1). While only siPα induced changes in cellular morphology and anchorage-independent growth, both siRNAs similarly affected cellular responses to the antitumor drug mithramycin A and to UV light. Microarray analyses further showed that the expression of a certain set of genes was equally affected by siPα and siE1. The data suggest that Ets1 serves as an effector for PKCα to fulfil certain functions in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2162075091,"Drug-induced modifications of transcription factors play important roles in both apoptosis and survival signaling. The data presented here show that the DNA topoisomerase II poison TAS-103 transactivated the SV40 promoter in a GC-box-dependent manner and induced Sp1 acetylation in cells expressing p300. This activity was not observed in cells lacking p300. TAS-103 treatment also enhanced the p300 content of the nucleus and the interaction of p300 with Sp1. Cellular susceptibility to TAS-103 was correlated with p300 expression but not with topoisomerase II expression. Furthermore, the presence of p300 significantly sensitized cancer cells to TAS-103 but not to cisplatin. Taken together, these findings demonstrate novel genomic responses to anticancer agents that modulate Sp1 acetylation and Sp1-dependent transcription in an apoptotic pathway.

Taken together, these findings demonstrate novel genomic responses to anticancer agents that modulate Sp1 acetylation and Sp1-dependent transcription in an apoptotic pathway. Sp1 was one of the first transcription factors to be identified in mammalian cells. It is a member of the zinc-finger family, which functions by binding the GC-box within the DNA sequences of promoters (1Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 32: 669-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 2Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Sp1 is expressed ubiquitously in various mammalian cells and is implicated in the transcription of many genes, particularly housekeeping genes and those that are involved in cell growth and development (3Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 4Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Changes in the cellular content of Sp1, the Sp1/Sp3 ratio, and its GC-box DNA binding activity influence the regulation of Sp1 transcriptional activity (5Bouwman P. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Transcriptional co-activators have an inherently low transcriptional activity. Their only active role in the transcriptional process occurs through their interaction with transcription factors (6Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). p300 is a transcriptional co-activator that can acetylate a variety of transcription factors and histones (7Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The histones are localized within transcriptionally active euchromatin, and their interaction with p300 plays a critical role in transcription regulation. A wide range of biological processes such as the cell cycle, differentiation, and tumor growth are regulated by p300 (9Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). This protein has the potential to activate p53 target genes and might thus act as a suppressor of tumor cell growth (10Klochendler-Yeivin A. Yaniv M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1551: M1-M10PubMed Google Scholar, 11Grossman S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Ionov Y. Matsui S. Cowell J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M.

II poison and anticancer agent TAS-103 induces cellular acidosis through changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (15Kluza J. Lansiaux A. Wattez N. Mahieu C. Osheroff N. Bailly C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4077-4084PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the Sp1 DNA binding activity and interaction of Sp1 with TATA-binding protein are enhanced under conditions of low pH. Therefore, cellular pH might also be crucial for the expression of Sp1 target genes (16Torigoe T. Izumi H. Yoshida Y. Ishiguchi H. Okamoto T. Itoh H. Kohno K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), including TAS-103-induced cellular acidosis. In this study, we show that the treatment of cells with TAS-103 leads to the acetylation of Sp1, resulting in a dramatic induction of Sp1-dependent promoters. We also demonstrate that p300 expression sensitizes cancer cells to TAS-103. We propose that p300-dependent acetylation of Sp1 triggered through the DNA-damage signaling pathway and cellular acidosis leads to the enhanced expression of Sp1 target genes in TAS-103-induced apoptosis. This discovery has important implications for current views of the molecular mechanisms by which anticancer agents trigger genome-wide responses. These important responses might occur through the posttranscriptional modification of transcription factors. Reagents, Cell Culture, and Antibodies—TAS-103 was kindly provided by the Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Cisplatin and etoposide were purchased from Sigma, and camptothecin was purchased from Daiichi Seiyaku (Tokyo, Japan). Human epidermoid cancer KB cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium, human breast cancer MCF7 cells and human glioblastoma T98G cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and human colon cancer cell lines (HCT15, CaCo2, LoVo, and SW620) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (all from Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.292 mg/ml l-glutamine. All of the cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2. Anti-pan-acetylation (sc-8649) and anti-topo-IIα (sc-5346) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG (anti-M2) and anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA)-peroxidase antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Preparation of Luciferase-Reporter and Expression Plasmids—Simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter luciferase-reporter plasmids were constructed using the pGL3-promoter vector containing the SV40 promoter (Promega, Madison, WI) designated SV40 Luc1, which contained six GC-boxes. SV40 Luc2 lacking GC-boxes was prepared as follows. SV40 Luc1 was digested with TasI, end-filled with T4 DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), and digested with NcoI. The resultant fragment was ligated to the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). An expression plasmid for FLAG-Sp1 was obtained using FLAG-tagged Sp1 cDNA fragments (a gift from R. Tjian, University of California, Berkeley, CA), which were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) (17Torigoe T. Izumi H. Ishiguchi H. Uramoto H. Murakami T. Ise T. Yoshida Y. Tanabe M. Nomoto M.

HA-p300 derived from cytomegalovirus was prepared as described previously (18Izumi H. Ohta R. Nagatani G. Ise T. Nakayama Y. Nomoto M. Kohno K. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 713-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transient transfections were performed as described previously (17Torigoe T. Izumi H. Ishiguchi H. Uramoto H. Murakami T. Ise T. Yoshida Y. Tanabe M. Nomoto M. Itoh H. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36534-36543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 4 × 104 cells/well. The next day, the cells were transfected with a luciferase-reporter plasmid using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) for 12 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. The β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences) was co-transfected as an internal control. The cells were then washed and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in fresh medium with or without TAS-103. Subsequently, the cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity in the lysed cells was detected using a Picagene kit (Toyoinki, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The light intensity was measured for 2 s with a luminometer (Luminescencer JNRII AB-2300, ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). The results shown represent at least three independent experiments and were normalized to β-galactosidase activity measured using an enzyme assay kit (Promega). Preparation of Cellular Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared using buffer C as described previously (17Torigoe T. Izumi H. Ishiguchi H. Uramoto H. Murakami T. Ise T. Yoshida Y. Tanabe M. Nomoto M.

Extracts of whole cells were produced by lysing cells in buffer X comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The cellular debris was removed from the extract by centrifugation, and the supernatant was stored at –70 °C. The protein concentrations of nuclear and whole-cell extracts were determined using the Bradford method. Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear and whole-cell extracts were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry blotter. Western blot analysis was performed with an appropriate dilution of each antibody followed by visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence. In Vivo Binding Assay—An in vivo binding assay (transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation assay) was performed as described previously (18Izumi H. Ohta R. Nagatani G. Ise T. Nakayama Y. Nomoto M. Kohno K. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 713-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. MCF7 cells growing in 60-mm plates were co-transfected with HA- and FLAG fusion plasmids along with Superfect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three hours after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and the medium was renewed. After 36 h, the medium was discarded and fresh medium was added with or without the anticancer agents (TAS-103 and cisplatin) as indicated. Whole-cell or nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. These were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-M2 antibody and 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Qiagen). The beads were then washed three times with buffer X. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed using 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/well. On the following day, drugs were added to the medium at increasing concentrations. After 48 h, the surviving cells were assayed with TetraColar ONE (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for 2 h at 37 °C according to the protocol provided and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The IC50 value was defined as the drug concentration needed to reduce cell growth by 50% relative to the control. TAS-103 Treatment Markedly Induced SV40 Promoter Activity in a GC-box-dependent Manner—We reported previously that the cellular level of Sp1 increased severalfold in human epidermoid cancer KB cells after exposure to 4 μm TAS-103 (17Torigoe T. Izumi H. Ishiguchi H. Uramoto H. Murakami T. Ise T. Yoshida Y. Tanabe M. Nomoto M. Itoh H. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36534-36543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the SV40 promoter, which contains six GC-boxes, was activated markedly by TAS-103 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The activity of SV40 Luc1 was maximal following 4 μm TAS-103 treatment for 12 h. To confirm that this effect was GC-box-dependent, we constructed the reporter plasmid SV40 Luc2, which lacks a GC-box. TAS-103 did not induce SV40 promoter activity from this construct (Fig. 1B). Co-activator p300 Has Critical Roles in TAS-103-induced SV40 Promoter Activity—We next examined TAS-103-induced SV40 promoter activity in various human cancer cell lines. Both KB cells and human glioblastoma T98G cells induced transactivation of the SV40 promoter ∼80- and 30-fold following TAS-103 treatment, respectively, whereas human colon cancer HCT15 cells did not (Fig. 2A). However, the Sp1 content of the nucleus induced by TAS-103 treatment was increased only severalfold in these three cell lines (data not shown). Mutations of p300 have frequently been detected in colon cancer cell lines including HCT15 cells (12Ionov Y. Matsui S. Cowell J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). p300 expression was induced by treatment with TAS-103 in KB and T98G cells but not in HCT15 cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, transient transfection of a p300 expression plasmid was able to enhance TAS-103-induced SV40 promoter activity by ∼20-fold in HCT15 cells (Fig. 2C). This finding suggests that the induction of Sp1 acetylation might be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the TAS-103-induced transactivation of Sp1-dependent promoters. Treatment of Cells with TAS-103 Led to the Acetylation of Sp1 through Interaction with p300—p300 has been shown to assist Sp1 in GC-box-dependent transcription (13Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether the acetylation of Sp1 was led by TAS-103 treatment of the cells. Human breast cancer MCF7 cells, which have greater transfection efficiency than KB cells, were transfected with FLAG-Sp1. The acetylation of immunoprecipitated FLAG-Sp1 occurred at a low level without any stimulation and was significantly induced by TAS-103 treatment but not by cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3A). Suzuki et al. (14Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) demonstrated the physical and functional interactions between the acetyltransferase region of p300 and the DNA binding domain of the transcription factor Sp1. Therefore, we examined whether this interaction was affected by TAS-103 treatment. Our results showed that TAS-103 treatment significantly enhanced the interaction of Sp1 with p300 (Fig. 3B). p300 Expression Was Correlated with Sensitivity to TAS-103 Treatment in Human Colon Cancer Cell Lines—Bearing in mind the strong link between p300 expression and Sp1 activation after treatment with TAS-103, we next examined whether p300 was involved in cellular sensitivity to TAS-103. Four human colon cancer cell lines, either with or without p300 expression, were used in a cytotoxicity assay. HCT15 and CaCo2 cells lacked p300 expression, whereas LoVo and SW620 cells showed significant p300 expression (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The levels of topo-II expression varied among these cell lines (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Cellular sensitivity to TAS-103 was dependent upon p300 expression. Cells expressing p300 showed 10–30-fold greater sensitivity to TAS-103 compared with cells lacking p300 (Fig. 4B). Cellular expression of p300 also sensitized cells to the well characterized topo-II poison, etoposide (Fig. 4C). However, cells expressing p300 showed only a 2–9-fold greater sensitivity to etoposide compared with cells lacking p300. Furthermore, among cells lacking p300, CaCo2 cells showed higher expression of topo-IIα and higher sensitivity to etoposide than did HCT15 cells. In addition, among the cells expressing p300, LoVo cells showed higher expression of topo-IIα and higher sensitivity to etoposide than did SW620 cells. These results indicate that topo-IIα expression might be involved in cellular sensitivity to etoposide when cells are categorized into two groups based on p300 status. On the other hand, the cellular sensitivity to cisplatin was not associated with p300 expression (Fig. 4D). The levels of topo-II expression have been shown to be involved in the sensitivity of cancer cells to topo II poisons (20Takano H. Kohno K. Matsuo K. Matsuda T. Kuwano M. Anticancer Drugs. 1992; 3: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); however, no such correlation was observed in the sensitivity of these human colon cancer cell lines to TAS-103 (Fig. 4, A and B). These data indicate that the acetylation of Sp1 via an interaction with p300 is involved in TAS-103-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. We have previously identified several transcription factors involved in genomic responses to anticancer agents including Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), zinc-finger factor 143 (ZNF143), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) (21Kohno K. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Ashizuka M. Kuwano M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 22Tanabe M. Izumi H. Ise T. Higuchi S. Yamori T. Yasumoto K. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8592-8595PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ishiguchi H. Izumi H. Torigoe T. Yoshida Y. Kubota H. Tsuji S. Kohno K. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Yoshida Y. Izumi H. Torigoe T. Ishiguchi H. Itoh H. Kang D. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3729-3734PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides evidence to support the novel finding that Sp1 contributes to the stress response of cancer cells following treatment with anticancer agents. We used the SV40 promoter-luciferase reporter to examine whether TAS-103 could activate Sp1-dependent transcription. This was based on the knowledge that Sp1 was originally identified as a transcription factor from HeLa cells that binds to GC-boxes within the 21-bp repeat elements of the SV40 promoter (1Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 32: 669-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 2Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). We found that TAS-103 dramatically activated SV40 promoter activity in KB cells (Fig. 1A) by inducing the acetylation of Sp1 through physical interaction with p300 (Fig. 3). Acetylation of Sp1 might be important in bringing about high-level transactivation of the Sp1-dependent promoter. These findings could explain the discrepancy observed in cells expressing p300 such as KB and T98G cells in which TAS-103 induced extensive transactivation of the SV40 promoter (Fig. 2A), whereas the Sp1 protein level was increased only severalfold by TAS-103 treatment (data not shown). To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate acetylation of Sp1 after treatment with anticancer agents in cancer cells. By contrast, other anticancer agents such as cisplatin, etoposide, and camptothecin did not transactivate the SV40 promoter (data not shown), indicating that TAS-103 might function in these processes through a unique mechanism. p300 is a transcriptional co-activator and histone acetyltransferase that functions in chromatin remodeling during transcription. Lysine residues that could be acetylated by p300 were clustered within the zinc-finger domain. The acetylated zinc-finger domain of Sp1 might therefore enhance the interaction of Sp1 with GC-boxes to bring about high-level transactivation. It is interesting to note that the nuclear content of p300 was increased in cells treated with TAS-103 (Fig. 2B), indicating that p300 is also involved in drug-induced stress signaling via the acetylation of Sp1. Drug-induced gene expression is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Recently, cellular acidification has been reported in cancer cells after treatment with TAS-103 (15Kluza J. Lansiaux A. Wattez N. Mahieu C. Osheroff N. Bailly C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4077-4084PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic pH is critical for the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents (25Laurencot C.M. Andrews P.A. Kennedy K.A. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 363-369PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular acidosis is thought to trigger apoptosis (26Gottlieb R.A. Giesing H.A. Zhu J.Y. Engler R.L. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5965-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Gottlieb R.A. Nordberg J. Skowronski E. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and to play an important role in drug resistance (28Beck W.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 29Torigoe T. Izumi H. Ise T. Murakami T. Uramoto H. Ishiguchi H. Yoshida Y. Tanabe M. Nomoto M. Kohno K. Anticancer Drugs. 2002; 13: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Izumi H. Torigoe T. Ishiguchi H. Uramoto H. Yoshida Y. Tanabe M. Ise T. Murakami T. Yoshida T. Nomoto M. Kohno K. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2003; 29: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the GC-box binding activity of Sp1 and its interaction with TATA-binding protein are enhanced under conditions of low pH (16Torigoe T. Izumi H. Yoshida Y. Ishiguchi H. Okamoto T. Itoh H. Kohno K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is possible that cellular acidosis might stabilize the modification status of Sp1 by regulating the activity of Sp1-modifying enzymes. We have also shown that TAS-103 treatment induces the p300-dependent acetylation of Sp1 (Fig. 3). Of particular interest is the observation that p300 expression significantly sensitizes cancer cells to TAS-103 (Fig. 4, A and B). Unexpectedly, we also found that p300 expression sensitized cells to etoposide, which is another topo-II poison (Fig. 4C). However, cellular sensitivity to etoposide is weaker than the sensitivity to TAS-103. It was shown previously that the antitumor activity of TAS-103 did not correlate with the expression of topo-II in freshly isolated human colon cancer cells, in contrast to etoposide (31Tsunoda T. Tanimura H. Yamaue H. Ishimoto K. Kobunai T. Yamada Y. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 3897-3902PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, cellular sensitivity to TAS-103 did not correlate with the expression of topo-IIα (Fig. 4, A and B). We also found that etoposide did not enhance SV40 promoter activity, unlike TAS-103 (data not shown). Taken together, these findings indicate that the mode of action of TAS-103 might differ from that of etoposide. Martens et al. (32Martens J.H. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Dorsman J.C. Zantema A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2598-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that p300 is a major constituent of the nuclear matrix, similar to topo-IIα (33Adachi Y. Kas E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). p300 does not interact directly with topo-IIα. Rather they co-localize with each other. One possible explanation for why p300 expression sensitized cells to etoposide is that both proteins were localized in the nuclear matrix-attachment region, which might be critical for inducing a cleavable complex with etoposide. Our demonstrated results suggest that treatment with TAS-103 might induce apoptosis by activating both p300- and Sp1-dependent gene expressions. Sp1 directly or indirectly regulates several proteins including Bax, Fas ligand, and caspase-8 that induce apoptosis (34Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15598-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35McClure R.F. Heppelmann C.J. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7756-7762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Liedtke C. Groger N. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27593-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies should examine the relationship between TAS-induced apoptosis and the expression of these genes. Our present data indicate that TAS-103 is potentially unique in its ability to activate Sp1 target genes through both Sp1 acetylation and cellular acidification (Fig. 5). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Sp1 participates directly in the drug-induced signaling pathway through posttranscriptional modification."
