https://openalex.org/W1603423304,"Kinetic constants were determined for 34 nucleoside substrates of deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74) from calf thymus. Substrate efficiency was assessed by the ratio of Vmax to Km. Inhibition constants were determined for 61 nonsubstrate nucleosides or nucleoside analogues. The enzyme was relatively specific for the pentose moiety of nucleoside substrates. beta-D-2'-Deoxyribonucleosides were more efficient substrates than the corresponding beta-D-arabinonucleosides. Unexpectedly, the L isomer of the beta-arabinonucleoside of cytosine was a more efficient substrate than was the D isomer. beta-Cytidine and beta-5-azacytidine were the only beta-D-ribonucleosides studied that had detectable substrate activity. alpha-Cytidine was an inhibitor but not a substrate. Nucleosides containing a variety of sugar moieties other than those mentioned above did not have detectable substrate activity. The enzyme was relatively nonspecific for the base moiety of nucleoside substrates. 2'-Deoxyribonucleosides of a variety of pyrimidines, purines, and other heterocycles were substrates. Cytosine was the most preferred pyrimidine moiety. 5-Substitution, except with fluorine, decreased substrate efficiency with nucleosides of cytosine or uracil. 2-Fluoradenine was the most preferred purine moiety. The effects of various purine ring substituents were interdependent. Nucleosides containing bulky, hydrophobic substituents on either the base or the pentose moiety had no substrate activity but were relatively potent competitive inhibitors. This suggested the presence of a hydrophobic region on the surface of the enzyme near the active site."

https://openalex.org/W1569872070,"A systematic approach to selection of surfactants for disrupting biological membranes, for solubilizing their components, and for removing the surfactant by dialysis is described. The two relevant surfactant parameters were the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB). Rat liver mitochondria were treated with two series of nonionic surfactants and the extent of extraction of total protein, total lipid, and six enzymes was determined. Within the homologous series of Triton surfactants, maximum protein and phospholipid extraction occurred at HLB values between 12.5 and 13.5. In addition, a single surfactant species solubilized more protein than a mixture of surfactants with the same mean HLB value. In order to examine independently the effect of CMC and HLB on protein extraction, a specialty surfactant, S10-7, was prepared and compared with its structurally similar analog, Brij 56. Above a concentration of 0.35%, both Brij 56 and S10-7 extracted about 70% of the mitochondrial protein. Hence, for optimum extraction of mitochondrial protein and lipids the HLB must be about 13, and the surfactant concentration must be above the CMC. The S10-7 dialyzed almost as rapidly as cholate and far more rapidly than Brij 58 and Triton X-100. It therefore possesses the two most desirable surfactant properties for disruption of membranes, a high CMC for rapid dialysis, and an HLB value of 13.2."
https://openalex.org/W1534158967,"The bovine glomerular basement membrane in its S-carboxymethylated form has been fractionated into a large number of polypeptide components ranging from 25,800 to 205,000 in apparent molecular weight by performing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate on fractions obtained by DEAE- and CM-cellulose chromatography. While only 20 electrophoretic bands were recognized in the unfractionated S-carboxymethylated membrane the DEAE-cellulose column fractions yielded 43 distinct polypeptide components and an additional 15 were obtained from the CM-cellulose chromatography. Analyses of the purified subunits indicated pronounced compositional diversity even in polypeptide components of the same molecular weight. Great differences in the content of the amino acids characteristic of collagen, namely, hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, and glycine were evident and these three amino acids varied in a parallel manner. In contrast a reciprocal relationship between the number of lysine and hydroxylysine residues was observed so that the sum of these two remained fairly constant. While the collagen-like polypeptide components had a relatively low content of S-carboxymethylcysteine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, and heteropolysaccharides the more polar subunits were enriched in there constituents. These results are consistent with a structural model for the membrane in which the peptide chains vary greatly in the proportion of helical segments and polar regions which they contain. It is likely that the subunit polydispersity is nor primarily a biosynthetic function, but is due to limited in vivo proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1559324308,"The kinetics of protein synthesis inhibition in a cell-free system from rabbit reticulocyte lysate was studied after addition of abrin and ricin and the isolated A chains. The toxin A chains inhibited protein synthesis at a rate proportional to the amount added. When intact toxins were added to the reticulocyte lysate, the kinetics of protein synthesis inhibition indicated that the A chains must be liberated before ribosome inactivation can take place. The splitting of the toxin in the lysate was directly demonstrated by the use of labeled toxins. The amount of abrin and ricin bound to HeLa cells under different experimental conditions was correlated to the concomitant inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. In the presence of lactose, which inhibits toxin binding, much higher concentrations of toxins were required to inhibit protein synthesis than in the absence of lactose. A linear relationship was found between the lactose concentration in the medium and the toxin concentration required to give 50% reduction in protein synthesis after 3 hours. The amount of toxin bound to the cell surfaces in the presence of lactose was either determined directly or calculated from the apparent association constant between toxins and surface receptors at the various lactose concentrations. Under different conditions involving a 300-fold variation in the concentration of toxin required to reduce protein synthesis by 50% after 3 hours, the amount of toxin bound to the cell surface was found to be the same. The toxicity thus appears to be determined by the number of toxin molecules bound to the cell surface. Purified ricin B chain was used to compete with the toxins for the receptor sites. Only after addition of high amounts of B chain was the toxicity of abrin and ricin appreciably reduced. The data do not support the view that receptors with especially high affinity are involved in the uptake of the toxins. When the time required for 50% inhibition was plotted versus the inverse value of the square root of the number of toxin molecules bound per cell, a straight line was obtained, intercepting at about 30 min. The data indicate that the observed lag time cannot be due entirely to the fact that the A chains must be liberated before they can act."
https://openalex.org/W1586695792,"The 5'-terminal methylated cap (m7G(5')ppp(5')Gm) in reovirus messenger RNA comprises part of the ribosomes binding site, since attachment of 40 S wheat germ ribosomal subunits to reovirus small (s), medium (m), and large (l) RNA classes conferred almost complete protection of the cap against RNase digestion. After joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunits, however, the cap continued to be protected against T1 RNase within the 80 S initiation complexes formed with only some messenger species; namely the three l-messages, one of the m-messages, and one or two of the s-messages. When protected fragments were recovered from 40 S and 80 S complexes and tested for ability to rebind to ribosomes those fragments which retained the cap were able to rebind most efficiently. The protected fragments recovered from 40 S initiation complexes with several of the s- and m-RNA species were larger than the messenger fragments recovered from 80 S complexes. The medium size class of reovirus RNA, which consists of three messenger species, gave rise to three discrete 5'-terminal fragments after digestion of 40 S complexes with T1 RNase, and to three somewhat smaller fragments after T1 RNase digestion of 80 S complexes. Fingerprints of the T1 oligonucleotides derived from these fragments are consistent with the interpretation that each messenger species within the m-RNA class gives rise to a protected fragment of a unique size and that, with each message, there is extensive overlap between the regions of the message protected by 40 S and 80 S ribosomes. The ratio of the three protected fragments recovered from 40 S complexes with m-RNA was highly reproducible under a given set of binding conditions, but could be shifted by varying the messenger/ribosome ratio in the binding reaction. Thus, one of the fragments, which was preferentially recovered when the ribosome concentration was limiting, could be tentatively identified as the binding site of the most efficiently translated message within the m-RNA class."

https://openalex.org/W1539792513,"To explore the role of the pool of intracellular free valine in the processes of protein synthesis and protein degradation, cultured hepatoma (HTC) cells were incubated in media containing varying concentrations of L-valine, under conditions of constant rates of protein synthesis and protein breakdown, and at steady state levels of intracellular valine specific radioactivities. Two types of experiments were compared: in the first (designated experiment), unlabeled cells were exposed to [3H]valine for a short period of time. In the second (termed experiment), cells were prelabled with [3H]valine and then incubated for a brief period with media containing different concentrations of unlabeled valine; reincorporation of [3H]valine was calculated by the difference between the release of [3H]valine from labeled cellular proteins at low valine concentrations, and the maximal rate of the release at high valine concentrations. In both types of experiments, the rates of [3H]valine incorporation or reincorporation were compared with the respective specific radioactivities of free intracellular valine. In the incorporation experiment, the rates of [3H]valine incorporation into protein calculated by the intracellular specific radioactivities were not constant, but showed an upward deviation at low valine concentrations. This is in agreement with the results of Mortimore, G.E., Woodside, K.H., and Henry, J.E. ((1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 2776-2784) in the perfused rat liver. By contrast, in the reincorporation experiment, the calculated rates of [3H]valine reincorporation based on intracellular specific radioactivities were constant throughout the range of valine concentrations. The constant value of calculated valine reincorporation was lower by 30 to 50% than the calculated rate of valine incorporation at high valine concentrations. The following model is proposed to explain these results. There is one common pool of free intracellular valine, but there are two sites where valyl-tRNA can be formed. The first is an internal site that utilizes valine from the intracellular pool, and the second is an external (possibly membranous) system that converts extracellular valine directly to valyl-tRNA. Valine originating from protein degradation flows into the intracellular pool, from which it can be reutilized by the internal system. According to these assumptions, in the incorporation experiment and at low valine concentrations, the specific activity of valyl-tRNA is higher than that of the intracellular pool of free valine, due to the contribution of the external system. On the other hand, in the reincorporation experiment the specific activity of extracellular valine is negligible in comparison with that of the intracellular pool. Therefore, in this case the specific activity of valyl-tRNA is proportional to that of the intracellular pool, with a constant dilution by unlabeled valine of extracellular origin..."

https://openalex.org/W1509003053,"Adenosine deaminase (adenosine aminohydrolase EC 3.5.4.4) has been purified 468,000-fold from pooled human erythrocytes. The procedure developed was used to isolate the enzyme from up to 23 liters of packed erythrocytes at one time. An easily prepared affinity column bed material employing adenosine as the ligand was used as the final step in the purification. During elution from the affinity column there was approximately a 3:1 partition of adenosine deaminase between gel bed and column buffer. There was no apparent difference in the partitioning of unresolved or partially resolved preparations of the electrophoretically different forms of the enzyme on the affinity column. Gel filtration and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels of increasing concentration revealed no differences in the Mr of these electrophoretically different forms. The four bands resolved by electrophoresis of the different forms on polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions yielded a single band when electrophoresis was carried out in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol. Partially resolved preparations of the different electrophoretic forms of adenosine deaminase also gave rise to a single band of the same mobility when electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels under these conditions. The band had the mobility of a protein of Mr of 36,000. This Mr is approximately the same as estimated for the nondenatured enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1668992842,"Synthesis of heme and cytochrome P-450 have been studied in adult rat hepatocytes in primary monolayer culture. Incubation of cells with delta-aminolevulinic acid increases both cellular heme and cytochrome P-450 relative to that found in cells incubated under control conditions. Formation of heme is proportional to the concentration of delta-aminolevulinic acid in the culture medium and is not saturable. By contrast, formation of cytochrome P-450 is saturable; excess intracellular heme appears as a new absorption band at 420 nm in the carbon monoxide-reduced difference spectrum. We have studied the effect of cobalt on heme and hemoprotein formation in this cell system. The metal blocks formation of cytochrome P-450 but fails to affect heme synthesis. In contrast to previous findings with isolated mitochondria, no cobalt protoporphyrin formed in hepatocytes cultured in the presence of the metal. In studies of rats in vivo, it was confirmed that cobalt acts to reduce the amount of [14C]heme in the liver after administration of delta-amino[14C]levulinic acid. However, the present findings suggest that this effect of cobalt represents accelerated breakdown of newly labeled hepatic heme rather than inhibition of synthesis. We conclude that cobalt interferes with formation of cytochrome P-450 not by direct inhibition of heme synthesis but most likely by blocking the association of heme and apocytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W2278402341,"Pre-proparathyroid hormone, discovered previously by the translation of messenger RNA from parathyroid glands in heterologous cell-free systems, is a polypeptide of 115 amino acids consisting of 25 amino acids added to the NH2 terminus of proparathyroid hormone (90 amino acids), the immediate biosynthetic precursor of parathyroid hormone (84 amino acids). We now have detected pre-proparathyroid hormone formation within intact parathyroid cells, thus providing direct evidence that it is a biosynthetic precursor of proparathyroid hormone. A radiolabeled protein synthesized by slices of bovine parathyroid glands during 1 to 10 min of incubation with [35S] methionine was identified that co-migrated on both urea-acetate and urea-SDS acrylamide gels with 3H-labeled pre-proparathyroid hormone prepared by mRNA translation in a cell-free system derived from wheat germ. The amount of radiolabeled protein reached a maximum 3 min after exposure of the tissue to[35S] methionine and decreased during a 3-min chase incubation with unlabeled methionine. It bound to antisera to both proparathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone and contained 35S-labeled tryptic peptides that migrated identically with peptides of pre-proparathyroid hormone prepared from the wheat germ system. Radiolabeled proparathyroid hormone was identified in the tissue after 1 min of incubation with [35S] methionine. These findings indicate that pre-proparathyroid hormone is an early biosynthetic precursor of proparathyroid hormone in parathyroid tissue and that this precursor is converted to proparathyroid hormone within 1 min after completion of its synthesis on the rough endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1939440116,"Rapid mixing and quenching techniques have been used with chloroplasts activated by an acid-base transition or by light to assess the nature and characteristics of the substances initially labeled by inorganic [32P]phosphate during ATP synthesis. With light-activated chloroplast fragments, but not with acid-base-activated preparations, an initial rapid labeling of a small amount of ADP is observed. With the acid-base activated preparations a slower continued labeling of ADP occurs that is uncoupler-sensitive, that does not proceed via [gamma-32]ATP of the medium and for which medium ADP furnishes the AMP moiety. The results point to ADP as the initial acceptor of phosphate for ATP synthesis, with a slow side reaction in which bound ATP phosphorylates bound AMP to give a bound ADP. The phosphorylation of bound ADP by medium [32P]phosphate in the absence of added ADP is confirmed, but the reaction is too slow to serve as an intermediate in photophosphorylation. The appearance of label from [32P]phosphate in ATP in the acid-base transition at 25 degrees shows a lag of only about 3 to 7 ms, consistent with the absence of any phosphorylated intermediate. The lag is followed by a linear rate of [gamma-32]ATP formation that is about as fast as that observed in steady photophosphorylation, consistent with a proton gradient serving for transmission of energy from electron transfer reactions to the ATP-synthesizing complex."
https://openalex.org/W1562983546,"Broken cell particulate preparations of adenylate cyclase isolated from the human glioma cell line 132-1N1 were stimulated 2-to 3-fold by 30 muM adenosine. This concentration of adenosine produced a maximal stimulation of the cyclase while 3 to 5 muM adenosine produced half-maximal stimulation. Theophylline, at 40 muM, inhibited the adenosine stimulation of the adenylate cyclase by about 40% while 200 muM produced near complete inhibition. The inhibition by theophylline could be overcome by increasing adenosine to a concentration 10-fold that of theophylline, implying that the inhibition was competitive. Basal activity was not inhibited by even 1.0 mM theophylline, nor was the epinephrine stimulated activity. In contrast, 1.0 muM propranolol essentially completely inhibited the 8-fold stimulation of 1.0 muM epinephrine but had no effect on either basal or adenosine-stimulated activity. Adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine were equipotent in stimulating adenylate cyclase from the 132-1N1 line, whereas neither adenine nor guanosine had any detectable effect. GTP, 10 muM, produced a small variable stimulation of the adenylate cyclase while the GTP analogue, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), produced a marked stimulation fo the cyclase. Preincubation of the adenylate cyclase preparation with the analogue greatly increased its potency and maximal effect. In contrast, both basal and adenosine-stimulated activity decreased markedly with preincubation. The effects of adenosine or epinephrine in combination with Gpp(NH)p were at least additive and often synergistic in comparison to the effects of the compounds alone. The effects of adenosine on intact and broken cell preparations of the human fibroblast lines WI-38 and VA13-2RA were also examined. In the intact VA13-2RA, adenosine produced rapid and large increases in intracellular and extracellular cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP). In the parental fibroblast line, the WI-38, adenosine slightly elevated basal levels of cAMP, but only produced marked elevations in the presence of non-methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The effect of adenosine on the broken cell particulate preparations of adenylate cyclase from the fibroblasts was similar to its action on the cyclase from the 132-1N1; 30 muM adenosine produced a maximal stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, and the stimulation was inhibited by theophylline."

https://openalex.org/W1645621642,"Density measurements have been made on aqueous lysozyme solutions at 20, 25, and 30 degrees. The apparent specific volumes, phi v, and expansibilities, phi e, have been determined from the density measurements and fitted to a function of concentration (weight per cent). Sound velocities and heat capacities have also been measured for various concentrations of lysozyme-water solutions at 25 degrees. From the density, expansibility, heat capacity, and sound velocity data at 25 degrees, the isothermal compressibility, phi k, for the lysozyme solutions have been calculated over a range of concentrations. All the physicochemical properties measured were found to be a linear function of the weight per cent of lysozyme. The number of water molecules hydrated to 1 mol of lysozyme was estimated from the volume and compressibility and found to be 162 at 25 degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1528492570,"A microvillus plasma membrane-enriched fraction of human placenta was obtained by a combination of differential, isopycnic, and rate-zonal centrifugation techniques. Assays for enzyme markers from mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane indicated a relative enrichment of plasma membrane between 10- and 20-fold over the most prominent contaminating enzyme markers. Electron microscopy verified the microvillus ultrastructure of the isolated placental membrane and the lack of significant contamination by identifiable organelles. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the microvillus membrane fraction revealed a protein and glycoprotein subunit composition. There were 16 major protein subunits and 10 major glycoprotein subunits, and apparent molecular weights are assigned to these subunits. 32P-labeling of the microvillus membrane-associated alkaline phosphatase indicated that this enzyme is one of the major glycoproteins of the human placental microvillus membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1597599446,"When streptokinase is incubated with human or rabbit plasminogen, one event which occurs is a specific fragmentation of streptokinase. At least five major identifiable streptokinase fragments appear with time, and they possess molecular weights of approximately 40,000 (SK 1), 36,000 (SK 2), 31,000 (SK 3), 26,000 (SK 4), and 10,000 (SK 5) under denaturing conditions, as observed on calibrated sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, compared to native streptokinase of molecular weight 45,000. The amount of each of the fragments generated at given times of incubation of plasminogen and streptokinase depends upon the species of plasminogen employed. Utilizing rabbit plasminogen and streptokinase, the SK 4 fragment was purified. This fragment arises by proteolysis at both the NH2 and COOH regions of native streptokinase. However, when isolated utilizing dilute aqueous buffers, the SK 4 fragment contained a portion of the original NH2 terminus of native streptokinase noncovalently bound to the molecule (SK 4'). SK 4' is capable of activating human plasminogen to plasmin, albeit more slowly than native streptokinase. However, the SK 4'-human plasmin complex possess only very weak plasminogen-activating activity toward sheep plasminogen. Upon removal of the noncovalently bound small NH2-terminal peptide of native streptokinase from SK 4', SK 4 is formed. This particular fragment possesses practically no human plasminogen-activating activity and cannot be used as an activator of sheep plasminogen, even with added human plasminogen."

https://openalex.org/W1495329112,"Mucus secreted from the integument of the marine heteronemertine Cerebratulus lacteus (Leidy) contains two major types of polypeptide neurotoxin: the A toxins (11,000 daltons) which are lethal to a variety of animal species including mammals, and the B toxins (6,000 daltons) which appear to be selectively toxic for crustaceans. Both types of toxin were readily obtained from live worms by stimulation and collection of mucus with 1% acetic acid followed by batch adsorption of the basic polypeptide fraction upon CM-cellulose. Separate A and B toxin fractions were obtained by gel chromatography. Four toxins were purified from the B toxin fraction by CM-cellulose gradient elution chromatography. Each consists of a single polypeptide chain with NH2-terminal alanine and three (B-I) or four (B-II, B-III, B-IV) intrachain disulfide bonds. All four B toxins contain large proportions of lysine and exhibit identical gel electrophoretic mobilities at neutral pH. The B toxins lack cysteine and reducing sugar moieties. Toxin B-I differs considerably from the others in its amino acid composition and its shorter chain length (49 instead of 53 or 54 residues). The other three toxins have similar compositions, but lack proline, methionine, and phenylalanine. All four polypeptides show crustacean-selective toxicities which vary over a 30-fold range; B-II possesses the highest toxicity. As a working hypothesis it is suggested that the Cerebratulus B toxins are isotoxins which act via a common receptor present in crustacean axon membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1532387108,"Colchicine inhibits the secretion of plasma protein by rat hepatocytes and causes their intracellular accumulation in Golgi-derived secretory vesicles. This study examines whether colchicine affects secretion before or after galactose and sialic acid have been added to the secretory glycoproteins. D-[G-3H] Galactose was injected into rats and was found to be incorporated into serum glycoproteins contained within Golgi-derived secretory vesicles. The administration of colchicine (25 mumol/100 g, body weight), immediately before the injection of D-[G-3H] galactose, caused an increase in radioactivity of the serum glycoproteins in these cell fractions. D-[G-3H] Glucosamine was incorporated into serum glycoproteins contained within the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi cell fractions; however, its incorporation into the sialic acid moieties of these proteins only occurred in Golgi-derived cell fractions. Colchicine administration resulted in an increased incorporation of D-[G-3H] glucosamine into the sialic acid residues of serum glycoproteins contained within the Golgi cell fractions. These data indicate that colchicine inhibits secretion of serum proteins by rat liver after the addition of galactose and sialic acid to the secretory proteins has taken place."

https://openalex.org/W1554186946,"Incubation of normal human skin fibroblasts or fibroblasts derived from patients with erythrocyte deficiency of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-deficient) in culture medium containing L-[35S]cystine resulted in incorporation of radioactivity into protein, cysteine, and glutathione, gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase-deficient fibroblasts synthesized glutathione from [35S]cystine at 30% the rate of normal cells and contained 30% the normal amount of glutathione. Cystinotic fibroblasts incorporated [35S]cystine into the large intracellular cystine pool not found in normal or gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-deficient cells and also appeared to synthesize glutathione more slowly than normal cells. However, the radioactivity recovered as cystine was reduced greatly and the rate of [35S]cystine incorporation into glutathione increased if cystinotic cells were first depleted of their intracellular cystine pool before incubation in [35S]cystine. This suggests that the apparent reduced rate of glutathione synthesis observed in untreated cystinotic cells was a secondary effect caused by dilution of the [35S]cystine by the large pool of nonradioactive cystine. Cystinotic cells depleted of cystine by treatment with mercaptoethylamine reaccumulate 30 to 50% of their initial cystine in 24 hours in the absence of extracellular cystine. Both normal and cystinotic cells lose more than 90% of their intracellular glutathione in 24 hours in cystine-free medium. Both cell types can reutilize cysteine from glutathione for protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1505702414,"The effects of hormone binding on the reversible monomer in equilibrium dimer equilibrium of bovine neurophysins I or II in solution have been studied by sedimentation equilibrium measurements performed in conjunction with equilibrium dialysis experiments. Under normal solution conditions saturating amounts of oxytocin displace the neurophysin dimerization equilibrium toward the associated form of the protein to give a dimeric complex with two oxytocin molecules bound per dimer. Vasopressin exerts different influences on this oligomerization process. At low fractional saturation this ligand exhibits a behavior similar to oxytocin with a higher affinity for the neurophysin dimer than the monomer. But in contrast, at higher fractional saturation, vasopressin strongly displaces the aggregation equilibrium toward a monomeric complex bearing two vasopressin molecules. However, in the presence of a high concentration of LiCl two oxytocin molecules are bound per neurophysin protomer (10,000 daltons). These observations, together with earlier data for vasopressin binding, suggest that each neurophysin molecule possesses two structurally distinct hormone binding sites. These observations can be rationalized in a simple schematic model of hormone binding to neurophysin in which oxytocin favors a dimeric form with one hormone binding site available per 10,000 daltons while vasopressin favors the monomeric form with two hormone binding sites available per 10,000 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1561759442,"In an effort to clarify the mechanism by which certain plant lectins induce lymphocyte activation, we have studied amino acid (amino[14C]isobutyric acid) uptake in purified human lymphocytes exposed to mitogenic and nonmitogenic lectins. In confirmation of earlier work, mitogenic lectins (concanavalin A and two phytohemagglutinins) produced a dose-related, 2- to 10-fold increase in aminoisobutyric acid transport. Changes occurred as early as 2 hours and reached a maximum after 18 hours. The stimulation by concanavalin A was inhibited by alpha-methyl-D-mannoside but not by other selected monosaccharides, indicating that the effect is modulated through specific carbohydrate receptors. In contrast to the stimulation with concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin, the nonmitogen wheat germ agglutinin inhibited aminoisobutyric acid transport, both in the presence and absence of the mitogenic lectins. The inhibition was seen over a broad wheat germ agglutinin dose range, was prevented by N-acetylglucosamine, a known inhibitor of wheat germ agglutinin binding, and did not appear to be associated with cytotoxicity. Comparative binding studies with radiolabeled concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin demonstrated that differences in transport occurred in cells containing comparable numbers of bound lectin molecules indicating that the failure of wheat germ agglutinin to stimulate a response was not a result of ineffective binding. The lack of stimulation by wheat germ agglutinin was not due to its inability to interact multivalently with membrane receptors since this lectin is divalent, produces capping and agglutination, and continues to inhibit aminoisobutyric acid transport even after the minimum valence was increased to 4 by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. In contrast both divalent and tetravalent concanavalin A produced stimulation. Competitive binding studies with soluble wheat germ agglutinin or lectin attached to 300 A latex spheres revealed little or no competition for binding sites with radiolabeled concanavalin A, suggesting the two lectins are interacting with different receptors. This was further suggested by kinetic studies of aminoisobutyric acid transport which indicated that wheat germ agglutinin was probably affecting both the Vmax and Km of transport, whereas concanavalin A affected only the Vmax. While the mechanism by which concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin produce opposing effects on amino acid transport is not clear, since the two lectins appear to be interacting with different surface receptors we would suggest that they are perturbing microanatomically and functionally different domains on the lymphocyte plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1516206119,"Prior studies have demonstrated that the thyroid hormones L-triiodothyronine and L-thyroxine stimulate the rapid uptake of 1-amino-cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid into isolated rat thymocytes. In the present study the effects of several groups of thyroid hormones and structurally related compounds were investigated to determine the structure-function relations required for stimulation of this membrane process. Particular attention was given to (a) analogues with modifications at the oxygen bridge, the phenolic hydroxyl group, and the group at the 3' position of the outer ring, and (b) the steric orientation of the thyroid hormones. The following were found to be important for maximal activity: (a) the L-isomer configuration, (b) the presence of a 4'-hydroxyl group, (c) the presence of one substituent in both the inner and outer rings (3 and 3' positions), (d) the distal orientation of the 3' substituent in the outer ring of L-triiodothyronine, and (e) the lipophilic character of the 3' substituent. Of lesser importance was the presence of halogen atoms, or an oxygen atom in the ether position. Since these structure-function relations seen in thymocytes parallel in many respects those relations seen in whole-animal studies, it is believed that thymocytes will be a useful tool for further studies of thyroid hormones and their analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1541137308,"An aminotransferase was isolated from peroxisomes that had been separated by isopycnic centrifugation of homogenates from rat liver or kidney. The enzyme was located only in the peroxisomes and in the soluble fraction, presumably from broken peroxisomes. Within the peroxisomes, this aminotransferase was in the soluble matrix. This specific aminotransferase was not found in spinach leaves. The enzyme was relatively specific for glyoxylate as the amino group acceptor. L-Leucine and L-phenylalanine were the preferred amino donors; other amino acids were less efficiently utilized. Rates were 181 nmol X min-1 of peroxisomal protein with leucine, and 134 with phenylalanine. The rate with serine was only 28% as fast and there was no reaction with glutamate. The reactions were essentially irreversible. Treatment of peroxisomes with 0.04% Triton X-100 increased enzyme activity 80%. The enzyme in the peroxisomes was stable at 50 degrees. The enzyme was purified 100-fold. Activities with leucine, phenylalanine, and histidine could not be separated by gel filtration and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 72,000. Reaction kinetics were ping-pong. The Km (glyoxylate) was 0.5 mM with leucine and 0.67 mM with phenylalanine. Km (leucine) was 2.5 mM and Km (phenylalanine) was 2.8 mM. Substrate inhibition occurred at over 4 mM glyoxylate but did not occur with the amino donors. pH optima were 8.5 for leucine and phenylalanine and 6.2 for histidine. There was no requirement for exogenous pyridoxal phosphate, but activity was inhibited by phenylhydrazine and isonicotinic acid hydrazide. The glyoxylate aminotransferase developed postnatally and increased with age until rats were 40 days old. There was more activity in female than male rats. About 50% of the activity disappeared if rats were starved overnight. Clofibrate treatment of male rats increased this enzyme activity in isolated peroxisomes. Rats on a high casein diet had slightly higher enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W1606168622,"The membrane penicillinase of Bacillus licheniformis 749/C is a phospholipoprotein carrying extra residues of asparagine or aspartate, serine, glutamine or glutamate and glycine not present in the exoenzyme (Yamamoto, S., and Lampen, J.O. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 4095-4101). Cleavage of the membrane enzyme with trypsin yielded a phospholipipopeptide and a hydrophilic penicillinase differing from exopenicillinase only by the absence of the NH2-terminal lysine residue. Phosphatidylserine was isolated from a pronase digest of the phospholipopeptide. The partial sequence of the phospholipopeptide is: phosphatidylserine-(Ser3, Glx5, Asx7, Gly5)-Asp-Gin-Ser-Lys-COOH with the lysine being the NH2-terminal residue of the usual exoenzyme. The fatty acids present in the membrane enzyme and in the phospholipopeptide had essentially the same composition (predominantly n-16:0, ante iso-17:0, n-18:0, and n-18:1). These acids were also found in the total membrane lipids, although in very different proportions; thus, the phosphatidic acid residue of the phosphatidylserine is probably formed by the usual synthetic pathway for membrane phospholipids, but some special feature of the process affects the nature of the component fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1995175662,"CELL behaviour has been studied widely in tissue culture, and in many cases individual cells have been shown to inhibit the locomotion of cells with which they make contact1. In the embryo, however, cells move mainly in sheets2 or streams3–5 and in the latter case their locomotion does not appear to be contact inhibited6. The question, then, is how the behaviour of individual cells is coordinated in these organised morphogenetic movements. While studying isolated deep cells of the fish, Fundulus heteroclitus, we have made some observations which relate to this question."

https://openalex.org/W1522934970,"The depletion of 18O from CO2, caused by the exchange of oxygen between CO2 and water during the hydration-dehydration cycle, is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. This depletion process at chemical equilibrium in the presence of erythrocytes is biphasic, exhibiting a very rapid depletion rate immediately following the addition of cells to an isotonic solution containing 18O-enriched CO2, followed by a much slower depletion rate. It is hypothesized that these depletion characteristics are caused by the diffusion of labeled CO2 into erythrocytes where depletion occurs rapidly due to the large intracellular carbonic anhydrase content. Kinetic equations which describe this hypothesis are solved and a rate constant is obtained which represents the depletion of 18O in CO2 caused by the presence of red cells. These are equilibrium experiments with no net uptake or loss of CO2 in the cells. Consequently, depletion processes are not limited in rate by bicarbonate-chloride exchange or proton distribution across the membrane. The purpose of these measurements is to determine whether the rate of 18O depletion in red cell suspensions is determined by carbonic anhydrase activity in the cell or by the diffusion process by which CO2 enters the cell. This goal is achieved by partially inhibiting carbonic anhydrase with acetazolamide. The rate constant representing 18O depletion caused by the presence of red cells is unchanged, even though up to 90% of carbonic anhydrase is inhibited. From this rate constant the permeability constant of the membrane of rat erythrocytes to CO2 at 25 degrees and pH 7.4 is determined to be (7.6 +/- 1.2) X 10(-3) cm s-1 in the presence of 3.2 mM picrate, a passive anion diffusion inhibitor intended to block HCO3 -flux across the membrane. Using no picrate and allowing HCO3-flux to introduce an error in the measurements, the permeability constant is (1.6 +/- 0.4) X 10(-2) cm s-1. The permeability constants measured by this technique include the diffusion barrier to CO2 not only of the red cell membrane but also of a portion of the intracellular medium."
https://openalex.org/W1510333193,"After the intravenous administration to the intact rat of triglyceride carried in either intestinal lipoproteins or in an artificial fat emulsion, the enzymatic activities of microsomal beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity in the liver assayed in vitro became markedly elevated. This elevation of enzyme activity was not associated with a corresponding change in the overall rate of cholesterol synthesis in the rat liver slice as measured by the incorporation of either [3H]water or [1-14C]octanoate into nonsaponifiable lipids or into digitonin-precipitable sterols. The degree of dissociation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity from the overall rate of cholesterol synthesis correlated closely with the amount of lipid administered to the animal, the level of circulating lipids, and the level of ketone synthesis manifest in the liver cell suggesting that this phenomenon might be the consequence of a detergent effect of elevated cellular levels of fatty acids. In any event, under these experimental circumstances hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA redutase activity no longer reflects the rate at which the liver cell is synthesizing cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1543427241,"Calf liver CTP synthetase was purified 2000-fold from cytosol. The formation of 1 mol of CTP from UTP was accompanied by the cleavage of 1 mol of ATP to ADP and the formation of 1 mol of L-glutamate from L-glutamine. The stoichiometry of the liver enzyme reaction was identical with that found for the Escherichia coli B enzyme (Levitzki, A., and Koshland, D.E., Jr. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 3365-3371). The liver enzyme was also similar to the bacterial enzyme in that it polymerized in the presence of kinetically saturating levels of ATP and UTP. In the absence of nucleotides the enzyme had a sedimentation coefficient of 6.8 and an average molecular weight of 133,000 as determined by sedimentation and molecular sieving. In the presence of ATP and UTP, the enzyme had a sedimentation coefficient of 10.1 and a molecular weight, as determined by molecular sieving, of 263,000. The molecular weights of the two forms of the liver enzyme are about 25% higher than those of the corresponding forms of the bacterial enzyme (Long. C.W., Levitzki, A., and Koshland, D.E., Jr. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 80-87)."
https://openalex.org/W1579465717,"The present report describes the complete synthesis of a functional oligomeric enzyme in a heterologous cell-free system. Polysomal RNA from chicken skeletal muscle was used to direct the production of functional aldolase tetramers in wheat germ extracts. The aldolase product was (a) specifically precipitated with monospecific antibodies raised against pure muscle aldolase, (b) had the same subunit molecular weight (40,000) as that of native aldolase (as determined by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate), (c) presumably contained a functional active site since it co-purified with authentic muscle aldolase upon substrate elution from phosphocellulose, and (d) had associated into tetrameric units (Mr=160,000) as shown by centrifugation in sucrose gradients. The present work suggests that, within the cell, post-translational processing of aldolase polypeptide chains is not involved in the formation of functional aldolase tetramers."
https://openalex.org/W1605310086,"Abstract Purified ovalbumin messenger RNA was employed to selectively enrich the concentration of the gene coding for ovalbumin from total chick DNA by molecular hybridization. The coding strand of the ovalbumin gene was partially purified from sheared chick DNA by affinity column chromatography using ovalbumin mRNA immobilized on phosphocellulose. The concentrations of the ovalbumin DNA sequence in various DNA fractions were quantitated by measuring their rates of hybridization with 125I-labeled ovalbumin mRNA. When apparent Cot1/2 values of these reactions were compared to the apparent Cot1/2 value obtained from the hybridization reaction between 125I-ovalbumin mRNA and complementary DNA synthesized against ovalbumin mRNA using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, purification of the coding ovalbumin DNA strand over total chick DNA was estimated to be approximately 9,600-fold. There was no apparent degradation of the 4,000 nucleotide strands of chick DNA throughout the purification procedure. Since ovalbumin mRNA has a complexity of 1890 nucleotides, the resulting DNA was more than twice the length of ovalbumin mRNA and thus should contain DNA sequences adjacent to the structural portion of the ovalbumin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1514178127,"The unstable hemoglobin (Hb) Saint Etienne (alpha2beta295F8 His replaced by G1n) (betaSE) was found in the red blood cells of an 8-year-old boy. The composition of this hemoglobin was 26% Saint Etienne, 52% A, 3% A2 and 19% HbF. Studies of hemoglobin synthesis indicate: a) a balanced synthesis of alpha and non-alpha chains (alpha=betaA + betaSE + gamma), b) an increased pool of free alpha hemoglobin chains, and c) a rapid exchange of alpha chains between this pool and HbSE. The alpha chain pool resulted from the dissociation of HbSE and the greater instability of betaSE chains than alpha chains upon heating. Hemoglobin F is of the fetal type and is heterogeneously distributed among the red cells. Furthermore, two populations of red blood cells could be separated according to their i antigen content. Analysis of the hemoglobins revealed a heterogeneous distribution. Thus, F hemoglobin was preferentially associated with cells having low i antigen level, while Saint Etienne hemoglobin was increased in cells having a high i antigen level. HbF and HbSE were not present in the parents of the propositus. Study of the genetic markers confirmed the filiation. The parents were normal upon clinical and hematological examination; they exhibited a normal pattern and synthesis of hemoglobin. The Hb Saint Etienne case is compared with Hb Istanbul, which in spite of the same amino acid substitution is not associated with increased HbF level."
https://openalex.org/W1563173144,Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase from Clostridium cylindrosporum catalyzes phosphoryl transfer from carbamyl phosphate in ADP to form ATP. The phosphoryl transfer reaction has an obligatory requirement for tetrahydrofolate presumably as a cofactor for a proper conformation of the active site. Carbamyl phosphate is an analog of formyl phosphate-a potential intermediate in the normal enzymic reaction. The ability of the enzyme to promote synthesis of ATP from carbamyl phosphate and ADP supports a stepwise chemical reaction mechanism for the enzyme in which formyl phosphate participates as a tightly bound intermediate.
https://openalex.org/W1574893272,"Abstract A simplified and streamlined purification scheme has been developed for the large scale isolation of a green hemoprotein from human erythrocytes. The isolation procedure involves hypotonic lysis, freezing of the hemolysate at -60 degrees, centrifugation, direct chromatography of the supernatant on DEAE-cellulose, and subsequent cation exchange, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. Approximately 2 mumol of this anionic hemoprotein were isolated per liter of packed erythrocytes. The previous inability to separate the prosthetic group from the protein by conventional solvent extraction procedures was shown to be a consequence of the highly polar character of the heme and not due to covalent linkage between heme and protein. The polar nature and marked lability of the heme necessitated development of techniques for the extraction, purification, and derivatization of the prosthetic group. The heme was separated from the protein by membrane filtration in the presence of pyridine and alkali or by disc gel electrophoresis in the presence of cyanide. The heme was methylated with trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate and further derivatized. The heme derivatives were purified on columns of Sephadex LH-20 or alumina. Chromatography of the heme, heme methyl ester, acetylated heme ester, and the corresponding porphyrin derivatives suggests that the heme contains three carboxyl groups and one or more polar, acetylatable functional groups, probably hydroxyl groups. Spectral characterization of these compounds, as well as the derivatives resulting from reaction of the heme with NH2OH, NaHSO3, and Na2S2O4, show that the prosthetic group is a previously undescribed, formyl-containing heme that can be clearly distinguished from heme a, Spirographis heme, and all other naturally occurring prosthetic groups."

The large fragments isolated from two HL-A preparations carrying different specificities appeared homogeneous both by immunoelectrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide electrophoresis. Both HL-A antigen preparations contained the same NH2-terminal (glycine) and the same COOH-terminal residue (serine). The carbohydrate content of the large fragment was 12.9%, making the carbohydrate-free molecular weight approximately 30,000. Small but significant differences have been found in the amino acid compositions and tryptic peptide maps of the two large fragments containing different specificities."

https://openalex.org/W1544562630,"D-erythro-(2S, 3R)-Sphinganine 1-phosphate was incubated with rat liver microsomes in the presence of tritiated water. [3H]Ethanolamine 1-phosphate was isolated and converted, through a combination of enzymatic and chemical reactions, to [3H]glycine. The labeled glycine was incubated with D-amino acid oxidase, an enzyme which, in the catalysis of the conversion of glycine to glyoxylic acid, specifically removes the hydrogen in the S configuration at carbon atom 2 of glycine. Essentially complete retention of the labeled hydrogen occurred upon conversion to glyoxylic acid. The combined results indicate that the conversion of D-erythro-(2S,3R)-sphinganine 1-phosphate to palmitaldehyde and ethanolamine 1-phosphate, catalyzed by sphinganine-1-phosphate lyase of rat liver microsomes, proceeds with the stereospecific incorporation of 1 atom of solvent hydrogen into the R configuration of ethanolamine 1-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2096935242,"Abstract A comparative affinity chromatography study using agarose-ATP columns revealed differences between heavy meromyosin subfragment 1 (HMM S-1) preparations obtained from rabbit white skeletal, rabbit red skeletal, bovine cardiac, and chicken gizzard muscle myosins. The characteristic patterns were markedly affected by Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in a manner typical for each myosin species. Similar differences were also observed on comparing the intact myosins of red and white muscles. It thus became possible to separate, at least partially, mixtures of myosin (or HMM S-1) of different origins. Muscle acetone-dried powder was used as chromatographic medium for active myosin fragments in affinity chromatography columns. At low ionic strength the columns bound appreciable amounts of heavy meromyosin (HMM) and of HMM S-1. Binding was reversible and the myosin fragments could be eluted by ATP or magnesium pyrophosphate. The absorption peak of bovine cardiac HMM S-1 was found to be less symmetrical than that of the rabbit white skeletal analog. Chemical modification by trinitrophenylation of white skeletal HMM S-1 was found to affect the affinity of binding and the shape of the absorption peak, thus enabling a partial separation of trinitrophenylated fragment from the unmodified protein using an actin column. The resolving power of ATP columns for the separation of red and white skeletal myosins was increased after trintrophenylation of the proteins."
