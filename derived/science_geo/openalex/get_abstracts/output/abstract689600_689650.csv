https://openalex.org/W4214861448,"For more than 100 years, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been one of the most studied model organisms. Here, we present a single-cell atlas of the adult fly, Tabula Drosophilae, that includes 580,000 nuclei from 15 individually dissected sexed tissues as well as the entire head and body, annotated to >250 distinct cell types. We provide an in-depth analysis of cell type-related gene signatures and transcription factor markers, as well as sexual dimorphism, across the whole animal. Analysis of common cell types between tissues, such as blood and muscle cells, reveals rare cell types and tissue-specific subtypes. This atlas provides a valuable resource for the Drosophila community and serves as a reference to study genetic perturbations and disease models at single-cell resolution."
https://openalex.org/W4214944386,"Alzheimer’s disease has a higher incidence in older women, with a spike in cognitive decline that tracks with visceral adiposity, dysregulated energy homeostasis and bone loss during the menopausal transition1,2. Inhibiting the action of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) reduces body fat, enhances thermogenesis, increases bone mass and lowers serum cholesterol in mice3–7. Here we show that FSH acts directly on hippocampal and cortical neurons to accelerate amyloid-β and Tau deposition and impair cognition in mice displaying features of Alzheimer’s disease. Blocking FSH action in these mice abrogates the Alzheimer’s disease-like phenotype by inhibiting the neuronal C/EBPβ–δ-secretase pathway. These data not only suggest a causal role for rising serum FSH levels in the exaggerated Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology during menopause, but also reveal an opportunity for treating Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, osteoporosis and dyslipidaemia with a single FSH-blocking agent. Follicle-stimulating hormone acts directly on hippocampal and cortical neurons to accelerate amyloid-β and Tau deposition and impair cognition in mice displaying features of Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W4214922633,The sleep cycle is characterized by alternating non–rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleeps. The mechanisms by which this cycle is generated are incompletely understood. We found that a transient increase of dopamine (DA) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during NREM sleep terminates NREM sleep and initiates REM sleep. DA acts on dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2)–expressing neurons in the BLA to induce the NREM-to-REM transition. This mechanism also plays a role in cataplectic attacks—a pathological intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness—in narcoleptics. These results show a critical role of DA signaling in the BLA in initiating REM sleep and provide a neuronal basis for sleep cycle generation.
https://openalex.org/W4221021635,"Plants continuously form new organs in different developmental contexts in response to environmental cues. Underground lateral roots initiate from prepatterned cells in the main root, but cells can also bypass the root-shoot trajectory separation and generate shoot-borne roots through an unknown mechanism. We mapped tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) shoot-borne root development at single-cell resolution and showed that these roots initiate from phloem-associated cells through a unique transition state. This state requires the activity of a transcription factor that we named SHOOTBORNE ROOTLESS (SBRL). Evolutionary analysis reveals that SBRL's function and cis regulation are conserved in angiosperms and that it arose as an ancient duplication, with paralogs controlling wound-induced and lateral root initiation. We propose that the activation of a common transition state by context-specific regulators underlies the plasticity of plant root systems."
https://openalex.org/W4214913948,"The prospect of controlling the electronic properties of materials via the vacuum fields of cavity electromagnetic resonators is emerging as one of the frontiers of condensed matter physics. We found that the enhancement of vacuum field fluctuations in subwavelength split-ring resonators strongly affects one of the most paradigmatic quantum protectorates, the quantum Hall electron transport in high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases. The observed breakdown of the topological protection of the integer quantum Hall effect is interpreted in terms of a long-range cavity-mediated electron hopping where the anti-resonant terms of the light-matter coupling Hamiltonian develop into a finite resistivity induced by the vacuum fluctuations. Our experimental platform can be used for any two-dimensional material and provides a route to manipulate electron phases in matter by means of vacuum-field engineering."
https://openalex.org/W4214834354,"In this study, we achieved magnetic control of reactive scattering in an ultracold mixture of $^{23}$Na atoms and $^{23}$Na$^{6}$Li molecules. In most molecular collisions, particles react or are lost near short range with unity probability, leading to the so-called universal rate. By contrast, the Na{+}NaLi system was shown to have only $\sim4\%$ loss probability in a fully spin-polarized state. By controlling the phase of the scattering wave function via a Feshbach resonance, we modified the loss rate by more than a factor of $100$, from far below to far above the universal limit. The results are explained in analogy with an optical Fabry-Perot resonator by interference of reflections at short and long range. Our work demonstrates quantum control of chemistry by magnetic fields with the full dynamic range predicted by our models."
https://openalex.org/W4214833509,"Selective metal coordination is central to the functions of metalloproteins:1,2 each metalloprotein must pair with its cognate metallocofactor to fulfil its biological role3. However, achieving metal selectivity solely through a three-dimensional protein structure is a great challenge, because there is a limited set of metal-coordinating amino acid functionalities and proteins are inherently flexible, which impedes steric selection of metals3,4. Metal-binding affinities of natural proteins are primarily dictated by the electronic properties of metal ions and follow the Irving–Williams series5 (Mn2+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+ < Cu2+ > Zn2+) with few exceptions6,7. Accordingly, metalloproteins overwhelmingly bind Cu2+ and Zn2+ in isolation, regardless of the nature of their active sites and their cognate metal ions1,3,8. This led organisms to evolve complex homeostatic machinery and non-equilibrium strategies to achieve correct metal speciation1,3,8–10. Here we report an artificial dimeric protein, (AB)2, that thermodynamically overcomes the Irving–Williams restrictions in vitro and in cells, favouring the binding of lower-Irving–Williams transition metals over Cu2+, the most dominant ion in the Irving–Williams series. Counter to the convention in molecular design of achieving specificity through structural preorganization, (AB)2 was deliberately designed to be flexible. This flexibility enabled (AB)2 to adopt mutually exclusive, metal-dependent conformational states, which led to the discovery of structurally coupled coordination sites that disfavour Cu2+ ions by enforcing an unfavourable coordination geometry. Aside from highlighting flexibility as a valuable element in protein design, our results illustrate design principles for constructing selective metal sequestration agents. An alternative approach to metalloprotein design shows that it is possible to overcome the restrictions of the Irving–Williams series and achieve both flexibility and specificity in the binding of metal ions."
https://openalex.org/W4214890833,"Discrimination of self from non-self is fundamental to a wide range of immunological processes1. During pregnancy, the mother does not recognize the placenta as immunologically foreign because antigens expressed by trophoblasts, the placental cells that interface with the maternal immune system, do not activate maternal T cells2. Currently, these activation defects are thought to reflect suppression by regulatory T cells3. By contrast, mechanisms of B cell tolerance to trophoblast antigens have not been identified. Here we provide evidence that glycan-mediated B cell suppression has a key role in establishing fetomaternal tolerance in mice. B cells specific for a model trophoblast antigen are strongly suppressed through CD22–LYN inhibitory signalling, which in turn implicates the sialylated glycans of the antigen as key suppressive determinants. Moreover, B cells mediate the MHC-class-II-restricted presentation of antigens to CD4+ T cells, which leads to T cell suppression, and trophoblast-derived sialoglycoproteins are released into the maternal circulation during pregnancy in mice and humans. How protein glycosylation promotes non-immunogenic placental self-recognition may have relevance to immune-mediated pregnancy complications and to tumour immune evasion. We also anticipate that our findings will bolster efforts to harness glycan biology to control antigen-specific immune responses in autoimmune disease. Pathways of glycan-mediated B cell suppression during pregnancy are important for promoting fetomaternal tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W4220869301,"Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are zoonotic henipaviruses (HNVs) responsible for outbreaks of encephalitis and respiratory illness. The entry of HNVs into host cells requires the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, which are the main targets of antibody responses. To understand viral infection and host immunity, we determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the NiV G homotetrameric ectodomain in complex with the nAH1.3 broadly neutralizing antibody Fab fragment. We show that a cocktail of two nonoverlapping G-specific antibodies neutralizes NiV and HeV synergistically and limits the emergence of escape mutants. Analysis of polyclonal serum antibody responses elicited by vaccination of macaques with NiV G indicates that the receptor binding head domain is immunodominant. These results pave the way for implementing multipronged therapeutic strategies against these deadly pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4214950837,"Molecular knots are often prepared using metal helicates to cross the strands. We found that coordinatively mismatching oligodentate ligands and metal ions provides a more effective way to synthesize larger knots using Vernier templating. Strands composed of different numbers of tridentate 2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide groups fold around nine-coordinate lanthanide (III) ions to generate strand-entangled complexes with the lowest common multiple of coordination sites for the ligand strands and metal ions. Ring-closing olefin metathesis then completes the knots. A 3:2 (ditopic strand:metal) Vernier assembly produces +31#+31 and -31#-31 granny knots. Vernier complexes of 3:4 (tetratopic strand:metal) stoichiometry selectively form a 378-atom-long trefoil-of-trefoils triskelion knot with 12 alternating strand crossings or, by using opposing stereochemistry at the terminus of the strand, an inverted-core triskelion knot with six alternating and six nonalternating strand crossings."
https://openalex.org/W4214945771,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on various aspects of life, but questions about its effects on close relationships remain largely unanswered. In the present study, we examined perceived changes in relationship satisfaction at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by using an international sample of 3,243 individuals from 67 different countries, mostly from Italy, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In April and May 2020, participants responded to an online survey that included questions about relationship satisfaction, their satisfaction before the pandemic, other relationship aspects (e.g., shared time), special circumstances (e.g., mobility restrictions), and enduring dispositions (e.g., insecure attachment). A decline in time shared with one's partner was most strongly associated with perceived decreases in relationship satisfaction, resulting in a different pattern of findings for cohabiting and non-cohabiting individuals. Among the most influential moderators were anxious and avoidant attachment. The findings offer insights into both aggravating and protecting factors in couples' responses to pandemic-related stressors."
https://openalex.org/W4214947431,"The motion of a spin excitation across topologically nontrivial magnetic order exhibits a deflection that is analogous to the effect of the Lorentz force on an electrically charged particle in an orbital magnetic field. We used polarized inelastic neutron scattering to investigate the propagation of magnons (i.e., bosonic collective spin excitations) in a lattice of skyrmion tubes in manganese silicide. For wave vectors perpendicular to the skyrmion tubes, the magnon spectra are consistent with the formation of finely spaced emergent Landau levels that are characteristic of the fictitious magnetic field used to account for the nontrivial topological winding of the skyrmion lattice. This provides evidence of a topological magnon band structure in reciprocal space, which is borne out of the nontrivial real-space topology of a magnetic order."
https://openalex.org/W4214915302,"Magnetic monopoles play a central role in areas of physics that range from electromagnetism to topological matter. String theory promotes conventional vector gauge fields of electrodynamics to tensor gauge fields and predicts the existence of more exotic tensor monopoles. Here, we report the synthesis of a tensor monopole in a four-dimensional parameter space defined by the spin degrees of freedom of a single solid-state defect in diamond. Using two complementary methods, we characterized the tensor monopole by measuring its quantized topological charge and its emanating Kalb-Ramond field. By introducing a fictitious external field that breaks chiral symmetry, we further observed an intriguing spectral transition, characterized by spectral rings protected by mirror symmetries. Our work demonstrates the possibility of emulating exotic topological structures inspired by string theory."
https://openalex.org/W4214896964,"Sequence features of genes and their flanking regulatory regions are determinants of RNA transcript isoform expression and have been used as context-independent plug-and-play modules in synthetic biology. However, genetic context-including the adjacent transcriptional environment-also influences transcript isoform expression levels and boundaries. We used synthetic yeast strains with stochastically repositioned genes to systematically disentangle the effects of sequence and context. Profiling 120 million full-length transcript molecules across 612 genomic perturbations, we observed sequence-independent alterations to gene expression levels and transcript isoform boundaries that were influenced by neighboring transcription. We identified features of transcriptional context that could predict these alterations and used these features to engineer a synthetic circuit where transcript length was controlled by neighboring transcription. This demonstrates how positional context can be leveraged in synthetic genome engineering."

https://openalex.org/W4214891095,"α-Olefins are important starting materials for the production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, and fine and bulk chemicals. However, the selective synthesis of α-olefins from ethylene, a highly abundant and inexpensive feedstock, is restricted, and thus a broadly applicable selective α-olefin synthesis using ethylene is highly desirable. Here, we report the catalytic reaction of an α-olefin with two ethylene molecules. The first ethylene molecule forms a 4-ethyl branch and the second a new terminal carbon-carbon double bond (C2 elongation). The key to this reaction is the development of a highly active and stable molecular titanium catalyst that undergoes extremely fast β-hydride elimination and transfer."
https://openalex.org/W4214922652,"The timely release of SARS-CoV-2 first genomic sequences allowed the identification of the etiologic agent and development of diagnostic protocols. Genomic sequencing was a crucial step in generating data for driving laboratory response and detections of SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of all the progression and achievements that timely release of genetic sequence data represents in the public health response, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in collaboration with countries' public health laboratories, started implementation of a network for strengthening the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region on timely generation of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. Here we describe the implementation of the COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Regional Network in the Americas region during the beginning of the pandemic. The establishment of this network has strengthened laboratory response capacity at the country level, as well as facilitated timely release of SARS-CoV-2 genomic information to be used to complement the multiple response strategies for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation. As genomic epidemiology is useful for guiding public health decisions on outbreak and response, we also analysed the first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data from countries of the Latin America and Caribbean Region."
https://openalex.org/W4214894318,"Economic security can be considered as an economic aspect of the life of an individual or household that provides the opportunity to achieve financial stability and improve living standards. In this context, understanding the impact of economic affordability of food on the economic security of the country is of great importance. The authors propose to use the indicator of economic affordability of food for in-depth analysis of the economic security of the country. Indicators that determine the level of economic affordability of food products in Ukraine for 2000-2018 are calculated. The regression analysis made it possible to establish a close relationship between the indicators of food expenditures and the level of GDP per capita, between the level of income and expenditure of food of decile groups. Correlation coefficients between the consumption of six basic foodstuffs and the level of per capita income in Ukraine are determined. The obtained indicators, which determine the economic affordability of food, allow us to conclude that there is a lack of economic protection at the level of individual low-income households. Overcoming economic instability and minimizing the possible consequences of the low level of economic affordability of food should become one of the main tasks of Ukraine's economic security."
https://openalex.org/W4214940687,"Anticipating intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy is critical in supporting decision makers to impose (or relax) measures that mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Mechanistic approaches such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models have traditionally been used to achieve this objective. However, formulating such models is challenged by the necessity to formulate equations for plausible causal mechanisms between the intensity of COVID-19 transmission and external epidemic drivers such as temperature, and the stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here, we combined a neural network model (NN) with a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model (SEIR) in a hybrid model and attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of existing models used to forecast ICU occupancy. Between 1 st of October, 2020 - 1 st of July, 2021, the hybrid model improved performances of the SEIR model at different geographical levels. At a national level, the hybrid model improved, prediction accuracy (i.e., mean absolute error) by 74%. At the cantonal and hospital levels, the reduction on the forecast’s mean absolute error were 46% and 50%, respectively. Our findings illustrate those predictions from hybrid model can be used to anticipate occupancy in ICU, and support the decision-making for lifesaving actions such as the transfer of patients and dispatching of medical personnel and ventilators."
https://openalex.org/W4214948190,"Various lipids (mainly meibum lipids secreted by the meibomian glands) are present in the tear film lipid layer and play important roles in tear stability and the health of the cornea and conjunctiva. Many meibum lipids contain fatty alcohols (FAls) with chain lengths ≥C24, but the fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs) that produce them remain unclear. Here, using cell-based assays, we found that the two FAR isozymes (FAR1 and FAR2) show different substrate specificities: FAR1 and FAR2 are involved in the production of C16-C18 and ≥C20 FAls, respectively. Next, we generated Far2 knockout (KO) mice and examined their dry eye phenotype and meibum lipid composition. These mice showed a severe dry eye phenotype, characterized by plugged meibomian gland orifices, corneal damage, and tear film instability. The plugging was attributed to an increase in the melting point of the meibum lipids. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry revealed that FAl-containing meibum lipids (wax monoesters and types 1ω, 2α, and 2ω wax diesters) with a hydroxyl group at position 1 were almost completely absent in Far2 KO mice. The levels of di-unsaturated (O-acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acids were higher in Far2 KO mice than in wild type mice, but those of tri-unsaturated ones were comparable, suggesting the presence of two synthesis pathways for type 1ω wax diesters. These results indicate the importance of FAl-containing meibum lipids in the formation of a functional tear film lipid layer. In addition, our study provides clues to the molecular mechanism of the biosynthesis of meibum lipids."
https://openalex.org/W4214911467,"Background Large households/families may create more happiness and offer more comprehensive healthcare among the members. We correlated household size to dementia mortality rate at population level for analysing its protecting role against dementia mortality. Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study. Dementia specific mortality rates of the 183 member states of World Health Organization were calculated and matched with the respective country data on household size, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), urban population and ageing. Scatter plots were produced to explore and visualize the correlations between household size and dementia mortality rates. Pearson’s and nonparametric correlations were used to evaluate the strength and direction of the associations between household size and all other variables. Partial correlation of Pearson’s approach was used to identify that household size protects against dementia regardless of the competing effects from ageing, GDP and urbanization. Multiple regression was used to identify significant predictors of dementia mortality. Results Household size was in a negative and moderately strong correlation (r = -0.6034, p &lt; 0.001) with dementia mortality. This relationship was confirmed in both Pearson r (r = - 0.524, p&lt;0.001) and nonparametric (rho = -0.579, p &lt; 0.001) analyses. When we controlled for the contribution of ageing, socio-economic status and urban lifestyle in partial correlation analysis, large household was still in inverse and significant correlation to dementia mortality (r = −0.331, p &lt;0.001). This suggested that, statistically, large household protect against dementia mortality regardless of the contributing effects of ageing, socio-economic status and urban lifestyle. Stepwise multiple regression analysis selected large household as the variable having the greatest contribution to dementia mortality with R 2 = 0.263 while ageing was placed second increasing R 2 to 0.259. GDP and urbanization were removed as having no statistically significant influence on dementia mortality. Conclusions While acknowledging ageing, urban lifestyle and greater GDP associated with dementia mortality, this study suggested that, at population level, household size was another risk factor for dementia mortality. As part of dementia prevention, healthcare practitioners should encourage people to increase their positive interactions with persons from their neighbourhood or other fields where large household/family size is hard to achieve."
https://openalex.org/W4214916548,"B. vulgaris extracts possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory along with its role in improving memory disorders. Subsequently, in vitro and in silico studies of its purified phytochemicals may expand complementary and alternative Alzheimer's therapeutic option. Super activation of acetylcholinesterase enzyme is associated explicitly with Alzheimer's disease (AD) ultimately resulting in senile dementia. Hence, acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition is employed as a promising approach for AD treatment. Many FDA approved drugs are unable to cure the disease progression completely. The Present study was devised to explore the potential bioactive phytochemicals of B. vulgaris as alternative therapeutic agents against AD by conducting in vitro and in silico studies. To achieve this, chemical structures of phytochemicals were recruited from PubChem. Further, these compounds were analyzed for their binding affinities towards acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme. Pharmacophoric ligand-based models showed major characteristics like, HBA, HBD, hydrophobicity, aromaticity and positively ionizable surface morphology for receptor binding. Virtual screening identified three hit compounds including betanin, myricetin and folic acid with least binding score compared to the reference drug, donepezil (-17 kcal/mol). Further, in vitro studies for anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of betanin and glycine betaine were performed. Dose response analysis showed 1.271 μM and 1.203 μM 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for betanin and glycine betaine compounds respectively. Our findings indicate that phytoconstituents of B. vulgaris can be implicated as an alternative therapeutic drug candidate for cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease."

Minimally invasive ultrasound-guided autopsies were performed in fourteen deceased patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Histological and clinical findings of lung, kidney, and liver tissue are described and contrasted with those previously reported in the literature.Single-center COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City.Fourteen minimally invasive autopsies revealed a gross correlation with open autopsies reports: 1) Lung histology was characterized mainly by early diffuse alveolar damage (12/13). Despite low lung compliances and prolonged mechanical ventilation, the fibrotic phase was rarely observed (2/13). 2) Kidney histopathology demonstrated acute tubular injury (12/13), interstitial nephritis (11/13), and glomerulitis (11/13) as the predominant features 3) Liver histology was characterized by neutrophilic inflammation in all of the cases, as well as hepatic necrosis (8/14) despite minimal alterations in liver function testing. Hepatic steatosis was observed in most cases (12/14). SARS-CoV-2 positivity was widely observed throughout the immunohistochemical analysis. However, endothelitis and micro thrombosis, two of the hallmark features of the disease, were not observed.Our data represents the largest minimally invasive, ultrasound-guided autopsy report. We demonstrate a gross histological correlation with large open autopsy cohorts. However, this approach might overlook major histologic features of the disease, such as endothelitis and micro-thrombosis. Whether this represents sampling bias is unclear."
https://openalex.org/W4220732119,"Musical activities, especially singing and playing wind instruments, have been singled out as potentially high-risk activities for the transmission of SARS CoV-2, due to a higher rate of aerosol production and emission. Playing wind instruments can produce condensation, droplets of saliva, and aerosol particles, which hover and spread in the environmental air's convectional flows and which can be potentially infectious. The aim of this study is to investigate the primary impulse dispersion of aerosols that takes place during the playing of different wind instruments as compared to breathing and to speaking. Nine professional musicians (3 trumpeters, 3 flautists and 3 clarinetists) from the Bavarian Symphony Orchestra performed the main theme from the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th symphony in different pitches and loudness. The inhaled air volume was marked with small aerosol particles produced using a commercial e-cigarette. The expelled aerosol cloud was recorded by cameras from different perspectives. Afterwards, the dimensions and dynamics of the aerosol cloud were measured by segmenting the video footage at every time point. Overall, the flutes produced the largest dispersion at the end of the task, reaching maximum forward distances of 1.88 m. An expulsion of aerosol was observed in different directions: upwards and downwards at the mouthpiece, at the end of the instrument, and along the flute at the key plane. In comparison, the maximum impulse dispersions generated by the trumpets and clarinets were lower in frontal and lateral direction (1.2 m and 1.0 m towards the front, respectively). Also, the expulsion to the sides was lower."
https://openalex.org/W4221075257,"Background Accurate methods of identifying patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of poor outcomes has become especially important with the advent of limited-availability therapies such as monoclonal antibodies. Here we describe development and validation of a simple but accurate scoring tool to classify risk of hospitalization and mortality. Methods All consecutive patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March 25-October 1, 2020 within the Intermountain Healthcare system were included. The cohort was randomly divided into 70% derivation and 30% validation cohorts. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for 14-day hospitalization. The optimal model was then adapted to a simple, probabilistic score and applied to the validation cohort and evaluated for prediction of hospitalization and 28-day mortality. Results 22,816 patients were included; mean age was 40 years, 50.1% were female and 44% identified as non-white race or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. 6.2% required hospitalization and 0.4% died. Criteria in the simple model included: age (0.5 points per decade); high-risk comorbidities (2 points each): diabetes mellitus, severe immunocompromised status and obesity (body mass index≥30); non-white race/Hispanic or Latinx ethnicity (2 points), and 1 point each for: male sex, dyspnea, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrythmia, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic neurologic disease. In the derivation cohort (n = 16,030) area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.81–0.84) for hospitalization and 0.91 (0.83–0.94) for 28-day mortality; in the validation cohort (n = 6,786) AUROC for hospitalization was 0.8 (CI 0.78–0.82) and for mortality 0.8 (CI 0.69–0.9). Conclusion A prediction score based on widely available patient attributes accurately risk stratifies patients with COVID-19 at the time of testing. Applications include patient selection for therapies targeted at preventing disease progression in non-hospitalized patients, including monoclonal antibodies. External validation in independent healthcare environments is needed."

https://openalex.org/W4214852121,"Automatic facial coding (AFC) is a novel research tool to automatically analyze emotional facial expressions. AFC can classify emotional expressions with high accuracy in standardized picture inventories of intensively posed and prototypical expressions. However, classification of facial expressions of untrained study participants is more error prone. This discrepancy requires a direct comparison between these two sources of facial expressions. To this end, 70 untrained participants were asked to express joy, anger, surprise, sadness, disgust, and fear in a typical laboratory setting. Recorded videos were scored with a well-established AFC software (FaceReader, Noldus Information Technology). These were compared with AFC measures of standardized pictures from 70 trained actors (i.e., standardized inventories). We report the probability estimates of specific emotion categories and, in addition, Action Unit (AU) profiles for each emotion. Based on this, we used a novel machine learning approach to determine the relevant AUs for each emotion, separately for both datasets. First, misclassification was more frequent for some emotions of untrained participants. Second, AU intensities were generally lower in pictures of untrained participants compared to standardized pictures for all emotions. Third, although profiles of relevant AU overlapped substantially across the two data sets, there were also substantial differences in their AU profiles. This research provides evidence that the application of AFC is not limited to standardized facial expression inventories but can also be used to code facial expressions of untrained participants in a typical laboratory setting."
https://openalex.org/W4214892880,"In the present study, we evaluate the effect of acute restraint stress (15 min) of male Wistar rats on social interaction measurements and c-Fos immunoreactivity (c-Fos-ir) expression, a marker of neuronal activity, in areas involved with the modulation of acute physical restraint in rats, i.e., the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), median raphe nucleus (MnR), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), cingulate prefrontal cortex (cPFC), nucleus accumbens (NaC), hippocampus (CA3), lateral septum (LS) and medial amygdala (MeA). We considered the hypothesis that restraint stress exposure could promote social withdrawal induced by the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, and increase c-Fos expression in these limbic forebrain areas investigated. In addition, we investigated whether pretreatment with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (5 mg/kg; I.P.) could attenuate or block the effects of restraint on these responses. We found that restraint stress induced social withdrawal, and increased c-Fos-ir in these areas, demonstrating that a single 15 min session of physical restraint of rats effectively activated the HPA axis, representing an effective tool for the investigation of neuronal activity in brain regions sensitive to stress. Conversely, pretreatment with clozapine, prevented social withdrawal and reduced c-Fos expression. We suggest that treatment with clozapine exerted a preventive effect in the social interaction deficit, at least in part, by blocking the effect of restraint stress in brain regions that are known to regulate the HPA-axis, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, septum and amygdala. Further experiments will be done to confirm this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W4214870229,"The concentration of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum antibodies, elicited by vaccination or infection, is a primary determinant of anti-viral immunity, which correlates with protection against infection and COVID-19. Serum samples were obtained from 25 897 participants and assayed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD IgG antibodies. The cohort was composed of newly vaccinated BNT162b2 recipients, in the first month or 6 months after vaccination, COVID-19 patients and a general sample of the Israeli population. Antibody levels of BNT162b2 vaccine recipients were negatively correlated with age, with a prominent decrease in recipients over 55 years old, which was most significant in males. This trend was observable within the first month and 6 months after vaccination, while younger participants were more likely to maintain stable levels of serum antibodies. The antibody concentration of participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 was lower than the vaccinated and had a more complex, non-linear relation to age, sex and COVID-19 symptoms. Taken together, our data supports age and sex as primary determining factors for both the magnitude and durability of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 vaccine. Our results could inform vaccination policies, prioritizing the most susceptible populations for repeated vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4214872985,"Background Educational environment refers to the diverse physical facilities, the clinical settings where students learn, the design and delivery of the curriculum, and involve the skills, and attitudes of the teachers. Due to various undesirable aspects of the educational environment, students often do not attain the expected professional standard of nursing care. There is limited evidence on students’ perception of their educational environment in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. Thus, this study aimed to assess nursing students’ perceptions of their educational environment in government Universities of Southwest Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based qualitative case study was employed. Eight participants were interviewed from government Universities of southwest Ethiopia. Face to face in-depth interview was used to generate data. The interviews were conducted for forty-five minutes to one hour using an open-ended semi-structured guiding questionnaire. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach; finally, themes were derived and presented with narration. Results The analysis of this study yields four themes categorized as curriculum, instructors’, organizations’, and students. The result of the study revealed that there were poor institutions students support systems, inadequate skills and knowledge in certain instructors, inadequate instructional materials and teaching aids, scarce facilities in students’ practical areas, accommodation, and transportation. Conclusion Improvement of nursing students’ educational environment was recognized as a strong attention-seeking area. The majority of the key informants stated that the educational environment is not suitable for the teaching-learning process. Thus, to create a conducive educational environment, the Minister of education, Universities, instructors, and other concerned bodies should design and implement strategies targeted at the aforementioned problems."
https://openalex.org/W4214880044,"Because of the past 3 decades' extensive research, several disease modifying therapies became available, thus a paradigm change is multiple sclerosis care was necessary. In 2018 a therapeutic guideline was created recommending that treatment of persons with multiple sclerosis should take place in specified care units where the entire spectrum of disease modifying therapies is available, patient monitoring is ensured, and therapy side effects are detected and treated promptly. In 2019 multiple sclerosis care unit criteria were developed, emphasizing personnel and instrumental requirements to provide most professional care. However, no survey was conducted assessing the real-world adaptation of these criteria.To assess whether Hungarian care units fulfil international criteria.A self-report questionnaire was assembled based on international guidelines and sent to Hungarian care units focusing on 3 main aspects: personnel and instrumental background, disease-modifying therapy use, number of people living with multiple sclerosis receiving care in care units. Data on number of persons with multiple sclerosis were compared to Hungarian prevalence estimates. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data.Out of 27 respondent care units, 3 fulfilled minimum requirements and 7 fulfilled minimum and recommended requirements. The least prevalent neighbouring specialties were spasticity and pain specialist, and neuro-ophthalmologist and oto-neurologist. Only 15 centres used all available disease modifying therapies. A total number of 7213 people with multiple sclerosis received care in 27 respondent centres. Compared to prevalence estimates, 2500 persons with multiple sclerosis did not receive multiple sclerosis specific care in Hungary.Less than half of Hungarian care units provided sufficient care for people living with multiple sclerosis. Care units employing fewer neighbouring specialties, might have difficulties diagnosing and providing appropriate care for persons with multiple sclerosis, especially for people with progressive disease course, contributing to the reported low number of persons living with multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4214864492,"Across Southeast Asia and China, more than 17000 Asian bears are kept under suboptimal conditions and farmed for their bile to meet the consumer demand for traditional medicine products. Years of unsterile and repetitive bile extraction contribute to the development of chronic sterile or bacterial cholecystitis, a pathology commonly diagnosed in formerly bile-farmed bears. In both human and veterinary medicine, the diagnostic value of the macroscopic bile examination for assessing gallbladder disease is unclear. The objective of this study is to identify the role of gallbladder bile color, viscosity, and turbidity, while comparing them with established markers of cholecystitis. Moreover, it aims to define the optimal duration of oral antibiotic treatment for chronic bacterial cholecystitis in bears associated with bile farming. Thirty-nine adult, formerly bile-farmed Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) were examined under anesthesia and underwent percutaneous ultrasound guided cholecystocentesis. A total of 59 bile samples were collected with 20 animals sampled twice to evaluate the therapeutic success. All bile aspirates were assessed macroscopically and microscopically followed by submission for bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity. In the majority of bears, samples with cytological evidence of bactibilia lacked inflammatory cells and did not always correlate with positive bacterial cultures. The most common bacterial isolates were Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Escherichia coli. Based on our findings, the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for chronic bacterial cholecystitis is 30 days. Moreover, unlike Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) and gallbladder wall thickness, the organoleptic properties of bile were found to be reliable markers of chronic gallbladder inflammation with color and turbidity indicating cholestasis. The current study highlights the importance of cholecystocentesis for the management of gallbladder disease and provides initial results on the possible diagnostic value of macroscopic bile examination."
https://openalex.org/W4214926181,"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions are associated with adverse psychological impacts but an assessment of positive wellbeing is required to understand the overall impacts of the pandemic. Methods The NZ Lockdown Psychological Distress Survey is an on-line cross-sectional survey of 3487 New Zealanders undertaken during a strict lockdown for COVID-19. The lockdown extended from 25 March 2020 to 28 April 2020 and the survey was undertaken between 15 April 2020 and 27 April 2020. The survey measured excellent wellbeing categorised by a WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) score ≥22. The survey also contained demographic and pre-lockdown questions, subjective and objective lockdown experiences, and questions on alcohol use. The proportion of participants with excellent wellbeing is reported with multivariate analysis examining the relative importance of individual factors associated with excellent wellbeing. Results Approximately 9% of the overall sample (303 participants) reported excellent wellbeing during the New Zealand lockdown. In the multivariable analysis, excellent wellbeing status was positively associated with increasing age (p&lt;0.001), male gender (p = 0.044), Māori and Asian ethnicity (p = 0.008), and lower levels of education (certificate/diploma level qualification or less) (p&lt;0.001). Excellent wellbeing was negatively associated with smoking (p = 0.001), poor physical (p&lt;0.001) and mental health (p = 0.002), and previous trauma (p = 0.033). Conclusion Nine percent of New Zealanders reported excellent wellbeing during severe COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Demographic and broader health factors predicted excellent wellbeing status. An understanding of these factors may help to enhance wellbeing during any future lockdowns."
https://openalex.org/W4220784612,"Hyaluronan (HA) is dynamically remodeled in tumor microenvironment (TME) and is reported to be closely related to tumor lymphatic metastasis by inducing lymphangiogenesis. Macrophages are known to be involved in neo-lymphatic vessels formation. However, few studies have investigated the role of HA-mediated TME remodeling on macrophages-dependent lymphangiogenesis. We previously showed that HA could drive macrophages to acquire the M2 phenotype. In this study, we attempt to study the crosstalk between HA in TME and macrophages dependent lymphangiogenesis. First, we found that the abundant assembly of HA in breast cancer tissue was accompanied by increased infiltration of macrophages featured by expressing lymphatic endothelial markers. Then, to further identify the remodeling of HA in regulating macrophage phenotype, we used HA fragments which are usually enriched in TME for this purpose. Our results showed that the reconstructed HA could induce bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) to express markers of lymphatic endothelium and form tube-like structures, suggesting a novel function of HA from TME on macrophages-dependent lymphangiogenesis. Finally, we found that inhibition of the HA-TLR4 pathway could reduce the ability of BMDMs to exhibit lymphatic endothelial phenotype. Our results provide new insight into tumor microenvironment remodeling and macrophages in breast cancer lymphangiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4214909759,"The proposed mechanisms for the development of nephropathy are many, complex and often overlapping. Although recent literature strongly supports a role of kidney hypoxia as an independent pathway to nephropathy, the evidence remains inconclusive since the role of hypoxia is difficult to differentiate from confounding factors such as hyperglycemia, hypertension and oxidative stress. By increasing kidney oxygen consumption using triiodothyronine (T3) and, thus, avoiding these confounding factors, the aim of the present study was to investigate renal hypoxia per se as a causal pathway for the development of nephropathy. Healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with T3 (10 μg/kg/day) and the angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonist candesartan (1 mg/kg in drinking water) to eliminate effects of T3-induced renin release; and compared to a candesartan treated control group. After 7 weeks of treatment in vivo kidney function, oxygen metabolism and mitochondrial function were evaluated. T3 did not affect glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow, but increased total kidney oxygen consumption resulting in cortical hypoxia. Nephropathy, demonstrated as albuminuria and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, developed in T3-treated animals. Mitochondria uncoupling mediated by uncoupling protein 2 and the adenosine nucleotide transporter was demonstrated as a mechanism causing the increased kidney oxygen consumption. Importantly, blood glucose levels, mean arterial blood pressure and oxidative stress levels were not affected by T3. In conclusion, the present study provides further evidence for increased kidney oxygen consumption causing intrarenal tissue hypoxia, as a causal pathway for development of nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W4214931258,"Based on the social identity theory, this study investigates the mediation and moderation mechanism of CSR on job applicant attraction. A total of 395 job seekers are recruited to join in the experiment survey. The results indicate that job seekers' perceptions of CSR positively relate to job applicant attraction, employer reputation and expected pride mediate this relationship, respectively, and the serial mediating role of employer reputation and then expected pride in the relationship between CSR and job applicant attraction. Additionally, the findings show that job applicants' materialism orientation plays a moderating role in the indirect effect of CSR on job applicant attraction via expected pride, but the moderating effect of job seekers' materialism orientation in the indirect effect of CSR on job applicant attraction via employer reputation is not statistically significant. These findings enrich the new culture-driven evidence on the impacting mechanism of CSR on job applicant's attitude and provide valuable insight into how CSR motivates job applicant attraction."
https://openalex.org/W4214807606,"Chediak-Higashi syndrome, caused by mutations in the Lysosome Trafficking Regulator (Lyst) gene, is a recessive hypopigmentation disorder characterized by albinism, neuropathies, neurodegeneration, and defective immune responses, with enlargement of lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. Although recent studies have suggested that Lyst mutations impair the regulation of sizes of lysosome and lysosome-related organelle, the underlying pathogenic mechanism of Chediak-Higashi syndrome is still unclear. Here we show striking evidence that deficiency in LYST protein function leads to accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment phagosomes in retinal pigment epithelial cells, and reduces adhesion between photoreceptor outer segment and retinal pigment epithelial cells in a mouse model of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. In addition, we observe elevated levels of cathepsins, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) 3 and oxidative stress markers in the retinal pigment epithelium of Lyst mutants. Previous reports showed that impaired degradation of photoreceptor outer segment phagosomes causes elevated oxidative stress, which could consequently lead to increases of cysteine cathepsins and MMPs in the extracellular matrix. Taken together, we conclude that the loss of LYST function causes accumulation of phagosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium and elevation of several extracellular matrix-remodeling proteases through oxidative stress, which may, in turn, reduce retinal adhesion. Our work reveals previously unreported pathogenic events in the retinal pigment epithelium caused by Lyst deficiency. The same pathogenic events may be conserved in other professional phagocytic cells, such as macrophages in the immune system, contributing to overall Chediak-Higashi syndrome pathology."
https://openalex.org/W4214824731,"Linkage to care for newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients is important to ensure that patients have good access to care. However, there is little information about factors influencing linkage to care for HIV patients. We aimed to identify existing measures in place that promote linkage to care and to explore facilitators and barriers to linkage to care for clients diagnosed with HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome at a rural health center in Uganda. This descriptive qualitative study enrolled 33 purposively selected participants who included expert clients, linkage facilitators, heads of families with people living with HIV, and health workers. Data were collected using in-depth interviews that were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated. The data were manually analyzed to generate themes. The following four themes were generated: 1) availability of services that include counseling, testing, treatment, follow-up, referral, outreach activities, and support systems. 2) Barriers to linkage to care were at the individual, health facility, and community levels. Individual-level barriers were socioeconomic status, high transport costs, fear of adverse drug effects, fear of broken relationships, and denial of positive results or treatment, while health facility barriers were reported to be long waiting time, negative staff attitude, and drug stock outs. Community barriers were mostly due to stigma experienced by HIV clients, resulting in discrimination by community members. 3) Facilitators to linkage to care were positive staff attitudes, access to information, fear of death, and support from others. 4) Suggestions for improving service delivery were shortening waiting time, integrating HIV services, increasing staff numbers, and intensifying outreaches. Our findings highlight the importance of stakeholder involvement in linkage to care. Access and linkage to care are positively and negatively influenced at the individual, community, and health facility levels. However, integration of HIV services and intensifying outreaches are key to improving linkage to care."
https://openalex.org/W4214838647,"The present research investigates the individual and aggregate level determinants of support for thin-centred ideology parties across 23 European countries. Employing a multilevel modelling approach, we analysed European Social Survey data round 7 2014 (N = 44000). Our findings show that stronger identification with one’s country and confidence in one’s ability to influence the politics positively but perceiving the system as satisfactory and responsive; trusting the institutions and people, and having positive attitudes toward minorities, i.e., immigrants and refugees, negatively predict support for populist and single issue parties. The level of human development and perceptions of corruption at the country level moderate these effects. Thus, we provide the first evidence that the populist surge is triggered by populist actors’ capacity to simultaneously invoke vertical, “ordinary” people against “the elites”, and horizontal, “us” against “threatening aliens”, categories of people as well as the sovereignty of majority over minorities. These categories and underlying social psychological processes of confidence, trust, and threats are moderated by the general level of human development and corruption perceptions in a country. It is, therefore, likely that voting for populist parties will increase as the liberally democratic countries continue to prosper and offer better opportunities for human development. Stronger emphasis on safeguarding the integrity of the economic and democratic institutions, as our findings imply, and preserving their ethical and honest, i.e., un-corrupt, nature can keep this surge under check."
https://openalex.org/W4214909487,"Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae infection causes significant mortality of endangered New Zealand sea lion pups at Enderby Island, Auckland Islands. Gross necropsy and histopathology findings are well reported, but little is known about the clinical course of disease in affected pups. To determine factors feasible as clinical screening tools for hypervirulent K . pneumoniae in live pups, 150 pups over two field seasons (2016–18) were recruited shortly after birth for a prospective cohort study. A randomised controlled clinical treatment trial with the anthelmintic ivermectin was conducted concurrently and risk factor data and biological samples were collected approximately fortnightly. Treatment with ivermectin has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of hypervirulent K . pneumoniae mortality in pups, so effects on clinical parameters between the treated and control cohorts were also investigated. A broader sample of pups were monitored for clinical signs to investigate the course of disease in affected pups. Clinical signs, haematology and oral and rectal swabs to detect gastrointestinal carriage of hypervirulent K . pneumoniae were not useful for detection of disease prior to death. Of those pups that died due to hypervirulent K . pneumoniae , only 26.1% (18/69) had any clinical signs prior, likely a reflection of the peracute course of disease. On comparison of haematological parameters between ivermectin-treated and control pups, significantly lower total plasma protein and higher eosinophil counts were seen in control versus treated pups, however standard length as a surrogate for age was a more important influence on parameters overall than ivermectin treatment. This study also highlighted a cohort of pups with severe clinical signs suggestive of hypervirulent K . pneumoniae infection were lost to follow up at the end of the monitored season, which could be contributing to cryptic juvenile mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4214916588,"Modern proteomic analysis and reliable surgical access to gain liquid inner ear biopsies have enabled in depth molecular characterization of the cochlea microenvironment. In order to clarify whether the protein composition of the perilymph can provide new insights into individual hearing performance after cochlear implantation (CI), computational analysis in correlation to clinical performance after CI were performed based on the proteome profile derived from perilymph samples (liquid biopsies). Perilymph samples from cochlear implant recipients have been analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The proteins were identified using the shot-gun proteomics method and quantified and analyzed using Max Quant, Perseus and IPA software. A total of 75 perilymph samples from 68 (adults and children) patients were included in the analysis. Speech perception data one year after implantation were available for 45 patients and these were used for subsequent analysis. According to their hearing performance, patients with excellent (n = 22) and poor (n = 14) performance one year after CI were identified and used for further analysis. The protein composition and statistically significant differences in the two groups were detected by relative quantification of the perilymph proteins. With this procedure, a selection of 287 proteins were identified in at least eight samples in both groups. In the perilymph of the patients with excellent and poor performance, five and six significantly elevated proteins were identified respectively. These proteins seem to be involved in different immunological processes in excellent and poor performer. Further analysis on the role of specific proteins as predictors for poor or excellent performance among CI recipients are mandatory. Combinatory analysis of molecular inner ear profiles and clinical performance data using bioinformatics analysis may open up new possibilities for patient stratification. The impact of such prediction algorithms on diagnosis and treatment needs to be established in further studies."

https://openalex.org/W4214931947,"Dietary intake is a fundamental determinant of maternal and child nutrition. This paper presents evidence on whether maternal and child dietary diversity can be improved with systemic improvements focused on strengthening training, capacity building, and behavior change communication among frontline workers to encourage improved nutritional practices among mothers and children in the intervention area. The evidence is derived from Project Spotlight intervention that was jointly implemented by Department of Women and Child Development, Government of Maharashtra and Tata Trusts in tribal dominated Gadchiroli and Chandrapur districts in Maharashtra. Based on a pre-post comparison of baseline (2019) and endline (2021) household survey data it is confirmed that there is a significant association between maternal and child dietary diversity in the study area. Notably, dietary diversity in mother-child dyads is marked with a higher consumption of fruits and vegetables as well as eggs and flesh foods. Econometric analysis further reveals that the association between maternal and child dietary diversity has improved after the systems strengthening interventions. The paper concludes that local interventions such as Project Spotlight for strengthening counselling services and coverage by frontline workers and enhancing knowledge and awareness on maternal and child dietary diversity among communities are important for improving maternal and child nutrition."

https://openalex.org/W4214840710,"Among the Neotropical gripopterygids, the genus Paragripopteryx occurs along the Brazilian Atlantic coast to Uruguay. Since its first recognition by Enderlein in 1909, the genus underwent a confusing taxonomic history with some combinations. In this study, we aim to revise Paragripopteryx and present the first morphology-based phylogeny for the genus. The analysis comprised 38 morphological characters and their respective states in 30 terminal taxa, including 13 Paragripopteryx species, two new species identified as belonging to Paragripopteryx , and 15 outgroup species, among which we can highlight 12 different South American genera and one Australian genus of Gripopterygidae. The cladistic analysis yielded a parsimonious tree for k = 3 (137 steps, consistency index = 0.445, and retention index = 0.591) where most Paragripopteryx are nested, except for Uruguayan Paragripopteryx munoai . We can then infer that in its current circumscription Paragripopteryx is polyphyletic. The following two species are described: Paragripopteryx dasalmas sp. nov. and Paragripopteryx ogum sp. nov. Paragripopteryx baratinii is designated as a nomen dubium . Additionally, we provide a key for species identification, updated geographical records, and illustrations for all species. As a corollary, our study gathers relevant morphological information that can help to better understand this genus and create foundations for the next steps."
https://openalex.org/W4214842575,"Existing methods for estimating how individual muscles contribute to a movement require extensive time and experimental resources. In this study we developed an efficient method for determining how changes to lower extremity joint kinematics affect the potential of individual muscles to contribute to whole-body center-of-mass vertical (support) and anteroposterior (progression) accelerations. A 4-link 2-dimensional model was used to assess the effect of kinematic changes on muscle function. Joint kinematics were systematically varied throughout ranges observed during the momentum transfer phase of the sit-to-stand transfer. Each muscle's potential to contribute to support and progression was computed and compared to simulated potentials estimated by traditional dynamic simulation methods for young adults and individuals with knee osteoarthritis. The new method required 4-10s to compute muscle potentials per kinematic state and computed potentials were consistent with simulated potentials. The new method identified differences in muscle potentials between groups due to kinematic differences, particularly decreased anterior pelvic tilt in young adults, and revealed kinematic and muscle strengthening modifications to increase support. The methods presented provide an efficient, systematic approach to evaluate how joint kinematic adjustments alter a muscle's ability to contribute to movement and can identify potential sources of pathologic movement and rehabilitation strategies."

https://openalex.org/W4214909343,"Background Older patients are often users of prolonged Central Nervous System Depressants (CNSD) (Z-hypnotics, benzodiazepines and opioids), which may be associated with reduced cognition. The long-term effects of CNSD use and reduced cognitive function in older patients are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine whether cognitive function and CNSD use at baseline hospitalisation were associated with all-cause mortality two years after discharge. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study, including baseline data (2017–2018) from previously hospitalised older patients (65–90 years), assessing all-cause mortality two years after discharge. We used logistic regression to assess the primary outcome, all-cause mortality two years after baseline hospitalisation. The primary predictors were cognitive function measured by The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and prolonged CNSD use (continuous use ≥ 4 weeks). Adjustment variables: age, gender, education, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G), using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to compare the predictive power of the models. In a sub-analysis we used, the Neurobehavioural Cognitive State Examination (Cognistat) and the Clock Drawing Test. Results Two years after discharge, out of 246 baseline patients, 43 were deceased at follow-up, among these 27 (63%) were CNSD users, and 16 (36%) were non-users at baseline, (p = 0.002). In the multivariable models cognitive function (MMSE score) was a predictor of mortality (OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.69; 0.96), p = 0.014). CNSD use was associated with mortality (OR 2.71 (95% CI 1.06; 6.95), p = 0.038), with ROC AUC: 0.74–0.77 for these models. Results using Cognistat supported the findings. The Clock Drawing Test was not significant predictor of mortality. Conclusion Two years after discharge from the hospital, older patients with reduced cognitive function and CNSD use during hospital stay had higher mortality. This underlines that inappropriate (prolonged and concurrent) use of CNSDs should be avoided by older patients, particularly in patients with reduced cognitive function.
