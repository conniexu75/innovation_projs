https://openalex.org/W4280550860,"During vertebrate embryogenesis, cell collectives engage in coordinated behavior to form tissue structures of increasing complexity. In the avian skin, assembly into follicles depends on intrinsic mechanical forces of the dermis, but how cell mechanics initiate pattern formation is not known. Here, we reconstitute the initiation of follicle patterning ex vivo using only freshly dissociated avian dermal cells and collagen. We find that contractile cells physically rearrange the extracellular matrix (ECM) and that ECM rearrangement further aligns cells. This exchange transforms a mechanically unlinked collective of dermal cells into a continuum, with coherent, long-range order. Combining theory with experiment, we show that this ordered cell-ECM layer behaves as an active contractile fluid that spontaneously forms regular patterns. Our study illustrates a role for mesenchymal dynamics in generating cell-level ordering and tissue-level patterning through a fluid instability-processes that may be at play across morphological symmetry-breaking contexts."

However, its clinical therapeutic effects have been restricted due to its low water solubility and poor absorption after oral administration. The aim of this study was to develop SB-loaded PCL/Pluronic F68 nanoparticles for pulmonary delivery in the treatment of lung cancer. A modified solvent displacement process was used to make nanoparticles, which were then lyophilized to make inhalation powder, Nanoparticles were characterized with DSC, FTIR,SEM and In vitro release study. Further, a validated HPLC method was developed to investigate the Biodistribution study, pharmacokinetic parameters. Poly Caprolactone PCL / Pluronic F68 NPs showed the sustained release effect up to 48 h with an emitted (Mass median Aerodynamic diameter)MMAD and (Geometric size distribution)GSD were found to be 4.235 ±0.124 and 1.958±1.23 respectively. More specifically, the SB Loaded PCL/Pluronic F 68 NPs demonstrated long circulation and successful lung tumor-targeting potential due to their cancer-targeting capabilities. SB Loaded PCL/Pluronic F68 NPs significantly inhibited tumour growth in lung cancer-induced rats after inhalable administration. In a pharmacokinetics study, PCL/ Pluronic F68 NPs substantially improved SB bioavailability, with a more than 4-fold rise in AUC when compared to IV administration. These findings indicate that SB-loaded PCL/PluronicF68 nanoparticles may be a successful lung cancer therapy delivery system."

The antioxidant activity and total phenolic content (TPC) were evaluated by using methanol extracts along with 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) assay, respectively having Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and Gallic acid (GA) as standard. The TPC and antioxidant activity in the peels ranged from 20 mg GAE/g to 525 mg GAE/g and 15.02% to 75.95%, respectively, which revealed that investigated fruit and vegetable peels are rich source of phytochemical constituents. Bottle gourd peels exhibited the highest value of DPPH compared to the rest of the peels included in the study. Likewise, mango peels had the highest TPC as compared to the rest of the fruit peels. This research showed that the utilization of agricultural wastes should be promoted at commercial level to achieve the nutritional benefit at zero cost and minimize the generation of biological waste."
https://openalex.org/W4280573019,"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important biomarker for determining cardiovascular risk and regulating lipid lowering therapy. Therefore, the accurate estimation of LDL-C concentration is essential in cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prognosis. Sampson recently proposed a new formula for the estimation of LDL-C. However, little is known regarding the validation of this formula.This study aimed to validate this new formula with other well-known formulas in Turkish population, composed of adults.A total of 88,943 participants above 18 years old at Sivas Cumhuriyet University Hospital (Sivas, Turkey) were included to this study. LDL-C was directly measured by homogeneous assays, i.e., Roche, Beckman and Siemens and estimated by Friedewald's, Martin-Hopkins', extended Martin-Hopkins' and Sampson's formulas. The concordances between the estimations obtained by the formulas and the direct measurements were evaluated both in general and separately for the LDL-C, TG and non-HDL-C sublevels. Linear regression analysis was applied and residual error plots were generated between each estimation and direct measurement method. Coefficient of determination (R2) and mean absolute deviations were also calculated.The results showed that the extended Martin-Hopkins approach provided the most concordant results with the direct assays for LDL-C estimation. The results also showed that the highest concordances were obtained between the direct assays with the extended Martin-Hopkins formula calculated with the median statistics obtained from our own population. On the other hand, it was observed that the results of the methods may differ in different assays. The extended Martin-Hopkins approach, calculated from the median statistics of our population, gave the most concordant results in patients with ""low LDL-C level (LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (TG levels ≥ 400 mg/dL)"".Although the results of the formulas in different assays may vary, the extended Martin-Hopkins approach was the best one with the highest overall concordances. The validity of the Martin Hopkins' and Sampson's formulas has to be further investigated in different populations."

The study focuses on a much-neglected cultural context, Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC), since Student’s readiness as well as institutions and professors’ endowments greatly varied within countries and among universities. The study further incorporates Instructors attitudes and evaluates the mediation effect of Academic engagement on Academic achievement. The methodology relies on Partial Least Squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The research findings emphasize the role of E-learning environment, Digital readiness, Academic engagement, students as well as instructors E-learning attitude as the decisive factors that determine students’ Academic achievement. This implies that institutions who adapt to a changing environment by aligning students and instructors’ goals to develop a positive and supportive E-learning environment, will foment Academic engagement and promote students’ Academic achievement."

https://openalex.org/W4280647065,"Few studies explored Indonesian understanding of cervical cancer (CC) and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. We aimed to investigate the association between knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) and socio-demographical influences related to HPV, CC, and vaccination among Indonesian urban citizens.We conducted an online survey during March 2020-August 2021 using the Snowball sampling technique. The socio-demographic characteristic and KAP responses were collected via Google Forms from 400 respondents in Jakarta. The knowledge and attitudes were divided into HPV and CC (aspect 1) and HPV vaccination (aspect 2). Correlation between KAP scores was performed using Spearman's test, and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine KAP predictors.Indonesian urban citizens in Jakarta were found to have poor knowledge in individual aspects of the inquiry but moderate knowledge overall, good attitude in inquiry both in each aspect and overall, and unsatisfying practices. Overall, in the general population, men, and women respectively: 50.8%, 32.4%, and 53.6% had good knowledge; 82.0%, 75.2%, and 84.4% expressed positive attitude; and 30.3%, 15.2%, and 35.6% applied favorable practice regarding questions inquired. Knowledge was weakly correlated towards attitude (ρ = 0.385) but moderately correlated with practice (ρ = 0.485); attitude was moderately correlated with practice (ρ = 0.577), all results: p<0.001. Significant odds ratio (OR) for predictors to good knowledge were female sex (OR = 2.99), higher education (OR = 2.91), and higher mother's education (OR = 2.15). Factors related to positive attitudes were higher mother's education (OR = 4.13), younger age (OR = 1.86), and better results in the knowledge inquiries (OR = 2.96). Factors that suggested better practices were female sex (OR = 2.33), being employed (OR = 1.68), excellent knowledge scores (OR = 4.56), and positive attitudes expressions (OR = 8.05). Having done one vaccination dose and intention to receive vaccines were significantly influenced by good KAP.KAP had inter-association to successful CC and HPV prevention programs, and socio-demographical characteristics are critical to influencing better KAP."
https://openalex.org/W4280561378,"Government-sponsored health insurance schemes can play an important role in improving the reach of healthcare services. Launched in 2018 in India, Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PM-JAY) is one of the world's largest government-sponsored health insurance schemes. The objective of this study is to understand beneficiaries' experience of availing healthcare services at the empaneled hospitals in PM-JAY. This study examines the responsiveness of PM-JAY by measuring the prompt attention in service delivery, and access to information by the beneficiaries; financial burden experienced by the beneficiaries; and beneficiary's satisfaction with the experience of hospitalization under PMJAY and its determinants.The study was conducted during March-August 2019. Data were obtained through a survey conducted with 200 PM-JAY beneficiaries (or their caregivers) in the Indian states of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. The study population comprised of patients who received healthcare services at 14 study hospitals in April 2019. Prompt attention was measured in the form of a) effectiveness of helpdesk, and b) time taken at different stages of hospitalization and discharge events. Access to information by the beneficiaries was measured using the frequency and purpose of text messages and phone calls from the scheme authorities to the beneficiaries. The financial burden was measured in terms of the incidence and magnitude of out-of-pocket payments made by the beneficiaries separate from the cashless payment provided to hospitals by PMJAY. Beneficiaries' satisfaction was measured on a five-point Likert scale.Socio-economically weaker sections of the society are availing healthcare services under PM-JAY. In Gujarat, the majority of the beneficiaries were made aware of the scheme by the government official channels. In Madhya Pradesh, the majority of the beneficiaries got to know about the scheme from informal sources. For most of the elements of prompt attention, access to information, and beneficiaries' satisfaction, hospitals in Gujarat performed significantly better than the hospitals in Madhya Pradesh. Similarly, for most of the elements of prompt attention, access to information, and beneficiaries' satisfaction, public hospitals performed significantly better than private hospitals. Incidence and magnitude of out-of-pocket payments were significantly higher in Madhya Pradesh as compared to Gujarat, and in private hospitals as compared to the public hospitals.There is a need to focus on Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities for PM-JAY, especially in Madhya Pradesh. Capacity-building efforts need to be prioritized for private hospitals as compared to public hospitals, and for Madhya Pradesh as compared to Gujarat. There is a need to focus on enhancing the responsiveness of the scheme, and timely exchange of information with beneficiaries. There is also an urgent need for measures aimed at reducing the out-of-pocket payments made by the beneficiaries."
https://openalex.org/W4280589889,"""Tobacco-free"" nicotine (TFN) e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches containing synthetic nicotine are increasingly available. The term TFN may lead to reduced risk perceptions and increased use intentions relative to tobacco-derived nicotine products. Effectively communicating messages about TFN may depend on the public's ability to differentiate TFN from tobacco-derived nicotine. Our goals were to examine knowledge about the source(s) of nicotine in commonly used products and beliefs about what TFN means.In 2021 we surveyed 2464 young adults (18-25 years) online. Participants reported whether cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes, and nicotine pouches contain nicotine that comes from tobacco (always, sometimes, never). Correct responses were ""always"" for cigarettes/smokeless and ""sometimes"" for e-cigarettes/pouches. Participants also reported ""what [they] think TFN e-cigarettes/vapes contain"" (nicotine only; tobacco only; both nicotine and tobacco; neither nicotine nor tobacco). We ran unadjusted and adjusted models examining correct responses for nicotine source and TFN contents by past-month product use status (cigarettes, smokeless, e-cigarettes, pouches).Rates of correctly identifying nicotine source were modest (23.6% pouches-61.9% cigarettes). Except smokeless tobacco, using a given product was associated with identifying its nicotine source correctly in unadjusted models. Participants reported ""TFN"" means a product contains nicotine only (57.8%), tobacco only (10.8%), both (14.1%), or neither (17.1%).There is confusion about the source of nicotine in products, and many young adults incorrectly interpreted TFN to mean something other than containing nicotine but no tobacco. Regulatory efforts may be needed to restrict using the term ""tobacco-free nicotine"" on product labeling and advertising."
https://openalex.org/W4280499938,"The sheep is a valuable model to test whether hormone mechanisms that sexually differentiate the brain underlie the expression of sexual partner preferences because as many as 8% of rams prefer same-sex partners. Epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation act as mediators in the interaction between steroid hormones and the genome. Variations in the epigenome could be important in determining morphological or behavior differences among individuals of the same species. In this study, we explored DNA methylation differences in the hypothalamus of male oriented rams (MORs) and female oriented rams (FORs). We employed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to generate a genome-wide map of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptome. We found substantial DNA methylation and gene expression differences between FORs and MORs. Although none of the differentially methylated genes yielded significant functional terms directly associated with sex development, three differentially expressed genes were identified that have been associated previously with sexual behaviors. We hypothesize that these differences are involved in the phenotypic variation in ram sexual partner preferences, whereas future studies will have to find the specific mechanisms. Our results add an intriguing new dimension to sheep behavior that should be useful for further understanding epigenetic and transcriptomic involvement."
https://openalex.org/W4280599896,"The prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma is increasing rapidly worldwide, with environmental and lifestyle behaviors implicated as a reason. Epidemiological studies have shown that children who grow up on farms are at lower risk of developing childhood atopic disease, indicating the presence of a protective ""farm effect"". The Old Order Mennonite (OOM) community in Upstate New York have traditional, agrarian lifestyles, a low rate of atopic disease, and long periods of exclusive breastfeeding. Human milk proteins are heavily glycosylated, although there is a paucity of studies investigating the milk glycoproteome. In this study, we have used quantitative glycoproteomics to compare the N-glycoprotein profiles of 54 milk samples from Rochester urban/suburban and OOM mothers, two populations with different lifestyles, exposures, and risk of atopic disease. We also compared N-glycoprotein profiles according to the presence or absence of atopic disease in the mothers and, separately, the children. We identified 79 N-glycopeptides from 15 different proteins and found that proteins including immunoglobulin A1, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and lactotransferrin displayed significant glycan heterogeneity. We found that the abundances of 38 glycopeptides differed significantly between Rochester and OOM mothers and also identified four glycopeptides with significantly different abundances between all comparisons. These four glycopeptides may be associated with the development of atopic disease. The findings of this study suggest that the differential glycosylation of milk proteins could be linked to atopic disease."
https://openalex.org/W4280608268,"Background Acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH), as a blood-conservation technique, avoids the need for allogeneic blood transfusions. The historic practice of cold-storing type-O whole blood (WB) in military fields popularised the transfusion of refrigerated WB to treat acute bleeding. In this study, we compared the effects of room temperature (RT) and refrigeration up to 24 hours on the coagulation properties of WB for ANH. Materials and methods Each WB sample, collected from 12 male volunteers, was divided into two parts, one stored at RT and the other refrigerated for 24 hours. Complete blood counts (CBC), blood gas levels, and coagulation profiles were measured, and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measurements were performed at the initial collection time point (baseline) and at 6, 12, and 24 hours after initial collection. Results The preservation of platelet aggregation response induced by arachidonic acid and adenosine diphosphate was better in cold-stored WB compared to that in RT-stored WB. The platelet aggregation response induced by thrombin receptor-activating peptide 6 was significantly decreased in all samples after 24 hours of storage when compared with that at baseline. The lactate levels in WB stored at RT increased significantly after 6 hours of storage compared to that of cold-stored samples. There were no significant differences in CBC, coagulation parameters, and ROTEM variables between the cold-stored and RT-stored WB samples. Conclusion WB for ANH stored in the refrigerator showed better metabolic characteristics after 6 hours of storage and better aggregation response after 12 hours of storage than WB stored at RT."
https://openalex.org/W4280506181,"COVID-19 induced restrictions ordered by governments around the world have been an exogenous shock to the music industry, which we divide into two affected groups: 1) live music events and 2) recorded music. While the impact on live music events is rather obvious, it is unclear how the current pandemic is affecting the recorded music market. Hence, we study consumers’ pre- and post-pandemic shifts in consumer spending (in euros) and music consumption (in hours) across live music events, as well as the digital and physical submarkets of recorded music, in the world’s fourth largest music market, Germany. Relying on an online bi-annual panel capturing five waves between winter 2018/19 and winter 2020/21, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the continuous trend towards digitalization of the music landscape with premium streaming being the biggest beneficiary. However, total monthly consumer spending on music decreased by more than 45% compared to pre-pandemic, with live music events and physical sales being the most severely affected. Surprisingly, music consumption in hours also decreased during the lockdown even though consumers spent more time at home."

This paper investigates the impact of leadership styles on the innovative performance of female leaders in Pakistani Universities using a survey approach. This paper aimed to (a) discover a leadership style practiced by females and (b) discover the relationship between leadership style and the innovative performance of female leaders. Several female leaders, including faculty members, heads of departments, deans, coordinators, and directors, from public and private universities of Punjab (a province of Pakistan), were involved in this study. A sample of one hundred female leaders was selected using a multistage sampling method. In the first stage, five public and five private sector universities were selected through a simple random method. In the second stage, ten female leaders (five from each of the social science and basic science departments) were selected from each university through a purposive sampling method. The researchers adopted a reliable instrument to collect the survey data. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS (Version 26). Mean scores and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to discover the relationship between various variables. The investigation revealed that most female leaders practice the transactional leadership style in their universities. This study also discovered a moderate positive relationship between both leadership styles, namely transactional and transformational, and innovative performance. The study recommends that various workshops and seminars may be conducted to increase the practices of both leadership styles to enhance innovation in Pakistani Universities."
https://openalex.org/W4280540631,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and worldwide. Obesity—a worldwide public health concern—is a known risk factor for cancer including CRC. However, the mechanisms underlying the link between CRC and obesity have yet to be fully elucidated in part because of the molecular heterogeneity of CRC. We hypothesized that obesity modulates CRC in a consensus molecular subtype (CMS)-dependent manner. RNA-seq data and associated tumor and patient characteristics including body weight and height data for 232 patients were obtained from The Cancer Genomic Atlas–Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD) database. Tumor samples were classified into the four CMSs with the CMScaller R package; body mass index (BMI) was calculated and categorized as normal, overweight, and obese. We observed a significant difference in CMS categorization between BMI categories. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between obese and overweight samples and normal samples differed across the CMSs, and associated prognostic analyses indicated that the DEGs had differing associations on survival. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we found differences in Hallmark gene set enrichment between obese and overweight samples and normal samples across the CMSs. We constructed Protein-Protein Interaction networks and observed differences in obesity-regulated hub genes for each CMS. Finally, we analyzed and found differences in predicted drug sensitivity between obese and overweight samples and normal samples across the CMSs. Our findings support that obesity impacts the CRC tumor transcriptome in a CMS-specific manner. The possible associations reported here are preliminary and will require validation using in vitro and animal models to examine the CMS-dependence of the genes and pathways. Once validated the obesity-linked genes and pathways may represent new therapeutic targets to treat colon cancer in a CMS-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W4280548391,"Quantification of key gait parameters plays an important role in assessing gait deficits in clinical research. Gait parameter estimation using lower-limb kinematics (mainly leg velocity data) has shown promise but lacks validation for the amputee population. The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of lower-leg angular velocity to predict key gait events (toe-off and heel strike) and associated temporal parameters for the amputee population. An open data set of reflexive markers during treadmill walking from 10 subjects with unilateral transfemoral amputation was used. A rule-based dual-minima algorithm was developed to detect the landmarks in the shank velocity signal indicating toe-off and heel strike events. Four temporal gait parameters were also estimated (step time, stride time, stance and swing duration). These predictions were compared against the force platform data for 3000 walking cycles from 239 walking trials. Considerable accuracy was achieved for the HS event as well as for step and stride timings, with mean errors ranging from 0 to -13ms. The TO prediction exhibited a larger error with its mean ranging from 35-81ms. The algorithm consistently predicted the TO earlier than the actual event, resulting in prediction errors in stance and swing timings. Significant differences were found between the prediction for sound and prosthetic legs, with better TO accuracy on the prosthetic side. The prediction accuracy also appeared to improve with the subjects' mobility level (K-level). In conclusion, the leg velocity profile, coupled with the dual-minima algorithm, can predict temporal parameters for the transfemoral amputee population with varying degrees of accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4280555926,"Any form of long-term physical or mental impairment might negatively influence health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HRQoL, as an independent concept, covers a wide range of characteristics that includes physical, mental, social, and spiritual functions. People with disabilities are continuously exposed to multiple barriers that deteriorate their HRQoL. It also creates impairment in performing physical activities. However, experts opine regular physical exercise as an intervention to help disabled people. This research aims to investigate the association between disability and physical activity with HRQoL among the adult population in Australia.A retrospective cohort study.This study utilized the most recent 19 waves of data (2002-2020) from the nationally representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. Component summary scores such as physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS), and SF-6D utility scores were utilized to measure HRQoL. Random-effects GLS regression technique was fitted to estimate the association between disability and physical activity with HRQoL, after adjusting for a range of socio-demographic and health-related characteristics.Disability was negatively associated with the PCS (-5.95), MCS (-2.70) and SF-6D (-0.060) compared with non-disabled counterparts. However, respondents engaged in the recommended level of physical activity had substantial gain in PCS (b = 0.96), MCS (1.57), and SF-6D (0.021) scores. Besides, the results showed that performing the recommended level of physical activity in the presence of disability has lessen the negative effect of disability/ positive moderating effect of physical activity on PCS, MCS, and SF-6D scores by 1.84 points, 0.82 points, and 0.013 percentage points, respectively.This study found an inverse association between disability and HRQoL among Australian adults. However, physical activity was associated with improved HRQoL. Therefore, public health interventions, such as the orientation of physical activities, have a higher potential to dwindle the burden regarding HRQoL."

However, the effect of DAAs on kidney function remains debated.We analyzed electronic health record data for DAA-naive patients with chronic HCV infection engaged in HCV care at Boston Medical Center between 2014 and 2018. We compared the following hypothetical interventions using causal inference methods: 1) initiation of DAA and 2) no DAA initiation. For patients with normal kidney function at baseline (eGFR>90 ml/min/1.73m2), we estimated and compared the risk for reaching Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR≤60 ml/min/1.73m2) under each intervention. For patients with baseline CKD Stages 2-4 (15<eGFR≤90 ml/min/1.73m2), we estimated and compared the mean change in eGFR at 2 years after baseline under each intervention. We used the parametric g-formula to adjust our estimates for baseline and time-varying confounders.First, among 1390 patients with normal kidney function at baseline the estimated 2-year risk difference (95% CI) of reaching Stage 3 CKD for DAA initiation versus no DAA was -1% (-3, 2). Second, among 733 patients with CKD Stage 2-4 at baseline the estimated 2-year mean difference in change in eGFR for DAA initiation versus no DAA therapy was -3 ml/min/1.73m2 (-8, 2).We found no effect of DAA initiation on kidney function, independent of baseline renal status. This suggests that DAAs may not be nephrotoxic; furthermore, in the short-term, HCV clearance may not improve CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4280630853,"Introduction Early-life nutrition related experiences may fuel the emergence of obesity and type 2 diabetes in adolescence. The adoption of unhealthy dietary practices early in life is an indicator of adverse cardiometabolic health in adulthood. In-school adolescents’ dietary practices in Ghana have not been explored extensively despite increasing levels of obesity in adolescents. This study sought to examine dietary practices, socio-demographic disparities and the factors influencing dietary choices among in-school adolescents in Ghana. Methods A school-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in the Central region of Ghana in 2017. Using multistage sampling procedures, a total of 1,311 in-school adolescents were selected for the study. A modified version of the generic Global School Health Survey questionnaire on dietary practices was adapted and used for data collection. Percentage and frequency counts were used to report on the dietary practices, while Chi-square was used to determine socio-demographic variations in the dietary practices. Binary logistic regression was used to compute the influence of socio-demographic characteristics of respondents on the prevalence of healthy dietary behavior among in-school adolescents. Results The study revealed the prevalence of healthy dietary practices (49.9%, n = 654) among in-school adolescents in the region. The study also found increased frequency in consumption of soft drinks (93%, n = 1220) and toffees/sweets (90%, n = 1183) among in-school adolescents. However, low intake of breakfast (57%, n = 749) was observed among the adolescents. Significant disparities were observed in relation to gender, age, parental communication, academic performance and geographical location in the dietary practices of in-school adolescents. Furthermore, gender (OR = 1.36, P = 0.007), academic performance (OR = 2.19, P = 0.001) and geographical location (OR = 1.79, P = 0.001) were found to be significantly associated with dietary practices among in-school adolescents in the region. Conclusions There was low consumption of fruits and vegetables among adolescents. Fruits and vegetables consumption was associated with gender, academic performance and geographical location, and these may be a reflection that knowledge on healthy food choices and availability are important factors influencing dietary choices among in-school adolescents. School health policy interventions aimed at improving nutritional status among adolescents and enhanced fruit and vegetable consumption in the country should take into account the potential benefit of increasing availability of fruits and vegetables in schools, while reducing access to sweets and soft drinks in the schools and communities."
https://openalex.org/W4280635309,"Ecological research, just as all Earth System Sciences, is becoming increasingly data-rich. Tools for processing of ""big data"" are continuously developed to meet corresponding technical and logistical challenges. However, even at smaller scales, data sets may be challenging when best practices in data exploration, quality control and reproducibility are to be met. This can occur when conventional methods, such as generating and assessing diagnostic visualizations or tables, become unfeasible due to time and practicality constraints. Interactive processing can alleviate this issue, and is increasingly utilized to ensure that large data sets are diligently handled. However, recent interactive tools rarely enable data manipulation, may not generate reproducible outputs, or are typically data/domain-specific. We developed datacleanr, an interactive tool that facilitates best practices in data exploration, quality control (e.g., outlier assessment) and flexible processing for multiple tabular data types, including time series and georeferenced data. The package is open-source, and based on the R programming language. A key functionality of datacleanr is the ""reproducible recipe""-a translation of all interactive actions into R code, which can be integrated into existing analyses pipelines. This enables researchers experienced with script-based workflows to utilize the strengths of interactive processing without sacrificing their usual work style or functionalities from other (R) packages. We demonstrate the package's utility by addressing two common issues during data analyses, namely 1) identifying problematic structures and artefacts in hierarchically nested data, and 2) preventing excessive loss of data from 'coarse,' code-based filtering of time series. Ultimately, with datacleanr we aim to improve researchers' workflows and increase confidence in and reproducibility of their results."

We simulate different scenarios and initial conditions, and we find that higher abundancy and rate of deployment of low efficacy vaccines lowers the cumulative number of deaths in comparison to slower deployment of high efficacy vaccines. We also forecast that, at the same daily deployment rate, the earlier introduction of vaccination schemes with lower efficacy would also lower the number of deaths with respect to a delayed introduction of high efficacy vaccines, which can however, still achieve lower numbers of infections and better herd immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4229451670,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the anterograde surface transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) after their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are not well defined. In C. elegans, odorant response abnormal 4 has been implicated in the delivery of olfactory GPCRs to the cilia of chemosensory neurons. However, the function and regulation of its human homolog, C1orf27, in GPCR transport or in general membrane trafficking remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that siRNA-mediated knockdown of C1orf27 markedly impedes the ER-to-Golgi export kinetics of newly synthesized α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR), a prototypic GPCR, with the half-time being prolonged by more than 65%, in mammalian cells in retention using the selective hooks assays. Using modified bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays and ELISAs, we also show that C1orf27 knockdown significantly inhibits the surface transport of α2A-AR. Similarly, C1orf27 knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 markedly suppresses the ER-Golgi-surface transport of α2A-AR. In addition, we demonstrate that C1orf27 depletion attenuates the export of β2-AR and dopamine D2 receptor but not of epidermal growth factor receptor. We further show that C1orf27 physically associates with α2A-AR, specifically via its third intracellular loop and C terminus. Taken together, these data demonstrate an important role of C1orf27 in the trafficking of nascent GPCRs from the ER to the cell surface through the Golgi and provide novel insights into the regulation of the biosynthesis and anterograde transport of the GPCR family members."
https://openalex.org/W4229452395,"Protein Z (PZ)-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) is a plasma anticoagulant protein of the serpin superfamily, which is activated by its cofactor, PZ, to rapidly inhibit activated factor X (FXa) on a procoagulant membrane surface. ZPI is also activated by heparin to inhibit free FXa at a physiologically significant rate. Here, we show that heparin binding to ZPI antagonizes PZ binding to and activation of ZPI. Virtual docking of heparin to ZPI showed that a heparin-binding site near helix H close to the PZ-binding site as well as a previously mapped site in helix C was both favored. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the helix H and helix C sites demonstrated that both sites were critical for heparin activation. The binding of heparin chains 72 to 5-saccharides in length to ZPI was similarly effective in antagonizing PZ binding and in inducing tryptophan fluorescence changes in ZPI. Heparin binding to variant ZPIs with either the helix C sites or the helix H sites mutated showed that heparin interaction with the higher affinity helix C site most distant from the PZ-binding site was sufficient to induce these tryptophan fluorescence changes. Together, these findings suggest that heparin binding to a site on ZPI extending from helix C to helix H promotes ZPI inhibition of FXa and allosterically antagonizes PZ binding to ZPI through long-range conformational changes. Heparin antagonism of PZ binding to ZPI may serve to spare limiting PZ and allow PZ and heparin cofactors to target FXa at different sites of action."
https://openalex.org/W4280549888,"Background Quality indicators are used to quantify the quality of care. A large number of quality indicators makes assessment of overall quality difficult, time consuming and impractical. There is consequently an increasing interest for composite measures based on a combination of multiple indicators. Objective To examine the use of different approaches to construct composite measures of quality of care and to assess the use of methodological considerations and justifications. Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed and EMBASE databases (latest update 1 December 2020). For each publication, we extracted information on the weighting and aggregation methodology that had been used to construct composite indicator(s). Results A total of 2711 publications were identified of which 145 were included after a screening process. Opportunity scoring with equal weights was the most used approach (86/145, 59%) followed by all-or-none scoring (48/145, 33%). Other approaches regarding aggregation or weighting of individual indicators were used in 32 publications (22%). The rationale for selecting a specific type of composite measure was reported in 36 publications (25%), whereas 22 papers (15%) addressed limitations regarding the composite measure. Conclusion Opportunity scoring and all-or-none scoring are the most frequently used approaches when constructing composite measures of quality of care. The attention towards the rationale and limitations of the composite measures appears low. Discussion Considering the widespread use and the potential implications for decision-making of composite measures, a high level of transparency regarding the construction process of the composite and the functionality of the measures is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W4280566657,"Analysis of global sustainability is incomplete without an examination of the FEW nexus. Here, we modify the Generalized Global Sustainability Model (GGSM) to incorporate the global water system and project water stress on the global and regional levels. Five key water-consuming sectors considered here are agricultural, municipal, energy, industry, and livestock. The regions are created based on the continents, namely, Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. The sectoral water use intensities and geographical distribution of the water demand were parameterized using historical data. A more realistic and novel indicator is proposed to assess the water situation: net water stress. It considers the water whose utility can be harvested, within economic and technological considerations, rather than the total renewable water resources. Simulation results indicate that overall global water availability is adequate to support the rising water demand in the next century. However, regional heterogeneity of water availability leads to high water stress in Africa. Africa’s maximum net water stress is 140%, so the water demand is expected to be more than total exploitable water resources. Africa might soon cross the 100% threshold/breakeven in 2022. For a population explosion scenario, the intensity of the water crisis for Africa and Asia is expected to rise further, and the maximum net water stress would reach 149% and 97%, respectively. The water use efficiency improvement for the agricultural sector, which reduces the water demand by 30%, could help to delay this crisis significantly."
https://openalex.org/W4280651405,"Background and objective Gabapentinoids are the first-line drugs for neuropathic pain. These drugs are the substrate of organic cation transporter (OCTN1) for renal excretion and absorption across the intestinal epithelium. Gabapentinoids exhibit wide interindividual variability in daily dosage and therapeutic efficacy which makes titration regimens prolonged for optimal efficacy. The present study aimed to investigate the possible influence of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of OCTN1 on therapeutic efficacy and safety of gabapentinoids in neuropathic pain patients of the Pakistani population. Methods Four hundred and twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study. All participants were genotyped for OCTN1 rs1050152 and rs3792876 by PCR-RFLP method and followed up for eight weeks. The therapeutic outcomes of gabapentinoids, reduction in pain score, inadequate or complete lack of response, adverse events (AEs) in responders and discontinuation of treatment on account of AEs were recorded for all patients. Results There was no significant association of genotypes and alleles of both SNPs on the clinical response of gabapentinoids ( P ˃ 0.05). Similarly, significant differences were not found in the reduction of pain scores and AEs among different genotypes in the responders. The present study has reported the association of OCTN1 rs1050152 and rs3792876 polymorphisms with clinical outcomes of gabapentinoids for the first time in the real-world clinical setting. Conclusion Our results suggest a lack of influence of OCTN1 genetic variants in the determination of clinical response to gabapentinoids in patients with neuropathic pain in the Pakistani population. These findings signify the role of renal functions in predicting the interindividual variability to therapeutic responsiveness of gabapentinoids."
https://openalex.org/W4285740540,"Background World Health Organization guidelines for cervical cancer screening recommend HPV testing followed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for triage if HPV positive. In order to improve visual assessment and identification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and worse (CIN2+), providers may use visual aids such as digital cameras. Objectives To determine whether combined examination by naked-eye and digital VIA (D-VIA) and VILI (D-VILI) improves detection of CIN2+ as compared to the conventional evaluation. Materials and methods Women (30–49 years) living in Dschang (West Cameroon) were prospectively invited to a cervical cancer screening campaign. Primary HPV-based screening was followed by VIA/VILI and D-VIA/VILI if HPV-positive. Health care providers independently defined diagnosis (pathological or non-pathological) based on naked-eye VIA/VILI and D-VIA/VILI. Decision to treat was based on combined examination (VIA/VILI and D-VIA/VILI). Cervical biopsy and endocervical curettage were performed in all HPV-positive participants and considered as reference standard. Diagnostic performance of individual and combined naked-eye VIA/VILI and D-VIA/VILI was evaluated. A sample size of 1,500 women was calculated assuming a prevalence of 20% HPV positivity and 10% CIN2+ in HPV-positive women. Results Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study had to terminate prematurely. A total of 1,081 women with a median age of 40 (IQR 35.5–45) were recruited. HPV positivity was 17.4% (n = 188) and 26 (14.4%) had CIN2+. Naked-eye VIA and D-VIA sensitivities were 80.8% (95% CI 60.6–93.4) and 92.0% (95% CI 74.0–99.0), and specificities were 31.2% (95% CI 24–39.1) and 31.6% (95% CI 24.4–39.6), respectively. The combination of both methods yielded a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI 74.9–99.1) and specificity of 23.2% (95% CI 16.8–30.7). A trend towards improved sensitivity was observed, but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Addition of D-VIA/VILI to conventional naked-eye examination may be associated with improved CIN2+ identification. Further studies including a larger sample size are needed to confirm these results."
https://openalex.org/W4280523146,"Cirrhosis is a major risk factor for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, many surgically resected HCCs are presumably non-cirrhotic. The dynamic nature of chronic liver disease leads to periods of hepatic repair and fibrosis regression. We hypothesize that most resected HCCs, including those from non-cirrhotic patients, exhibit features of fibrosis regression in their background liver, suggesting previously more advanced liver disease. We reviewed the histology of 37 HCC resections performed between 2005-2020, including 30 from non-cirrhotic patients. The non-neoplastic liver was evaluated for features of liver disease and of the hepatic repair complex (HRC). CD34 immunohistochemistry was performed as a marker of sinusoidal capillarization. CD34 staining was evaluated manually and also by a digital image classifier algorithm. Overall, 28 cases (76%) had a high number of fibrosis regression and hepatic repair features (≥4 out of 8 features). Amongst the 30 non-cirrhotic patients, 21 (70%) showed a high number of repair features. Relative CD34 expression was increased in cases with a high number (≥4) of HRC features versus a low number (≤3) of features (p = 0.019). High HRC cases were more likely to exhibit nodular circumferential CD34 staining (p = 0.019). Our findings suggest that most resected HCC from non-cirrhotic patients display features of fibrosis regression in their background liver. Thus many, if not most, HCC patients who are ""non-cirrhotic"" may in fact have regressed cirrhosis. This finding reinforces that patients with regressed cirrhosis continue to be at high risk for HCC."

However, few studies have investigated whether prescriptions for common cold in Japan comply with domestic and international evidence.To determine whether prescriptions for common cold complied with domestic and international evidence.This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 22, 2020, and January 16, 2021. Patients with cold symptoms who visited the two dispensing pharmacies and met the eligibility criteria were interviewed.The pharmacists at each store and a physician classified the patients into two groups: the potentially inappropriate prescribing group and the appropriate prescribing group.Of the 150 selected patients, 14 were excluded and 136 were included in the analysis. Males accounted for 44.9% of the total study population, and the median patient age was 34 years (interquartile range [IQR], 27-42). The prevalence rates of potentially inappropriate prescriptions and appropriate prescriptions were 89.0% and 11.0%, respectively and the median drug costs were 602.0 yen (IQR, 479.7-839.2) [$5.2 (IQR, 4.2-7.3)] and 406.7 yen (IQR, 194.5-537.2) [$3.5 (IQR, 1.7-4.7)], respectively. The most common potentially inappropriate prescriptions were the prescription of oral cephem antibacterial agents to patients who did not have symptoms of bacterial infections (50.4%) and β2 stimulants to those who did not have respiratory symptoms due to underlying disease or history (33.9%).Approximately 90% of prescriptions for common cold symptoms in the area were potentially inappropriate. Our findings could contribute to the monitoring of the use of medicines for the treatment of common cold symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4280538263,"Pollinators and other insects are currently undergoing a massive decline. Several stressors are thought to be of importance in this decline, with those having close relationships to agricultural management and practice seemingly playing key roles. In the present study, we sampled Bombus lapidarius L. workers in grasslands differing in their management intensity and management regime across three different regions along a north-south gradient in Germany. We analyzed the bees with regard to (1) their cuticular hydrocarbon profile (because of its important role in communication in social insects) and amount of scent by using gas chromatography and (2) the size of each individual by using wing distances as a proxy for body size. Our analysis revealed changes related to land-use intensity and temperature in the cuticular scent profile of bumble bees. Decreasing body size and increasing total scent amount were explained by an interaction of land-use intensity and study region, but not by land-use intensity alone. Thus, land-use intensity and temperature influence intracolonial communication and size, both of which can have strong effects on foraging. Land management and climate are therefore probably detrimental for colony maintenance and the reproductive success of bumble bees."

A total of 94 participants who responded to all questions were included in the analysis. The results of this study indicate that clarity of the long-term solution enhances time-oriented attitude. In addition, the clarity of short-term solutions increases the reality of their goals. Furthermore, solution-building and, positive, and ideal levels of life were shown to increase after implementation, regardless of the condition.

https://openalex.org/W4280549675,"Swallowing impairments are a major complication of radiation treatment for oropharyngeal cancers, influencing oral intake and quality of life. The timing and functional consequences of radiation treatment on the swallowing process is not clearly understood. A rodent radiation injury model was used to investigate the onset of oral and pharyngeal dysfunctions in deglutition related to radiation treatment. This study tested the hypothesis that (Wall et al., 2013) alterations in normal biting, licking, and swallowing performance would be measurable following 64Gy of fractionated radiation to the submental muscles; and (Kotz et al., 2004) radiation will affect the animal’s general well-being as measured via burrowing activity. Seven rats received radiation using a clinical linear accelerator given in 8 fractions of 8Gy and another seven animals received sham anesthesia only treatment. Swallowing bolus transit/size was assessed via videofluoroscopy, tongue movement during drinking was measured via an electrical lick sensor, and biting was analyzed from acoustic recordings of a vermicelli pasta test. Burrowing activity was measured by the amount of gravel substrate displaced within a container. Measurements were taken at baseline, during treatment (1–4 weeks), and after completion of treatment (weeks 5 &amp; 6). Decreases in licking frequency and increases in inter-lick interval were observed 5- and 6-weeks post-treatment. Significant decreases in burrowing performance, swallowing frequency, and inter-swallow interval were observed starting the last week of treatment and continuing up to 2-weeks after completion. Results suggest that tongue dysfunction is one of the first treatment related feeding problems to present immediately after the completion of radiation to the submental muscles."
https://openalex.org/W4280552941,"HIV disproportionately affects Latinos versus Whites, with Latinos having higher rates of HIV. Additionally, many HIV-positive Latinos are unaware of their infection. Proyecto Protégete, an HIV prevention intervention developed for Latino men who have sex with men (MSM), used social and sexual networking mobile applications (apps) to recruit individuals for HIV testing and linkage to medical care and prevention services. This study occurred in Los Angeles County, California, USA from December 18, 2015 to April 22, 2017. The study's primary aim was to assess Proyecto Protégete's ability to successfully recruit Latino MSM involved in high-risk sexual activities. A secondary aim was to evaluate its capacity to promote HIV testing and linkage to HIV medical care and prevention services among this population by comparing it to two programs with similar samples. Comparisons using Fisher's Exact Test were conducted between Proyecto Protégete and the HIV testing program of the agency in which Proyecto Protégete was located and the County-funded HIV testing programs to compare the samples' rates of HIV-positive Latino MSM identified through HIV testing and linked to HIV medical care and prevention services. Participants were recruited through seven apps. In Proyecto Protégete, 9,573 individuals completed the screener, 4,657 were eligible, and 359 (7.7% of those eligible) enrolled. Among those enrolled, 79% reported anal sex without a condom in the previous twelve months; 51% reported anal sex under the influence of alcohol. The HIV positivity rates were as follows: Proyecto Protégete, 1.71%; the agency, 1.25% (p = .293, compared to Proyecto Protégete); and the County, 1.09% (p = .172, compared to Proyecto Protégete). The rates of those confirmed as new HIV-positives and linked to medical care within 30 days were as follows: Proyecto Protégete, 71.4%; the agency, 81.5% (p = .450, compared to Proyecto Protégete); and the County, 77.3% (p = .503, compared to Proyecto Protégete). Proyecto Protégete had a higher rate of linked referrals to prevention services than the agency's testing program (19.5% versus 8.3%, p < .001). Proyecto Protégete experienced successes in some areas but not in others. Future research should build on Proyecto Protégete's experiences to promote HIV-related services among Latino MSM."
https://openalex.org/W4280594891,"Molecular tumor boards (MTBs) require specialized activities to leverage genomic data for therapeutic decision-making. Currently, there are no defined standards for implementing, executing, and tracking the impact of MTBs. This study describes the development and validation of ACTE-MTB, a tool to evaluate the maturity of an organization’s MTB to identify specific areas that would benefit from process improvements and standardization. The ACTE-MTB maturity assessment tool is composed of 3 elements: 1) The ACTE-MTB maturity model; 2) a 59-question survey on MTB processes and challenges; and 3) a 5-level MTB maturity scoring algorithm. This tool was developed to measure MTB maturity in the categories of Access, Consultation, Technology, and Evidence (ACTE) and was tested on 20 MTBs spanning the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. Validity testing revealed that the average maturity score was 3.3 out of 5 (+/- 0.1; range 2.0–4.3) with MTBs in academic institutions showing significantly higher overall maturity levels than in non-academic institutions (3.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.2; P = .018). While maturity scores for academic institutions were higher for Consultation, Technology, and Evidence domains, the maturity score for the Access domain did not significantly differ between the two groups, highlighting a disconnect between MTB operations and the downstream impact on ability to access testing and/or therapies. To our knowledge, ACTE-MTB is the first tool of its kind to enable structured, maturity assessment of MTBs in a universally-applicable manner. In the process of establishing construct validity of this tool, opportunities for further investigation and improvements were identified that address the key functional areas of MTBs that would likely benefit from standardization and best practice recommendations. We believe a unified approach to assessment of MTB maturity will help to identify areas for improvement at both the organizational and system level."

Design and methods The authors followed the guidelines for scale translation, adaptation, and validation in cross-cultural healthcare research. After translation and back-translation, a series of pilot studies were conducted to assess comprehensibility. Subsequently, an expert panel established the content validity. Content validity was calculated using the content validity index (CVI). Finally, we verified the construct validity and calculated the test-retest reliability. Results The updated HWE-AT achieved sufficient comprehensibility after conducting the two pilot tests. Content validity was calculated using the scale-level CVI/average and all the items were 1.00. The content validity indices CFI and RMSEA were 0.918 and 0.082, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients for all dimensions ranged from 0.618 to 0.903, indicating acceptable test-retest reliability.

https://openalex.org/W4280617901,"Hyperglycaemia is known to induce endothelial dysfunction and changes in metabolic function, which could be implicated in diabetes-induced cardiovascular disease. To date, however, little is known about the impact of physiologically relevant concentrations of fructose on endothelial cells. A novel in vitro model was devised to establish the impact of substitution of a small proportion of glucose with an equal concentration (0.1 mM or 1 mM) of fructose on EA.hy926 endothelial cells during periodic carbohydrate ""meals"" superimposed on a normoglycaemic (5.5 mM) background. Parallel experiments were conducted using meals consisting of normoglycaemic glucose, intermediate glucose (12.5 mM) or profound hyperglycaemia (25 mM), each delivered for 2 h, with and without substituted fructose over 50 h. Outcome measures included nitrite as a surrogate marker of the mediator of healthy endothelial function, nitric oxide (NO), and a range of bioenergetic parameters using a metabolic analyser. Despite its relatively low proportion of carbohydrate load, intermittent fructose induced a substantial reduction (approximately 90%) in NO generation in cells treated with either concentration of fructose. Cell markers of oxidative stress were not altered by this treatment regimen. However, the cells experienced a marked increase in metabolic activity induced by fructose, irrespective of the glucose concentration delivered simultaneously in the ""meals"". Indeed, glucose alone failed to induce any metabolic impact in this model. Key metabolic findings were a 2-fold increase in basal oxygen consumption rate and a similar change in extracellular acidification rate-a marker of glycolysis. Non-metabolic oxygen consumption also increased substantially in cells exposed to fructose. There was no difference between results with 0.1 mM fructose and those with 1 mM fructose. Low, physiologically relevant concentrations of fructose, delivered in a pattern that mimics mealtime consumption, had a profound impact on endothelial function and bioenergetics in an in vitro cell model. The results suggest that endothelial cells are exquisitely sensitive to circulating fructose; the potential ensuing dysfunction could have major implications for development of atherosclerotic disease associated with high fructose consumption."
https://openalex.org/W4280633833,"Acute injury of the lung involves damage to the epithelium and its underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane (BM). How BMs contribute to injury resolution is poorly understood. Nephronectin (NPNT) is a high-affinity ligand for integrin α8β1 and, although first identified in the mouse kidney, is prominently expressed in the lung, where it localizes to BMs in the alveoli. To determine if NPNT plays a role in acute injury and inflammation of the lung, we developed a model for postnatal deletion of NPNT using mice with a floxed allele of Npnt in combination with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase expressed at the ROSA locus. Expression of NPNT was substantially reduced in lungs from tamoxifen-treated Cre+ animals. Cre+ mice and Cre- controls were given E. coli LPS by oropharyngeal aspiration to induce injury and inflammation. In Cre- lungs, although both Npnt and Itga8 (integrin α8) transcripts were downregulated at the peak of inflammation, NPNT protein was still detectable. While the onset of inflammation was similar for Cre+ and Cre-, NPNT-deficient lungs still had thickened alveolar septa and there were increased macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in the resolution phase. BALF from Cre+ lungs was more chemotactic for bone marrow-derived macrophages than Cre- in in vitro experiments, but there were no differences in the elaboration of chemokines in vivo. We speculate that absence of NPNT in BMs of the alveoli impairs or delays inflammatory and injury resolution in this model, but further studies are needed to establish the precise role of NPNT in tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W4280653677,"The association between upper respiratory tract microbial positivity and illness prognosis in children is unclear. This impedes clinical decision-making and means the utility of upper respiratory tract microbial point-of-care tests remains unknown. We investigated for relationships between pharyngeal microbes and symptom severity in children with suspected respiratory tract infection (RTI).Baseline characteristics and pharyngeal swabs were collected from 2,296 children presenting to 58 general practices in Bristol, UK with acute cough and suspected RTI between 2011-2013. Post-consultation, parents recorded the severity of six RTI symptoms on a 0-6 scale daily for ≤28 days. We used multivariable hurdle regression, adjusting for clinical characteristics, antibiotics and other microbes, to investigate associations between respiratory microbes and mean symptom severity on days 2-4 post-presentation.Overall, 1,317 (57%) children with complete baseline, microbiological and symptom data were included. Baseline characteristics were similar in included participants and those lacking microbiological data. At least one virus was detected in 869 (66%) children, and at least one bacterium in 783 (60%). Compared to children with no virus detected (mean symptom severity score 1.52), adjusted mean symptom severity was 0.26 points higher in those testing positive for at least one virus (95% CI 0.15 to 0.38, p<0.001); and was also higher in those with detected Influenza B (0.44, 0.15 to 0.72, p = 0.003); RSV (0.41, 0.20 to 0.60, p<0.001); and Influenza A (0.25, -0.01 to 0.51, p = 0.059). Children positive for Enterovirus had a lower adjusted mean symptom severity (-0.24, -0.43 to -0.05, p = 0.013).

https://openalex.org/W4280495220,"At present, there is less attention paid to the relationship between the frequency of travel and built environment, especially in households. In this paper, some of the determining factors in the frequency of daily cycling per household were explored based on the data from 2018 Daily Trip Survey in Xianyang, China. Then a two-level linear model was construct to identify the determining factors in the frequency of per capita daily cycling of household. According to the research results, 22.8% of the differences in the per capita cycling frequency of household are due to the differences between communities. In terms of community factors, the densities of road networks and educational facilities delivered a significantly positive impact on the per capita daily cycling frequency of family; on the contrary, the densities of medical facilities, intersections and POI delivered a significantly negative impact. Per capita cycling frequency varies considerably between households. For instance, the number of bicycles owned and the number of school-age children have a significantly positive impact on the per capita daily cycling frequency of family. However, car ownership, household income and occupation composition impose a significantly negative impact.

The purpose of the current study was to analyze the logic model (LM) of a SFD program in Canada that provides training for high school coaches in low socioeconomic communities in Montreal. Methods Key actors (i.e., coaches, program administrators, school directors, and sport coordinators; N = 22) were interviewed about their perceptions of the different components of the organization’s LM, namely the program’s context, the initial problem it addressed, its needs, objectives, input, output, and impacts. Findings Findings reveal the participants perceived the program as being successful by all key actors. Participants had similar understandings regarding the targeted problem and context, but their views differed regarding their understanding of the program’s activities. In addition, the key actors addressed issues of the structure and impacts of the SFD program and made suggestions to improve the program, including clarifying its objectives, reinforcing internal communication, and building stronger partnerships with the partner schools. Conclusions Findings from the present study provide recommendations to help improve the organization’s LM. In addition, these findings can help researchers and SFD administrators reinforce essential organizational program structures and activities for better management, evaluation, and improved impact on communities."

Intra-muscular-7α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) has been the preventive treatment of choice until the recent ""Prolong study"" that reported no benefit.To determine the benefit of (17P) treatment in preventing reoccurrence of sPTB, by evaluating two presenting symptoms of the first sPTB: premature contractions (PMC) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM).This retrospective study included 342 women with a previous singleton sPTB followed by a subsequent pregnancy. sPTB were either due to PMC (n = 145) or pPROM (n = 197). During the subsequent pregnancy, 90 (26.3%) patients received 250 mg 17P IM. Each presenting symptom-PMC or pPROM-was evaluated within itself comparing treated vs. untreated groups. Data were analyzed using t-test, Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was also performed.Patients treated with 17P in the subsequent pregnancy had delivered earlier in the previous pregnancy (33.4w vs. 35.3w in the PMC group, and 34.1w vs. 35.7w in the pPROM group, p<0.001). In the following pregnancy, they had higher admission rates due to suspected preterm labor (31.7% vs. 10.9% in the treated vs. untreated PMC group (p = 0.003) and 26.1% vs. 5.4% in the treated vs. untreated pPROM group (p<0.001). In both groups, but more prominently in the previous PMC group, treatment compared to non-treatment in the subsequent pregnancy significantly prolonged it (4.3w vs. 2.6w in the PMC group (p = 0.007), and 3.7w vs. 2.7w in the pPROM group (p = 0.018)). The presenting symptom of sPTB in the following pregnancy tended to recur in cases of another sPTB, with a significantly greater likelihood of repeating the sPTB mechanism in cases with PMC, regardless of receiving 17P (69% in the PMC cohort and 60% in the pPROM cohort, p<0.001).17P might delay preterm delivery in patients with a previous sPTB on an individual level (prolongation of the pregnancy for each patient compared to her previous delivery). Therefore, our results imply that 17P can decrease potential premature delivery complications for patients with a previous sPTB due to PMC or pPROM."

By following the birth of the sequence of human lincRNA BCRP3 (BCR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase 3 pseudogene) during primate evolution, we find diverse genes, long non-coding RNA and protein genes (and sequences that do not appear to encode a gene) that all stem from the 3’ end of the spacer, and all begin with a similar sequence. During primate evolution, part of the BCRP3 sequence initially formed in the Old World Monkeys and developed into different primate genes before evolving into the BCRP3 gene in humans. The gene developmental process consists of the initiation of DNA synthesis at spacer 3’ ends, addition of a complex of tandem transposable elements and the addition of a segment of another gene. The findings support the concept of the spacer sequence as a starting site for DNA synthesis that leads to formation of different genes with the addition of other sequences. These data suggest a new process of de novo gene birth."

Community pharmacists', as part of the primary care team, optimise care for people living with mental illness. This study aims to examine the factors that support or hinder the delivery of mental health services delivered in Australian community pharmacies and proposes ideas for improvement. A qualitative study was conducted comprising focus groups with community pharmacists and pharmacy staff across metropolitan, regional, and rural areas of New South Wales, Australia. Data were collected in eight focus groups between December 2020 and June 2021. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Thirty-three community pharmacists and pharmacy staff participated in an initial round of focus groups. Eleven community pharmacists and pharmacy staff participated in a second round of focus groups. Twenty-four factors that enable or hinder the delivery of mental health services in community pharmacy were identified. Participant's perception of a lack of recognition and integration of community pharmacy within primary care were identified as major barriers, in addition to consumers' stigma and lack of awareness regarding service offering. Suggestions for improvement to mental health care delivery in community pharmacy included standardised practice through the use of protocols, remuneration and public awareness. A framework detailing the factors moderating pharmacists, pharmacy staff and consumers' empowerment in mental health care delivery in community pharmacy is proposed. This study has highlighted that policy and funding support for mental health services is needed that complement and expand integrated models, promote access to services led by or are conducted in collaboration with pharmacists and recognise the professional contribution and competencies of community pharmacists in mental health care. The framework proposed may be a step to strengthening mental health support delivered in community pharmacies."
https://openalex.org/W4280546999,"Elucidation of the static states and dynamic behavior of oxygen and nitrogen dissolved in water is one of the most important issues in the life sciences. In the present study, experimental trials and theoretical calculations were performed based on the hypothesis that the dissolution of gas molecules in water is related to excitation by the Earth’s magnetic field. Using quantum theories such as those used to describe electro magnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance, this study investigated the states of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen dissolved in water. The results indicate that the Earth’s magnetic field is involved in the bonding and dissociation of molecules at the gas-liquid interface. These calculations assessed the effect of a field strength of 1.0 x 10 −4 T and reproduced the influences of temperature changes on dissolved gas concentrations. Molecular interactions caused by electromagnetic properties and the external geomagnetic field were found to affect intermolar bonding associated with water cluster structures. It is concluded that the binding between molecules typically attributed to Coulomb coupling by magnetic charge and van der Waals forces results from excitation in the Earth’s magnetic field."

In Cambodia, mobility measurements have been limited to questionnaires, which are of limited efficacy in rural environments. In this study, we used GPS tracking to measure the daily mobility of Cambodian forest goers, a population at high risk of malaria, and developed a workflow adapted to local constraints to produce an optimal dataset representative of the participants' mobility. We provide a detailed assessment of the GPS tracking and analysis of the data, and highlight the associated difficulties to facilitate the implementation of similar studies in the future."

While cranes have the potential to influence soil biogeochemical processes via dropping, foraging, and walking, few studies have investigated ecological roles of migrating birds in the new habitat. Here, we explored how cranes alter resource landscape (the amount and quality of carbon) and microbial community in soil. We set up control (fenced, no crane access) and treatment (free crane activities) plots (n = 6, respectively) in a rice paddy, and collected soils at 0-15 cm three months after the crane migration. Soils were tested for total carbon, total nitrogen, water extractable organic carbon, and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, along with microbial parameters (biomass, respiration, community composition). The wintering crane activity significantly increased total carbon and nitrogen contents, but decreased the ratio of CH (aliphatic) to COO (carboxylic) in soil. Also, both microbial biomass and respiration was greater in soils under crane activities. Bacterial and fungal community composition differed with or without crane activities, with treatment soils harboring more diverse microbial communities. Our results demonstrate that crane migration created a distinct system with altered resource landscape and microbial community, highlighting beneficial effects of migratory cranes on the soil biogeochemical processes in rice paddies. This study may help encourage more farmers, local governments, and the public to participate in crane conservation campaigns targeted at rice fields."
https://openalex.org/W4280602606,"Introduction Postural control of the trunk is critical for performance of everyday activities and the health of spinal tissues. Although some studies report that individuals with low back pain (LBP) have poorer/compromised postural control than pain-free individuals when sitting on an unstable surface, others do not. Analyses commonly lack the statistical power to evaluate the relevance of features that could impact the performance of postural control, such as sex, age, anthropometrics, pain intensity or disability. This paper outlines a protocol for a systematic review with an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis that aims to synthesise the evidence and evaluate differences of postural control measures between individuals with and without LBP during unstable sitting. Methods and analysis A systematic review with IPD meta-analysis will be conducted according to PRISMA-IPD guidelines. To identify relevant studies, electronic databases and the reference lists of included articles will be screened. Unstable seat movements are derived from centre of pressure (CoP) data using a force plate or angle of the seat using motion systems/sensors. The comprehensiveness of reporting and methodological quality of included studies will be assessed. Analysis will involve a descriptive analysis to synthesise the findings of all included studies and a quantitative synthesis using two-stage IPD meta-analysis of studies that include both individuals with and without LBP for which IPD set can be obtained from authors. Analyses will include consideration of confounding variables. Ethics Exemption from ethical approval was obtained for this review (University of Queensland, ID: 2019003026).

https://openalex.org/W4280627626,"Sweden as many other countries uses video consultation to increase patients’ access to primary healthcare services particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Working in digital care settings and using new technologies, in this case video consultations, require learning new skills and adoption to new workflow. The aim of this study is to explore nurses’ experience of using video consultation in a digital care setting and its impact on their workflow and communication. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were carried out with registered nurses recruited from a private digital healthcare provider. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using an abductive approach. Nurses’ workflow was modeled, and several categories and subcategories were identified: nurses’ workflow (efficiency, flexibility, and information accessibility); communication (interaction with patients and interprofessional communication); user experience (change and development of the platform, challenges, and combining digital and physical care). Even though providing online care has its limitations, the nurses were positive towards using video consultations."
https://openalex.org/W4280633950,"Many real applications such as businesses and health generate large categorical datasets with uncertainty. A fundamental task is to efficiently discover hidden and non-trivial patterns from such large uncertain categorical datasets. Since the exact value of an attribute is often unknown in uncertain categorical datasets, conventional clustering analysis algorithms do not provide a suitable means for dealing with categorical data, uncertainty, and stability.The ability of decision making in the presence of vagueness and uncertainty in data can be handled using Rough Set Theory. Though, recent categorical clustering techniques based on Rough Set Theory help but they suffer from low accuracy, high computational complexity, and generalizability especially on data sets where they sometimes fail or hardly select their best clustering attribute.The main objective of this research is to propose a new information theoretic based Rough Purity Approach (RPA). Another objective of this work is to handle the problems of traditional Rough Set Theory based categorical clustering techniques. Hence, the ultimate goal is to cluster uncertain categorical datasets efficiently in terms of the performance, generalizability and computational complexity.The RPA takes into consideration information-theoretic attribute purity of the categorical-valued information systems. Several extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of RPA using a real Supplier Base Management (SBM) and six benchmark UCI datasets. The proposed RPA is also compared with several recent categorical data clustering techniques.The experimental results show that RPA outperforms the baseline algorithms. The significant percentage improvement with respect to time (66.70%), iterations (83.13%), purity (10.53%), entropy (14%), and accuracy (12.15%) as well as Rough Accuracy of clusters show that RPA is suitable for practical usage.We conclude that as compared to other techniques, the attribute purity of categorical-valued information systems can better cluster the data. Hence, RPA technique can be recommended for large scale clustering in multiple domains and its performance can be enhanced for further research."
https://openalex.org/W4280645511,"Postnatal home visit has the potential to improve maternal and newborn health, but it remains as a missed opportunity in many low-and middle-income countries. This study examines the effect of health extension worker administered postnatal card combined with health facility strengthening intervention on postnatal home visit coverage, newborn care practices, and knowledge of newborn danger signs in rural Ethiopia.We employed quasi-experimental design using controlled before-and-after study in intervention and comparison districts of rural Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Training of health extension workers (HEWs) on postnatal home visit (PNHV), training of healthcare providers on maternal and newborn care, and capacity building of healthcare authorities on leadership, management and governance together with health system strengthening were the implemented interventions. Baseline (n = 705) and end line (n = 980) data were collected from mothers who delivered a year before the commencement of the actual data collection in the respective surveys. We used difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to assess the effect of the intervention on PNHV coverage, essential newborn care practices and maternal knowledge of newborn danger signs.A total of 1685 (100%) mothers participated in this study. In all districts, more than 1/3rd of the mothers 633(37.57%) were in the age of 30-39 years. The difference-in-differences estimator showed an average of 23.5% increase in coverage of PNHVs within three days (DiD, p<0.001) and the provision of most postnatal contents significantly increased in the intervention district in the end line survey. The knowledge of at least three danger signs increased by 13.6% (p = 0.012).The DiD estimator showed an average of 27.6% increase to check the mothers for heavy bleeding (DiD, p = 0.011). This study also revealed that the checking of maternal blood pressure increased from 5.8% to 11.8% in the comparison districts and from 9.4% to 93.3% in the intervention district. The difference-in-differences estimator result showed a 9% difference in clean cord care practices among the participants (p = 0.025), 12.2% in skin to skin care (p = 0.022), and borderline significant increase in early initiation of breastfeeding (10.5%, p = 0.051).We conclude that the intervention package was effective in improving the coverage of PNHV, increase in knowledge of newborn danger sign and essential newborn care practices. Hence, further strengthening the linkages between health facilities and community is imperative to improve the coverage of essential lifesaving maternal and newborn care services by HEWs at home."
