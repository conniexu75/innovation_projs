https://openalex.org/W2124641083,"Out of Africa Kidney disease is more common in African Americans than in Americans of European descent, and genetics is likely to be a major contributing factor. Genovese et al. (p. 841 , published online 15 July) now show that African Americans who carry specific sequence variants in a gene on chromosome 22 encoding apolipoprotein L-1 (APOL1) have an increased risk of developing hypertension-attributed end-stage kidney disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. These variants are absent from European chromosomes. Among the functions ascribed to APOL1 is the ability to lyse and kill trypanosomes. Intriguingly, APOL1 derived from the risk alleles, but not the “wild-type” allele, killed Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense , which causes African sleeping sickness."

Under standard cell culture conditions in the laboratory, muscle stem cells fail to proliferate efficiently and lose their regenerative capacity. Gilbert et al. (p. 1078 , published online 15 July; see the Perspective by Bhatia ) built an in vitro–culture system that resembles the physical characteristics in which muscle stem cells normally reside: a squishy elastic bed (rather than the hard slab of a plastic culture flask). Laminin tethered to hydrogels was used to generate substrates of varying elasticity. When cultured on these substrates, muscle stem cells remained undifferentiated and were able to support muscle regeneration when transplanted back into mice."

Unfortunately, this selectivity has evolved for cellular purposes and may not promote the sorts of reactions chemists are seeking to enhance (see the Perspective by Lutz ). Siegel et al. (p. 309 ) now describe the design of enzymes that catalyze the bimolecular Diels-Alder reaction, a carbon-carbon bond formation reaction that is central to organic synthesis but unknown in natural metabolism. The enzymes display high stereoselectivity and substrate specificity, and an x-ray structure of the most active enzyme confirms that the structure matches the design. Savile et al. (p. 305 , published online 17 June) applied a directed evolution approach to modify an existing transaminase enzyme so that it recognized a complex ketone in place of its smaller native substrate, and could tolerate the high temperature and organic cosolvent necessary to dissolve this ketone. This biocatalytic reaction improved the production efficiency of a drug that treats diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2032154466,"Astrocytes provide structural and metabolic support for neuronal networks, but direct evidence demonstrating their active role in complex behaviors is limited. Central respiratory chemosensitivity is an essential mechanism that, via regulation of breathing, maintains constant levels of blood and brain pH and partial pressure of CO2. We found that astrocytes of the brainstem chemoreceptor areas are highly chemosensitive. They responded to physiological decreases in pH with vigorous elevations in intracellular Ca2+ and release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP propagated astrocytic Ca2+ excitation, activated chemoreceptor neurons, and induced adaptive increases in breathing. Mimicking pH-evoked Ca2+ responses by means of optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes expressing channelrhodopsin-2 activated chemoreceptor neurons via an ATP-dependent mechanism and triggered robust respiratory responses in vivo. This demonstrates a potentially crucial role for brain glial cells in mediating a fundamental physiological reflex."
https://openalex.org/W2073794770,"Cosmic Fullerenes Since the discovery of the buckminsterfullerene C 60 in laboratory experiments, it has been speculated that fullerenes could form abundantly in carbon-rich evolved stars and, because of their stability, survive the harsh radiation field in the interstellar medium as a gas-phase species. Cami et al. (p. 1180 ; published online 22 July; see the Perspective by Ehrenfreund and Foing ) have detected large amounts of fullerenes in a peculiar planetary nebula with an extremely hydrogen-poor dust formation zone. Contrary to expectations, the fullerenes are not gaseous; they are cool, are in a neutral charge state, and represent about 1.5% of the available carbon."
https://openalex.org/W2048469514,"The Hall effect usually occurs when the Lorentz force acts on a charge current in a conductor in the presence of perpendicular magnetic field. On the other hand, neutral quasi-particles such as phonons and spins can carry heat current and potentially show the Hall effect without resorting to the Lorentz force. We report experimental evidence for the anomalous thermal Hall effect caused by spin excitations (magnons) in an insulating ferromagnet with a pyrochlore lattice structure. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the propagation of the spin wave is influenced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit interaction, which plays the role of the vector potential as in the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in metallic ferromagnets."
https://openalex.org/W2053456734,"Red Sea Coral Decline Large, rapid sea surface temperature rises of 1°C or greater typically cause bleaching of corals. Cantin et al. (p. 322 ) show that smaller temperature increases also have detrimental effects on corals, dramatically reducing their rates of calcification and skeletal extension. Corals in the Red Sea, where water temperatures have risen by 0.4 to 1°C since the mid-1970s, have declined in skeletal extension by about 30%, and decreased in calcification rates by around 18% since 1998. This finding suggests that we may see an end to coral growth in the Red Sea this century."
https://openalex.org/W1967251674,"Regulation of Energy Homeostasis The mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase complex that regulates cellular energy homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which AMPK mediates transcriptional responses to metabolic perturbations has been unclear. Bungard et al. (p. 1201 ; published online 17 August; see the Perspective by Hardie ) have found that AMPK activated transcription directly on chromatin, combined with phosphorylation of histone H2B at Serine-36. Both signals colocalized at genes regulated in the pathway, and both the enzyme and phosphorylation were required for the direct transcription of stress-responsive genes."
https://openalex.org/W2009165647,"Toward a General Flu Vaccination Current seasonal influenza virus vaccines are targeted against specific viral strains and do not provide broad, durable protection. Seasonal influenza vaccines induce protective antibody responses against regions of viral hemagglutinin (HA) that rapidly mutate so that very soon, the virus becomes resistant to vaccination. Conserved regions of HA also exist, and a major goal of influenza vaccine development is to design a vaccine that elicits antibodies against the conserved regions so that protection against a wide range of viral strains is achieved. Wei et al. (p. 1060 , published online 15 July; see the Perspective by Doms ) show that a combined HA DNA prime, followed by boosting with a seasonal vaccine, elicits broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates, which were protective in mice and ferrets against heterologous influenza challenge. The neutralizing antibodies were directed against the conserved HA stem region, which indicates the possibility that a more broadly protective vaccine against influenza could be developed."
https://openalex.org/W2019709612,"Sulfur Signal Dinner Phytoplankton produces large amounts of the compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which can be transformed into the gas dimethylsulfide and emitted into the atmosphere in sufficient quantities to affect cloud formation. The functional role of DMSP is somewhat unclear, but it is degraded by marine bacteria as a source of reduced carbon and sulfur. It also acts as a foraging cue for a variety of aquatic animals ranging from copepods to marine mammals. Now, Seymour et al. (p. 342 ) have developed a microfluidic device to observe the behavior of motile microorganisms in response to pulses of DMSP. Contrary to accepted thought, these compounds appear primarily to play a defensive role—for most motile organisms, they are strongly attractive and act as an important infochemical throughout the marine food web."
https://openalex.org/W2097755834,"Legionella Hijacks Rab Legionella pneumophila can infect eukaryotic cells and takes up residence within intracellular vacuoles, where it multiplies. In order to produce and maintain this intracellular niche, the pathogen must manipulate membrane trafficking within the host cell. Now, Müller et al. (p. 946 , published online 22 July) describe the ability of Legionella pneumophila to manipulate vesicular trafficking by the covalent modification of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab1, which normally regulates the transport of endoplasmic reticulum–derived vesicles in eukaryotic cells. The Legionella protein DrrA is released into the cytosol of infected cells, where it specifically AMPylates a tyrosine residue of one of the regulating regions of Rab1. The modification renders the Rab protein inaccessible to GTPase-activating proteins and thus locks it in its active guanosine triphosphate–bound state."
https://openalex.org/W2110004994,"Transcription On and sORF Eukaryotic transcriptomes include numerous RNAs that are presumed noncoding because they include only short open reading frames (sORFs). However, some sORF RNAs actually produce small peptides with unknown activity. Now Kondo et al. (p. 336 ; see the Perspective by Rosenberg ) report the function of peptides containing 11 to 32 amino acids that are encoded by the gene polished-rice ( pri ). pri triggers N-terminal truncation of the transcription factor Shavenbaby that controls epidermal differentiation in Drosophila . Following pri expression, Shavenbaby is converted from a transcriptional repressor to an activator. Thus, sORF peptides can control transcriptional programs during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2087066667,"Continued progress in the electronics industry depends on downsizing, to a few micrometers, the wire bonds required for wiring integrated chips into circuit boards. We developed an electrodeposition method that exploits the thermodynamic stability of a microscale or nanoscale liquid meniscus to ""write"" pure copper and platinum three-dimensional structures of designed shapes and sizes in an ambient air environment. We demonstrated an automated wire-bonding process that enabled wire diameters of less than 1 micrometer and bond sizes of less than 3 micrometers, with a breakdown current density of more than 10(11) amperes per square meter for the wire bonds. The technology was used to fabricate high-density and high-quality interconnects, as well as complex three-dimensional microscale and even nanoscale metallic structures."

For instance, companies may offer to contribute some portion of their revenues to charitable causes as an inducement to customers, but it is generally assumed that these pass-throughs directly diminish the corporate bottom line. Gneezy et al. (p. 325 ; see the Perspective by DellaVigna ) have designed a framework that encourages both customers and companies to contribute toward social goods, and, in field tests, this design increased charitable contributions as well as corporate revenues."
https://openalex.org/W2125905259,"It has been predicted that the Arctic Ocean will sequester much greater amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere as a result of sea ice melt and increasing primary productivity. However, this prediction was made on the basis of observations from either highly productive ocean margins or ice-covered basins before the recent major ice retreat. We report here a high-resolution survey of sea-surface CO2 concentration across the Canada Basin, showing a great increase relative to earlier observations. Rapid CO2 invasion from the atmosphere and low biological CO2 drawdown are the main causes for the higher CO2, which also acts as a barrier to further CO2 invasion. Contrary to the current view, we predict that the Arctic Ocean basin will not become a large atmospheric CO2 sink under ice-free conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2045714553,"Limitations of current steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists have stimulated the search for a new generation of molecules. We screened for novel nonsteroidal compounds and identified MR antagonists derived from the chemical class of dihydropyridines. Chemical optimization resulted in BR-4628, which displays high in vitro and in vivo MR potency as well as selectivity with respect to the other steroid hormone receptors and the L-type calcium channel. Biochemical studies demonstrated that BR-4628 forms complexes with MR that do not promote the recruitment of transcriptional co-regulators. Docking experiments, using the crystal structure of the MR ligand-binding domain in an agonist conformation, revealed that BR-4628 accommodates in the MR ligand-binding cavity differently in comparison with the classical steroidal MR antagonists. An alanine scanning mutagenesis approach, based on BR-4628 docking, allowed identifying its anchoring mode within the ligand-binding cavity. Altogether, we propose that BR-4628 is a bulky antagonist that inactivates MR through a passive mechanism. It represents the prototype of a new class of MR antagonists.

The first and best documented effects of aldosterone are those observed on the kidney distal tubule. In this epithelial tissue, aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, increasing the blood pressure by expanding the extracellular volume (1Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

These aldosterone effects are mediated by the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), 4The abbreviations used are: MRmineralocorticoid receptorARandrogen receptorGRglucocorticoid receptorPRprogesterone receptorTIF2transcriptional intermediary factor 2NCoRnuclear receptor co-repressor 1LBDligand-binding domainDHPdihydropyridine. a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily (3Evans R.M.

In addition to its renal effects, aldosterone acts in nonepithelial tissues such as brain, vasculature, and heart, in which it has deleterious effects. In the cardiovascular system, aldosterone provokes inflammation and fibrosis, combined with ventricular hypertrophy (9Delcayre C. Silvestre J.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whether these adverse effects are mediated by aldosterone and/or cortisol at conditions of inappropriate salt or redox status has not yet been established (10Funder J.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Spironolactone and eplerenone, both of which display structural elements of progesterone, have been developed as MR antagonists (11Kagawa C.M. Cella J.A. Van Arman C.G.

These molecules inhibit aldosterone binding to MR and render it transcriptionally inactive. As a consequence, they prevent the aldosterone-induced sodium reabsorption and are effective in decreasing blood pressure (15Jeunemaitre X. Chatellier G. Kreft-Jais C. Charru A. DeVries C.

Drugs. 2005; 5: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Remarkably, these molecules have been shown to reduce the deleterious aldosterone effects in the cardiovascular system. In the randomized aldactone evaluation study (RALES) and eplerenone post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study (EPHESUS), spironolactone and eplerenone, respectively, significantly reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure (17Pitt B.

Despite their renal and cardiac benefits, these two steroidal spirolactones suffer from substantial drawbacks that limit their clinical use. Although spironolactone is highly potent, it lacks selectivity toward other members of the oxo-steroid receptor family. Indeed, its prolonged use is associated with sexual side effects that are related to its progestogenic and antiandrogenic activities (19Corvol P. Mahoudeau J.A. Valcke J.C. Ménard J. Bricaire H. Nouv. Presse Med. 1976; 5: 691-694PubMed Google Scholar). Eplerenone is characterized by an improved selectivity as compared with spironolactone. However, eplerenone has a low affinity for MR (20Garthwaite S.M. McMahon E.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 217: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and is less efficient than spironolactone with respect to blood pressure lowering in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (21Weinberger M.H. Roniker B. Krause S.L. Weiss R.J. Am. J. Hypertens. 2002; 15: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In addition, both steroidal molecules are not only unable to block the constitutive activity of the mutant MRS810L, a gain-of function mutation that is linked clinically to early onset hypertension in men and gestational hypertension in women, but paradoxically activate this mutant receptor (8Geller D.S. Farhi A. Pinkerton N. Fradley M. Moritz M. Spitzer A. Meinke G. Tsai F.T. Sigler P.B. Lifton R.P. Science. 2000; 289: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 22Hultman M.L.

Therefore, the use of spirolactones to treat hypertensive patients carrying the S810L mutation is inappropriate. The known disadvantages of spirolactones stimulated research for new, selective MR antagonists (23Kolkhof P. Bärfacker L. Hillisch A. Haning H. Schäfer S. Ottow E. Weinmann H. Nuclear Receptors as Drug Targets. Wiley-VCH Verlag, Berlin2008: 409-429Google Scholar). An ultrahigh throughput screening revealed substituted dihydropyridines (DHP) as novel nonsteroidal MR antagonists. Chemical optimization of these DHP lead compounds resulted in BR-4628. Here we present the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of BR-4628, together with studies that highlight the binding mode on MR and the molecular reasons for the distinct antagonism. BR-4628 and [3H]BR-4628 were synthesized as described in the supplemental data. Aldosterone and spironolactone were purchased from Sigma. Eplerenone was purified from commercially available tablets (Inspra®). Nitrendipine was obtained by Hantzsch dihydropyridine synthesis using classical published methods (24Meyer H. Bossert F. Wehinger E. Stoepel K. Vater W. Arzneimittelforschung. 1981; 31: 407-409PubMed Google Scholar). 18-Oxo-18-vinylprogesterone (18-vinyl-4-pregnen-3,18,20-trione) was a gift from A.

The pchMRS810A, pchMRS810M, and pchMRA773G/S810M coding for MRS810A, MRS810M, and MRA773G/S810M, respectively, were obtained from pchMR using the site-directed mutagenesis procedure (QuikChange; Agilent, Massy, France). The plasmid pFC31Luc contains the murine mammary tumor virus promoter that drives the luciferase gene (29Gouilleux F. Sola B. Couette B. Richard-Foy H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1563-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The coding sequences of the respective LBDs of MR, MRS810L, AR, GR, and PR have been PCR-amplified and fused to the coding sequence of the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (amino acids 1–147) under the control of a CMV promoter, leading to the expression plasmids pGAL4-MR, pGAL4-MRS810L, pGAL4-GR, pGAL4-AR, and pGAL4-PR. The pVPMR (kindly provided by Dr. G. Pinon) codes for the fusion protein between the VP16 activating domain and the full-length MR. The pGALTIF2 and pGALNcoR vectors, which code for fusion protein between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the nuclear activating domain of TIF2 and NCoR, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. P. Balaguer. The pG5luc (kindly provided by Prof. P. Fuller) contains the luciferase gene driven by a GAL4-responsive promoter. The pGAL4-MR, pGAL4-MRS810L, pGAL4-GR, pGAL4-AR, and pGAL4-PR vectors were transfected into CHO-K1 cells stably expressing a thymidine kinase promoter construct containing five GAL4-binding elements in front of the firefly luciferase gene. For each receptor a stable cell line has been generated by several rounds of limiting dilutions. The stable MR, MRS810L, GR, AR, and PR cell lines were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium with GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal calf serum, 20 mm HEPES, 1.4 mm sodium pyruvate, 1.8 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mg/ml Geneticin. Subconfluent cultures were passaged using Accutase. All of the cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The cells were seeded 24 h before testing in Optimem medium containing 2.5% FCS (v/v), 2 mm glutamine, and 10 mm HEPES in 96- or 384-well plates. On the test day compounds were given in eight dilutions to the cells followed by the relevant EC50 concentration of each agonist. After an incubation time of 5–6 h, luciferase activity was determined using a luminescence detecting video camera system. The GraphPad Prism software (version 3.02; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for curve fitting and calculation of the IC50 and EC50 values. The IC50 and EC50 values from the luciferase assay were determined in at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The IC50 and EC50 values are given as the means ± S.E. HEK-293T cells were cultured and transfected with the expression vectors pchMR, pchMRN770A, pchMRA773G, pchMRQ776A, pchMRS810A, pchMRS810M, pchMRR817A, pchMRM852A, pchMRC942A, pchMRT945A, or pchMRA773G/S810M, the reporter vector pFC31Luc, and the pcβgal vector according to the method described previously (30Huyet J.

The IC50 values were determined from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The IC50 values are given as the means ± S.E. The EC50 values were calculated from one experiment performed in triplicate. HEK 293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of pVPMR, pGALTIF2, or pGALNcoR; 5 μg of pg5luc; and 1 μg of pcβgal. 24 h after transfection, aldosterone (10−10 to 10−8 m) or spironolactone or BR-4628 (10−8 to 10−6 m) were added. Parallel experiments were performed with 10−9 m aldosterone in the presence of 10−8 to 10−6 m spironolactone or BR-4628. After 16 h, the cell extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase as reported previously (30Huyet J. Pinon G.M. Fay M.R. Fagart J. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Male Wistar rats (Charles River Germany, ∼300 g) were used in the experiment. They were housed with free access to food and water and maintained on a light-dark cycle at 22–24 °C. All of the animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and German legislation on animal welfare. A similar protocol as published previously (31Brandish P.E. Chen H. Szczerba P. Hershey J.C. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2008; 57: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, after 7 days of acclimatization, male Wistar rats were placed on a low salt diet containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium chloride (S0602-E081; ssniff Spezialdiäten GmbH, Soest, Germany) for 72 h. BR-4628 and spironolactone were administered in 1 ml/kg of vehicle (PEG400, 85.8%; glycerine, 5.3%, water, 8.9%, v/v/v) by oral gavage, and the animals (n = 8/group) were placed in metabolic cages (Tecniplast Deutschland GmbH, Hohenpeissenberg, Germany) for 8 h on water ad libitum. The urine samples were analyzed for volume as well as sodium and potassium concentrations by flame spectroscopy. The human MR was expressed in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as described previously (27Fagart J. Seguin C. Pinon G.M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Mol.

The lysates containing the in vitro expressed MR were diluted 4-fold with TEGWM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium tungstate, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (v/v), pH 7.4) and incubated with 0.3–300 nm [3H]BR-4628 for 4 h at 4 °C. Bound and unbound ligands were separated by the dextran-charcoal method (27Fagart J. Seguin C. Pinon G.M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The change in bound/unbound as a function of the amount bound was analyzed, and the Kd value was calculated as described previously (32Claire M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Michaud A. Corvol P. Venot A. Roth-Meyer C. Boisvieux J.F. Mallet A. FEBS Lett. 1978; 88: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A parallel experiment was performed with an untranslated rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The lysates containing the in vitro expressed MR were 4-fold diluted with TEGWM buffer and incubated with 10 nm [3H]BR-4628 for 4 h at 4 °C. One half of the labeled lysate was kept at 4 °C and was used to determine the stability of the [3H]BR-4628·MR complexes, and the other half was incubated with 1 μm BR-4628 for various periods. Bound and free ligands were separated using charcoal-dextran. The findings were corrected for receptor stability and were expressed as percentages of the binding measured at time 0. Dissociation was represented in a semi-logarithmic scale giving a linear manner representation. In vitro expressed [35S]MR was incubated for 10 min at 20 °C with or without aldosterone or BR-4628 (10−8 m) and then for 10 min at 20 °C with increasing concentrations of trypsin (0–300 μg/ml). The digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The x-ray structure of the wild type MR LBD complexed with deoxycorticosterone (Protein Data Bank code 2ABI) (30Huyet J. Pinon G.M. Fay M.R. Fagart J. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) served as a model for docking of BR-4628. The size of the binding site was enlarged by modifying several side chain conformations. The program Glide SP (version 3.5) was used to dock BR-4628 into the resulting binding cleft. The complex with the most probable binding pose was energy-minimized using the OPLS-AA/L force field. To check for the stability of hydrogen bonds or alternative contacts, a 4-ns molecular dynamics simulation with 11,522 explicit water molecules using the program Desmond was run (for details, see the supplemental text). An ultrahigh throughput screening was performed with a cellular transactivation assay based on a recombinant CHO cell line stably expressing the MR LBD. Screening of almost 1,000,000 compounds revealed 677 confirmed primary hits. Approximately 300 screening hits were selected for further evaluation after elimination of toxic, unspecific, and noncompetitive compounds. Among them, a single cluster of ∼100 compounds comprised dihydropyridines (WO2007/025604) (33Kuhl, A., Kolkhof, P., Heckroth, H., Schlemmer, K. H., Flamme, I., Perez, S. F., Gielen-Haertwig, H., Grosser, R., Ergüden, J. K., Lang, D., (2007) 4-CHROMENONYL-l,4-DIHYDROPYRIDINES AND THEIR USE. WO2007/025604.Google Scholar). This finding was surprising because dihydropyridines constitute the well known class of L-type calcium channel antagonists. Chemical optimization with respect to potency, selectivity, and metabolic stability lead to the synthesis of BR-4628 as a drug candidate (see formula in Table 1).TABLE 1Half-maximally inhibitory/effective concentrations of spironolactone, eplerenone, nitrendipine, and BR-4628 determined for the oxo-steroid receptor and for the L-type calcium channel Open table in a new tab Transactivation assays performed with CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the MR LBD revealed that BR-4628 acts as a full MR antagonist. It inactivates the aldosterone-induced MR-LBD transactivation activity with an IC50 of 27.9 nm, a value comparable with that of spironolactone (24.2 nm) but much lower than that of eplerenone (990 nm) (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Furthermore, its antagonist potency is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of nitrendipine, the well known dihydropyridine-based calcium channel blocker (Table 1). Spironolactone and eplerenone lose their antagonist feature upon the S810L mutation (8Geller D.S. Farhi A. Pinkerton N. Fradley M. Moritz M. Spitzer A. Meinke G. Tsai F.T. Sigler P.B. Lifton R.P. Science. 2000; 289: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 22Hultman M.L. Krasnoperova N.V. Li S. Du S. Xia C. Dietz J.D. Lala D.S. Welsch D.J. Hu X. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered whether BR-4628 still acts as an antagonist when bound to the MRS810L. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the MRS810L LBD are characterized by a weak constitutive activity (5-fold increase in the base-line luciferase activity; Fig. 1B). Remarkably, BR-4628 inhibits the constitutive MRS810L LBD activity (IC50, 3630 nm) and the aldosterone-induced MRS810L LBD activity (IC50, 813 nm; Fig. 1B) in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, BR-4628 is a potent MR antagonist that retains its antagonist character at the MRS810L mutant. The high sequence similarity among the LBDs of oxo-steroid receptors results in the cross-binding of ligands to the various receptors. To evaluate whether BR-4628 was MR-selective, transactivation assays were performed in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the LBD of AR, GR, and PR. Spironolactone is a strong AR antagonist (IC50 = ∼77 nm), a weak GR antagonist (IC50 = ∼2.4 μm), and a weak PR agonist (EC50 = ∼740 nm). In contrast, BR-4628, like nitrendipine and eplerenone, is a weak antagonist of AR, GR, and PR, as revealed by IC50 values higher than 4 μm (Table 1). Thus, BR-4628 is at least 160-fold more selective for MR than for AR, whereas spironolactone exhibits only a 3-fold selectivity. The dihydropyridine-derived nitrendipine is a potent calcium channel blocker used as a antihypertensive agent (34Meredith P.A. Elliott H.L. J. Hypertens. 2004; 22: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Binding assays show that BR-4628 has a low calcium channel blocker activity, as revealed by an IC50 value 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of nitrendipine (1.99 μm versus 0.26 nm; Table 1). In summary, we could demonstrate that minor chemical modifications from a classical dihydropyridine calcium antagonist lead to a potent and highly specific MR antagonist. The acute in vivo activity of a MR antagonist can be monitored by measuring its effects on the urinary Na+/K+ ratio. BR-4628 was orally administered to conscious rats by gavage, and the sodium and potassium concentrations were measured in the collected urine. BR-4628 administration increased the urinary sodium/potassium ratio in a dose-dependent manner with a significant effect for a dose as low as 1 mg/kg (Fig. 2). For comparison, spironolactone was found to increase the Na+/K+ at a dose of 10 mg/kg (Fig. 2). The crystal structures of the LBD of MR and MRS810L complexed with steroidal agonists have been recently solved, allowing their anchoring mode to be studied in detail (28Fagart J. Huyet J. Pinon G.M.

Cell. 2005; 19: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The nonsteroidal nature of BR-4628 raised the question of its binding mode within the MR binding pocket. To answer this question, a large amount of purified MR·BR-4628 complex was produced. However, despite numerous trials, crystallization of a complex was unsuccessful. Thus, a mutagenesis approach guided by BR-4628 docking within the x-ray structure of the wild type MR LBD (Protein Data Bank code 2ABI) (30Huyet J. Pinon G.M. Fay M.R. Fagart J. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was followed. Initial docking into the agonist conformation of the MR LBD was unsuccessful because the binding pocket is simply too small to accommodate the highly branched BR-4628 (supplemental Fig. S1). Indeed, the 5-acetyl moiety is in close contact with Trp806 and might displace it for accommodation, resulting in a clash with the H12 helix (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the neighboring 6-methyl group of the DHP core clashes with Leu960 located in helix H12 (Fig. 3A). Both of these structural elements suggest that this molecule might have bulky antagonist features by impairing the H12 helix to adopt its agonist position. Therefore, the H12 helix was omitted from further docking experiments and from a constrained 4-ns molecular dynamics simulation (supplemental Video S1 and Fig. S2). The chromenone carbonyl group is anchored to Gln776 and Arg817, the DHP NH group is hydrogen-bonded to the Asn770 carbonyl oxygen, and the carbonyl group of the 5-acetyl moiety forms a hydrogen bond with Ser810 (Fig. 3B). During the course of the 4-ns molecular dynamics simulation, Asn770 is hydrogen-bonded in 92.8% of the conformations, Ser810 is hydrogen-bonded in 65.3%, Arg817 is hydrogen-bonded in 34.5%, and Gln776 is hydrogen-bonded in 0.6%. No hydrogen bond is observed for Cys942; however, the thiol group packs against the core of the DHP ring, forming van der Waal's contacts (average distance from the BR-4628 NH to the sulfur of Cys942 is 3.9 Å). The methyl side chain of Ala773 fits tightly into a notch on the BR-4628 surface, formed by the 6-methyl carbon (3.6 Å), the C5 in the DHP core (3.9 Å), the 5-acetyl carbon (4.0 Å), and the C7′ in the chromenone ring (3.7 Å). Interestingly, in such a position, BR-4628 does not interact with Thr945 (average distance from the BR-4628 NH to Thr945 Cα is 7.4 Å). The 3-ethyl ester fills a lipophilic pocket formed by Leu814, Phe829, Met845, Met852, and Leu938 (Fig. 3B). The methyl substituent on the 4-chromenone ring interacts with close van der Waal's contacts with the side chain of Ser811, Met807, Met852, and Leu938. Based on this binding mode, 10 amino acids in the binding site were selected for mutation studies. We focused on Asn770, Gln776, Arg817, and Thr945, known to anchor the steroids (25Fagart J. Wurtz J.M. Souque A. Hellal-Levy C. Moras D. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and on the Ala773, Ser810, Met852, and Cys942 residues that play a critical role in delimiting the volume of the cavity (25Fagart J.

All of the mutations were introduced within the full-length MR gene, and the corresponding mutant receptors were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and tested for their transcriptional activity. Aldosterone activates MRA773G and MRS810A with ED50 values identical to that of MR (0.025 and 0.019 nm, respectively, versus 0.014 nm; Fig. 4). Aldosterone is less efficient in activating MRC942A and MRT945A (ED50, 9.5 and 4.9 nm, respectively). The activity of MRQ776A and MRR817A in response to 10−7 m aldosterone is 20 and 70% that of MR, respectively (Fig. 4). Aldosterone is unable to activate MRN770A and MRM852A (25Fagart J. Wurtz J.M. Souque A. Hellal-Levy C. Moras D. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27Fagart J. Seguin C. Pinon G.M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, 18-vinyl-4-pregnen-3,18,20-trione and spironolactone activate MRN770A and MRM852A, respectively (ED50, 8.4 and 0.41 nm; Fig. 4). The effect of the mutations on the BR-4628 and spironolactone antagonist potency was analyzed in transfection assays (supplemental Fig. S3 and Table 2). The T945A mutation had no effect on the BR-4628 potency, as revealed by an IC50 identical to that of wild type MR, and confirmed that BR-4628 does not interact with this residue. In sharp contrast, the N770A and A773G mutations have a strong effect, increasing BR-4628 IC50 values by 39- and 25-fold, respectively. From these results it can be propo"

The pathways that control mesenchymal cell differentiation are not well understood. We propose that Foxo1 is an early molecular regulator during mesenchymal cell differentiation into osteoblasts. In mouse embryos, Foxo1 expression is higher in skeletal tissues, while Foxo1 silencing has a drastic impact on skeletogenesis and craniofacial development, specially affecting pre-maxilla, nasal bone, mandible, tibia, and clavicle. Similarly, Foxo1 activity and expression increase in mouse mesenchymal cells under the influence of osteogenic stimulants. In addition, silencing Foxo1 blocks the expression of osteogenic markers such as Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin and results in decreased culture calcification even in the presence of strong osteogenic stimulants. Conversely, the expression of these markers increases significantly in response to Foxo1 overexpression. One mechanism through which Foxo1 affects mesenchymal cell differentiation into osteoblasts is through regulation of a key osteogenic transcription factor, Runx2. Indeed, our results show that Foxo1 directly interacts with the promoter of Runx2 and regulates its expression. Using a tibia organ culture model, we confirmed that silencing Foxo1 decreases the expression of Runx2 and impairs bone formation. Furthermore, our data reveals that Runx2 and Foxo1 interact with each other and cooperate in the transcriptional regulation of osteoblast markers.

In conclusion, our in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo results strongly support the notion that Foxo1 is an early molecular regulator in the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblast. Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells can differentiate into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells), adipocytes (fat cells), chondrocytes (cartilage cells), and myocytes (muscle cells) under the influence of various hormones and growth factors (1Grigoriadis A.E. Heersche J.N. Aubin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2139-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Commitment and differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts is crucial during skeletal development and bone growth. Whether mesenchymal cells differentiate along the osteogenic or other pathway depends on the activation of specific transcription factors. The importance of transcription factors in controlling skeletal development can be appreciated in the human skeletal disorder cleidocranial dysplasia. In this condition, deregulation of an important osteogenic transcription factor, Runx2, produces a striking phenotype with anterior fontanelle, hypoplasia or aplasia of the clavicle, wide pubic symphysis, and short stature (2Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S. Albright S. Lindhout D. Cole W.G. Henn W. Knoll J.H. Owen M.J. Mertelsmann R. Zabel B.U. Olsen B.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Although some of the transcription factors that control osteoblast differentiation are well characterized, the role of others remains unclear. One such factor is Foxo1 (forkhead box class O). Foxo1 belongs to the winged helix/forkhead family of transcription factors that is characterized by a 100-amino acid monomeric DNA-binding domain called the FOX domain. Other portions of the forkhead proteins, such as the DNA transactivation or DNA transrepression domains, are highly divergent (3Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of Foxo1 are dynamically regulated by post-transcriptional modification. Foxo1 is phosphorylated at the three sites: Thr-24, Ser-253, and Ser-316 (4Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4574-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Foxo1 leads to its cytoplasmic retention and the inhibition of its transcriptional activity. On the other hand, dephosphorylation localizes Foxo1 to the nucleus, where Foxo1 binds to the forkhead response element in the promoter of target genes and interacts with transcriptional coactivators, resulting in transcriptional regulation (9Nasrin N. Ogg S. Cahill C.M. Biggs W. Nui S. Dore J. Calvo D. Shi Y. Ruvkun G. Alexander-Bridges M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that FOXO transcription factors control the regulation of many genes involved in fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, cell death, modulation of inflammation, metabolism, protection from oxidative stress, and cell survival (10Birkenkamp K.U.

Recently, the role of Foxo1 in differentiation of mesenchymal cells started to unravel. It has been shown that activation of Foxo1 prevents mesenchymal cells from differentiating into fat or muscle cells (16Gilde A.J. Van Bilsen M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Armoni M. Harel C. Karni S. Chen H. Bar-Yoseph F. Ver M.R. Quon M.J. Karnieli E. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that inhibition of adipogenesis or myogenesis by Foxo1 concurrently signals mesenchymal cells toward osteogenesis. This possibility is supported by the observation that the alkaline phosphatase gene, a marker of osteoblast differentiation, contains a forkhead response element in its promoter (19Hatta M. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Deyama Y. Yoshimura Y. Suzuki K. Matsumoto A. Fukamizu A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that Foxo1 is expressed during skeletogenesis in mouse embryos and that Foxo1 activity increases in the early hours of differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts in vitro. Silencing Foxo1 significantly disturbs skeletogenesis in vivo and ex vivo and prevents expression of osteoblast markers and subsequent matrix calcification. In addition, Foxo1 controls Runx2 expression, and can directly interact with this transcription factor, suggesting that Foxo1 induces osteoblast differentiation through regulation and interaction with Runx2. Based on these findings, we propose that Foxo1 is an early and important regulator of mesenchymal cell differentiation into osteoblasts. The first series of experiments evaluated Foxo1 expression in mouse skeletal tissues at E15.5, a period of active bone formation, by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Foxo1 expression was silenced in vivo and ex vivo (tibia organ culture) using a lentiviral vector carrying miRNA. The silencing level and specificity were determined by RT-PCR and EMSA, and the impact on bone formation was studied by RT-PCR, histological methods, whole embryo staining, and microCT. 2The abbreviations used are: microCTmicro computed tomographySHHsonic hedgehogPTHrparathyroid hormone-related peptideALPalkaline phosphatasemiRNAmicroRNA. micro computed tomography sonic hedgehog parathyroid hormone-related peptide alkaline phosphatase microRNA. A mouse embryonic cell line treated with the osteogenic stimulants BMP2, SHH, and PTHrP was used to demonstrate that Foxo1 regulates mesenchymal cell differentiation into osteoblasts. Foxo1 expression, protein levels, and activity were measured over time and in parallel with Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen (osteoblast markers), and type II collagen (chondrocyte marker). The effect of Foxo1 overexpression and silencing on osteogenic markers such as Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and mineral deposition was examined in vitro by RT-PCR, ELISA, and biochemical staining. The specificity of the gene silencing was confirmed by RT-PCR, EMSA, ELISA, proliferation, and apoptosis studies. The interaction of Foxo1 with Runx2 was investigated by means of promoter reporter constructs, mutagenesis, EMSA, ChIP assay, RT-PCR, and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Mouse embryonic C3H10T1/2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Basal Medium Eagle (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The murine osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1, subclone 14(CRL-2549, ATCC) was cultured in alpha modified Minimum Essential Medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, and antibiotics. Osteogenic differentiation was induced using 100 ng/ml BMP2 (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). In some experiments SHH (500 ng/ml) or PTHrP (10−7 m) was added to medium. Calcification studies were performed in presence of ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Alizarin red staining was performed for visualization of calcium deposits. Primary human mesenchymal cells were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10−7 m dexamethasone as previously described (20Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I. Bruder S.P. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation was measured by counting cells after fixation and staining with toluidine blue. Apoptosis was measured by detecting cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA (Roche Applied Science). Foxo1 and Runx2 activity was measured using an ELISA-based kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, nuclear proteins were extracted, and their protein content was measured (Pierce Protein Assay, ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL). Nuclear extracts were incubated with immobilized oligonucleotides that bind Foxo1 or Runx2 followed by successive incubations with primary (anti-Runx2 and anti-Foxo1) antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and measuring the colorimetric reaction by spectrophotometry. Wild-type consensus oligonucleotides at a higher concentration were used as a specific competitor and mutated consensus oligonucleotides were used as non-competitor. Interactions between nuclear proteins and Foxo1 DNA probe (CAAAACAA) were investigated using an EMSA kit (Panomics Redwood City, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Specificity was demonstrated for each reaction by adding 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitive oligonucleotide or unlabeled nonspecific oligonucleotide. Three potential Foxo1 DNA binding sites were identified in the Runx2 promoter using Biobase (Biobase, Biological Databases, Beverly, MA) and three unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to these sites were created: synthetic probe A: CCATTATAAACAACAAAAACTTACAGTTTC (−1204 to −1233), synthetic probe B, AGAATTATACAAAACATTTTCTTTGAAAAGAT (−1071 to −1100), and synthetic probe C, CCTGACATTTGTTTTTTAAGATCTTCAAAG (−986 to −1015). In some experiments nuclear proteins were incubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probes A, B, and C. C3H10T1/2 cells were incubated with Foxo1 siRNA or scrambled siRNA mixed with HiPerFect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. For calcification study, cells were incubated with Foxo1 siRNA (or scrambled siRNA) once a week and stimulated with BMP2 for 14 days. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol with pcDNA3 Flag Foxo1 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) or pcDNA3.1 as a control. Transfection efficiency was determined using pcDNA3-EGFP (Addgene, Cambridge, MA), and Foxo1 protein levels were evaluated by Western blot using polyclonal antisera against Foxo1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Runx2 promoter activity was determined using a pGL4.10 firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) containing two different fragments of the mouse Runx2 promoter region (−0.9 kb or −1.3 kb upstream of transcription starting site), and pGL4.74 basic plasmid (Renilla luciferase) for control of transfection efficiency. In some experiments a mutation was introduced in potential binding sites of Foxo1 in the Runx2 promoter. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and tested using a luciferase assay system (Dual-Glo, Promega, Madison, WI) and a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Data were expressed as the ratio of experimental sample's luminescence/control luciferase luminescence. Expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, type I and type II collagen, Foxo1, Foxo3, Foxo4, and Runx2 was analyzed by semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR. mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit, and RT-PCR was conducted using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) on a DNA Engine Optican 2 System (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Specific primers for these genes were designed using the murine sequences and for GAPDH as a reference “housekeeping gene” for quantification. Relative expression levels are reported as “-fold change” (x in the following formula) in gene expression and calculated using the threshold cycle (Ct) and the following formula, in which ctl = control, exp = experimental, and GAPDH = the housekeeping gene: x = 2ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = ΔE − ΔC, ΔE = Ctexp − CtGAPDH, and ΔC = Ctctl − CtGAPDH. The absolute number for ΔΔCt was used in the calculation, and a negative ΔΔCt was considered an increase while a positive ΔΔCt was considered a decrease in gene expression. Formaldehyde (1% final concentration) was added directly to culture medium for 10 min at ambient temperature to cross-link DNA and bound protein. The cells were lysed and sonicated on ice followed by immunoprecipitation overnight with anti-Foxo1 antibody or normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), mixed with Protein G Magnetic Beads and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the beads followed by a cross-link reversal step. DNA from each immunoprecipitation reaction was examined by semiquantitative PCR. The Foxo1-responsive region of the mouse ALP, osteocalcin, and Runx2 promoters was mapped for primer design using Genomatix Software (Munich, Germany). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibody against Foxo1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 FLAG Foxo1 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) as described above. BMP2 was added after 24 h (100 ng/ml), and after an additional 48-h nuclear extracts were collected and co-immunoprecipitation performed (Universal Magnetic Co-IP kit, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, nuclear extracts were combined either with rabbit monoclonal FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit polyclonal Runx2 or species matched normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein G-coated magnetic beads. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were also conducted with MC3T3-E1 cells treated with BMP2 (100 ng/ml) for 48 h (without transfection). Total nuclear extracts or immunoprecipitates were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a PVD membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Bio-Rad), probed with monoclonal antibodies against either Runx2 or Foxo1, and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence. The tail vein of CD1 timed-pregnant mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) at E14.5 were injected with lentivirus (pLenti6/V5-DEST, Invitrogen) containing an engineered microRNA (miRNA) for silencing Foxo1 or negative control miRNA (virus titer, 5 × 105 TU/ml). The miRNA insert was designed to target and cleave Foxo1 mRNA. The control miRNA can form a hairpin structure, but does not target any known vertebrate gene. Embryos were collected at E16.5 for whole embryo staining with alizarin red and Alcian blue. Embryos were dissected and tissues, including tibia, were used to extract mRNA. Embryos were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight, and placed 0.05% alizarin red, 0.015% Alcian blue, 5% acetic acid, in 70% ethanol overnight. Soft tissues were removed by incubation with 1% KOH before storage in glycerol. Digital images of stained bones were analyzed using digital image analysis software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health) to quantify the area of stained bones. For organ culture studies, tibiae were isolated from E15.5 embryos using a stereomicroscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) and allowed to equilibrate overnight in serum-free α-MEM media containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.55 mm l-glutamine, 40 units/ml penicillin, and 40 μg/ml streptomycin as described by Serra et al. (21Serra R. Karaplis A. Sohn P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Tibiae were infected with the lentiviral system described above, containing either engineered microRNA for silencing Foxo1, negative control miRNA, or no vector and were kept in culture for 48 h before histological analysis. Experiments were repeated at least 3 times, with 6–9 bones per treatment. Tibiae were also microdissected, to separate the cartilage region (epiphysis) from the region of active bone formation (diaphysis) and RNA or nuclear proteins were extracted for real time RT-PCR or studies of transcription factor activity. Embryos were isolated, and tibiae were collected for microCT analysis 48 h post-tail injection, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight, and scanned using the Enhanced Vision Systems Model MS-8 In Vitro micro computed tomography (microCT) scanner (Amersham Biosciences) at the Imaging Core of the Hospital for Special Surgery (New York, NY). microCT was used to obtain mineral content and density, bone volume fraction, density of bone, and cross-sectional geometry using the instrument's software. Embryos were collected from three CD1 timed-pregnant mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) at E15.5 fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed as previously described (22Teixeira C.C. Ischiropoulos H. Leboy P.S. Adams S.L. Shapiro I.M. Bone. 2005; 37: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and polyclonal antibody specific for mouse Foxo1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Sections were counterstained with Mallory Trichrome stain, mounted, and scanned on Scan Scope G optical microscope (Aperio, Bristol, UK) at 10×. Cultured tibiae were also fixed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin to visualize cellular structures, Alcian blue to detect cartilage matrix, and von Kossa to detect mineral deposition. Each experiment was carried out with at least three replicate samples per group, and each experiment was performed three times. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significance was tested by non-parametric analysis at the p < 0.05 level using the Mann-Whitney test. Mouse embryonic mesenchymal cells (C3H10T1/2 cells) that have the potential to differentiate into adipocytes, myoblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts were used to study early events in the commitment of mesenchymal cells into osteoblast. These cells differentiate into osteoblasts in response to BMP2 (23Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA & Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 24Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P.

When mesenchymal cells were treated with BMP2, Foxo1 activity increased 2.5-fold in comparison with cells that did not receive BMP2 after 12 h (Fig. 1A), continued to increase in activity after 1, 3, and 7 days, and decreased to 1.8-fold by day 14. The increase in Foxo1 activity relative to control, at all time points studied was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Runx2 activity at 3, 6, and 12 h was not statistically significant. Runx2 activity increased to 2.5-fold and 1.9-fold at days 3 and 7, respectively, and these changes were statistically significant (p < 0.05). At day 14, Runx2 activity returned to control levels. Similarly Western blotting demonstrates early detection of Foxo1 protein in nuclear extracts of cells treated with BMP2 (Fig. 1B). In cells that were treated with BMP2, Foxo1 expression increased from 1.3-fold at 6 h to 3.7-fold at day 14 with a peak of 4.1-fold at day 7 (Fig. 1C). Similar to Foxo1, expression of Runx2 and ALP increased significantly during the time course of study and peaked at 3.1- and 5.2-fold, respectively, at day 7. In addition, a 4.5-fold increase in type I collagen expression (p < 0.05) was observed in the first week in culture, while type II collagen expression did not change significantly at the cell densities used in these study (Fig. 1D). Activation and expression of Foxo1 in C3H10T1/2 was not limited to BMP2 stimulation. Similar results were obtained in response to other osteogenic stimulants. SHH and PTHrP increased Foxo1 activity 2.7- and 2.3-fold, respectively, in the first 24 h (Fig. 1E). To demonstrate that this phenomenon was not limited to mouse mesenchymal cells, activation of Foxo1 was also measured in primary human mesenchymal cells in response to dexamethasone with similar results (Fig. 1F). Foxo1 expression was down-regulated in vitro in both C3H10T1/2 and MC3T3-E1 cells with siRNA to obtain insight into Foxo1 function. This strategy successfully reduced Foxo1 binding activity in MC3T3-E1 cells as demonstrated by EMSA (Fig. 2A). Specificity of binding was demonstrated by the competitive inhibition with excess unlabeled probe. Silencing Foxo1 did not affect the expression of other members of the FOXO family, Foxo3, and Foxo4 (Fig. 2B), or affect cell proliferation or cell death significantly (Table 1). Foxo1 expression decreased in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells by 76% (Fig. 2C). Silencing of Foxo1 expression in mesenchymal cells was able to reduce the up-regulation of Runx2, ALP, and osteocalcin expression in response to BMP2 treatment by 68%, 71%, and 63%, respectively (Fig. 2C). Foxo1 silencing also decreased the activity of Foxo1 and Runx 2 by 79 and 62%, respectively (Fig. 2D). In addition, cells that were transfected with Foxo1 siRNA showed markedly less calcium accumulation in the extracellular matrix (Fig. 2E), as visualized by alizarin red staining.TABLE 1Effect of Foxo1 siRNA on apoptosis and proliferationApoptosis (+/− S.D.)Proliferation (+/− S.D.)ODaOD, optical density.%Control143 +/− 12200 +/− 4.8Scr siRNA175 +/− 23171 +/− 2.3Foxo1 siRNA181 +/− 31175 +/− 5.6a OD, optical density. Open table in a new tab The effect of Foxo1 on Runx2 protein levels in nuclear extracts, key osteoblast marker, in the absence of BMP2 stimulation was evaluated by overexpression of Foxo1 in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 2F). Compared with controls, Foxo1 overexpression also significantly up-regulated the expression of Runx2 (2.2-fold), ALP (2.7-fold), and osteocalcin (4.6-fold) (Fig. 2G) (p < 0.05). The expression of Foxo1 was evaluated during active skeletal development, E15.5 (Fig. 3A), because this stage has the most ossification centers present in the mouse embryonic skeleton (27Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that Foxo1 is expressed in multiple tissues, i.e. brain, tongue, liver, and cartilage, with the highest expression levels in areas of mesenchymal cell differentiation into bone, such as the developing calvaria (7-fold) and diaphysis (7-fold) of long bones. Immunohistochemical staining of these tissues (Fig. 3B) confirmed these observations. Pregnant mice were injected with either Foxo1 miRNA or control miRNA to evaluate the role of Foxo1 on skeletogenesis. The specificity of the Foxo1 miRNA was first tested in C3H10T1/2 cells by EMSA (Fig. 4A). Foxo1 expression in calvaria and tibia was silenced 68% (Table 2). Foxo3 and Foxo4 expression did not change with Foxo1 miRNA (Table 2). Whole skeleton staining with alizarin red and Alcian blue showed that silencing Foxo1 impaired skeletal development (Fig. 4B). Embryos that received the Foxo1 miRNA lentiviral vector were smaller in size with delayed ossification of supraoccipitale and forelimbs (arrowheads in Fig. 4B, panel i). In addition, in the craniofacial area, the nasal bone, premaxilla, and mandible were on average 20% smaller, which was statistically significant (Fig. 4B). Also, in embryos exposed to Foxo1 miRNA, there were 35 and 40% decrease in ossification of the clavicles (Fig. 4C) and palatine process (Fig. 4D), respectively (p < 0.05). The microCT scans of the tibiae from these embryos reveal a 38% decrease in the bone volume fraction, a 12% decrease in the bone mineral density, and a striking 59% decrease in the overall mineral content of the tibiae (Table 2). The three-dimensional reconstruction of microCT data from representative tibiae shows the considerably different appearance of these embryonic bones (Fig. 4E).TABLE 2Effect of Foxo1 miRNA on developing tibiaControlFoxo 1 miRNAFoxo 1 exp10.32 ± 0.06aSignificantly different from control miRNA values (p < 0.05).Foxo 3 exp11.2 ± 0.24Foxo 4 exp11.3 ± 0.26BVF (%)13.7 ± 1.878.54 ± 0.94aSignificantly different from control miRNA values (p < 0.05).BMD (mg/cc)263.1 ± 18.27232.3 ± 15.54aSignificantly different from control miRNA values (p < 0.05).Min Cont (μg)5.6 ± 1.42.3 ± 0.8aSignificantly different from control miRNA values (p < 0.05).a Significantly different from control miRNA values (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Organ culture was used to examine the Foxo1 mechanism of action on skeleton development. The ex vivo culture of developing bones is a versatile three-dimensional model to study the effect of Foxo1 expression/activity on bone formation. Indeed, we found that in comparison with regions that remain cartilaginous (epiphysis) (Fig. 5A), the activity of Foxo1 in the areas of active bone formation (diaphysis) was 3.4-fold higher (Fig. 5B) and, interestingly, the activity of Runx2 in the same nuclear extracts was 6.7-fold higher (Fig. 5B). When mouse embryonic tibiae were incubated with lentivirus expressing Foxo1 miRNA for 48 h, the expression of Foxo1 was reduced 76%, Runx2 expression decreased 63%, and ALP expression decreased 61% (Fig. 5C) in the areas of active bone formation. The histological appearance of tibia exposed to Foxo1 miRNA was also very different from tibia exposed to control miRNA. Silencing of"
https://openalex.org/W1971758875,"Gobbled by Gobies A common feature of overfished marine ecosystems is a tendency for biomass to become dominated by jellyfish and microbes, and for the habitat to become anoxic or hypoxic as large fish species are removed. The Benguela ecosystem off the coast of Namibia is a case in point. Utne-Palm et al. (p. 333 ) describe how the loss of overfished sardines from the Benguela fishery has provided an opportunity for an endemic fish species, the bearded goby, to exploit jellyfish and microbial biomass and to increase in number. These small fish have in turn become the predominant prey species for the larger fish, birds, and mammals in the region. The significance of the goby lies in its ability to forage on resources traditionally regarded as “dead-ends.” The bearded goby has thus become a key stabilizing component to the turnover of energy in the Benguela ecosystem."

More recently, several regulatory roles of β-arrestins for atypical 7TMRs and non-7TM receptors have emerged. Here, we uncover an entirely novel regulatory role of β-arrestins in cross-talk between the angiotensin receptor (AT1aR) and a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, TRPV4. AT1aR and TRPV4 form a constitutive complex in the plasma membrane, and angiotensin stimulation leads to recruitment of β-arrestin 1 to this complex. Surprisingly, angiotensin stimulation results in ubiquitination of TRPV4, a process that requires β-arrestin 1, and subsequently to internalization and functional down-regulation of TRPV4. β-Arrestin 1 interacts with, and acts as an adaptor for AIP4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for TRPV4 ubiquitination. Thus, our data provide the first evidence of a functional link between β-arrestins and TRPV4 and uncovers an entirely novel mechanism to maintain appropriate intracellular Ca2+ concentration to avoid excessive Ca2+ signaling. β-Arrestins, originally discovered to desensitize activated G protein-coupled receptors, (aka seven-transmembrane receptors, 7TMRs) also mediate 7TMR internalization and G protein-independent signaling via these receptors.

Kadowaki S. Haga T. Takaesu H. Mitaku S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). They mediate a wide range of cellular and physiological responses upon activation by different stimuli (2Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). To avoid harmful effects of sustained signaling and to exert tight regulation, cells have evolved several different mechanisms for down-regulating these receptors (3Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). For example, upon activation by an agonist, 7TMRs are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases followed by recruitment of β-arrestins. This receptor-β-arrestin interaction sterically hinders further G protein coupling and thus terminates the G protein-dependent cellular responses, leading to receptor desensitization (4Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the activated receptors are internalized and targeted either for degradation or for recycling back to the cell surface (5Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins, originally discovered in the context of receptor desensitization, have more recently emerged as key players in almost every aspect of 7TMR function and regulation. For example, they not only mediate 7TMR internalization by acting as adaptors for several key proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis but also mediate G protein-independent signaling via these receptors (6DeWire S.M. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Moreover, β-arrestins also act as adaptors for E3 ubiquitin ligases to mediate 7TMR ubiquitination and degradation (6DeWire S.M. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, β-arrestins were also found to interact with and regulate atypical 7TMRs such as Smoothened (7Chen W.

These previously unanticipated functional capabilities of β-arrestins hint at much broader roles of β-arrestins in cellular signaling and clearly demand more in depth investigation. To better understand their functional and regulatory roles in cellular processes, we recently carried out a global interactomics screen using a shotgun proteomics approach to generate an extensive list of putative interaction partners of β-arrestins (11Xiao K. McClatchy D.B. Shukla A.K. Zhao Y. Chen M. Shenoy S.K. Yates 3rd, J.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12011-12016Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Among a small number of non-receptor membrane proteins such as ion channels and transporters present in this screen, we surprisingly identified a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPV4 as a specific interacting partner of β-arrestins in response to angiotensin stimulation. seven-transmembrane receptors transient receptor potential atrophin 1-interacting protein 4 4-α-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate rat vascular smooth muscle cell analysis of variance immunoblotting immunoprecipitation ([sarcosine1,IIe4,IIe8]Angiotensin II) beta 2 adrenergic receptor. TRP channels are a family of non-selective cation channels permeable to Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, and they mediate numerous cellular and physiological processes (12Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). TRP channels are ubiquitously expressed, and they are activated and regulated by a wide array of external stimuli such as chemicals, temperature, mechanical and osmotic stress, and intracellular signals such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination (12Montell C.

TRPV4 is a member of the vanilloid subfamily of the TRP channel family and is widely expressed in the central nervous system as well as the peripheral nervous system, cardiovascular tissues, epithelial cells such as keratinocytes, bronchial, and renal epithelia, mesenchymally derived cells such as skeletal (chondrocytes, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts), and endothelial cells (14Liedtke W.

Cells were stimulated with angiotensin or SII-angiotensin for an appropriate time interval and lysed using glycerol lysis buffer (37Ahn S. Kim J. Hara M.R. Ren X.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Subsequently, 1–3 mg of total cell lysate was used to immunoprecipitate the protein of interest with tumbling overnight in the cold room. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times (with 1 ml of lysis buffer each) and eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The proteins were separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and used for Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. Cells were fixed on conformal chambers using 6% formaldehyde for 15 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1–0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min. After washing, the cells were incubated with an appropriate antibody overnight followed by incubation with secondary antibody. Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using single line (488 nm) or multitrack sequential excitation (488 and 633 nm) and emission (515–540 nm, boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) fluorescein; 650 nm, Alexa Fluor 633) filter sets. The color for 488 nm excitation line was set as pseudo green, and the color for 633 nm excitation line was set as pseudo red. The merge of these two colors (pseudo green and pseudo red) yielded yellow when colocalization of two proteins occurred (see Fig. 1E).

The readings were recorded using the NovoStar multiwavelength plate reader (BMG Labtech). The Ca2+ influx data are normalized with respect to a 4-α-PDD-induced but angiotensin-non-stimulated sample (100%).

We identified TRPV4 as a specific interaction partner of β-arrestins using a global interactomics analysis (11Xiao K. McClatchy D.B. Shukla A.K. Zhao Y. Chen M. Shenoy S.K. Yates 3rd, J.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12011-12016Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To further confirm this interaction and explore the regulatory outcome, we chose rVSMCs as our model system. These cells, isolated from rat aorta, endogenously express AT1aR, TRPV4, and β-arrestins and represent an excellent, physiologically relevant model system. First, we stimulated rVSMCs with angiotensin for different times, immunoprecipitated TRPV4, and subsequently detected β-arrestins by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, angiotensin stimulation led to a robust but transient interaction between TRPV4 and β-arrestin 1. We also carried out a reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment where we stimulated rVSMCs with angiotensin, immunoprecipitated β-arrestins, and detected TRPV4 by Western blot. Again, we observed a robust interaction between TRPV4 and β-arrestin 1 at the 2-min time point (Fig. 1, C and D). rVSMCs express very low levels of β-arrestin 2, and β-arrestin 1 is the predominant isoform of β-arrestins in these cells. Thus, to confirm the specificity of interaction of TRPV4 with β-arrestin 1 versus β-arrestin 2, we used HEK-293 cells expressing endogenous β-arrestins 1 and 2 but transfected with HA-AT1aR and FLAG-TRPV4. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a selective interaction between TRPV4 and β-arrestin 1 that was transient in nature, similar to that observed in rVSMCs (supplemental Fig. S1, A–D). These findings confirm our initial observation based on the proteomic screen that β-arrestin 1 and TRPV4 interact with each other upon activation of AT1aR and provide the first evidence of a direct link between TRPV4 and β-arrestins. Next, we asked whether AT1aR and TRPV4 are involved in a direct cross-talk. As rVSMCs express very low levels (20 fmol/mg) of AT1aR, which is insufficient for coimmunoprecipitation, we transfected these cells with HA-AT1aR to probe a direct interaction between AT1aR and TRPV4. First, we immunostained AT1aR and TRPV4 and examined the localization of these two proteins by confocal microscopy. Both AT1aR and TRPV4 were expressed at the cell surface and exhibited clear colocalization indicating a potential interaction (Fig. 1E). Subsequently, we immunoprecipitated either HA-AT1aR or endogenous TRPV4 and detected the respective partner by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, F and G, we detected a constitutive interaction between the AT1aR and TRPV4, and this interaction is not modulated by angiotensin stimulation during the time course examined in this experiment. We also observed a similar pattern of constitutive interaction of AT1aR and TRPV4 in HEK-293 cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Taken together with the data presented in Fig. 1, A–D, these findings establish the formation of a previously unsuspected multiprotein complex involving TRPV4, AT1aR, and β-arrestin 1 in response to angiotensin stimulation. What are the functional outcomes of this physical interaction among TRPV4, AT1aR, and β-arrestin 1? One of the critical roles of β-arrestins that has emerged in the context of 7TMR regulation is their ability to support receptor in"
https://openalex.org/W2066346206,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel involved in physiological and pathophysiological processes linked to oxidative stress. TRPM2 channels are co-activated by intracellular Ca(2+) and ADP-ribose (ADPR) but also modulated in intact cells by several additional factors. Superfusion of TRPM2-expressing cells with H(2)O(2) or intracellular dialysis of cyclic ADPR (cADPR) or nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) activates, whereas dialysis of AMP inhibits, TRPM2 whole-cell currents. Additionally, H(2)O(2), cADPR, and NAADP enhance ADPR sensitivity of TRPM2 currents in intact cells. Because in whole-cell recordings the entire cellular machinery for nucleotide and Ca(2+) homeostasis is intact, modulators might affect TRPM2 activity either directly, by binding to TRPM2, or indirectly, by altering the local concentrations of the primary ligands ADPR and Ca(2+). To identify direct modulators of TRPM2, we have studied the effects of H(2)O(2), AMP, cADPR, NAADP, and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide in inside-out patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing human TRPM2, by directly exposing the cytosolic faces of the patches to these compounds. H(2)O(2) (1 mM) and enzymatically purified cADPR (10 μM) failed to activate, whereas AMP (200 μM) failed to inhibit TRPM2 currents. NAADP was a partial agonist (maximal efficacy, ∼50%), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide was a full agonist, but both had very low affinities (K(0.5) = 104 and 35 μM). H(2)O(2), cADPR, and NAADP did not enhance activation by ADPR. Considering intracellular concentrations of these compounds, none of them are likely to directly affect the TRPM2 channel protein in a physiological context."

https://openalex.org/W2020668157,"Cenozoic Tectonics The Basin and Range Province of western North America—exemplified by the alternating mountain ridge and valley landscapes across nearly the entire U.S. state of Nevada—started to form ∼50 million years ago through a series of extensions of the continental crust. Prior to that, massive mountain-building collisions at the boundary between North America and the Pacific Ocean formed a subduction zone and compressed the continent. By combining observations of global subduction zone velocities with numerical modeling, Schellart et al. (p. 316 ) demonstrate that the thinning of the subducting portion of the oceanic plate controlled how and when the transition from compression to extension occurred. Even today, where the much smaller remnant oceanic plate continues to slowly subduct below North America in the Pacific Northwest, the width of the slab and not its age controls the velocity of subduction. Indeed, this relation may explain the dynamics of other modern subduction zones, from South America to Japan."

Furthermore, there was an increase in the level of activated glycogen synthase kinase-3β and enhanced expression of intraneuronal Aβ in AAV1-I2CTF animals. Morris water maze behavioral test revealed that infection with AAV1-I2CTF induced spatial reference memory and memory consolidation deficits and a decrease in the brain level of pSer133-CREB.

https://openalex.org/W1985807346,"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are often recruited to solid tumors, integrate into the tumor stroma, and contribute to tumor development. TNFα is a major inflammatory cytokine present in the tumor microenvironment and has a profound influence on the progression of tumor development. This study was aimed to investigate the role of BM-MSCs in tumor promotion in response to TNFα. Quantitative real-time PCR arrays show that diverse cytokines/chemokines were induced in TNFα-treated BM-MSCs; in particular, CXCR3 ligand chemokines, including CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, were potently induced. A serial and site-directed mutation analysis in the CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 promoters revealed that NF-κB binding elements were responsible for TNFα-induced promoter activation of CXCR3 ligand chemokines. TNFα stimulated NF-κB activity, and ectopic expression of NF-κB enhanced TNFα-induced promoter activities of the CXCR3 ligand chemokines. Gel shift and supershift assays showed that NF-κB was associated with CXCR3 ligand chemokine promoters in response to TNFα treatment. All three CXCR3 ligand chemokines enhanced the migration and invasive motility of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressing CXCR3. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with CXCL10 activated small GTPase of Rho family proteins, such as RhoA and Cdc42. CXCL9-, CXCL10-, or CXCL11-induced invasive capability of MDA-MB-231 cells was completely abrogated in the presence of a neutralizing anti-CXCR3 antibody in the culture medium. Moreover, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 stimulated the expression of MMP-9, but not MMP-2, in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggest that BM-MSCs promote the locomotion of breast cancer cells through CXCR3 ligand-mediated actin rearrangement by TNFα in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2104898504,"Heavy metal pumps (P1B-ATPases) are important for cellular heavy metal homeostasis. AtHMA4, an Arabidopsis thaliana heavy metal pump of importance for plant Zn(2+) nutrition, has an extended C-terminal domain containing 13 cysteine pairs and a terminal stretch of 11 histidines. Using a novel size-exclusion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry approach we report that the C-terminal domain of AtHMA4 is a high affinity Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) chelator with capacity to bind 10 Zn(2+) ions per C terminus. When AtHMA4 is expressed in a Zn(2+)-sensitive zrc1 cot1 yeast strain, sequential removal of the histidine stretch and the cysteine pairs confers a gradual increase in Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) tolerance and lowered Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) content of transformed yeast cells. We conclude that the C-terminal domain of AtHMA4 serves a dual role as Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) chelator (sensor) and as a regulator of the efficiency of Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) export. The identification of a post-translational handle on Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) transport efficiency opens new perspectives for regulation of Zn(2+) nutrition and tolerance in eukaryotes."

Some organic carbon sources, such as acetate and pyruvate, can be assimilated during the phototrophic growth of the GSBs, in the presence of CO2 or HCO3−. It has not been established why the inorganic carbonis required for incorporating organic carbon for growth and how the organic carbons are assimilated. In this report, we probed carbon flux during autotrophic and mixotrophic growth of the GSB Chlorobaculum tepidum. Our data indicate the following: (a) the RTCA cycle is active during autotrophic and mixotrophic growth; (b) the flux from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is very low and acetyl-CoA is synthesized through the RTCA cycle and acetate assimilation; (c) pyruvate is largely assimilated through the RTCA cycle; and (d) acetate can be assimilated via both of the RTCA as well as the oxidative (forward) TCA (OTCA) cycle. The OTCA cycle revealed herein may explain better cell growth during mixotrophic growth with acetate, as energy is generated through the OTCA cycle. Furthermore, the genes specific for the OTCA cycle are either absent or down-regulated during phototrophic growth, implying that the OTCA cycle is not complete, and CO2 is required for the RTCA cycle to produce metabolites in the TCA cycle.

The Prokaryotes Vol. 7. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 359-378Google Scholar). The RTCA cycle, first reported in a green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum (3Evans M.C. Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1966; 55: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), is essentially the reversal of the oxidative (forward) tricarboxylic acid (OTCA) cycle. Four enzymes have been recruited for the RTCA cycle to catalyze the reverse reaction of four steps in the OTCA cycle (3Evans M.C. Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1966; 55: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar); pyruvate:ferredoxin (Fd) oxidoreductase (acetyl-CoA + CO2 + 2Fdred + 2H+ ⇌ pyruvate + CoA + 2Fdox), ATP citrate lyase (ACL, acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi ⇌ citrate + CoA + ATP), α-keto-glutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (succinyl-CoA + CO2 + 2Fdred + 2H+ ⇌ α-ketoglutartate + CoA + 2Fdox) and fumarare reductase (succinate + acceptor ⇌ fumarate + reduced acceptor). Moreover, several GSBs, C. tepidum included, are potential mixotrophs that use organic carbon sources for producing biomass in the presence of CO2 or HCO3− (2Overmann J.

Fluoroacetate (FAc) is known to be a metabolic poison that is highly toxic to mammals. As a structural analog of acetate, the metabolic pathway of FAc has been suggested to be similar to that of acetate, and the toxicity of FAc can be reduced by acetate (6Gribble G.W. J. Chem. Educ. 1973; 50: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). FAc is known to be an inhibitor for the OTCA cycle (Fig. 1B). Like acetate, FAc is converted into fluoroacetyl-CoA (7Marcus A. Elliott W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 823-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which condenses with oxaloacetate (OAA) to produce (−)-erythro-(2R,3R)-2-fluorocitrate (2-FC) catalyzed by citrate synthase (CS) (8Proudfoot A.T.

Ormerod J.G. Science. 1970; 169: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported decades ago that CO2 assimilation and carbon flux are affected upon addition of FAc during phototrophic growth of the GSB Chlorobium limicola. However, in 2003, Ormerod (12Ormerod J. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 76: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) indicated that it remains to be understood what step of the RTCA cycle is affected by FAc in GSB. In this report, we address two essential questions: why organic carbon sources, in particular acetate, can enhance the growth of C. tepidum (and other GSBs) (5Sadler W.R. Stanier R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1960; 46: 1328-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and why CO2 (or HCO3−) is required for growth when pyruvate or acetate is assimilated. We present studies of the carbon metabolism and probe the effect of FAc on C. tepidum with multiple lines of experimental evidence, including mass spectral analysis of photosynthetic pigments with [13C]acetate or pyruvate, physiological studies of FAc, identification of genes for the RTCA cycle, and activity assays for several key enzymes. Throughout this report, an autotrophic culture also supplied with acetate or pyruvate (acetate or pyruvate + HCO3−) is defined as a “mixotrophic” culture, a classification used in a recent review by Kelly and Wood (13Kelly D.P. Wood A.P. The Prokaryotes Vol. 2. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 441-456Google Scholar). Chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The 13C-labeled acetate and pyruvate were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. The DNA oligomers were from Integrated DNA Technology without further purification. All C. tepidum TLS cultures reported in this work were grown anaerobically at temperatures ranging from 46–50 °C, and cell growth was estimated turbidimetrically at A625. A625 was chosen for evaluating the cell growth because absorbance of photosynthetic pigments is minimal ∼625 nm (14Tang K.H. Yue H. Blankenship R.E. BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The autotrophic and mixotrophic cultures were grown in low intensity light (100 ± 10 micromoles/m2/s), and the list of growth media used in this report and organic carbon sources included in each medium were described previously (2Overmann J. The Prokaryotes Vol. 7. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 359-378Google Scholar). Typically, 1–2% culture (50–100-fold dilution) in the late exponential growth phase was used to inoculate fresh media. The amount of pyruvate and lactate was determined using the methods reported previously (14Tang K.H. Yue H. Blankenship R.E. BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Tang K.H. Feng X. Tang Y.J. Blankenship R.E.

The amount of acetate was determined by a coupled acetyl-CoA synthetase/citrate synthase/malate dehydrogenase assay following the formation of NADH (17Ma K. Hutchins A. Sung S.J. Adams M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The methods used to extract RNA and perform QRT-PCR were described previously (14Tang K.H. Yue H. Blankenship R.E. BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Tang K.H. Feng X. Tang Y.J. Blankenship R.E.

QRT-PCR was performed to profile the gene expression under different growth conditions of C. tepdium. The primers for QRT-PCR in this report are listed in supplemental Table S1. Two biological replicates, with three technical replicates for each biological sample, were performed for validation, and the mean value was reported. The amplified DNA fragments were verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and a single fragment was obtained for all amplicons. Photosynthetic pigments in C. tepidum cultures were extracted as reported previously (14Tang K.H. Yue H. Blankenship R.E. BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mass spectra of bacteriochlorophyll c (BChl c) were acquired using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The MALDI-TOF samples were prepared through mixing a 1:1 volume of sample: matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Sample measurements were described previously (18Tang K.H. Wen J. Li X. Blankenship R.E. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 13C-labeled content of BChl c from mixotrophic cultures with 13C-labeled pyruvate or acetate was calculated using the program IsoPro 3.1. Enzymatic assays were performed with cell-free crude extracts prepared as follows. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0. The cell pellet was resuspended in the same buffer containing 1 mm PMSF. Resuspended cells were disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed with centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Protein concentration in cell extracts was determined by the Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The enzymatic activities of acetyl-CoA synthetase, acetate kinase, ATP citrate lyase, citrate synthase, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, and P-enolpyruvate carboxylase in cell-free extracts were assayed as described previously (20Kim W. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Chen Z.H. Walker R.P. Técsi L.I. Lea P.J. Leegood R.C.

Methods. 2007; 70: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that the RTCA cycle is used for CO2 assimilation when C. tepidum grows photoautotrophically. Consistent with previous studies, we have found that photosynthetic pigments are 13C-labeled in the autotrophic cultures grown on H13CO3− with mass spectrometry (data not shown). To establish conditions for autotrophic or mixotrophic growth of C. tepidum, all of the studies for C. tepidum carried out in this report were performed in the medium containing 0.34% HCO3− (∼40 mm), with or without the inclusion of organic carbon sources. It has been reported that C. tepidum photoassimilates acetate or pyruvate (4Wahlund T.M. Woese C.R. Castenholz R.W. Madigan M.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 156: 81-90Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and we observed that, compared with autotrophic growth, mixotrophic growth is enhanced ∼20% with pyruvate and up to 50% with acetate (Fig. 2A). Additionally, 2–4-fold higher transcript levels were found for most of the genes involved in carbon metabolism during mixotrophic growth compared with autotrophic growth (Table 1). Furthermore, neither acetate nor pyruvate were excreted during autotrophic growth, and at most, 0.2 mm acetate was excreted from the mixotrophic culture with 20 mm pyruvate supplied.TABLE 1Relative transcript levels ΔCT for genes involved in carbon metabolism during autotrophic and mixotrophic growth conditions of C. tepidumGeneGrowth conditionaConcentrations are as follows: HCO3− (Na+), 0.95 m (8%); and acetate, pyruvate, and FAc, 20 mm each.HCO3−Pyruvate + HCO3−Acetate + HCO3−Acetate + FAc + HCO3−gltA (CT1834, citrate synthase)12.8 ± 0.211.0 ± 0.111.2 ± 0.111.4 ± 0.1aclA (CT1088, ACL, α subunit)9.4 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.28.0 ± 0.18.3 ± 0.2aclB (CT1089, ACL, β subunit)8.6 ± 0.17.6 ± 0.17.0 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.1porA (CT1628, pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase)12.8 ± 0.110.5 ± 0.211.6 ± 0.212.3 ± 0.1korB (CT0162, KFOR, bKFOR, α-ketoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PEP, P-enolpyruvate. β subunit)7.5 ± 0.17.2 ± 0.07.9 ± 0.27.4 ± 0.1korA (CT0163, KFOR, α subunit)7.9 ± 0.16.2 ± 0.07.2 ± 0.17.0 ± 0.1acn (CT0543, aconitase)8.4 ± 0.16.5 ± 0.17.3 ± 0.18.2 ± 0.1icd (CT0351, isocitrate dehydrogenase)8.0 ± 0.26.7 ± 0.17.2 ± 0.27.9 ± 0.2ppd (CT1682, pyruvate phosphate dikinase)8.8 ± 0.07.6 ± 0.17.5 ± 0.07.9 ± 0.1ppc (CT1640, PEP carboxylase)6.9 ± 0.15.4 ± 0.16.8 ± 0.26.6 ± 0.1pckA (CT2232, PEP carboxykinase)7.5 ± 0.15.9 ± 0.07.7 ± 0.17.1 ± 0.3acsA (CT1652, acetyl-CoA synthetase)8.6 ± 0.06.9 ± 0.28.0 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.2ackA (CT1525, acetate kinase)5.9 ± 0.15.7 ± 0.16.7 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.0pta (CT1085, phosphotransacetylase)7.9 ± 0.07.8 ± 0.08.9 ± 0.07.7 ± 0.1a Concentrations are as follows: HCO3− (Na+), 0.95 m (8%); and acetate, pyruvate, and FAc, 20 mm each.b KFOR, α-ketoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PEP, P-enolpyruvate. Open table in a new tab To probe incorporation of acetate and pyruvate into biomass, we grew cultures of C. tepidum with unlabeled or 13C-labeled acetate or pyruvate supplied, extracted BChls derived from α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and acetyl-CoA and examined the molecular mass of BChl c (the major pigment in the chlorosome), with MALDI-TOF. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows that peaks corresponding to the demetallization (M-Mg2+ + 2H+) of two BChl c isomers, with Δm/z = 14 (C12 substituent as a methyl or ethyl group), were detected and that BChl c was 13C-labeled with [13C]pyruvate or acetate supplied. Assuming that the carbon number for BChl c in C. tepidum is 50 or 51 (C50H65N4O4 or C51H67N4O4 with C173 farnesyl group and demetallization), the calculated 13C-labeled content of BChl c is reported in Table 2. The 13C-labeling content was estimated using the program IsoPro 3.1 with the peak at m/z 785 and 799 (m/z for BChl c with unlabeled carbon sources). Supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 2 indicate slightly higher 13C-labeled content of BChl c with [2-13C]acetate than with [1-13C]acetate and more 13C-labeled with [2-13C]acetate than with [3-13C]pyruvate.TABLE 2m/z of BChl c with unlabeled or 13C-labeled pyruvate or acetatem/zm/zNo. of 13C-labeled carbonsaThe 13C-labeled percentage on BChl c was estimated using the program IsoPro 3.1 with molecular masses 785.6 and 799.7 for BChl c.13C-Labeled percentageaThe 13C-labeled percentage on BChl c was estimated using the program IsoPro 3.1 with molecular masses 785.6 and 799.7 for BChl c.Unlabeled pyruvate or acetate785.6bThe molecular masses 785.6 and 799.7 correspond to the chemical formulas C50H65N4O4 and C51H67N4O4, with the C173 farnesyl group and demetallization on BChl c.799.7bThe molecular masses 785.6 and 799.7 correspond to the chemical formulas C50H65N4O4 and C51H67N4O4, with the C173 farnesyl group and demetallization on BChl c.00[1-13C]Acetate790.7805.77–814–15[2-13C]Acetate792.8806.8816[1-13C]Pyruvate786.7800.724[3-13C]Pyruvate788.6802.6510a The 13C-labeled percentage on BChl c was estimated using the program IsoPro 3.1 with molecular masses 785.6 and 799.7 for BChl c.b The molecular masses 785.6 and 799.7 correspond to the chemical formulas C50H65N4O4 and C51H67N4O4, with the C173 farnesyl group and demetallization on BChl c. Open table in a new tab To understand the unidentified role(s) of FAc in the growth of GSB, we set up a series of studies to test the growth of C. tepidum with the addition of FAc. Fig. 2A shows that 1 mm FAc is sufficient to inhibit the autotrophic growth of C. tepidum. No growth was detected during 36 h of mixotrophic growth with 10 mm pyruvate and 2 mm FAc (Fig. 2B). Even with 20 mm pyruvate and 2 mm FAc, only very slow cell growth was detected after 2 days (A625 = ∼0.1) (Fig. 2C). Alternatively, significant cell growth can be detected with 10 mm acetate and 2 mm FAc (Fig. 2B) and the transcript levels of genes involved in the RTCA cycle and carbon metabolism are similar with or without FAc added in the mixotrophic culture with acetate (Table 1). It is generally accepted that acetate assimilation is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA synthetase, for which the activity can be detected in the cell extracts of C. tepidum cultures. Using the purified acetyl-CoA synthetase, our kinetic measurements indicate that FAc is a competitive inhibitor of acetate for acetyl-CoA synthetase and that the catalytic efficiency ratio ((kcat/Km)acetate + (kcat/Km)fluoroacetate)/(kcat/Km)fluoroacetate is >400 using the colorimetric assay method reported previously (24Kuang Y. Salem N. Wang F. Schomisch S.J. Chandramouli V. Lee Z. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2007; 70: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the values reported by coupled enzyme assays (25Patel S.S. Walt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7132-7134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that FAc is an alternative and relatively poor substrate for acetyl-CoA synthetase. In addition to the genes required in the RTCA cycle, gltA (CT1834, encoding citrate synthase (CS)) is required for production of citrate in the OTCA cycle and has been annotated in the C. tepidum genome (26Eisen J.A. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Heidelberg J.F. Wu M. Dodson R.J. Deboy R. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Durkin A.S. Kolonay J.L. Yang F. Holt I. Umayam L.A. Mason T. Brenner M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9509-9514Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two gene clusters encoding succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)/fumarate reductase (putative sdhABC, CT2040–2042 and CT2266–2268) have also been annotated in the C. tepidum genome (26Eisen J.A. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Heidelberg J.F. Wu M. Dodson R.J. Deboy R. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Durkin A.S. Kolonay J.L. Yang F. Holt I. Umayam L.A. Mason T. Brenner M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9509-9514Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). NADH-dependent fumarate reductase catalyzes the reduction of fumarate to succinate in the RTCA cycle, and SDH catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the OTCA cycle. It is difficult, however, to predict the function of two putative sdhABC gene clusters in C. tepidium solely from sequence analysis. Additionally, the role of CS in carbon flow of C. tepidum has not been understood. To probe the contribution of CS during phototrophic growth of C. tepidum, and the functions of two sdh gene clusters in C. tepidum, we examined the expression level of gltA versus aclAB (CT1088–1089, encoding both subunits of ATP citrate lyase (ACL; EC 2.3.3.8)) and two sets of the sdhAB genes during autotrophic and mixotrophic growth. Fig. 3A shows the transcriptomic levels of two gene clusters encoding SDH/fumarate reductase after 36 h of autotrophic growth. For two sdhA-like genes, the transcript level of CT2042 is ∼10-fold higher than that of CT2267, and for two sdhB-like genes, CT2041 is ∼7-fold higher than CT2266. Because the carbon flux during autotrophic growth is through the RTCA cycle, the sdhAB-like genes up-regulated during autotrophic growth most likely encode the fumarate reductase protein. Thus, our data suggest that the CT2040–2242 (or CT2266–2268) during autotrophic growth encode fumarate reductase (or SDH). Similar results were also obtained from mixotrophic growth with pyruvate or acetate (data not shown). Moreover, SDH/fumarate reductase-like proteins encoded by CT2040–2042, not CT2266–2268, were also reported by recent proteomic studies (27Kouyianou K. Aivaliotis M. Gevaert K. Karas M. Tsiotis G. Photosynth. Res. 2010; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A also indicates that the transcript level of aclAB is ∼6–10-fold higher than gltA. The CS protein has been previously reported by the proteomic analysis of C. tepidum (27Kouyianou K. Aivaliotis M. Gevaert K. Karas M. Tsiotis G. Photosynth. Res. 2010; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 28Hosoya-Matsuda N. Inoue K. Hisabori T. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 336-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the studies by Hosoya-Matsuda et al. (28Hosoya-Matsuda N. Inoue K. Hisabori T. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 336-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) suggested that CS is inactivated under conditions when ACL is activated. Consistent with their working hypothesis, the enzymatic activity of ACL, not that of CS, can be detected in cell extracts of autotrophic and mixotrophic growth cultures (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S3). Furthermore, we probed the gene expression level of gltA during different stages of the mixotrophic growth with acetate. Fig. 3C shows the gene expression level of gltA versus some essential genes for the RTCA cycle. aclAB versus gltA, aclA (encoding the large subunit of ACL) versus acn (encoding aconitase), and aclA versus korA (encoding the α-subunit of α-keto-glutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase). The relative expression level of aclA/gltA and aclB/gltA is lower during the lag phase and early log phase of the growth and is higher during the late log phase and stationary phase of the growth. In comparison, the relative expression level of aclA versus acn and aclA versus korA is similar during the growth period. Taken together, the transcriptomic analysis and activity assays described above indicate that the major carbon flux during both autotrophic and mixotrophic growth of C. tepidum is through the RTCA cycle. Additionally, the partial OTCA cycle may also contribute to the carbon flux of C. tepidum during mixotrophic growth with acetate, as considered under “Discussion.” Although it has been well established that the RTCA cycle is employed during autotrophic growth of GSBs, the carbon flow during mixotrophic growth has not been understood. To address this unresolved and essential issue, we analyze the multiple lines of evidence listed below for the mixotrophic growth of C. tepidum with acetate or pyruvate. Biosynthesis of (B)Chls requires eight glutamate molecules for forming the Mg2+-chelating tetrapyrrole ring and several molecules of acetyl-CoA for synthesizing the hydrophobic tail. If pyruvate is assimilated mainly through the OTCA cycle, acetyl-CoA, α-KG, and BChls will not be labeled using [1-13C]pyruvate. Alternatively, acetyl-CoA (from cleavage of citrate), α-KG, and BChls are expected to be labeled with [1-13C]pyruvate through the RTCA cycle (supplemental Fig. S3A). Our studies show that two to three carbons were 13C-labeled with [1-13C]pyruvate (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S1D). Less 13C-enriched BChl c can be attributed to fast exchange between pyruvate and acetyl-CoA catalyzed by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and/or 13C-labeled scrambled in succinate. Moreover, Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S1 indicate more 13C-labeled content of BChl c with [2-13C]acetate (16%) than with [3-13C]pyruvate (10%). Both α-KG and acetyl-CoA contribute to 13C-labeled BChl c, and acetyl-CoA is labeled through the RTCA cycle with [2-13C]acetate or [3-13C]pyruvate (supplemental Fig. S3B). Thus, if acetate and pyruvate are photoassimilated exclusively via the RTCA cycle, similar 13C-labeled content of BChl c is expected with [2-13C]acetate versus [3-13C]pyruvate. We propose that higher 13C-labeled content of BChl c with [2-13C]acetate is acquired because acetate is assimilated through both RTCA and OTCA cycles, and more 13C-labeled α-KG is obtained through the OTCA cycle (supplemental Fig. S3B). This hypothesis is supported by our FAc studies, as discussed next. Fig. 2 shows significant inhibition by 2 mm FAc during the mixotrophic growth of C. tepidum with 20 mm pyruvate and less inhibition by FAc during mixotrophic growth with acetate. These results imply that during mixotrophic growth with pyruvate, the metabolic flux favors the formation of P-enolpyruvate (Fig. 4A). With less acetyl-CoA generated from pyruvate to compete with fluoroacetyl-CoA from FAc, the mixotrophic growth with pyruvate is expected to be repressed (Fig. 4C). Alternatively, our studies show that acetate is a much better substrate than FAc for acetyl-CoA synthetase (see “Results”), consistent with less FAc inhibition during mixotrophic growth with acetate (Fig. 2). From the mechanism of action of FAc reported in other organisms, we propose that the inhibition by FAc for the growth of C. limicola and C. tepidum arises from the formation of (−)-erythro-2-FC that blocks the carbon flux of the RTCA cycle. It has not been reported whether (−)-erythro-2-FC can be generated from FAc through the RTCA cycle. Alternatively, (−)-erythro-2-FC may be catalyzed by ACL or/and CS (as discussed below). In contrast, we cannot detect FAc-inhibition in the pyruvate- or acetate-grown photoheterotrophic bacterium Heliobacterium modesticaldum, in which no genes encoding ACL or CS have been annotated (29Sattley W.M. Madigan M.T. Swingley W.D. Cheung P.C. Clocksin K.M. Conrad A.L. Dejesa L.C. Honchak B.M. Jung D.O. Karbach L.E. Kurdoglu A. Lahiri S. Mastrian S.D. Page L.E. Taylor H.L. Wang Z.T. Raymond J. Chen M. Blankenship R.E. Touchman J.W. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4687-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and no activity of ACL or CS has been detected (14Tang K.H. Yue H. Blankenship R.E. BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Together, two conclusions can be reached with the physiological studies of FAc for C. tepidum. One is that low flux from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA is mainly generated in C. tepidum through acetate uptake and the RTCA cycle. Thus, acetyl-CoA production is prohibited through the RTCA cycle when aconitase is inhibited upon addition of FAc. The other conclusion is some of the carbon fluxes through the OTCA cycle during the mixotrophic growth with acetate, consistent with mass spectral evidence presented in this report. As annotated in the C. tepidum genome, genes encoding CS (Clim_2042) and both subunits of ACL (Clim_ 1231 and Clim_1232) have also been annotated in the C. limicola genome. The roles of ACL and CS in GSBs are discussed as follows. The enzymatic activity of ACL can be detected in the cell extracts of C. tepidum (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S3). The reaction catalyzed by ACL is shown below. Citrate +MgATP+CoA⟶←−OAA+acetyl-CoA+MgADP+PiREACTION 1 Note that ACL cleaves the acetyl-moiety in the “pro-S arm” of citrate to produce acetyl-CoA, which is the reverse reaction catalyzed by the common CS (or (Si)-CS). Thus, if the reaction catalyzed by ACL is reversible, ACL may catalyze the formation of (−)-erythro-2-FC from condensation of fluoroacetyl-CoA and OAA during the phototrophic growth of C. tepidum. Although the recombinant ACL from C. limicola was reported to catalyze only the cleavage of citrate (30Kanao T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3409-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), ACL isolated from rat liver (31Inoue H. Suzuki F. Tanioka H. Takeda Y. J. Biochem. 1968; 63: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and several prokaryotic ACL enzymes can catalyze both citrate cleavage and citrate formation through condensation of OAA and acetyl-CoA (32Moller D. Schauder R. Fuchs G. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 202-207Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Beh M. Strauss G. Huber R. Stetter K.O. Fuchs G. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 306-311Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, many enzyme-catalyzed aldol/retro-aldol reactions, such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and transketolases, are reversible both in vivo and in vitro. The recombinant ACL from C. tepidum has been characterized biochemically (20Kim W. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). If the reaction catalyzed by C. tepidum ACL is reversible, citrate can be generated along with ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation, which may provide one of the rationales for better mixotrophic growth with acetate than with pyruvate. CS has been recognized for catalyzing the formation of (−)-erythro-2-FC from OAA and fluoroacetyl-CoA for the inhibition of aconitase (10Villafranca J.J. Platus E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and fluoroacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA have been shown to have similar reactivity with CS (7Marcus A. Elliott W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 823-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies in C. tepidum indicated that CS is inactivated under conditions in which ACL is activated and vice versa (28Hosoya-Matsuda N. Inoue K. Hisabori T. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 336-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, our studies show that the relative gene expression level of gltA/aclA is higher in the earlier stage than in the late stage of the growth and that the transcript level of gltA is higher during acetate uptake and is lower when acetate is assimilated (Fig. 3C). Thus, although the activity of CS has neither been detected previously (28Hosoya-Matsuda N. Inoue K. Hisabori T. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 336-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) nor in our hands (supplemental Fig. S2), one cannot rule out the contribution of CS during phototrophic growth of C. tepidum. The role of CS is currently being investigated with the ΔgltA mutant of C. tepidum. In contrast to heterotrophs, acetate or pyruvate can enhance but cannot be used as a sole carbon source without including CO2 or HCO3− during the growth of GSBs (2Overmann J. The Prokaryotes Vol. 7. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 359-378Google Scholar, 5Sadler W.R. Stanier R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1960; 46: 1328-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of four enzymes responsible for CO2 assimilation in the RTCA cycle were reported in the GSB C. thiosulfatophilum (3Evans M.C. Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1966; 55: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 34Evans M.C. Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Science. 1966; 152: 673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (now Chlorobaculum thiosulfatiphilum) (1Imhoff J.F. Thiel V. Photosynth. Res. 2010; 104: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and we also detected the enzymatic activities of P-enolpyruvate carboxylase and P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (25–40 nmol/min·mg protein) in cell extracts of the autotrophic and mixotrophic cultures of C. tepidum. Together, previous and our studies suggest that the CO2-anaplerotic pathway is active during phototrophic growth of GSBs. The contribution of the CO2-anaplerotic pathway to the carbon metabolism of photoheterotrophic bacteria has also been identified experimentally (14Tang K.H. Yue H. Blankenship R.E. BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Tang K.H. Feng X. Tang Y.J. Blankenship R.E. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to being required for the RTCA cycle, CO2 is essential for assimilating pyruvate and acetate through the CO2-anaplerotic pathway and incorporating acetate through the catalysis of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (acetyl-CoA + CO2 + 2Fdred + 2H+ → pyruvate + CoA + 2Fdox) (Fig. 4). Although the activities for all of the enzymes in the RTCA cycle have been identified (3Evans M.C. Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1966; 55: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), the genes specific for the OTCA cycle are either absent (pdhAB for pyruvate dehydrogenase and sucAB for α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) in the C. tepidum genome or down-regulated (gltA for CS and CT2266–2268 for SDH) during phototrophic growth (Fig. 3A). Thus, only a partial OTCA cycle is expected to be employed by C. tepidum growing phototrophically. The proposed partial OTCA cycle is likely to go through citrate to α-KG because the reactions catalyzed by aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase are reversible (35Kanao T. Kawamura M. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Lebedeva N.V. Malinina N.V. Ivanovsky R.N. Microbiology. 2002; 71: 657-661Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and α-keto-glutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase is more favorable for catalyzing reductive carboxylation of α-KG. Thus, CO2 is required for the RTCA cycle to produce intermediates in the TCA cycle for biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 4). Although GSBs are known to produce biomass through assimilating CO2 via the RTCA cycle, the carbon flow during autotrophic and mixotrophic growth has not been fully understood. Here, we report studies of carbon flow of C. tepidum with multiple lines of experimental evidence, including mass spectral analysis of BChl c with [13C]acetate or pyruvate, physiological studies of FAc, identification of genes for the RTCA cycle, and activity assays for several key enzymes. Our studies demonstrate that C. tepidum utilizes not only the RTCA cycle but also the OTCA cycle that has not been revealed previously, consistent with the metabolic flux analysis of C. tepidum. 3X.

Carbon nanotubes have been proposed as novel nanomaterials that can offer significant advantages for the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids, such as siRNA. We recently demonstrated in a proof-of-principle study that amino-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWNT) can effectively deliver in vivo an siRNA sequence, triggering cell apoptosis that results in human lung xenograft eradication and prolonged survival. In the present study, we demonstrate how a newly synthesized series of polycationic dendron-MWNT constructs with a precisely tailored number of amino functions (dendron generations) can complex and effectively deliver double-stranded siRNA to achieve gene silencing in vitro. A systematic comparison between the f-MWNT series in terms of cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and siRNA complexation is offered. Significant improvement in siRNA delivery with the dendron-MWNT conjugates is shown, and gene silencing was obtained in 2 human cell lines using 2 different siRNA sequences. The study reveals that through f-MWNT structure-biological function analysis novel nanotube-based siRNA transfer vectors can be designed with minimal cytotoxicity and effective delivery and gene-silencing capabilities."

https://openalex.org/W2064615925,"The aim of this study is to identify the exact mechanism(s) by which cytoskeletal structures are modulated during bone resorption. In this study, we have shown the possible role of different actin-binding and signaling proteins in the regulation of sealing ring formation. Our analyses have demonstrated a significant increase in cortactin and a corresponding decrease in L-plastin protein levels in osteoclasts subjected to bone resorption for 18 h in the presence of RANKL, M-CSF, and native bone particles. Time-dependent changes in the localization of L-plastin (in actin aggregates) and cortactin (in the sealing ring) suggest that these proteins may be involved in the initial and maturation phases of sealing ring formation, respectively. siRNA to cortactin inhibits this maturation process but not the formation of actin aggregates. Osteoclasts treated as above but with TNF-α demonstrated very similar effects as observed with RANKL. Osteoclasts treated with a neutralizing antibody to TNF-α displayed podosome-like structures in the entire subsurface and at the periphery of osteoclast. It is possible that TNF-α and RANKL-mediated signaling may play a role in the early phase of sealing ring configuration (i.e. either in the disassembly of podosomes or formation of actin aggregates). Furthermore, osteoclasts treated with alendronate or αv reduced the formation of the sealing ring but not actin aggregates. The present study demonstrates a novel mechanistic link between L-plastin and cortactin in sealing ring formation. These results suggest that actin aggregates formed by L-plastin independent of integrin signaling function as a core in assembling signaling molecules (integrin αvβ3, Src, cortactin, etc.) involved in the maturation process."

The transition is driven by strongly anisotropic interactions within the layer versus with the metal substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2008682063,"Glucose-evoked mitochondrial signals augment ATP synthesis in the pancreatic β cell. This activation of energy metabolism increases the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio, which stimulates plasma membrane electrical activity and insulin granule exocytosis. We have recently demonstrated that matrix pH increases during nutrient stimulation of the pancreatic β cell. Here, we have tested whether mitochondrial matrix pH controls oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism-secretion coupling in the rat β-cell line INS-1E. Acidification of the mitochondrial matrix pH by nigericin blunted nutrient-dependent respiratory and ATP responses (continuously monitored in intact cells). Using electrophysiology and single cell imaging, we find that the associated defects in energy metabolism suppress glucose-stimulated plasma membrane electrical activity and cytosolic calcium transients. The same parameters were unaffected after direct stimulation of electrical activity with tolbutamide, which bypasses mitochondrial function. Furthermore, lowered matrix pH strongly inhibited sustained, but not first-phase, insulin secretion. Our results demonstrate that the matrix pH exerts a control function on oxidative phosphorylation in intact cells and that this mode of regulation is of physiological relevance for the generation of downstream signals leading to insulin granule exocytosis. We propose that matrix pH serves a novel signaling role in sustained cell activation.—Akhmedov, D., Braun, M., Mataki, C., Park, K.-S., Pozzan, T., Schoonjans, K., Rorsman, P., Wollheim, C.

In addition to these actin-nucleating proteins, a recent study has demonstrated that vinculin is capable of nucleating actin assembly in low ionic strength buffer conditions, but the mechanism of actin nucleation by vinculin and its physiological significance are unclear (15Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. DeMali K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30463-30473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The diversity of the mechanisms among these proteins demonstrates that independently evolved proteins have developed distinct ways of achieving the important nucleation function, which are presumably optimized for controlling actin networks in various cellular situations. tropomodulin leucine-rich repeat 1-ethyl-2-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide sulfo-N-hydroxylsulfosuccinimide 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. Tmods are a conserved family of actin filament pointed end-capping proteins. There are four Tmod isoforms (Tmod1–4), each of which is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion (16Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tmod1, which has been studied most extensively, and Tmod3 are expressed in a wide variety of tissues, whereas expression of Tmod2 and Tmod4 is restricted to neuronal tissues and skeletal muscle, respectively (14Conley C.A.

In vivo, Tmods play critical roles in regulating actin dynamics in a wide variety of cytoskeletal structures that are each uniquely modulated (16Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tmod1 is best known for promoting actin filament assembly and regulating filament lengths in myofibrils of striated muscles (21Fritz-Six K.L. Cox P.R. Fischer R.S. Xu B. Gregorio C.C. Zoghbi H.Y.

More recent studies show that Tmod1 also controls actin filament lengths and stability in the spectrin-based membrane skeletons of lens fiber cells (25Nowak R.B. Fischer R.S. Zoltoski R.K. Kuszak J.R. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 915-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and red blood cells (68Moyer J.D. Nowak R.B. Kim N.E. Larkin S.K. Peters L.L. Hartwig J. Kuipers F.A. Fowler V.M. Blood. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Tmod3 is associated with lateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells where it stabilizes actin filaments and maintains cell height (26Weber K.L. Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3625-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tmod3 is also associated with dynamic actin filaments in the leading lamellipodia and ruffles of migrating endothelial cells, where it negatively regulates rates of cell migration (27Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the actin filament pointed end-capping activity of Tmods, which is their best characterized property, may be insufficient to interpret these various experimental phenotypes. Tmods contain two distinct major domains (see Fig. 5A) (16Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). First, the unstructured N-terminal domain contains three functional α-helices and caps the pointed ends of tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments(Fig. 5A) (20Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Greenfield N.J. Kostyukova A.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biophys.

Rapp B.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12068-12075Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The first α-helix in the chicken Tmod1 N-terminal domain (residues 24–35) has been experimentally identified by NMR spectroscopy (28Greenfield N.J. Kostyukova A.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 372-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The second (residues 65–75 in chicken Tmod1) and third (residues 126–135 in chicken Tmod1) α-helices have been identified by secondary structure prediction analysis (29Kostyukova A.S. Choy A. Rapp B.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12068-12075Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Kostyukova A.S. Rapp B.A. Choy A. Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4905-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The first and third α-helices bind to tropomyosin (28Greenfield N.J. Kostyukova A.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 372-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Kostyukova A.S. Choy A. Rapp B.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12068-12075Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the second α-helix is suggested to cap actin filament pointed ends in a tropomyosin-dependent manner, based on elimination of these functionalities by predicted α-helix disrupting mutations (28Greenfield N.J. Kostyukova A.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 372-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Kostyukova A.S. Rapp B.A. Choy A. Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4905-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of Tmod3 can also bind to monomeric actin and sequester it from polymerization (31Fischer R.S. Yarmola E.G. Weber K.L. Speicher K.D. Speicher D.W. Bubb M.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36454-36465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, Tmod3 contains no sequence similarities to any known actin monomer-binding proteins, including the WH2 domain, actin-depolymerizing factor-homology domain, profilin domain, and the actin monomer-binding linker found in JMY and spire (9Zuchero J.B. Coutts A.S. Quinlan M.E. Thangue N.B. Mullins R.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 32Paavilainen V.O. Bertling E. Falck S. Lappalainen P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 386-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, how Tmod3 binds to actin is still unclear, as is the relationship of monomer binding to tropomyosin binding or actin capping, and to Tmod functions in vivo. Second, the C-terminal half of Tmods is compact, folded, and composed of a series of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) with an associated C-terminal α-helix (α6) that contains a tropomyosin-independent actin pointed end-capping activity (Fig. 5A) (20Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that the α6-helix is critical for tropomyosin-independent actin pointed end-capping by chicken Tmod1 (20Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, which residues in the C-terminal domain of Tmod are essential for pointed end capping remains unclear. In addition to these activities, our previous studies have shown that chicken Tmod1 and human Tmod3 can promote actin assembly with different efficiencies in vitro, suggesting that Tmods may have actin-nucleating activity (20Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Fischer R.S. Yarmola E.G. Weber K.L. Speicher K.D. Speicher D.W. Bubb M.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36454-36465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, which domains are responsible and how Tmods promote actin polymerization have not yet been investigated. In this study, we show that mammalian Tmod1–3 nucleate actin filament assembly. By characterizing truncated fragments and point mutations of Tmod3, we found that the actin-nucleating activity of Tmods depended on two distinct actin-binding activities. The first is actin monomer-binding activity, conferred by α-helix2 in the N-terminal domain, which is conserved among all Tmod isoforms that we tested. The second is actin pointed end-capping activity, conferred by the β-sheet of the fifth LRR and α6-helix in the C-terminal domain, which is conserved among Tmod1, Tmod3, and Tmod4 (20Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These biochemical results suggest a mechanistic model for actin nucleation by Tmods and provide new insights into the interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of Tmods with the pointed end of actin monomers and filaments. Full-length mouse Tmod3 and Tmod4 were inserted in-frame in the pGEX-KG vector so as to code for a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) on the N-terminal end of Tmod3 and Tmod4. Site-specific mutations were generated by the two-step PCR protocol (33Kuipers O.P. Boot H.J. de Vos W.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or a QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pGEX-KG-mouse Tmod3 as a template. cDNAs encoding GST fusion proteins with various Tmod3 fragments were inserted in the BamHI and EcoRI sites in the linker region of the pGEX-KG vector using the PCR with appropriate primers and pGEX-KG mouse Tmod3 as a template. The primers used are shown in supplemental Table 1. The entire Tmod3 and Tmod4 coding region of each plasmid was sequenced to confirm the presence of introduced mutations and the absence of PCR-induced errors. GST fusion Tmod3 and Tmod4, mutant Tmod3, and Tmod3 fragments were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (20Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol.

Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from acetone powder as described previously (35Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared and stored as described previously (36Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Prior to use in assays, actin was dialyzed several times against freshly prepared buffer A (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT) and then centrifuged for 1 h at 148,000 × g to remove minor amounts of aggregated material. Gelsolin was a gift from J. Bryan (Baylor College of Medicine, Dallas, TX) and was prepared as described previously (37Bryan J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined for actin and gelsolin by absorption at 290 or 280 nm with E290 = 24.9 mm−1 cm−1 and E280 = 150 mm−1 cm−1, respectively (19Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To measure actin nucleation, 4 μm of G-actin (8% pyrenyl) was converted to Mg2+-actin as described previously (38Young C.L. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and then the indicated concentrations of Tmod1–4, Tmod3 fragments, or mutant Tmod3 were added and incubated for 1 min. Polymerization was then initiated by the addition of one-tenth volume of 10× polymerizing buffer (200 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 m KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm EGTA). Fluorescence measurements (excitation = 366.5 nm and emission = 407 nm) were made using a Fluoromax 3 fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). To assay for barbed end elongation, 0.6 μm G-actin (8% pyrenyl) was polymerized in the presence or absence of 50 nm Tmod3 or 5 nm cytochalasin D. The concentration of barbed ends was calculated from the elongation rate (measured by the rate of polymerization, where 50% of monomers were polymerized) as described previously (20Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Measurements of elongation rates at the pointed end were performed using 2.5 μm G-actin (8% pyrenyl) and 10 nm gelsolin-capped actin filaments (gelsolin/actin, 1:10) as nuclei for polymerization as described previously (19Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 20Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Capping activity for Tmod3 wild type, mutant proteins, and fragments were obtained from the initial elongation rates, measured directly from the slopes of the polymerization traces over the first 1 min. Rates in the presence of increasing concentrations of Tmod (100 nm to 1 μm) were divided by the rate for actin in the absence of Tmod, giving a rate/control rate. The theoretical elongation rates were calculated using the two equations to describe Tmod3 binding to actin monomers (Equation 1) and to describe the rate of actin elongation at pointed ends (Equation 2), where K+ is the rate constant for association of ATP-actin subunits at the pointed end = 1.3 μm−1 s−1 (39Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Kd for Tmod 3 binding to G-actin =([ G-actin ]tot −[ G-actin − Tmod3 ] ) ([Tmod⁡3]tot −[ G-actin:Tmod 3])/[ G-actin:Tmod3 ](Eq. 1) rate of polymerization =[ pointed ends ][K+⋅[G -actin ]](Eq. 2) Assuming that Tmod3 possesses only G-actin-binding and -sequestering activities, we calculated a theoretical pointed end elongation rate as follows. First, the concentrations of the G-actin-Tmod3 complex were calculated using Equation 1, where the Kd for Tmod3-actin monomer binding was Kd = 0.51 μm (31Fischer R.S. Yarmola E.G. Weber K.L. Speicher K.D. Speicher D.W. Bubb M.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36454-36465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), total G-actin = 2.5 μm, and total Tmod3 = 100 nm to 1 μm as described above. The rate of polymerization in each assay was then calculated using Equation 2, where [pointed ends] = 10 nm (the concentration of the pointed ends of gelsolin-capped actin seeds in this assay), K+ = 1.3 μm (39Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and [G-actin] = total [G-actin] (2.5 μm) − [G-actin-Tmod3 complex]. Because the concentration of pointed ends (10 nm) and the association rate of actin for pointed ends (1.3 μm) are stable in Equation 2, the theoretical rate of polymerization is in direct proportion to [G-actin] if Tmod3 does not cap the pointed end. Cross-linking of G-actin and Tmod3 was performed as described previously (31Fischer R.S. Yarmola E.G. Weber K.L. Speicher K.D. Speicher D.W. Bubb M.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36454-36465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, G-actin and wild-type or mutant Tmod3 were exchanged into a buffer containing 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Pierce). G-actin and Tmod3 were combined at a 1:1 molar ratio at 10 μm each and then incubated for 20 min with 1 mm of EDC (Pierce) and 1 mm of sulfo-NHS (Pierce) at room temperature. Following addition of 10 mm hydroxylamine to stop the reaction, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using various percent acrylamide as indicated in figures. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma). Nondenaturing PAGE was performed as described by Safer (41Safer D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). G-actin and Tmod1–4, Tmod3 fragments, or Tmod3 mutants at indicated concentrations were incubated in buffer A for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were then supplemented with 0.25 volume of a loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed using a Bicine/triethanolamine buffer system. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. G-actin alone, Tmod3 alone, or the mixture of G-actin and Tmod3 at indicated concentrations were incubated in buffer A for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged for 20 min at 285,000 × g to remove aggregates. The samples were characterized by a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in buffer A. The elution profiles were determined from absorption at 280 nm using a Monitor UV-900 (GE"

The spreading and migration observed in FLNA sufficient A7 melanoma cells but not in the parental FLNA deficient M2 cells have been attributed to FLNA. In A7 and M2 cells, the normal prion (PrP) exists as pro-PrP, retaining its glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor peptide signal sequence (GPI-PSS). The GPI-PSS of PrP has a FLNA binding motif and binds FLNA. Reducing PrP expression in A7 cells alters the spatial distribution of FLNA and organization of actin and diminishes cell spreading and migration. Integrin β1 also binds FLNA. In A7 cells, FLNA, PrP, and integrin β1 exist as two independent, yet functionally linked, complexes; they are FLNA with PrP or FLNA with integrin β1. Reducing PrP expression in A7 cells decreases the amount of integrin β1 bound to FLNA. A PrP GPI-PSS synthetic peptide that crosses the cell membrane inhibits A7 cell spreading and migration. Thus, in A7 cells FLNA does not act alone; the binding of pro-PrP enhances association between FLNA and integrin β1, which then promotes cell spreading and migration. Pro-PrP is detected in melanoma in situ but not in melanocyte. Invasive melanoma has more pro-PrP. The binding of pro-PrP to FLNA, therefore, contributes to melanomagenesis.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Despite its importance in cellular biology, FLNA is dispensable for cell-autonomous survival. Human melanoma cell lines, such as M2 and M3 do not express FLNA. These cells lack actin fiber bundles and are less mobile in vitro (3Byers H.R. Etoh T. Doherty J.R. Sober A.J. Mihm Jr., M.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 423-435PubMed Google Scholar). The deficiency is restored in the A7 cell, which is derived from the M2 cell by transfection of a plasmid encoding human FLNA (4Cunningham C.C.

This pair of isogenic cell lines has been used extensively for studying FLNA function. Biological properties observed in A7 cells, but not in M2 cells, are attributed solely to FLNA function (4Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P.

The normal prion protein, PrP, is a highly conserved, widely expressed, GPI-anchored cell surface glycoprotein. Although the expression of PrP is essential for the pathogenesis of prion diseases (12Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5051) Google Scholar, 13Weissmann C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), its normal function remains unclear (14Chiesa R. Harris D.A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e75Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PrP is first synthesized as pre-pro-PrP. After removing the N-terminal signal sequence and the C-terminal GPI-PSS in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a GPI anchor and two N-linked glycans are added, thus, forming a mature GPI-anchored PrP. Recently, we discovered that in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines, PrP existed as pro-PrP, retaining its GPI-PSS. Unexpectedly, the GPI-PSS of PrP contained a FLNA binding motif. The binding of pro-PrP to FLNA altered the cytoskeleton and signaling events, thus, providing a growth advantage to the PDAC cell lines (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on our findings that down-regulation of PrP expression in the PDAC cell lines reduces their proliferation and invasiveness in vitro and their growth in vivo as xenografts in nude mice. In the PDAC cell lines the failure to remove the GPI-PSS of PrP is not due to a global defect in the GPI anchor machinery; CD55, a normally GPI-anchored protein, remained GPI-anchored in the PDAC cell lines. The FLNA binding motif furthermore is present only on the GPI-PSS of PrP and was absent on the GPI-PSS of 14 other normally GPI-anchored proteins (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We also rule out the possibility that the failure to remove the GPI-PSS is due to a mutation in the coding region of PRNP. In a normal human pancreas, PrP was only detectable in islet cells; neither acinar cells nor ductal cells had detectable PrP. About 40% of patients with PDAC, however, expressed PrP in their cancer. Most importantly, these patients had significantly shorter survival times compared with patients whose PDAC lacked PrP (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the presence of pro-PrP and its binding to FLNA provided a growth advantage to human pancreatic cancer cells, thus, enabling the tumor cell to become more aggressive. However, the underlying mechanism by which the binding of pro-PrP to FLNA provided a growth advantage to a cancer cell was not known. The M2 and A7 melanoma cell lines offer a unique model for studying FLNA function. Here, we report that in M2 and A7 cells, PrP also exists as pro-PrP and binds FLNA. One of the best-characterized FLNA binding partners is integrin β1 (16Loo D.T. Kanner S.B. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23304-23312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In A7 cells, the binding of pro-PrP to FLNA enhances the binding of FLNA to integrin β1, ultimately regulating cell spreading and migration. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which the presence of pro-PrP modulates the functionality of FLNA and integrin β1. Finally, we show that pro-PrP is detected in melanoma in situ but not in normal melanocytes. Invasive melanoma in the dermal component has more pro-PrP. We hypothesize that the presence of pro-PrP may be important for the neoplastic transformation of melanocytes and the progression of melanoma. Prevention of this interaction may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of human melanoma. The generation and culture of the melanoma cell lines M2 and A7 have been described (3Byers H.R. Etoh T. Doherty J.R. Sober A.J. Mihm Jr., M.C. Am. J.

Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), Triton X-100, Tween 20, brefeldin A (BFA), and phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) were purchased from Sigma. Tumor cell lines were cultured in poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottom Petri dishes (MatTek) overnight. Cells were then rinsed 3× with ice-cold DPBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 20 °C. PrP or FLNA was detected with anti-PrP mAb 8H4 or anti-FLNA mAb PM6/317 (0.01 μg/μl). Bound antibody was detected with an Alexa fluor 488-nm-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig-specific antibody. For pro-PrP staining, cells treated similarly were stained with a 1:100 dilution of the affinity-purified rabbit anti-PrP-GPI-PSS antiserum. Bound rabbit antibody was detected with an Alexa fluor 555-nm-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig-specific antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. F-actin was detected with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin. Samples were analyzed on a LSM 510 META confocal microscope at The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Image Core Facility. For double staining of FLNA and integrin β1, overnight-cultured cells were fixed as above and washed three times. Rabbit anti-FLNA and mouse anti-integrin β1 antibodies were added to the cultured cells as suggested by the manufacturers. Bound mouse and rabbit antibodies were detected with Alexa fluor 488-nm-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa fluor 555-nm-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies. For double staining of pro-PrP and FLNA, affinity-purified rabbit anti-pro-PrP and mouse anti-FLNA were added (0.01 μg/μl). Bound antibodies were detected as above. Double staining of FLNA and PrP was performed as described previously (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To locate PrP in Golgi or ER, PrP was detected as above, Golgi was detected with Bodipy™ F-C5 ceramide BSA complex, and ER was detected with rabbit anti-calnexin. Bound antibodies were detected with Alexa fluor 555-nm-conjugated donkey and rabbit antibody. Experiments were repeated at least twice with comparable results. Tumor cells were seeded overnight as described. The next day tumor cells were first washed three times with ice-cold DPBS and then treated with trypsin/EDTA to prepare a single cell suspension of the tumor cells. After washing twice with DPBS, cells were incubated with phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (500× dilution of 1 unit) at 37 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with DPBS and then stained with control antibody or 8H4 as described (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All samples were then analyzed in a BD Biosciences FACS™ flow cytometer. For BFA treatment of cells, 0.35 μm BFA were added in cultured cells for specified periods of time in culture condition. Cell surface PrP staining was performed as described in above. Tumor cells were seeded overnight, and lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm PMSF, and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture was added just before cell lysis. PrP was subjected to peptide N-glycosidase F treatment according to the protocols provided by the provider. After treatment, samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-PrP mAb. To detect GPI-PSS on PrP, mAb 8B4 affinity-purified PrP was separated and detected with affinity-purified rabbit anti PrP-GPI-PSS. To study signal transduction molecules change in PrP down-regulated cells, control and PrP knocking down cells were grown overnight. The next morning cells were rinsed three times with DPBS and incubated with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min. After aspirating off the medium, fresh culture medium were added, and the cells were incubated for additional 10 min. Cell lysate was made as above. Signal transduction molecules were detected using various mAbs and the protocols suggested by manufacturers. To identify proteins that are bound to PrP, cell lysates were prepared in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-PrP mAb 8B4 or control, irrelevant mAb D7C7 that was conjugated to-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were eluted using IgG elution buffer (Pierce). The eluted proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel, Bio-Rad) and then immunoblotted with anti-FLNA or anti-integrin β1 mAb. Bound antibody was detected with a goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase antibody using the chemiluminescence blotting system (Pierce). Similar approaches were used to determine whether FLNA co-purifies with integrin β1 using anti-integrin β1 mAb. Experiments were repeated at least twice with comparable results. 400 μl of cell lysate from each cell type was loaded into the mAb 8B4 column. Because the PrP GPI-PSS is rather insoluble, a KKRPK motif was added to the N terminus of the PrP to increase is solubility. Control peptide also has the KKRPK motif followed by 21 irrelevant amino acids. Synthetic peptides in the indicated amounts were also added as well as 4 μl of PMSF and 1 μl of DMSO/column. The columns were placed at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking, and bound proteins eluted as described by us (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were separated in a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with anti-FLNA mAb (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N.

All the recombinant FLNA proteins and the individual FLNA domains were prepared as described (19Nakamura F. Osborn T.M. Hartemink C.A. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1011-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In in vitro pulldown assays, 250 ng of GST-tagged FLNA was mixed with 1.2 μg of recombinant PrP23–253 or recombinant rPrP mutants in 400 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Tween 20). The tubes were rocked slowly and incubated at 20 °C for 1 h. Then 3 μg of anti-PrP mAb 8H4 was added and incubated for another hour with gentle rocking. 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads (pre-equilibrated with binding buffer) was then added for 30 min. The beads were washed ×5 with binding buffer for 5 min. Subsequently, beads were resuspended in 15 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. The proteins were separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. FLNA was detected with anti-GST tag mAb (Sigma, 1:1000 dilution, 4 °C overnight). After second antibody incubation and washing, the membrane was developed as described above. On the same membrane, input recombinant rPrPs were detected with anti-PrP mAb 8B4. All experiments were repeated at least twice with comparable results. Single cell suspension of the tumor cells were prepared and counted. Equal numbers of the tumor cells (1 × 104) were then platted in a 96-well tissue culture plates in triplicates. At different times after culture, the cells from each well were harvested and counted. The results presented are the mean ± S.E. of two experiments. The complex of FLNA-23 with bound PrP GPI-PSS peptide was modeled with HOMODGE in BODIL (20Lehtonen J.V. Still D.J. Rantanen V.V.

Intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the interaction areas between FLNA-23 and bound PrP GPI-PSS peptide were optimized by using side-chain rotamer library (22Lovell S.C. Word J.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2000; 40: 389-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) incorporated within BODIL. For the inducible system, we used the BLOCK-iT®-inducible H1 lentiviral RNAi system (Invitrogen) to generate PrP down-regulated M2 or A7 cell lines by following the manufacturer's guideline. The sequence of shRNA-10 has been described (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The sequence of shRNA-12 was 5′-gctcagtatactaatgccctatctt-3′, the sequence of inducible control shRNA, (shRNA-Cont) was 5′-acccgacaacatttctgccaggttt-3′. For non-inducible knockdown, shRNA-10, shRNA-12, or a scramble sequence were directly transfected into M2 and A7 cells using protocols suggested by the manufacturer. 48 h after transfection 50 μg/ml Geneticin was added to the medium. The PrP expression levels were quantified by immunoblot with anti-PrP mAb. Experiments were repeated at least three times with independently derived, pooled, transfectants. The constitutive system was carried out as described (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To study the effects of PrP down-regulation on cell spreading, a single suspension of PrP down-regulated or control cells was seeded in a 24-well tissue culture plate in triplicate and cultured for 2 h. The cells were then counted in a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. The results presented were the mean ± S.D. of two experiments. To study peptide effects on cell spreading, cells were cultured with the PrP GPI-PSS synthetic peptide, KKRPKPPVILLISFLIFL-IVG (Peptide 2), or a control peptide, KKRPKDMDYLPRVPNQG-IIIN-PMLSD (Peptide2), overnight at specified concentrations. After that, single cell suspensions were prepared and counted. Same numbers of cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates in triplicate. Thirty minutes later the numbers of cells with adherent morphology or in suspension in each well were counted in a microscope. The results presented were the mean of the two experiments ± S.E. To study the effects of PrP down-regulation on cell migration, shRNA-10 and control cells were seeded and allowed to grow to confluence then either induced or not induced. A wound was inflicted by scraping across the cell layer with a 200-μl sterile peptide tip. The cells were incubated for various lengths of time followed by imaging on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with an AxioCam digital camera system. Average wound area was quantified in the picture using ImageJ software (means ± S.E. of the two experiments). Inhibition of cell migration was determined by comparing the healed area of control cells with the healed areas of PrP down-regulated cells. To study the effects of peptide on wound healing, the same approach was adopted. A7 cells grown to confluence were inflicted with a 200-μl pipette tip. Inhibition of cell migration was determined by comparing with the healed area of non-treated cells with the healed areas of cells treated either with various concentrations of the PrP GPI-PSS synthetic peptide or a control, irrelevant synthetic peptide. All peptides were added right after the creation of the wound. Percent inhibition was calculated as 100 × (one-healed area of treated cells/healed area of non-treated cells). Experiments were repeated twice with comparable results. Unstained 5-μm sections were cut from the paraffin blocks of selected cases and de-paraffinized using standard techniques. Slides were treated with 1× sodium citrate buffer (diluted from 10 × heat-induced epitope retrieval buffer; Ventana-Bio Tek Solutions, Tucson, AZ) before heating for 20 min in a microwave. Slides were then cooled at room temperature for 20 min and incubated with 3% w/v H2O2 for 10 min. The anti-PrP mAb 8H4 or affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-PrP GPI-PSS antibody was then added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. An irrelevant monoclonal antibody or normal rabbit Ig was included in all the experiments as a negative control. After serial washing, a biotinylated goat anti-mouse Ig antibody or a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Ig antibody was added followed by the avidin-biotin complex and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromagens (Dako Inc.). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Each slide was coded and evaluated independently. The cytoplasmic and membrane staining intensity and distribution of each sample were graded as highly positive (>50% neoplastic cells stained strongly positive) or negative (<5% neoplastic cells stained). The study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Investigation of the University Hospital Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH. Student's t test or analysis of variance test were applied, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. As expected, FLNA was detected only in A7 cells but not in M2 cells (Fig. 1A). However, both M2 and A7 cells expressed PrP. A glycosylated, GPI-anchored PrP has a molecular mass of about 34 kDa (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N. Tartakoff A. Abbott D.W. Xin W. Sy M.S.. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, PrP from M2 and A7 cells migrated as a 26-kDa protein (Fig. 1A). PrP was present on the cell surface of M2 and A7 cells at a comparable level, as judged by immunofluorescent staining of M2 and A7 cells with multiple anti-PrP mAbs with distinct epitopes (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, we find that PrP is unglycosylated and exists as pro-PrP in M2 and A7 cells, as in PDAC. This conclusion is based on the following; 1) treatment of PrP with endoglycosidase-F did not alter its mobility in SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1B); 2) the cell surface PrP was resistant to phospholipase C (supplemental Fig. S1C); 3) the PrP reacted with a polyclonal antiserum that is specific for the GPI-PSS of PrP (supplemental Fig. S1D). Results of immunofluorescent staining further confirms the presence of FLNA in A7 cells but not in M2 cells (Fig. 1B). In A7 cells, FLNA was associated with the inner membrane leaflet in the leading edges (Fig. 1B, bottom panel, arrows identify leading edges). The spatial distributions of PrP also differed noticeably in M2 and A7 cells. In M2 cells, most of the PrP was on the cell membrane, in areas of cell-cell contact (Fig. 1B, arrows show cell-cell contact areas). In contrast, PrP was concentrated in the membrane ruffle areas in A7 cells (Fig. 1B, solid arrows show leading edges) and in the cytosol (Fig. 1B, dashed arrows). The distribution of actin filaments also differed between A7 and M2 cells. In M2 cells, actin filaments were distributed around the periphery of the cells (Fig. 1B). In A7 cells, the actin filaments were better organized with readily identifiable stress fibers that were concentrated at the leading edges (Fig. 1B, solid arrows; the dashed arrow shows the leading edge) in the same area where PrP and FLNA were localized. In the cytosol, staining with organelle-specific markers revealed that some, but not all of the cytosolic PrP was associated with the Golgi and the ER (Fig. 1B, arrows show co-localization), suggesting the presence of PrP in other cellular compartments in addition to the Golgi and the ER. Next we confirmed that pro-PrP indeed interacts with FLNA in A7 cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoblotting of proteins co-purified with PrP using an anti-FLNA-specific mAb detects FLNA (Fig. 1C, left top panel). Conversely, immunoblotting of proteins co-purified with FLNA in A7 cells using an anti-PrP mAb identified PrP (Fig. 1C, right top panel). Finally, co-purification of PrP and FLNA was competitively inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the GPI-PSS of PrP but not by an irrelevant peptide (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). PrP and FLNA also co-localized in the leading edges of A7 cells (Fig. 1D, arrows show co-localization). Staining with the anti-PrP-GPI-PSS antibody showed the co-localization of pro-PrP and FLNA (Fig. 1D, arrows show co-localization). Because cell surface PrP is physically associated with FLNA in A7 cells, we hypothesize that PrP on the cell surface of A7 cells may be more stable and, thus, have a longer half-life. We find that on the cell surface of M2 cells, PrP has a half-life of about 5–6 h. In contrast, the half-life of cell surface PrP on A7 cells is about 10–12 h (Fig. 1E). Thus, anchoring of PrP to FLNA indeed stabilizes PrP on the cell surface. We find that a full-length FLNA1–24 dimer binds pro-PrP (15Li C. Yu S. Nakamura F. Yin S. Xu J. Petrolla A.A. Singh N.

Subsequently, we found that the pro-PrP binding domain on FLNA is located between domains 10 and 24 (supplemental Fig. S2). Next, we prepare individual FLNA domains with a GST tag, which allows the individual domains to dimerize, and then determined which domain binds pro-PrP. We found that pro-PrP binds domains 10, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, or 23 but not domains 11, 19, 22, or 24 (Fig. 2A). Pro-PrP appears to bind domain 23 better than other"
https://openalex.org/W2168488088,"The NFκB pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of osteoclast activity, and activation of the pathway is dependent on IκB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates IκB, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Pharmacological inhibitors of IKK exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and prevent bone erosions in models of inflammatory arthritis. However, the effects of these agents on osteoblast function and ovariectomy-induced bone loss remain unknown. Here we examined the effects of the IKK inhibitors celastrol, BMS-345541, and parthenolide on bone cell function in vitro and ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo. All three compounds inhibited RANKL-induced signaling in osteoclasts, caused osteoclast apoptosis, and inhibited osteoclast formation. Although parthenolide and BMS-345541 had no inhibitory effects on osteoblast function, celastrol prevented IL1β-induced TAK1 activation and inhibited osteoblast growth, differentiation, and bone nodule formation. The selective IKK inhibitors parthenolide and BMS-345541 prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption. We conclude that pharmacological inhibitors of IKK inhibit several critical signaling pathways in osteoclasts necessary for cell survival, formation, and activity in vitro and bone loss in vivo. Accordingly, IKK inhibitors may be of value in the prevention and treatment of bone diseases characterized by increased bone loss such as postmenopausal osteoporosis.—Idris, A.

https://openalex.org/W2003760792,"Many siderophores used for the uptake and intracellular storage of essential iron contain hydroxamate chelating groups. Their biosyntheses are typically initiated by hydroxylation of the primary amine side chains of l-ornithine or l-lysine. This reaction is catalyzed by members of a widespread family of FAD-dependent monooxygenases. Here the kinetic mechanism for a representative family member has been extensively characterized by steady state and transient kinetic methods, using heterologously expressed N(5)-l-ornithine monooxygenase from the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Spectroscopic data and kinetic analyses suggest a model in which a molecule of hydroxylatable substrate serves as an activator for the reaction of the reduced flavin and O(2). The rate acceleration is only ∼5-fold, a mild effect of substrate on formation of the C4a-hydroperoxide that does not influence the overall rate of turnover. The effect is also observed with the bacterial ornithine monooxygenase PvdA. The C4a-hydroperoxide is stabilized in the absence of hydroxylatable substrate by the presence of bound NADP(+) (t(½) = 33 min, 25 °C, pH 8). NADP(+) therefore is a likely regulator of O(2) and substrate reactivity in the siderophore-associated monooxygenases. Aside from the activating effect of the hydroxylatable substrate, the siderophore-associated monooxygenases share a kinetic mechanism with the hepatic microsomal flavin monooxygenases and bacterial Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases, with which they share only moderate sequence homology and from which they are distinguished by their acute substrate specificity. The remarkable specificity of the N(5)-l-ornithine monooxygenase-catalyzed reaction suggests added means of reaction control beyond those documented in related well characterized flavoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2070479500,"Genetic crosses in many organisms have shown that alleles of unlinked genes generally assort independently of one another during gamete formation. However, variation in chromosome size may affect the process of meiosis and lead to nonindependent assortment of chromosomes. We therefore examined chromosomes with insertions and found that they preferentially segregated away from the X chromosome during meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans males. Conversely, chromosomes with deletions preferentially segregated with the X chromosome. The degree of segregation bias was significantly associated with the length of the insertion or deletion. Simulations revealed that this segregation bias leads to genome size reduction in hermaphroditic species, a pattern consistent with differences in genome sizes in the genus Caenorhabditis. These results suggest that insertions and deletions may affect chromosome segregation patterns."

Inherited deficiency of HGSNAT in humans results in lysosomal storage of heparan sulfate and causes the severe neurodegenerative disease, mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC). Previously we have cloned the HGSNAT gene, identified molecular defects in MPS IIIC patients, and found that all missense mutations prevented normal folding and trafficking of the enzyme. Therefore characterization of HGSNAT biogenesis and intracellular trafficking became of central importance for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the disease and developing future therapies.In the current study we show that HGSNAT is synthesized as a catalytically inactive 77-kDa precursor that is transported to the lysosomes via an adaptor protein-mediated pathway that involves conserved tyrosine- and dileucine-based lysosomal targeting signals in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with a contribution from a dileucine-based signal in the N-terminal cytoplasmic loop. In the lysosome, the precursor is cleaved into a 29-kDa N-terminal α-chain and a 48-kDa C-terminal β-chain, and assembled into active ∼440-kDa oligomers. The subunits are held together by disulfide bonds between at least two cysteine residues (Cys123 and Cys434) in the lysosomal luminal loops of the enzyme. We speculate that proteolytic cleavage allows the nucleophile residue, His269, in the active site to access the substrate acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm, for further transfer of the acetyl group to the terminal glucosamine on heparan sulfate. Altogether our results identify intralysosomal oligomerization and proteolytic cleavage as two steps crucial for functional activation of HGSNAT.

https://openalex.org/W2034138134,"Three sequential methylations of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) are required for the synthesis of phosphocholine (PCho) in plants. A cDNA encoding an N-methyltransferase that catalyzes the last two methylation steps was cloned from Arabidopsis by heterologous complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cho2, opi3 mutant. The cDNA encodes phosphomethylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PMEAMT), a polypeptide of 475 amino acids that is organized as two tandem methyltransferase domains. PMEAMT shows 87% amino acid identity to a related enzyme, phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase, an enzyme in plants that catalyzes all three methylations of PEA to PCho. PMEAMT cannot use PEA as a substrate, but assays using phosphomethylethanolamine as a substrate result in both phosphodimethylethanolamine and PCho as products. PMEAMT is inhibited by the reaction products PCho and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, a property reported for phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase from various plants. An Arabidopsis mutant with a T-DNA insertion associated with locus At1g48600 showed no transcripts encoding PMEAMT. Shotgun lipidomic analyses of leaves of atpmeamt and wild-type plants generated phospholipid profiles showing the content of phosphatidylmethylethanolamine to be altered relative to wild type with the content of a 34:3 lipid molecular species 2-fold higher in mutant plants. In S. cerevisiae, an increase in PtdMEA in membranes is associated with reduced viability. This raises a question regarding the role of PMEAMT in plants and whether it serves to prevent the accumulation of PtdMEA to potentially deleterious levels."

We recently reported that TGF-β1-stimulated collagen expression by cultured kidney cells requires integrin-dependent activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and consequent ERK MAP kinase activity leading to Smad3 linker region phosphorylation. Here, we defined a role for αvβ3-integrin in this non-canonical pathway. A human kidney tubular cell line in which β1-integrin was knocked down (β1-k/d) demonstrated enhanced type I collagen mRNA expression and promoter activity. A second shRNA to either αv-integrin or β3-integrin, but not to another αv-binding partner, β6-integrin, abrogated the enhanced COL1A2 promoter activity in β1-k/d cells. Although αvβ3-integrin surface expression levels were not different, αvβ3-integrins colocalized with sites of focal adhesion significantly more in β1-k/d cells, and activated αvβ3-integrin was detected only in β1-k/d cells. Further, the collagen response was decreased by a function-blocking antibody or a peptide inhibitor of αvβ3-integrin. In cells lacking αvβ3-integrin, the responses were attenuated, whereas the response was enhanced in αvβ3-overexpressing cells. Rac1 and ERK, previously defined mediators for this non-canonical pathway, showed increased activities in β1-k/d cells. Finally, inhibition of αvβ3-integrin decreased Rac1 activity and COL1A2 promoter activity in β1-k/d cells. Together, our results indicate that decreasing β1 chain causes αvβ3-integrin to become functionally dominant and promotes renal cell fibrogenesis via Rac1-mediated ERK activity.

https://openalex.org/W2134556466,"As a hepatic receptor for triglyceriderich lipoproteins, the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) may be involved in the dynamics of lipid distribution between the liver and peripheral tissues. Here, we explore the potential role of leptin in regulating LSR. At physiological concentrations (1–10 ng/ml), leptin increased LSR protein and mRNA levels in Hepa1–6 cells through an ERK1/2-dependent and α-amanitin-sensitive pathway. In vivo, leptin treatment of C57BL6/Rj mice (1 µg2×/d, 8 d) led to a significant increase in hepatic LSR mRNA and protein, decreased liver triglycerides and increased VLDL secretion as compared to controls. LSR+/− mice with elevated postprandial lipemia placed on a high-fat (60% kcal) diet exhibited accelerated weight gain and increased fat mass as compared to controls. While plasma leptin levels were increased 3-fold, hepatic leptin receptor protein levels and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 were significantly reduced. Therefore, leptin is an important regulator of LSR protein levels providing the means for the control of hepatic uptake of lipids during the postprandial phase. However, this may no longer be functional in LSR+/− mice placed under a chronic dietary fat load, suggesting that this animal model could be useful for the study of molecular mechanisms involved in peripheral leptin resistance.—Stenger, C., Hanse, M., Pratte, D., Mbala, M.-L., Akbar, S., Koziel, V., Escanyé, M.-C., Kriem, B., Malaplate-Armand, C., Olivier, J.-L., Oster, T., Pillot, T., Yen, F.

https://openalex.org/W1968632190,"Glycolipid glycosyltransferases (GGT) are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, their site of residence, via COPII vesicles. An interaction of a (R/K)X(R/K) motif at their cytoplasmic tail (CT) with Sar1 is critical for the selective concentration in the transport vesicles. In this work using computational docking, we identify three putative binding pockets in Sar1 (sites A, B, and C) involved in the interaction with the (R/K)X(R/K) motif. Sar1 mutants with alanine replacement of amino acids in site A were tested in vitro and in cells. In vitro, mutant versions showed a reduced ability to bind immobilized peptides with the CT sequence of GalT2. In cells, Sar1 mutants (Sar1(D198A)) specifically affect the exiting of GGT from the ER, resulting in an ER/Golgi concentration ratio favoring the ER. Neither the typical Golgi localization of GM130 nor the exiting and transport of the G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus were affected. The protein kinase inhibitor H89 produced accumulation of Sec23, Sar1, and GalT2 at the ER exit sites; Sar1(D189A) also accumulated at these sites, but in this case GalT2 remained disperse along ER membranes. The results indicate that amino acids in site A of Sar1 are involved in the interaction with the CT of GGT for concentration at ER exiting sites."
https://openalex.org/W1978260780,"The phenotypic stability of somatic cells is essential for the maintenance of both structural and functional organ integrity of the adult human body. Deregulated cell plasticity could result in the development of debilitating diseases such as cancer, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. We have previously demonstrated that a nonsense mutation in the NPC2 gene, which encodes ubiquitous, highly conserved, secretory protein with unknown function, leads to activation of human skin fibroblasts. The activated fibroblasts, also known as myofibroblasts, have the properties of mesenchymal stem cells and are able to differentiate along the mesodermal and endodermal lineages. Here we show that NPC2-null, but not the normal skin fibroblasts, possess characteristics of adipogenic progenitors as demonstrated by their specific gene expression pattern as well as the ability for efficient differentiation into white adipocytes. The presence of NPC2 in mature white adipocytes was also necessary for their maintenance because silencing NPC2 in differentiated cells by siRNA stimulated PPARG expression, which was followed by a shift toward a more favorable, brown adipocyte-like metabolic state characterized by up-regulated lipolysis and increased insulin sensitivity. It appears that NPC2 controls both the adipogenesis and the metabolic state of mature white adipocytes through a common mechanism that is linked to activation of FGFR2 that could be followed by induction of PPARG expression. Altogether, the current study highlights NPC2 as a novel intracrine/autocrine factor that controls adipocyte differentiation and function as well as potential therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders."
