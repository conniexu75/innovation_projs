https://openalex.org/W2058652198,"Background The threats facing Ecuador's Yasuní National Park are emblematic of those confronting the greater western Amazon, one of the world's last high-biodiversity wilderness areas. Notably, the country's second largest untapped oil reserves—called “ITT”—lie beneath an intact, remote section of the park. The conservation significance of Yasuní may weigh heavily in upcoming state-level and international decisions, including whether to develop the oil or invest in alternatives. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted the first comprehensive synthesis of biodiversity data for Yasuní. Mapping amphibian, bird, mammal, and plant distributions, we found eastern Ecuador and northern Peru to be the only regions in South America where species richness centers for all four taxonomic groups overlap. This quadruple richness center has only one viable strict protected area (IUCN levels I–IV): Yasuní. The park covers just 14% of the quadruple richness center's area, whereas active or proposed oil concessions cover 79%. Using field inventory data, we compared Yasuní's local (alpha) and landscape (gamma) diversity to other sites, in the western Amazon and globally. These analyses further suggest that Yasuní is among the most biodiverse places on Earth, with apparent world richness records for amphibians, reptiles, bats, and trees. Yasuní also protects a considerable number of threatened species and regional endemics. Conclusions/Significance Yasuní has outstanding global conservation significance due to its extraordinary biodiversity and potential to sustain this biodiversity in the long term because of its 1) large size and wilderness character, 2) intact large-vertebrate assemblage, 3) IUCN level-II protection status in a region lacking other strict protected areas, and 4) likelihood of maintaining wet, rainforest conditions while anticipated climate change-induced drought intensifies in the eastern Amazon. However, further oil development in Yasuní jeopardizes its conservation values. These findings form the scientific basis for policy recommendations, including stopping any new oil activities and road construction in Yasuní and creating areas off-limits to large-scale development in adjacent northern Peru."

As an RNA-binding protein, Lin28 acts to stimulate the translation of a specific subset of mRNAs, and to inhibit the biogenesis of a group of microRNAs. Oct4 is a transcription factor essential for the maintenance of pluripotency and survival of ES cells. In this study, we report that a sub-population of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells co-expresses Lin28 and Oct4 as demonstrated in the analyses of both cell lines and patient tumor samples. We also observe that the combined expression of these proteins in tumor samples is correlated with advanced tumor grade. Intriguingly, when the expression of these two proteins is repressed in the same cells using RNA interference, there is significant reduction in cell growth and survival. We thus propose that Lin28 and Oct4 may have important roles in the initiation and/or progression of EOC, and consequently may serve as important molecular diagnostics and/or therapeutic targets for the development of novel treatment strategies in EOC patients."

Mutations in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel SCN1A are associated with a growing number of disorders including generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+),7 severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, and familial hemiplegic migraine. To gain insight into the effect of SCN1A mutations on neuronal excitability, we introduced the human GEFS+ mutation SCN1A-R1648H into the orthologous mouse gene. Scn1aRH/RH mice homozygous for the R1648H mutation exhibit spontaneous generalized seizures and premature death between P16 and P26, whereas Scn1aRH/+ heterozygous mice exhibit infrequent spontaneous generalized seizures, reduced threshold and accelerated propagation of febrile seizures, and decreased threshold to flurothyl-induced seizures. Inhibitory cortical interneurons from P5-P15 Scn1aRH/+ and Scn1aRH/RH mice demonstrated slower recovery from inactivation, greater use-dependent inactivation, and reduced action potential firing compared with wild-type cells. Excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons were mostly unaffected. These results suggest that this SCN1A mutation predominantly impairs sodium channel activity in interneurons, leading to decreased inhibition. Decreased inhibition may be a common mechanism underlying clinically distinct SCN1A-derived disorders.

Mutations in SCN1A account for ∼80% of SMEI cases and 10% of GEFS+ cases. Over half of the more than 600 SCN1A mutations in SMEI patients result in protein truncation and loss of function, demonstrating haploinsufficiency of SCN1A (4.Meisler M.H. Kearney J.A. J. Clin.

The amino acid substitutions R1648H and T875M were the first identified SCN1A-GEFS+ mutations (1.Escayg A. MacDonald B.T. Meisler M.H. Baulac S. Huberfeld G. An-Gourfinkel I. Brice A. LeGuern E. Moulard B. Chaigne D. Buresi C. Malafosse A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The R1648H mutation was identified in a large pedigree with 13 affected members (1.Escayg A. MacDonald B.T. Meisler M.H. Baulac S. Huberfeld G. An-Gourfinkel I. Brice A. LeGuern E. Moulard B. Chaigne D. Buresi C. Malafosse A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the R1648H/+ heterozygotes in this family were highly variable and included individuals with only childhood febrile seizures, only afebrile epilepsies such as generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS), absence seizures, and myoclonic seizures, and both febrile and afebrile seizures (1.Escayg A. MacDonald B.T. Meisler M.H. Baulac S. Huberfeld G. An-Gourfinkel I. Brice A. LeGuern E. Moulard B. Chaigne D. Buresi C. Malafosse A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). This variation in severity may result from differences in genetic modifiers or environmental influences (4.Meisler M.H.

Genet. 2007; 16: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). GEFS+ families with SCN1A mutations have also been identified in which some affected members display neuropsychiatric deficits and ataxia (7.Osaka H. Ogiwara I. Mazaki E. Okamura N. Yamashita S.

The range of phenotypes among GEFS+ pedigrees that harbor different SCN1A mutations suggests that clinical variability may arise from differences in the way the mutations alter Nav1.1 function. However, functional analyses of GEFS+ mutations in heterologous systems have failed to reveal clear genotype-phenotype correlations, and different results have been observed when the same mutation was examined in different expression systems. For example, Nav1.1 channels with the R1648H mutation exhibited faster recovery from inactivation in Xenopus oocytes (9.Spampanato J. Escayg A. Meisler M.H. Goldin A.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but increased persistent current in HEK cells (10.Lossin C. Wang D.W. Rhodes T.H. Vanoye C.G. George Jr., A.L. Neuron. 2002; 34: 877-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Both of these effects should increase sodium channel activity. Other GEFS+ mutations (D1886Y and R859C) have been predicted to decrease neuronal excitability by slowing recovery from inactivation and shifting the voltage dependence of activation or inactivation (11.Spampanato J. Kearney J.A. de Haan G. McEwen D.P. Escayg A. Aradi I. MacDonald B.T. Levin S.I. Soltesz I. Benna P. Montalenti E. Isom L.L. Goldin A.L. Meisler M.H. J.

To examine the in vivo effects of SCN1A mutations on neuronal function, we first generated transgenic mice that express a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing the mouse Scn1a gene into which the R1648H mutation was introduced (14.Tang B. Dutt K. Papale L. Rusconi R. Shankar A. Hunter J. Tufik S. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Mantegazza M. Goldin A.L. Escayg A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2009; 35: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological analysis of dissociated cortical neurons from the transgenic mice revealed decreased sodium channel function in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Recordings from cortical and hippocampal neurons from two Scn1a knock-out mouse models of SMEI (15.Yu F.H. Mantegazza M. Westenbroek R.E. Robbins C.A. Kalume F. Burton K.A. Spain W.J. McKnight G.S.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5903-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) revealed a similar specific effect of Scn1a deficiency in GABAergic interneurons, raising the prospect that impaired inhibitory circuits may be a common feature of disorders that result from SCN1A mutations. To develop a more accurate model of the human disease, we have now introduced the SCN1A-R1648H mutation (1.Escayg A. MacDonald B.T. Meisler M.H. Baulac S. Huberfeld G. An-Gourfinkel I. Brice A.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the mouse genome by homologous recombination at the Scn1a locus. Spontaneous generalized seizures in heterozygous (Scn1aRH/+) and homozygous (Scn1aRH/RH) knock-in mutants as well as the predicted increased susceptibility to experimental febrile seizures were observed. Electrophysiological analysis of dissociated cortical neurons from the knock-in mutants demonstrated delayed recovery from inactivation, increased use dependent inactivation, and reduced action potential firing in inhibitory interneurons, which is predicted to reduce inhibition. The targeting construct consisted of a 4.1-kb 5′ arm of homology, a neomycin cassette flanked by FLP1 recombinase (Frt) sites, and a 4-kb 3′ arm of homology containing the R1648H mutation and an additional silent substitution resulting in a unique EcoRI site. The final assembled targeting construct was sequenced. The targeting construct was linearized with AvrII, gel-purified, and electroporated into 129X1/SvJ-derived PAT-5 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Six hundred neomycin-resistant clones were selected and screened by PCR amplification for correct targeting of the 3′ arm using the primer pair F4RH (GGAAT AGGAA CTTCG TTCTG CTCG) and R4RH (GTGTG CAACT CTCCC TACCA TAAG). Positive clones were then screened for homologous recombination of the 5′ arm by PCR amplification using the primer pair F5RH (CAAGT GCTAC TTGCC CAGCA G) and R5RH (TTCTG AGGCG GAAAG AACCA G). The PCR reactions were conducted using PCR SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen) under the recommended conditions. ES cell clones that amplified with both PCR screens were next analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. Ten micrograms of genomic DNA were digested overnight with SpeI, StuI, or BglI and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels were soaked with agitation in 0.25 m HCl for 10 min, 0.5 m NaOH and 1.5 m NaCl for 20 min, and 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m Tris (pH 7.5) for 20 min and then transferred by capillary action to Hybond-XL membranes (Amersham Biosciences) with 10× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). Membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 2 h in 7% SDS, 0.25 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), and 1 mm EDTA. External probes with homology to the region upstream of the 5′ arm and downstream of the 3′ arm were PCR-amplified with the primer pair 5′F (CAAGC AGAGC TGTTG GCTGA GGT) and 5′R (AGTGT GTAGT TGTAG GTCAT TTGGA GAC) and the pair 3′F (GGACT TCCTA GAATG GCCCC TCAG) and 3′R (CCAAG CGTAA CCATG CTGTA TTTC), respectively. An internal probe with homology to the 5′ arm was amplified using the primer pair 5′intF (CATTA GGAAG GTTTA GATCC ACTG) and 5′intR (CCTAC CTATT CAACC AACCA AAAT). Each probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]CTP using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences), purified using MicroSpin G50 columns (Amersham Biosciences), and added to the prehybridization buffer for overnight incubation of the membrane. Membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, once with 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and once with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Clones identified as correctly targeted were confirmed to have normal karyotypes by chromosome analysis. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from tail biopsies of 5-week-old mice was performed as described for the ES cell clones. Two clones with the R1648H mutation were injected into blastocysts obtained from mating C57BL/6NCrl female mice with (C57BL/6J X DBA/2J)F1 male mice at the University of Michigan Transgenic Core. Male chimeras with a high percentage of agouti coat color were bred to Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J females expressing FLP1 recombinase to test for germ line transmission of the mutation and to delete the neomycin cassette. Scn1aRH/+;Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym transgene-positive male offspring were bred to C56BL/6J females to produce Scn1aRH/+ N1 males. N1 males lacking the FLPe transgene were crossed to C57BL/6J females to create the N2 generation. All experiments on heterozygous mice were conducted at the N2 generation. Scn1aRH/+ N2 males and females were crossed to obtain Scn1aRH/RH mice. Mice were maintained at 22 °C on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Emory University and the University of California, Irvine. To screen for the R1648H mutation, tail DNA was amplified using the Scn1a-specific primer pair FRH (TTGAT GACTT CTTCA CTGAT TGAT) and RRH (AGAGG CTCTG CACTT TCTTC). PCR amplification was performed for 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The 591-bp PCR product was digested with EcoRI to distinguish between the wild-type (WT; 591 bp) and mutant (461 bp) alleles. The primers and the PCR conditions provided by The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) for the B6;SJL-Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J strain were used to genotype for the presence of the FLPe transgene. To screen for the deletion of the neomycin cassette, tail DNA was amplified with primers flanking the cassette, NeoF (TTTTC AAGTC AGGGT TCCTC), NeoR (GCAGG AAGGG ACATC ATCAG). PCR amplification was performed for 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2.5 min. In the presence of the neomycin cassette, a 2.5-kb product was observed, whereas deletion of the neomycin cassette produced a 767-bp product from the targeted allele. Northern blot analysis was performed on mRNA from the whole brains of 5-week-old mice. Two micrograms of poly(A) RNA was separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel containing 10% formaldehyde and 1× MOPS. RNA was capillary-transferred with 10× SSC to Hybond-XL membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were treated as previously described for Southern blot analysis. A published Scn1a probe (17.Kearney J.A. Buchner D.A. De Haan G. Adamska M. Levin S.I. Furay A.R. Albin R.L. Jones J.M. Montal M. Stevens M.J. Sprunger L.K. Meisler M.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2765-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the DECAtemplate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-mouse probe (Ambion) were radiolabeled, purified, and hybridized as in the Southern blot analysis. Western blot analyses from P18 or 5-week-old mouse brains were performed as previously described (18.Chen C. Westenbroek R.E. Xu X. Edwards C.A. Sorenson D.R. Chen Y. McEwen D.P. O'Malley H.A. Bharucha V. Meadows L.S. Knudsen G.A. Vilaythong A. Noebels J.L. Saunders T.L. Scheuer T. Shrager P. Catterall W.A. Isom L.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4030-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). With each sodium channel antibody, two mice of each genotype were analyzed in duplicate on three separate gels, and protein levels were compared between mutants and wild-type littermates. Briefly, 30–100 μg of protein was separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted with anti-Nav1.1 (Chemicon, 1:200), anti-Nav1.2 (Alomone, 1:200), anti-Nav1.3 (Alomone, 1:200), or anti-Nav1.6 (Alomone, 1:200) antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) was diluted 1:5000. To correct for variation in protein loading, the membrane was also incubated with mouse anti-α-tubulin diluted 1:10,000 (Cedarlane Labs) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Signal was visualized by chemiluminescent detection with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare), and the intensity of each band was quantified using the Gel Logic 2200 Digital Imaging System (Eastman Kodak Co.) and normalized to the level of α-tubulin. Kainic acid seizure induction was conducted as previously described (6.Martin M.S. Tang B. Papale L.A. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Escayg A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mice between three and six months of age were injected intraperitoneally with 15 or 20 mg/kg kainic acid (Ocean Produce International). Mice were observed for 2 h after the injection of kainic acid and scored according to a modified Racine scale (19.Racine R.J. Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1972; 32: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5762) Google Scholar). Flurothyl seizure induction was performed as previously described (6.Martin M.S. Tang B. Papale L.A. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Escayg A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mice (3–4 months old) were exposed to flurothyl(2,2,2-trifluroethylether) (Sigma) at a rate of 20 μl/min. The latencies to the first myoclonic jerk and to the GTCS were recorded. Progression of the tonic-clonic seizure to tonic hind-limb extension was also noted. Valproic acid (VPA, Sigma) was dissolved in 0.9% saline and administered at 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg. VPA or saline was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before seizure induction. All experiments were carried out between 12 and 4 p.m. The experimenter was blind to the genotypes of the mice. Male and female data were analyzed separately. There were no observed sex differences in the data; therefore, data from both sexes were combined. The experimental febrile seizure paradigm was modified from methods published for the rat (20.Dube C. Chen K. Eghbal-Ahmadi M. Brunson K. Soltesz I. Baram T.Z. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and adapted to the mouse (21.Dubé C. Vezzani A. Behrens M. Bartfai T. Baram T.Z. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Briefly, 14–15-day-old mice were exposed to hyperthermia (i.e. increased body and brain temperatures) via a warmed air stream. Core temperatures were measured before hyperthermia induction and at the onset of the seizures. The latter were considered threshold temperatures. In addition, the rate of seizure propagation was estimated by examining the progression of phenomenology of the seizure. The onset of experimental febrile seizures usually involves sudden immobility, reduced response to stimulation (altered consciousness), and facial automatisms. These rarely progress to generalized seizures. Because of altered seizure progression in the mutant mice, the latency and threshold temperature to generalized, tonic seizures were also determined. Once threshold and latency were determined, the hyperthermia was discontinued to stop the seizure. All experiments were carried out between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m., and the experimenter was blind to the genotypes. Fourteen Scn1aRH/+ mice and nine WT littermates (3–5 months old) were implanted for electroencephalography (EEG) recordings as previously described (6.Martin M.S. Tang B. Papale L.A. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Escayg A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After a minimum of 7 days recovery from surgery, each mouse was placed into a Plexiglas box (15 × 15 × 15 cm) and attached to a series of bioelectric amplifiers (Embla Somnologica, Iceland) via a small counterbalanced commutator (Dragonfly Research). After 24 h of acclimatization, EEG and electromyography data were collected for 96 h from each mouse, and epileptiform activity was manually scored. Mouse behavior was also simultaneously monitored with digital video recording. Seizures were characterized by polyspike activity accompanied by stereotypic seizure behaviors and a refractory period. Interictal epileptiform activity was characterized by spike discharges that were at least two times the amplitude of the background. Mice were decapitated after anesthesia with either ice (P5-P10) or halothane (P13-P15), and dissociated cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (22.Hilgenberg L.G. Hoover C.L. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7384-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Li Z. Hilgenberg L.G. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory bipolar neurons were identified by correlating shape with staining for anti-GluR1 (glutamate receptor 1) (1:5000, Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-GAD67 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 67) (1:5000, Chemicon), respectively (24.Fong A.Y. Stornetta R.L. Foley C.M. Potts J.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493: 274-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25.Graf E.R. Zhang X. Jin S.X. Linhoff M.W. Craig A.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 1013-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 568-anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-anti-mouse IgG2a (Molecular Probes) were used for observation with epifluorescent illumination. Electrophysiological recordings were performed within 24–36 h of obtaining neuronal cultures at 22–25 °C in the whole-cell patch configuration using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp with Digidata 1322A interface and pCLAMP 8 software. The bath solution consisted of 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 15 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 4 mm BaCl2, 0.1 mm CdCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and the electrode solution consisted of 140 mm CsF, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Series resistance was compensated to 80–90%, and linear leak subtraction was used for all recordings. Corrections were made for leak and capacity currents using P/4 subtraction. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. Current densities were determined in neurons from P13-P15 mice at room temperature (22–25 °C) in voltage clamp mode during a 15-ms depolarization to −5 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV. Series resistance was less than 20 megaohms, and the current amplitudes were normalized to cellular capacitance. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. The voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, recovery from inactivation, and use-dependent inactivation were studied using protocols described by Spampanato et al. (9.Spampanato J. Escayg A. Meisler M.H. Goldin A.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the voltage dependence of activation was analyzed using a protocol with depolarizations from −60 to +15 mV in 5-mV intervals. Peak current amplitudes were converted to conductance values, normalized for comparison, and plotted against voltage. The voltage dependence of inactivation was analyzed using varying depolarizations for 50 ms to allow inactivation followed by repolarization and then depolarizing to a test potential of −15 mV to elicit the remaining available current. Peak currents during the test pulse were normalized for comparison and plotted against the voltage of the conditioning pulse. Recovery from inactivation was analyzed using a protocol that first inactivated the channels by depolarization to −5 mV for 50 ms followed by recovery at −80 mV for a variable period of time (2 to 60 ms) and a test pulse to −5 mV. Peak current amplitudes during the test pulse were normalized to peak current amplitudes during the conditioning pulse and plotted against recovery time. Use-dependent inactivation was examined by successive depolarizations to −5 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV at 10 and 39 Hz. Measurement of persistent current was done using prolonged 200-ms depolarizations to −10 mV. Each voltage step was followed by a >5-s recovery period at −80 mV to minimize the accumulation of use-dependent inactivation. Pulse generation, data collection, and analyses were done with pCLAMP 8.0, Excel, and SigmaPlot 9.0 software. Data shown are the means ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. The average values of the parameters of activation, inactivation, recovery from inactivation, and use-dependent inactivation shown in TABLE 2, TABLE 3 were obtained after fitting the data with the following equations. For activation, G = 1/(1 + exp(−0.03937z(V −V½)), in which G is conductance, z is the apparent gating charge, V is the potential of the given pulse, and V½ is the potential for half-maximal activation. For inactivation, I = 1/(1 + exp(V − V½)/a), in which I is equal to the test-pulse current amplitude, V is the potential of the conditioning pulse, V½ is the voltage for half-maximal inactivation, and a is the slope factor. For recovery: I = 1 − Aexp(−t/τ) − c, in which A is the fraction of current that recovered with the time constant τ, t is the recovery time, and c is the fraction of current that did not recover. For use-dependent inactivation: I = A1exp(−t/τ) + c (single exponential), in which A1 is the relative fraction of current that decayed with the time constant τ, t is the decay time, and c is the remaining current. Current-clamp recordings were performed on dissociated cortical neurons from P8-P10 mice within 48 h of culture. Neurons were visualized using infrared differential interference contrast optics and selected based on shape. Recordings were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C) using a Multiclamp 700A patch clamp amplifier and pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Signals were sampled at 25 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. The pipette solution contained 126 mm potassium gluconate, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Mg-ATP, 0.3 mm Tris-GTP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, pH 7.2. The bath solution contained 126 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3. After forming a seal and performing capacitance and series resistance compensations, the passive properties of the cells were recorded in voltage clamp mode. Before switching to current-clamp mode, the resting membrane potential was measured, and only neurons with resting potentials between −55 and −70 mV were used. Firing patterns were recorded in response to 2-s depolarizing current injections in 20-pA increments starting at 10 pA. Hyperpolarizing current in steps of 5-pA decrements was injected to measure the input resistance, and neurons with input resistance of 60–80 megaohms were selected for analysis. The number of action potentials in 2 s was counted, and only over-shooting action potentials more positive than 0 mV were included. Data are represented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test with p < 0.05 as the criterion for significance. We generated a mouse model of human GEFS+ by knocking in the SCN1A-R1648H mutation into exon 26 of the mouse Scn1a gene (Fig. 1A). This mutation resulted in the substitution of a positively charged arginine residue in the voltage sensor of domain 4 with a histidine residue (1.Escayg A. MacDonald B.T. Meisler M.H. Baulac S.

Six hundred neomycin-resistant ES cell clones were screened for correct targeting by PCR amplification of the 3′ and 5′ regions of homology (Fig. 1B). Clones that were positive in both PCR assays were examined by Southern blot analysis. Two correctly targeted ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice that were bred to generate the knock-in mice. The presence of the targeted allele in the resulting lines of mice was confirmed by Southern blot analysis with 5′ and 3′ probes (Fig. 1C). Northern blot analysis of mRNA from the whole brains of Scn1aRH/+ mice detected the expected full-length Scn1a transcript. The expression level of the Scn1a transcript was comparable in heterozygous Scn1aRH/+ mutants and WT littermates (Fig. 2A).

Methodology/Principal Findings Vitamin D levels were assessed in 884 HIV-infected pregnant women at enrollment in a trial of multivitamin supplementation (not including vitamin D) in Tanzania. Women were followed up for a median of 69.5 months, and information on hemoglobin levels, HIV disease progression, and mortality was recorded. Proportional hazard models and generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship of these outcomes with vitamin D status. Conclusions/Significance Low vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D<32ng/mL) was significantly associated with progression to WHO HIV disease stage III or greater in multivariate models (incidence rate ratio [RR]: 1.25; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.05, 1.50). No significant relationship was observed between vitamin D status and T-cell counts during follow-up. Women with low vitamin D status had 46% higher risk of developing severe anemia during follow-up, compared to women with adequate vitamin D levels (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.96). Women in the highest vitamin D quintile had a 42% lower risk of all-cause mortality, compared to the lowest quintile (RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.84). Vitamin D status had a protective association with HIV disease progression, all-cause mortality, and development of anemia during follow-up in HIV-infected women. If confirmed in randomized trials, vitamin D supplementation could represent a simple and inexpensive method to prolonging the time to initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients, particularly in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2150148604,"Myc proteins (c-myc, Mycn and Mycl) target proliferative and apoptotic pathways vital for progression in cancer. Amplification of the MYCN gene has emerged as one of the clearest indicators of aggressive and chemotherapy-refractory disease in children with neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. Phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated modulation of Myc protein influence stability and represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Phosphorylation of Myc proteins is controlled in-part by the receptor tyrosine kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling, with additional contributions from Aurora A kinase. Myc proteins regulate apoptosis in part through interactions with the p53/Mdm2/Arf signaling pathway. Mutation in p53 is commonly observed in patients with relapsed neuroblastoma, contributing to both biology and therapeutic resistance. This review examines Myc function and regulation in neuroblastoma, and discusses emerging therapies that target Mycn."

Using a sample of registered Thoroughbred horses (n = 148), we have identified a novel MSTN sequence polymorphism that is strongly associated (g.66493737C>T, P = 4.85×10−8) with best race distance among elite racehorses (n = 79). This observation was independently validated (P = 1.91×10−6) in a resampled group of Thoroughbreds (n = 62) and in a cohort of Thoroughbreds (n = 37, P = 0.0047) produced by the same trainer. We observed that C/C horses are suited to fast, short-distance races; C/T horses compete favorably in middle-distance races; and T/T horses have greater stamina. Evaluation of retrospective racecourse performance (n = 142) and stallion progeny performance predict that C/C and C/T horses are more likely to be successful two-year-old racehorses than T/T animals. Here we describe for the first time the identification of a gene variant in Thoroughbred racehorses that is predictive of genetic potential for an athletic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2095404261,"Background Migrating leukocytes normally have a polarized morphology with an actin-rich lamellipodium at the front and a uropod at the rear. Microtubules (MTs) are required for persistent migration and chemotaxis, but how they affect cell polarity is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report that T cells treated with nocodazole to disrupt MTs are unable to form a stable uropod or lamellipodium, and instead often move by membrane blebbing with reduced migratory persistence. However, uropod-localized receptors and ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins still cluster in nocodazole-treated cells, indicating that MTs are required specifically for uropod stability. Nocodazole stimulates RhoA activity, and inhibition of the RhoA target ROCK allows nocodazole-treated cells to re-establish lamellipodia and uropods and persistent migratory polarity. ROCK inhibition decreases nocodazole-induced membrane blebbing and stabilizes MTs. The myosin inhibitor blebbistatin also stabilizes MTs, indicating that RhoA/ROCK act through myosin II to destabilize MTs. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that RhoA/ROCK signaling normally contributes to migration by affecting both actomyosin contractility and MT stability. We propose that regulation of MT stability and RhoA/ROCK activity is a mechanism to alter T-cell migratory behavior from lamellipodium-based persistent migration to bleb-based migration with frequent turning."
https://openalex.org/W1963603805,"Sequence variants in the first intron of FTO are strongly associated with human obesity and human carriers of the risk alleles show evidence for increased appetite and food intake. Mice globally lacking Fto display a complex phenotype characterised by both increased energy expenditure and increased food intake. The site of action of FTO on energy balance is unclear. Fasting reduces levels of Fto mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus, a site where Fto expression is particularly high. In this study, we have extended this nutritional link by demonstrating that consumption of a high fat diet (45%) results in a 2.5 fold increase in Arc Fto expression. We have further explored the role of hypothalamic Fto in the control of food intake by using stereotactic injections coupled with AAV technology to bi-directionally modulate Fto expression. An over expression of Fto protein by 2.5-fold in the ARC results in a 14% decrease in average daily food intake in the first week. In contrast, knocking down Arc Fto expression by 40% increases food intake by 16%. mRNA levels of Agrp, Pomc and Npy, ARC-expressed genes classically associated with the control of food intake, were not affected by the manipulation of Fto expression. However, over expression of Fto resulted in a 4-fold increase in the mRNA levels of Stat3, a signalling molecule critical for leptin receptor signalling, suggesting a possible candidate for the mediation of Fto's actions. These data provide further support for the notion that FTO itself can influence key components of energy balance, and is therefore a strong candidate for the mediation of the robust association between FTO intronic variants and adiposity. Importantly, this provide the first indication that selective alteration of FTO levels in the hypothalamus can influence food intake, a finding consistent with the reported effects of FTO alleles on appetite and food intake in man."

https://openalex.org/W2024781225,"DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) elicit a checkpoint response that causes a delay in cell cycle progression. Early in the checkpoint response, histone H2AX is phosphorylated in the chromatin region flanking the DSB by ATM/ATR and DNA-PK kinases. The resulting foci of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) serve as a platform for recruitment and retention of additional components of the checkpoint-signaling cascade that enhance checkpoint signaling and DSB repair. Upon repair, both the assembled protein complexes and the chromatin modifications are removed to quench the checkpoint signal. In this study, we show that the DNA damage-responsive Wip1 phosphatase is bound to chromatin. Moreover, Wip1 directly dephosphorylates gamma-H2AX and cells depleted of Wip1 fail to dephosphorylate gamma-H2AX during checkpoint recovery. Conversely, premature activation of Wip1 leads to displacement of MDC1 from damage foci and prevents activation of the checkpoint. Taken together, our data show that Wip1 has an essential role in dephosphorylation of gamma-H2AX to silence the checkpoint and restore chromatin structure once DNA damage is repaired."
https://openalex.org/W2084813257,"Gene expression microarrays are the most widely used technique for genome-wide expression profiling. However, microarrays do not perform well on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPET). Consequently, microarrays cannot be effectively utilized to perform gene expression profiling on the vast majority of archival tumor samples. To address this limitation of gene expression microarrays, we designed a novel procedure (3′-end sequencing for expression quantification (3SEQ)) for gene expression profiling from FFPET using next-generation sequencing. We performed gene expression profiling by 3SEQ and microarray on both frozen tissue and FFPET from two soft tissue tumors (desmoid type fibromatosis (DTF) and solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)) (total n = 23 samples, which were each profiled by at least one of the four platform-tissue preparation combinations). Analysis of 3SEQ data revealed many genes differentially expressed between the tumor types (FDR<0.01) on both the frozen tissue (∼9.6K genes) and FFPET (∼8.1K genes). Analysis of microarray data from frozen tissue revealed fewer differentially expressed genes (∼4.64K), and analysis of microarray data on FFPET revealed very few (69) differentially expressed genes. Functional gene set analysis of 3SEQ data from both frozen tissue and FFPET identified biological pathways known to be important in DTF and SFT pathogenesis and suggested several additional candidate oncogenic pathways in these tumors. These findings demonstrate that 3SEQ is an effective technique for gene expression profiling from archival tumor samples and may facilitate significant advances in translational cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W2098589170,"Invasive cell migration is a key step for cancer metastasis and involves Rho GTPase-controlled reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Altered Rho GTPase expression is found in various malignancies. Particularly, the closely related GTPases RhoA and RhoC are upregulated in many aggressive tumours, but specific effectors that distinguish between these two GTPases to explain mechanistic differences have not been identified. The formins are by far the largest family of Rho GTPase effectors and are characterized by the actin-nucleating formin homology 2 domain. Using siRNA-based screening against all 15 human formins, we systematically analysed their functions in 3D cell motility using three different cancer cell lines. These results reveal distinct requirements for specific formins in amoeboid versus mesenchymal invasive cell migration. Importantly, by knocking down all Rho proteins, we identified formin-like 2 (FMNL2) as a specific RhoC effector, showing selective interaction of FMNL2 with active RhoC, but not RhoA or RhoB. Functional analysis shows that RhoC regulates autoinhibition of FMNL2, whereas suppression of FMNL2 inhibits RhoC-, but not RhoA-dependent, rounded invasive cell migration. Thus, our data uncover a novel regulatory and functional interaction between RhoC and FMNL2 for modulating cell shape and invasiveness and provide mechanistic insight into RhoC-specific signalling events."

Overexpression of individual complexes are reported in multiple myeloma (MM), making them attractive therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigate the preclinical activity of a novel small-molecule multi-CDK inhibitor, AT7519, in MM. We show the anti-MM activity of AT7519 displaying potent cytotoxicity and apoptosis; associated with in vivo tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival. At the molecular level, AT7519 inhibited RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) phosphorylation, a CDK9, 7 substrate, associated with decreased RNA synthesis confirmed by [3H] Uridine incorporation. In addition, AT7519 inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation; conversely pretreatment with a selective GSK-3 inhibitor and shRNA GSK-3β knockdown restored MM survival, suggesting the involvement of GSK-3β in AT7519-induced apoptosis. GSK-3β activation was independent of RNA pol II dephosphorylation confirmed by α-amanitin, a specific RNA pol II inihibitor, showing potent inhibition of RNA pol II phosphorylation without corresponding effects on GSK-3β phosphorylation. These results offer new insights into the crucial, yet controversial role of GSK-3β in MM and show significant anti-MM activity of AT7519, providing the rationale for its clinical evaluation in MM."
https://openalex.org/W1995566079,"Methamphetamine (meth) is an illicit psychostimulant that is abused throughout the world. Repeated passive injections of the drug given in a single day or over a few days cause significant and long-term depletion of dopamine and serotonin in the mammalian brain. Because meth self-administration may better mimic some aspects of human drug-taking behaviors, we examined to what extent this pattern of drug treatment might also result in damage to monoaminergic systems in the brain. Rats were allowed to intravenously self-administer meth (yoked control rats received vehicle) 15 hours per day for 8 days before being euthanized at either 24 hours or at 7 and 14 days after cessation of drug taking. Meth self-administration by the rats was associated with a progressive escalation of daily drug intake to 14 mg/kg per day. Animals that self-administered meth exhibited dose-dependent decreases in striatal dopamine levels during the period of observation. In addition, there were significant reductions in the levels of striatal dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase proteins. There were also significant decreases in the levels of dopamine, dopamine transporter, and tyrosine hydroxylase in the cortex. In contrast, meth self-administration caused only transient decreases in norepinephrine and serotonin levels in the two brain regions, with these values returning to normal at seven days after cessation of drug taking. Importantly, meth self-administration was associated with significant dose-dependent increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein in both striatum and cortex, with these changes being of greater magnitude in the striatum. These results suggest that meth self-administration by rats is associated with long-term biochemical changes that are reminiscent of those observed in post-mortem brain tissues of chronic meth abusers."
https://openalex.org/W2013374027,"Microorganisms capable of surviving within macrophages are rare, but represent very successful pathogens. One of them is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) whose resistance to early mechanisms of macrophage killing and failure of its phagosomes to fuse with lysosomes causes tuberculosis (TB) disease in humans. Thus, defining the mechanisms of phagosome maturation arrest and identifying mycobacterial factors responsible for it are key to rational design of novel drugs for the treatment of TB. Previous studies have shown that Mtb and the related vaccine strain, M. bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), disrupt the normal function of host Rab5 and Rab7, two small GTPases that are instrumental in the control of phagosome fusion with early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes respectively.Here we show that recombinant Mtb nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) exhibits GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards Rab5 and Rab7. Then, using a model of latex bead phagosomes, we demonstrated that Ndk inhibits phagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. Maturation arrest of phagosomes containing Ndk-beads was associated with the inactivation of both Rab5 and Rab7 as evidenced by the lack of recruitment of their respective effectors EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1) and RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein). Consistent with these findings, macrophage infection with an Ndk knocked-down BCG strain resulted in increased fusion of its phagosome with lysosomes along with decreased survival of the mutant.Our findings provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that mycobacterial Ndk is a putative virulence factor that inhibits phagosome maturation and promotes survival of mycobacteria within the macrophage."

https://openalex.org/W1983337898,"Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor gene promoters has become a more frequent phenomenon in cancer than previously anticipated. In this study we addressed the mechanisms involved in the protection of the p53 tumor suppressor gene against epigenetic silencing in human transformed cell lines. We characterized a binding site for the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in the human p53 gene promoter that contributes to its transcriptional expression, and has the ability to maintain this regulatory element in a local open chromatin configuration. In the absence of CTCF we observe the incorporation of repressive histone marks, such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me3, in different sub-domains of the upstream regulatory sequence. This evidence suggests that CTCF protects the p53 gene promoter against repressive histone marks. Notably, no apparent direct correlation between repression and DNA hypermethylation has been detected. Together, we present evidence supporting the relevant role of CTCF in the epigenetic regulation of tumor suppressor genes and cancer. We propose that CTCF is a strategic component responsible for the maintenance and segregation of epigenetic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2007725161,"Human chromosomal fragile sites are regions of the genome that are prone to DNA breakage, and are classified as common or rare, depending on their frequency in the population. Common fragile sites frequently coincide with the location of genes involved in carcinogenic chromosomal translocations, suggesting their role in cancer formation. However, there has been no direct evidence linking breakage at fragile sites to the formation of a cancer-specific translocation. Here, we studied the involvement of fragile sites in the formation of RET/PTC rearrangements, which are frequently found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). These rearrangements are commonly associated with radiation exposure; however, most of the tumors found in adults are not linked to radiation. In this study, we provide structural and biochemical evidence that the RET, CCDC6 and NCOA4 genes participating in two major types of RET/PTC rearrangements, are located in common fragile sites FRA10C and FRA10G, and undergo DNA breakage after exposure to fragile site-inducing chemicals. Moreover, exposure of human thyroid cells to these chemicals results in the formation of cancer-specific RET/PTC rearrangements. These results provide the direct evidence for the involvement of chromosomal fragile sites in the generation of cancer-specific rearrangements in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986920175,"Background To date, few studies address disparities in older populations specifically using frailty as one of the health outcomes and examining the relative contributions of individual and environmental factors to health outcomes. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a data set from a health survey of 4,000 people aged 65 years and over living in all regions of Hong Kong, we examined regional variations in self-rated health, frailty, and four-year mortality, and analyzed the relative contributions of lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and geographical location of residence to these outcomes using path analysis. We hypothesize that lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and regional characteristics directly and indirectly through interactions contribute to self-rated physical and psychological health, frailty, and four-year mortality. District variations directly affect self-rated physical health, and also exert an effect through socioeconomic position as well as lifestyle factors. Socioeconomic position in turn directly affects self-rated physical health, as well as indirectly through lifestyle factors. A similar pattern of interaction is observed for self-rated mental health, frailty, and mortality, although there are differences in different lifestyle factors and district associations. Lifestyle factors also directly affect physical and mental components of health, frailty, and mortality. The magnitude of direct district effect is comparable to those of lifestyle and socioeconomic position. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that district variations in health outcomes exist in the Hong Kong elderly population, and these variations result directly from district factors, and are also indirectly mediated through socioeconomic position as well as lifestyle. Provision and accessibility to health services are unlikely to play a significant role. Future studies on these district factors would be important in reducing health disparities in the older population."

However, with the exception of the intronic enhancer Eμ, which regulates D to J recombination, cis-acting regulatory elements have not been identified. We have assembled the sequence of a strategically located 96-kb V-D intergenic region in the mouse Igh and analyzed its activity during lymphocyte development. We show that Eμ-dependent D antisense transcription, proposed to open chromatin before D to J recombination, extends into the V-D region for more than 30 kb in B cells before, during, and after V(D)J recombination and in T cells but terminates 40 kb from the first V gene.

To find cis-acting elements that regulate this differential chromatin opening, we identified six DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSs) in the V-D region. One conserved HS upstream of the first D gene locally regulates D genes. Two further conserved HSs near the D region mark a sharp decrease in antisense transcription, and both HSs bind CTCF in vivo.

Such ‘soluble’ matrix components, including collagens, fibronectin and laminin, induced Smad activation (termed crosstalk signaling), which follows a similar chronological sequence and R-Smad specificity as induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Smad4 nuclear translocation occurred in response to collagen binding, indicating downstream signal propagation. TGF-β scavenging antibody affected only TGF-β1, but not crosstalk-induced responses. TGF-β type II receptor mutation (DR26Δ25), which is deficient in TGF-β type I receptor recruitment to the ligand, induced a heterotetramer signaling complex, and propagated Smad2 activation only through collagen induction and not TGF-β signaling. Consequentially, TGF-β ligand participation is not required for crosstalk signaling. This signaling requires a functional integrin β1 receptor as showed by RNA interference. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and fluorescent microscopy indicate the involvement of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src activity in collagen-induced signal propagation, and suggest a membrane signaling complex formation that includes both TGF-β receptors and integrins. The related gene expressional responses are distinct from that evoked by TGF-β1, supporting its separate function.

Exclusion criteria were polyposis syndromes, Lynch syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. DNA methylation at the promoter region of the MGMT, CDKN2A, SFRP1, TMEFF2, HS3ST2 (3OST2), RASSF1A and GATA4 genes was evaluated by quantitative methylation specific PCR in both tumor and corresponding normal appearing colorectal mucosa samples. Overall, patients with multiple lesions exhibited a higher degree of methylation in tumor samples than those with solitary tumors regarding all evaluated genes. After adjusting for age and gender, binomial logistic regression analysis identified methylation of MGMT2 (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.97; p = 0.008) and RASSF1A (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.01 to 4.13; p = 0.047) as variables independently associated with tumor multiplicity, being the risk related to methylation of any of these two genes 4.57 (95% CI, 1.53 to 13.61; p = 0.006). Moreover, in six patients in whom both tumors were available, we found a correlation in the methylation levels of MGMT2 (r = 0.64, p = 0.17), SFRP1 (r = 0.83, 0.06), HPP1 (r = 0.64, p = 0.17), 3OST2 (r = 0.83, p = 0.06) and GATA4 (r = 0.6, p = 0.24). Methylation in normal appearing colorectal mucosa from patients with multiple and solitary CRC showed no relevant difference in any evaluated gene.These results provide a proof-of-concept that gene promoter methylation is associated with tumor multiplicity. This underlying epigenetic defect may have noteworthy implications in the prevention of patients with sporadic CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2078762926,"Background Trypanosoma cruzi is an intracellular parasite that, like some other intracellular pathogens, targets specific proteins of the host cell vesicular transport machinery, leading to a modulation of host cell processes that results in the generation of unique phagosomes. In mammalian cells, several molecules have been identified that selectively regulate the formation of endocytic transport vesicles and the fusion of such vesicles with appropriate acceptor membranes. Among these, the GTPase dynamin plays an important role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and it was recently found that dynamin can participate in a phagocytic process. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a compound called dynasore that has the ability to block the GTPase activity of dynamin. Dynasore acts as a potent inhibitor of endocytic pathways by blocking coated vesicle formation within seconds of its addition. Here, we investigated whether dynamin is involved in the entry process of T. cruzi in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells by using dynasore. In this aim, peritoneal macrophages and LLC-MK2 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of dynasore before interaction with trypomastigotes, amastigotes or epimastigotes. We observed that, in both cell lines, the parasite internalization was drastically diminished (by greater than 90% in LLC-MK2 cells and 70% in peritoneal macrophages) when we used 100 µM dynasore. The T. cruzi adhesion index, however, was unaffected in either cell line. Analyzing these interactions by scanning electron microscopy and comparing peritoneal macrophages to LLC-MK2 cells revealed differences in the stage at which cell entry was blocked. In LLC-MK2 cells, this blockade is observed earlier than it is in peritoneal macrophages. In LLC-MK2 cells, the parasites were only associated with cellular microvilli, whereas in peritoneal macrophages, trypomastigotes were not completely engulfed by a host cell plasma membrane. Conclusions/Significance Taken together our results demonstrate that dynamin is an essential molecule necessary for cell invasion and specifically parasitophorous vacuole formation by host cells during interaction with Trypanosoma cruzi."

ADAM10 is synthesized in an inactive form, which is proteolytically activated during its forward transport along the secretory pathway and at the plasma membrane. Therefore, modulation of its trafficking could provide a mechanism to finely tune its shedding activity. Here we report the identification of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif within the ADAM10 intracellular C-terminal tail. Sequential deletion/mutagenesis analyses showed that an arginine-rich (723RRR) sequence was responsible for the retention of ADAM10 in the ER and its inefficient surface trafficking. Mutating the second arginine to alanine was sufficient to allow ER exit and surface expression in both heterologous cells and hippocampal neurons. As synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) binds ADAM10 at its cytoplasmic tail and facilitates forward ADAM10 trafficking in neurons, we tested whether SAP97 could modulate ER export. However, neither expression nor Ser-39 phosphorylation of SAP97 in heterologous cells or hippocampal neurons were sufficient to allow the ER exit of ADAM10, suggesting that other signaling pathways or alternative binding partners are responsible for ADAM10 ER exit.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAMa disintegrin and metalloproteinaseADAlzheimer DiseaseFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateERendoplasmic reticulumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPCproprotein convertase. belongs to a large family of membrane-anchored metalloproteases, which are known as the ADAM protein family. ADAMs mediate the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane proteins in their juxtamembrane region, causing their shedding, i.e. the release of their extracellular domain in a soluble form. In addition, through the intracellularly retained stubs, ADAMs can initiate the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. Because of their metalloprotease, integrin binding, cell adhesion, and signaling functions, ADAMs are well positioned to coordinate cellular processes that are required for neural development, plasticity, and repair (1.Blobel C.P.

ADAM10 works as a sheddase for a large number of transmembrane proteins involved in a variety of biological functions, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer Disease (AD) (4.Kheradmand F. Werb Z. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5.Moss M.L. Bartsch J.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7227-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because of these links, much effort is currently directed toward developing tools which modulate ADAM10 activity and can be used to target these pathologies. ADAM10 is a multidomain transmembrane glycoprotein which is expressed ubiquitously (6.Prinzen C. Muller U. Endres K. Fahrenholz F. Postina R. Faseb. J. 2005; 19: 522-1524Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It contains an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a prodomain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an EGF-like repeat, a transmembrane domain and a SH3-binding cytoplasmic tail (7.Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). ADAM10 is synthesized in an inactive form that carries a proprotein convertase (PC) recognition sequence between the prodomain and the catalytic domain. Both PC7 and furin can cleave ADAM10 at the predicted PC cleavage motif to yield a mature, active form (8.Anders A. Gilbert S. Garten W. Postina R. Fahrenholz F. Faseb. J. 2001; 15: 1837-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). ADAM10 cleavage and maturation occur in the trans-Golgi network, in vesicles of the secretory pathway and at the cell surface (9.Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berghöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 10.Wouters S. Leruth M. Decroly E. Vandenbranden M. Creemers J.W. van de Loo J.W. Ruysschaert J.M. Courtoy P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); indeed, it has been suggested that the active form of ADAM10 can exert its catalytic activity both along the secretory system and at the plasma membrane (7.Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Yet, despite the importance of forward secretory trafficking for ADAM10 activity, the mechanisms regulating its trafficking and localization are largely unknown. Multiple signaling pathways could regulate ADAM10 trafficking and, consequently, modulate its activity in different cellular systems. For instance, calcium influx stimulates ADAM10 activity in fibroblasts, an effect that requires the intracellular C terminus (11.Horiuchi K. Le Gall S. Schulte M. Yamaguchi T. Reiss K. Murphy G. Toyama Y. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In neurons, the interaction between ADAM10 and synapse-associated protein-97 (SAP97), a protein involved in the dynamic trafficking of proteins to excitatory synapses, regulates the localization of ADAM10 at the postsynaptic membrane (12.Marcello E. Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Romorini S. Jeromin A. Epis R. Borroni B. Cattabeni F. Sala C. Padovani A. Di Luca M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, before reaching the plasma membrane and inserting into synapses, newly synthesized ADAM10 must be transported through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi secretory pathway via a set of processes that remain poorly understood. ER retention is a common mechanism used by many cell types to control the forward trafficking and surface expression of integral membrane proteins. Specific ER retention/retrieval signals and ER export signals have been identified in the intracellular domains of various channels and receptors, and these signals govern their surface density (13.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 14.Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ER exit has also been reported to be a rate-limiting step for the surface trafficking of ADAM12 and ADAM22, two members of the ADAMs family. This process is regulated by ER retention signals in their cytoplasmic tails, and binding to 14-3-3 proteins allows ER release and membrane targeting of ADAM22 by masking the retention signals (16.Hougaard S.

We have now investigated the trafficking and surface expression of ADAM10, and report the identification of a novel arginine-rich ER retention motif within its intracellular C terminus. Our results identify a novel mechanism regulating the intracellular trafficking and membrane delivery of ADAM10. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-SAP97 (NeuroMab, Davis, CA), rabbit anti-calnexin (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada), rabbit anti-calreticulin (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), rat anti-ADAM10 (R&D, Minneapolis, MN), chicken anti-GFP (Millipore, Billenica, MA), goat anti-Tac antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), rabbit anti-giantin (Covance, Princeton, NJ); mouse anti-Tac antibody (clone 7G7) was kindly provided by Dr. Bonifacino. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from E18-E19 rat hippocampi as described (19.Gardoni F. Bellone C. Viviani B. Marinovich M. Meli E. Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Neurons were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method at 10 days in vitro. COS7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA expression constructs using Superfect® Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and were grown for 24 h before fixation for immunocytochemistry or lysis for Western blot analysis. Chimeras of the extracellular domain of the human interleukin-2 receptor (Tac) with the intracellular C-terminal domain of mouse ADAM10 were generated by amplifying the ADAM10 C-terminal domain with the following set of primers: forward 5′-TGCCCAAGCTTCCGGATTTATCAAGATTTGCAGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTCTAGATTAGCGTCGCATGTGTCCC-3′. Deletion mutants Tac737Δ, Tac734Δ, and Tac721Δ were generated by PCR amplification using the same forward primer and different reverse primers: 5′-GCTCTAGATTACCTCTGACGCGGGGGCTG-3′ for Tac737Δ, 5′-GCTCTAGATTACGGGGGCTGCTGAATGGG-3′ for Tac734Δ, 5′-GCTCTAGATTATAAAGTGCCTGGAAGTGGTTT-3′ for Tac721Δ. After digestion with HindIII and XbaI, PCR fragments were ligated into the linearized Tac pCDM8 expression vector. TacADAM10, full-length mouse ADAM10 (flADAM10) point mutations, and the stop codon resulting in the flADAM10 721Δ construct were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were verified by sequencing. To evaluate surface and total staining, transfected COS7 cells or neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4, and then incubated with either anti-Tac 7G7 antibody (for Tac constructs) or anti-ADAM10 antibody. To visualize surface expression, cells were then blocked with 4% normal serum, followed by a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. Afterward, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and intracellular expression was determined by incubating cells with the appropriate antibody and labeling the total receptor fraction with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. For colocalization experiments, transfected COS7 cells were permeabilized with 0.2% saponin before incubation with anti-Tac 7G7 antibody and anti-calnexin/calreticulin (ER marker) or giantin antibodies (Golgi marker) followed by corresponding secondary antibodies. Wide-field fluorescence images were acquired in a Zeiss Axiovert 200M epifluorescence microscope with a Zeiss ×40 or 25 objective and a CoolSnap CCD camera. Images were analyzed using Metamorph Imaging software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For quantification of surface and total expression intensities, images were acquired using the same settings and exposure times. The average intensity of surface fluorescence staining (Cy3, red) was determined after cell tracing and normalized to the total intensity (FITC, green) to correct for differences in expression. Surface ratios were obtained by dividing the background subtracted Cy3 and FITC fluorescence intensities. Statistical differences were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test. Aliquots of transfected COS7 lysates were treated with or without 2 units of N-glycosidase F for 2 h at 37 °C in the buffer recommended by the supplier (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany). Endoglycosidase H (EndoH; 5 milliunits, Roche Diagnostics) was added to aliquots of transfected COS7 proteins and incubated in 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4 for 17 h at 37 °C. Denaturing buffer was added to digested samples, which were loaded on SDS-PAGE and probed by immunoblotting using goat anti-Tac antibody. A control digestion with no enzyme added demonstrated that samples did not undergo spontaneous degradation during incubations. Previous studies suggested that ADAM10 traffics inefficiently to the plasma membrane in recombinant systems and is retained in intracellular compartments, with only a small fraction reaching the cell surface (7.Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Because we had previously reported that the C terminus of ADAM10 is responsible for its intracellular trafficking (12.Marcello E. Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Romorini S. Jeromin A. Epis R. Borroni B. Cattabeni F. Sala C. Padovani A. Di Luca M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we constructed chimeras of the ADAM10 C-terminal tail (695–749 amino acids of mouse ADAM10) with the surface reporter protein Tac (human interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit) (20.Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 63: 503-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Tac is normally transported to the plasma membrane, where it accumulates at steady state and has been used extensively as a tool to define signals involved in secretory and endocytic membrane trafficking by attaching candidate sequences to its C terminus (15.Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Jansen E.J. Holthuis J.C. McGrouther C. Burbach J.P. Martens G.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Either Tac alone or TacADAM10 were transiently transfected into COS7 cells, and their surface expression was evaluated using an immunofluorescence-based antibody uptake assay. Consistent with previous reports, Tac displayed strong plasma membrane expression (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, addition of the C-terminal tail of ADAM10 completely prevented surface localization, despite intense intracellular labeling (Fig. 1, A and B, Tac surface/total expression = 1.99 ± 0.27; TacADAM10 surface/total expression = 0.02 ± 0.003; p < 0.001). The intracellular staining patterns of Tac and TacADAM10 also differed; whereas Tac was present in intracellular vesicles, intracellular TacADAM10 exhibited a reticular appearance (see insets in Fig. 1A) and accumulated in a perinuclear compartment. To identify the intracellular compartments where TacADAM10 was retained, we analyzed the subcellular localization of Tac and TacADAM10 using fluorescence microscopy. Tac was present along the secretory pathway, as showed by its partial colocalization with the ER marker calreticulin (Fig. 2A, top) and the Golgi-resident protein giantin (Fig. 2B, top), and its localization in vesicular structures. In contrast, TacADAM10 largely colocalized with two different ER markers, calreticulin and calnexin (Fig. 2A), and was excluded from Golgi structures (Fig. 2B, bottom). Further evidence of ER retention of TacADAM10 was obtained by Western blot analysis. Whereas a single band was present in homogenates of COS7 cells transfected with TacADAM10, two different bands appeared in cells transfected with Tac (Fig. 2C). The result is consistent with previous observations (15.Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that Tac is expressed as both mature high and immature low molecular weight species, and suggests that TacADAM10 is present only as an ER-retained immature species. This was confirmed by deglycosylation experiments where we compared the glycosylation state of Tac and TacADAM10 by assessing their sensitivity to two different glycosidases: endoglycosidase H (EndoH), an enzyme that hydrolyzes the high mannose N-glycans present on immature secretory proteins in the ER (23.Trimble R.B. Maley F. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) but not complex forms of N-linked oligosaccharide, and N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), an enzyme that cleaves all N-linked oligosaccharides (24.Tarentino A.L. Gómez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Because conversion of high mannose glycans into complex oligosaccharides occurs in the Golgi, resistance to EndoH indicates that a glycoprotein has reached this compartment. On the contrary, EndoH sensitivity is considered an indicator of immaturity. Treatment with EndoH demonstrated that the single TacADAM10 band was EndoH-sensitive and confirmed that it was retained in the ER as an immature protein (Fig. 2D, lower panels). In contrast, Tac appeared as both a mature, high molecular weight, EndoH-resistant species and a immature EndoH-sensitive species that migrated at a lower molecular weight (Fig. 2D, top panels). All Tac and TacADAM10 species exhibited increased electrophoretic mobility after PNGase F treatment, demonstrating PNGase F sensitivity (Fig. 2D). This combination of biochemical and immunocytochemical experiments provides strong evidence of selective ER retention mediated by the C-terminal domain of ADAM10. Next, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of the ADAM10 cytoplasmic tail to search for putative ER retention motifs. Based upon homology with known ER retention/retrieval consensus sequences in KATP channels and the NMDA receptor subunit NR1 (13.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 14.Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 15.Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we noted three arginine-based motifs within the C-terminal tail that could be responsible for ER retention (for review see Refs. 25.Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 26.Ma D. Jan L.Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and Fig. 3A). Then we made a series of C-terminal truncations in TacADAM10 to evaluate the role of the motifs 723RRR, 734RQR, and 748RR in ER retention and surface expression. Deleting the last 12 amino acids of ADAM10 (Tac737Δ) did not allow surface expression. Similar results were obtained with the Tac734Δ mutant (Fig. 3B), indicating that the 748RR and 734RQR sequences do not play a major role in ER exit. In contrast, removal of the last 28 amino acids yielded robust surface staining of the Tac721Δ mutant when compared with TacADAM10 (TacADAM10 surface/total expression = 0.04 ± 0.001; Tac721Δ surface/total expression = 2.38 ± 0.74, p < 0.01, Fig. 3B). We then assessed the intracellular localization of the deletion mutants by colocalization with calnexin. Tac737Δ and Tac734Δ mutants showed, as TacADAM10, strong perinuclear staining which colocalized with calnexin, suggesting that they were confined to the ER (supplemental Fig. S1). The surface-expressed Tac721Δ mutant displayed a more diffuse intracellular pattern and did not colocalize with calnexin (Fig. 3C, top). In a small percentage of cells, Tac721Δ accumulated intracellularly in giantin-positive structures (Fig. 3C, bottom), indicating that it was released from the ER and reached the Golgi apparatus. However, most cells exhibited a diffuse staining reflecting an efficient forward trafficking of this construct. In Western blot analyses, the Tac721Δ mutant was present as both high and low molecular weight species, whereas TacADAM10 and Tac734Δ mutants appeared as single bands. The Tac737Δ mutant was expressed as a doublet (Fig. 3D). Both the single Tac734Δ band and the Tac737Δ doublet were, as TacADAM10, EndoH-sensitive (Fig. 3E), confirming that these constructs do not exit the ER and suggesting that the Tac737Δ doublet reflects multiple glycosylation sites rather than states of maturation. In contrast, the prominent higher molecular weight Tac721Δ band was EndoH-resistant, indicating transport to the late Golgi. As a forward trafficking index, we measured the optical densities of the mature and immature species, and compared the mature/immature ratio of the Tac721Δ mutant with that of Tac alone. The Tac721Δ mature/immature ratio was 2.26, higher than the ratio of 1 estimated for Tac. This result is consistent with a trend toward higher surface expression of the Tac721Δ mutant when compared with Tac (Fig. 3B) and indicates that removal of the distal part of the ADAM10 cytoplasmic tail, along with deleting the ER retention motif, could unmask forward trafficking signals. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that a 12 amino acid fragment (721–734) in ADAM10 plays an inhibitory role on its trafficking to post-ER compartments and toward the cell surface. To map the motif responsible for ER retention, we carried out alanine substitutions in the arginine-rich putative ER retention sequence (723RRR) located within the 12 amino acid fragment and analyzed the behavior of the TacADAM10 mutants by immunofluorescence and deglycosylation experiments. Disruption of the RRR sequence by replacing all three arginine residues with alanine yielded strong surface expression (RRR to AAA = 5.53 ± 0.22-fold increase in the surface/total ratio compared with TacADAM10, p < 0.001, Fig. 4, A and B). Substituting the first or third arginines with alanine had no effect, but mutation of the second arginine was sufficient to allow surface expression (RRR to RAR = 3.64 ± 0.22-fold increase in the surface/total ratio compared with TacADAM10, p < 0.001, Fig. 4, A and B). Nevertheless, the effect on surface expression of this single substitution was significantly lower than that of the triple alanine mutant (p < 0.001, RRR to AAA versus RRR to RAR, Fig. 4B). To evaluate the importance of the sequence context, we generated double arginine mutants and observed a significantly increased surface expression of the RRR to AAR mutant when compared with the RRR to RAR mutant (p < 0.001, Fig. 4B). Indeed, the surface/total expression ratio of the RRR to AAR mutant was virtually identical to the triple mutant. Western blot and deglycosylation analyses revealed that the RRR to RAR mutant was present as both a mature, high molecular weight, EndoH-resistant species and a smaller, immature EndoH-sensitive species, as previously seen for Tac721Δ (Fig. 4, C and D). Notably, the RRR to AAA and RRR to AAR mutants were detected mainly as a high molecular weight mature species (Fig. 4C) not sensitive to EndoH treatment (Fig. 4D). Single RRR to ARR and RRR to RRA mutants were detected as a single EndoH-sensitive band, further confirming their ER retention (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, and despite a major role of the second arginine within the 723RRR motif in TacADAM10 ER retention, the amino acid context also influences TacADAM10 maturation and surface expression. To rule out the possibility that ER retention of TacADAM10 reflects, rather than an endogenous mechanism to limit surface expression, a lack of trafficking factors in COS7 cells which would be available in a native environment for ADAM10 expression, we monitored the surface expression of TacADAM10 in neurons. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with either Tac or TacADAM10 constructs, and their localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Whereas Tac was expressed at the surface and displayed punctate intracellular labeling along dendrites, TacADAM10 was mainly found intracellularly in the cell body (Fig. 5). Surface staining of TacADAM10 represented a very faint signal at the soma, matching our results in COS7 cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, Tac721Δ and TacADAM10 mutants lacking the retention motif (RRR to AAA and RRR to RAR) were located at the neuronal surface and in intracellular vesicles along dendrites (Fig. 5), suggesting that removal of the ER retention signal favors the dendritic targeting and surface expression of TacADAM10 in hippocampal neurons and indicating that ER retention is a mechanism controlling ADAM10 localization in neurons. We then asked whether ER retention plays a role in the context of the full-length ADAM10 protein, as it is possible that folding or other factors permit ER release. Indeed, it has been previously reported that ADAM10 is localized in the Golgi, albeit it trafficks inefficiently to the surface (7.Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected with full-length ADAM10 (flADAM10), a deletion mutant lacking the last 28 amino acids (flADAM10 721Δ) or a mutant lacking the second arginine of the ER retention motif, and their surface expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence. flADAM10 showed a strong perinuclear staining and was weakly expressed at the surface, whereas the mutants displayed a more diffuse intracellular pattern and stronger surface staining (Fig. 6A). Quantification revealed significant increases in surface/total expression ratios when the RRR motif was removed (Fig. 6B, p < 0.001 versus wild-type flADAM10). Recent studies showed that PDZ (PSD95/DLG/ZO-1) domain-containing scaffolding proteins that associate with receptors and channels early in the secretory pathway can facilitate or inhibit their ER to Golgi transport (14.Standley S.

ADAM10 binds the PDZ domain protein SAP97, interaction which facilitates its trafficking to postsynaptic compartments (12.Marcello E. Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Romorini S. Jeromin A. Epis R. Borroni B. Cattabeni F. Sala C. Padovani A. Di Luca M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To test whether SAP97 could favor ADAM10 ER exit, TacADAM10 and SAP97 were cotransfected in COS7 cells and surface expression was determined. However, SAP97 did not allow TacADAM10 surface expression (Fig. 7A, center panels). The result was confirmed by deglycosylation analysis, which showed that SAP97 coexpression did not modify TacADAM10 maturation, because only the EndoH-sensitive state was attained (Fig. 7B). Alternatively, the activation of specific signaling pathways might be required for ADAM10 transport along the secretory pathway. For instance, SAP97-Ser-39 phosphorylation by CaMKII favors the release of a SAP97/NR2A complex from the ER (28.Mauceri D. Gardoni F. Marcello E. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1032-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the putative role of SAP97 phosphorylation in modulating the ER release of ADAM10, we cotransfected COS7 cells with TacADAM10 and SAP97 mutants that prevent (GFPSAP97-S39A) or mimic (GFPSAP97-S39D) CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation. Neither SAP97-S39D nor SAP97-S39A cotransfection allowed TacADAM10 surface expression in COS7 cells (Fig. 7C). Given that SAP97 can"

Although RPE65 has no predicted membrane spanning domains, this protein predominantly associates with microsomal fractions isolated from bovine retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We have re-examined the nature of RPE65 interactions with native microsomal membranes by using extraction and phase separation experiments. We observe that hydrophobic interactions are the dominant forces that promote RPE65 association with these membranes. These results are consistent with the crystallographic model of RPE65, which features a large lipophilic surface that surrounds the entrance to the catalytic site of this enzyme and likely interacts with the hydrophobic core of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Moreover, we report a critical role for phospholipid membranes in preserving the retinoid isomerization activity and physical properties of RPE65. Isomerase activity measured in bovine RPE was highly sensitive to phospholipase A2 treatment, but the observed decline in 11-cis-retinol production did not directly reflect inhibition by products of lipid hydrolysis. Instead, a direct correlation between the kinetics of phospholipid hydrolysis and retinoid isomerization suggests that the lipid membrane structure is critical for RPE65 enzymatic activity. We also provide evidence that RPE65 operates in a multiprotein complex with retinol dehydrogenase 5 and retinal G protein-coupled receptor in RPE microsomes. Modifications in the phospholipid environment affecting interactions with these protein components may be responsible for the alterations in retinoid metabolism observed in phospholipid-depleted RPE microsomes. Thus, our results indicate that the enzymatic activity of native RPE65 strongly depends on its membrane binding and phospholipid environment.

https://openalex.org/W2120052914,"We earlier identified a lysine to arginine transition at residue 303 (K303R) in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in invasive breast cancers, which confers resistance to the aromatase inhibitor (AI) anastrozole (Ana) when expressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Here, we show that AI resistance arises through an enhanced cross talk of the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R)/insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/Akt pathway with ERalpha, and the serine (S) residue 305 adjacent to the K303R mutation has a key function in mediating this cross talk. The ERalpha S305 residue is an important site that modifies response to tamoxifen; thus, we questioned whether this site could also influence AI response. We generated stable transfectants-expressing wild-type, K303R ERalpha or a double K303R/S305A mutant receptor, and found that the AI-resistant phenotype associated with expression of the K303R mutation was dependent on activation of S305 within the receptor. Ana significantly reduced growth in K303R/S305A-expressing cells. Preventing S305 phosphorylation with a blocking peptide inhibited IGF-1R/IRS-1/Akt activation and also restored AI sensitivity. Our data suggest that the K303R mutation and the S305 ERalpha residue may be a novel determinant of AI response in breast cancer, and blockade of S305 phosphorylation represents a new therapeutic strategy for treating tumors resistant to hormone therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2086651571,"An oncogenic mutation (G49A:E17K) in the AKT1 gene has been described recently in human breast, colon, and ovarian cancers. The low frequency of this mutation and perhaps other selective pressures have prevented the isolation of human cancer cell lines that harbor this mutation thereby limiting functional analysis. Here, we create a physiologic in vitro model to study the effects of this mutation by using somatic cell gene targeting using the nontumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A. Surprisingly, knock in of E17K into the AKT1 gene had minimal phenotypic consequences and importantly, did not recapitulate the biochemical and growth characteristics seen with somatic cell knock in of PIK3CA hotspot mutations. These results suggest that mutations in critical genes within the PI3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are not functionally equivalent, and that other cooperative genetic events may be necessary to achieve oncogenic PI3K pathway activation in cancers that contain the AKT1 E17K mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1988096975,"Plakoglobin (γ-catenin) is a homolog of β-catenin with similar dual adhesive and signaling functions. The adhesive function of these proteins is mediated by their interactions with cadherins, whereas their signaling activity is regulated by association with various intracellular partners. In this respect, β-catenin has a well-defined oncogenic activity through its role in the Wnt signaling pathway, whereas plakoglobin acts as a tumor/metastasis suppressor through mechanisms that remain unclear. We previously expressed plakoglobin in SCC9 squamous carcinoma cells (SCC9-P) and observed a mesenchymal-to-epidermoid transition. Comparison of the protein and RNA profiles of parental SCC9 cells and SCC9-P transfectants identified various differentially expressed proteins and transcripts, including the nonmetastatic protein 23 (Nm23). In this study, we show that Nm23-H1 mRNA and Nm23-H2 protein are increased after plakoglobin expression. Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies using SCC9-P and various epithelial cell lines with endogenous plakoglobin expression revealed that Nm23 interacts with plakoglobin, cadherins and α-catenin. Furthermore, Nm23-H2 is the primary isoform involved in these interactions, which occur prominently in the cytoskeleton-associated pool of cellular proteins. In addition, we show that plakoglobin–Nm23 interaction requires the N-terminal (α-catenin interacting) domain of plakoglobin. Our data suggest that by increasing the expression and stability of Nm23, plakoglobin has a role in regulating the metastasis suppressor activity of Nm23, which may further provide a potential mechanism for the tumor/metastasis suppressor function of plakoglobin itself."
https://openalex.org/W2043423644,"The contribution of zinc-mediated neuronal death in the process of both acute and chronic neurodegeneration has been increasingly appreciated. Phosphatase and tensin homologue, deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), the major tumor suppressor and key regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, plays a critical role in neuronal death in response to various insults. NEDD4-1-mediated PTEN ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin proteosomal system have recently been demonstrated to be the important regulatory mechanism for PTEN in several cancer types. We now demonstrate that PTEN is also the key mediator of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the neuronal response to zinc insult. We used primary cortical neurons and neuroblastoma N2a cells to show that zinc treatment results in a reduction of the PTEN protein level in parallel with increased NEDD4-1 gene/protein expression. The reduced PTEN level is associated with an activated PI3K pathway as determined by elevated phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK-3 as well as by the attenuating effect of a specific PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin). The reduction of PTEN can be attributed to increased protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteosomal system, as we show NEDD4-1 to be the major E3 ligase responsible for PTEN ubiquitination in neurons. Moreover, PTEN and NEDD4-1 appear to be able to counter-regulate each other to mediate the neuronal response to zinc.

Zinc is increasingly recognized as an important molecule that plays both physiological and pathological roles in a variety of biological processes. The role of zinc in the central nervous system has also been discovered over the past 2 decades, as a neurotransmitter in modulating synaptic plasticity (1.Izumi Y. Auberson Y.P. Zorumski C.F. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7181-7188Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2.Qian J. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6089-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although zinc is selectively stored in the pre-synaptic vesicles of a specific type of neuron, sequestered or tightly bound to cellular compartments, it can be rapidly released in response to extracellular signals. The same neurons also secrete glutamate and are the so-called “gluzinergic” neurons found primarily in the mammalian cerebral cortex. Neurons store up to 300 μm free zinc in their termini (3.Frederickson C.J. Klitenick M.A. Manton W.I. Kirkpatrick J.B. Brain Res. 1983; 273: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and release it through several types of cation channels (e.g. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors) when they are depolarized, reaching high concentrations that are known to cause acute neuronal death. Together with glutamate, zinc mediates excitotoxicity, as manifested in acute brain injuries, ischemia, and seizures (4.Frederickson C.J. Koh J.Y. Bush A.I. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 5.Koh J.Y. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 24: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc is also implicated in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease via direct chelation with the amyloid precursor protein, thereby modulating its processing and generating oxidative stress (6.Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Hartshorn M.A. Vonsattel J.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26464-26470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).

In addition, PTEN deficiencies can cause serious defects in brain function such as seizures, ataxia, and brain enlargement (21.Kwon C.H. Zhu X. Zhang J. Knoop L.L. Tharp R. Smeyne R.J. Eberhart C.G.

Furthermore, PTEN is closely associated with neuronal cell death by direct physical interaction with the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor and regulation of the major survival PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (23.Ning K.

Because PTEN is the major regulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, we speculated that it is also a mediator of zinc-induced neuronal death. We therefore aimed to study molecular regulation of PTEN upon zinc treatment in neuronal models. Protein interactions between PTEN with other partners such as MAGI-2 (24.Wu X. Hepner K.

Numerous studies have also shown that post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, oxidation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, are critical for PTEN regulation (28.Salmena L. Carracedo A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2008; 133: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Among these modifications, phosphorylation has been most extensively studied in PTEN. Phosphorylation at five sites (Thr-366, Ser-370, Ser-380, Thr-382, and Ser-385) dramatically reduced PTEN stability and, inversely, increased its enzymatic activity (29.Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Recently, NEDD4-1 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-1) was identified as the first ubiquitin ligase (E3) for PTEN that regulates PTEN degradation in multiple types of cancer cells (human bladder, gastric, and colorectal carcinomas) (30.Wang X.

It is intriguing to note that cellular PTEN is generally very stable, and gene knock-out of NEDD4-1 does not result in a further increase of PTEN stability in the several cell types tested (32.Fouladkou F.

Therefore, it is possible that the enzymatic activity of NEDD4-1 toward PTEN is under tight control (34.Wang X. Shi Y. Wang J. Huang G. Jiang X. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, it has been shown most recently that the tyrosine kinase RAK can inhibit NEDD4-1-mediated PTEN degradation by phosphorylating PTEN (35.Yim E.K. Peng G. Dai H. Hu R. Li K.

However, under which physiological or pathological conditions NEDD4-1 degrades PTEN is still not defined.

Hence, it was intriguing to determine which NEDD4 member(s) (−1 and/or −2) is responsible for modulating PTEN activity in the central nervous system. We now demonstrate that zinc treatment in primary cultured cortical neurons selectively induced protein expression of NEDD4-1 but not NEDD4-2, resulting in enhanced interaction between PTEN and NEDD4-1 and increased PTEN degradation by UPS, accordingly. Moreover, we show that these processes are dependent on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway because a specific inhibitor (wortmannin) completely abolishes the changes to PTEN/NEDD4-1 upon zinc treatment. However, the ubiquitinated/degraded PTEN led to Akt activation, suggesting the existence of a feedback regulatory loop. Down-regulation of NEDD4-1 in N2a cells by its specific siRNA, or by partial immunodepletion of NEDD4-1 in primary cultured neurons, resulted in markedly reduced PTEN ubiquitination and degradation, indicating that NEDD4-1 is the major E3 ligase for PTEN in neuronal systems. We have further validated the notion of reciprocal protein levels of PTEN and NEDD4-1 in rodent brains after systemic administration of zinc to mice. This is the first report on NEDD4-1 as one major E3 ligase for PTEN in the central nervous system, and it shows that ubiquitination of PTEN is crucial for the regulation of PTEN for the PI3K/Akt signaling during the neuronal response to zinc.

For the majority of experiments, zinc was added at 300 μm to 2-week-cultured neurons for 4 h before cell lysates were prepared. In this study, we used ZnSO4 instead of ZnCl2 because it has less cellular toxicity. Neuroblastoma N2a cells were grown to confluency in 6-well plates or 100-mm tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (HyClone)/Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen), 4 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C (24.Wu X.

U87 (PTEN null glioma cell line) cells were grown to confluence on 6-well plates or 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (HyClone) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen), and 200 mg/liter G418 (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed with vector plasmids for pEF-PTEN-WT, pEF-PTEN-C124G, pSUPER-siNEDD4, pGIPZ-shPTEN, pCMV-Tag2B-AKT-WT, and Stealth negative siRNA (Invitrogen). All transfections were performed with LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) on subconfluent N2a cells in 6-well culture plates according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, after the transfections, and 48 h later cell lysates were prepared for further analysis. NEDD4-1-specific siRNA, which targets human and murine Nedd4-1 (NM_006154;TGGCGATTTGTAAACCGAAT), was constructed into the pSUPER-puro vector (OligoEngine, Seattle) according to the company's protocol. Briefly, primers (Nedd4-1 siRNA(+), 5′-GATCCCCTGGCGATTTGTAAACCGAATTCAAGAGATTCGGTTTACAAATCGCCATTTTTA-3′ and Nedd4-1 siRNA(−); 5′-AGCTTAAAAATGGCGATTTGTAAACCGAATCTCTTGAATTCGGTTTACAAATCGCCAGGG-3′) were annealed at 90 °C for 4 min and then at 70 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, these mixtures were step-cooled to 37 °C for 15–20 min and then to 10 °C. Annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of the vector and named pSUPER-siNEDD4-1. For silencing PTEN expression, we purchased the pGIPZ-shPTEN plasmid from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). To validate off-target gene silencing, we used Stealth negative siRNA (Invitrogen) and pGIPZ-nonsilencing shRNA (Open Biosystem) as a negative control. Total RNA was extracted from cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The SuperScript First Strand kit (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA from the samples with an equal amount of RNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesized cDNAs were then amplified using IQTM SYBR Green Supermix and ICycler from Bio-Rad with 3 min of preincubation at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The data were analyzed by using Bio-Rad MyIQ 2.0. PCR products were verified by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers used for NEDD4-1 and GAPDH amplification were as follows: NEDD4-1(+), 5′-CCAGGTTGGGAAGAAAAACA-3′, and NEDD4-1(−), 5′-ATTTCAGATGGCTGGGTCAC-3′; and GAPDH(+), 5′-CCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTA-3′, and GAPDH(−), 5′-CCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAA-3′, respectively. The level of NEDD4-1 mRNA was normalized to that of GAPDH. Relative amounts of NEDD4-1 and GAPDH were determined based on the standard curves prepared by serial dilution of cDNA from mouse N2a cells. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration of each sample was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell lysates (300 μg) were immunoprecipitated with specific antibody against PTEN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Following immunoprecipitation, immunoprecipitants or cell lysates were heated at 90 °C for 5 min in 2× TG sample loading buffer and separated on NuPAGETM 4–12% Tris glycine gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and probed at 4 °C overnight with the primary antibody in 5% skim milk/PBST. In this study, the following antibodies (Abs) were used: rabbit anti-PTEN Ab (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); goat anti-PTEN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-α-tubulin Ab (Sigma); rabbit anti-p-Akt Ab (Cell Signaling); rabbit Akt 1/2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-mono-poly-Ub Ab (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA); rabbit anti-NEDD4 Ab (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA); rabbit anti-NEDD4-2 Ab (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); mouse anti-FLAG Ab (Sigma); mouse anti-β-actin Ab (Sigma); and anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Abs (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The membranes were washed three times for 10 min each with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST, pH 7.4) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in 5% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBST, immunoreactive bands were visualized by using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) chemiluminescence reagent. Neuronal cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for the indicated times in the presence or absence of 300 μm ZnSO4. Cycloheximide was simultaneously treated with ZnSO4. Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and cell lysates were then prepared for further analysis. Zinc was added 300 μm to 2-week-cultured neurons for 4 h before cell lysates were prepared. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a control mouse IgG and NEDD4-1-specific antibodies and labeled as Mock and NEDD4-1, respectively. The treated lysates (15 μg) were then used in an in vitro PTEN ubiquitination assay using recombinant hemagglutinin-tagged PTEN as substrate as described previously (30.Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T.

Mouse handling was performed according to the standard procedures approved by the Animal Research Committee at Burnham Institute for Medical Research and National Institutes of Health Guidelines. A small volume (200 μl, 600 μm) of ZnSO4 or saline was administered to 12-month-old female C57B6 transgenic mice by intraperitoneal route at different time points (0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h). To prepare brain lysates, mouse brains were removed, dissected, and minced by a Dounce homogenizer. Protein samples were prepared by lysing the smashed tissue with ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). All quantitative data were presented as means ± S.D. Comparison between groups were analyzed with unpaired analysis of variance using GraphPad PRIZM software (La Jolla, CA), and values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Zinc, as an essential catalytic and structural element of many proteins and a signaling messenger, is increasingly recognized as a key player in neuronal activities at many central excitatory synapses. Excessive synaptic release of zinc followed by its entry into vulnerable neurons contributes to severe neuronal cell death accompanied by Akt activation and its downstream signaling events. Because PTEN is known to be the major regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway via its phosphatase activity, which converts phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, we therefore speculate that zinc also modulates PTEN, making PTEN the major executer of neuronal response to zinc. Indeed, exposure to Zn2+ significantly reduced PTEN protein levels in primary cultured neurons in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a significant effect seen at 25 μm and a 4-h time point at 100 μm (Fig. 1, A and B). Maximum reduction of PTEN protein levels was observed with 300 μm Zn2+. To examine whether reduction of PTEN was induced nonspecifically by exposure to any heavy metal ions, we exposed neurons to various concentrations of two additional metal ions, MgSO4 and CuSO4. However, these ions did not show any effect on PTEN levels (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the PTEN level was specifically reduced by Zn2+. To examine whether reduction of PTEN was due to a decrease of its protein stability in neurons, we performed a cycloheximide chase experiment (Fig. 1C). Although PTEN levels were stable in the untreated group, treatment with Zn2+-induced reduction in PTEN stability after 1 h, with a significant loss of PTEN after 5 h. These results indicated that the Zn2+-induced PTEN reduction in primary cortical neurons was due to its decreased protein stability. Furthermore, we found that pretreatment of cells with the specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 (25 μm for 30 min) before Zn2+ exposure completely rescued PTEN from degradation (Fig. 1C, last lane), indicating an involvement of the UPS. Zinc has been shown to induce neuronal death in immortalized embryonic hippocampal cells, accompanied by Akt activation (9.Min Y.K. Lee J.E. Chung K.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We report here a similar observation for primary cultured cortical neuronal cells. We assessed the effects of Zn2+ on p-Akt and p-GSK3α/β levels. Treatment with Zn2+ induced both p-Akt and p-GSK3α/β in neurons, in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, we found that co-incubation or pretreatment with a PI3K-specific inhibitor (200 nm wortmannin) not only completely abolished Akt activation, as evidenced by knocking down p-Akt below the basal level, but also reversed the effect of zinc on reducing PTEN protein to its basal level (Fig. 2, C–E). These results indicated a negative feedback mechanism in PI3K signaling for regulating PTEN levels, although it is not clear which component(s) of the PI3K/Akt pathway mediates this effect. Because MG132 can fully prevent PTEN degradation via the UPS upon exposure to Zn2+, ubiquitination is likely necessary for the observed PTEN reduction. NEDD4-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase from the HECT (homologous to E6-associated protein (E6AP) C terminus) family, has recently been identified as the enzyme responsible for PTEN ubiquitination in a number of cancer cell types (30.Wang X.

We purified the lipopolysaccharide-induced form of PP2A by chromatography plus immunoprecipitation and used mass spectrometry to identify VCP/p97 as a novel partner for PP2Ac. Endogenous VCP/p97 and PP2Ac were co-immunoprecipitated from primary murine macrophages and human lymphocytes. GST-VCP/p97 bound purified PP2A in pulldown assays, showing direct protein-protein interaction. Endotoxin conditioning of macrophages induced formation of 3-nitrotyrosine in the PP2Ac associated with VCP/p97, a response severely reduced in macrophages from iNOS knock-out mice. The reaction of purified PP2A with peroxynitrite dissociated the A subunit, and 3-nitro-Tyr284 was identified in PP2Ac by mass spectrometry. Myc-PP2Ac (Y284F) expressed in cells was resistant to peroxynitrite-induced nitration and reduction of A subunit binding.

https://openalex.org/W2168662283,"Signal transduction by the NF-kappaB pathway is a key regulator of a host of cellular responses to extracellular and intracellular messages. The NEMO adaptor protein lies at the top of this pathway and serves as a molecular conduit, connecting signals transmitted from upstream sensors to the downstream NF-kappaB transcription factor and subsequent gene activation. The position of NEMO within this pathway makes it an attractive target from which to search for new proteins that link NF-kappaB signaling to additional pathways and upstream effectors. In this work, we have used protein microarrays to identify novel NEMO interactors. A total of 112 protein interactors were identified, with the most statistically significant hit being the canonical NEMO interactor IKKbeta, with IKKalpha also being identified. Of the novel interactors, more than 30% were kinases, while at least 25% were involved in signal transduction. Binding of NEMO to several interactors, including CALB1, CDK2, SAG, SENP2 and SYT1, was confirmed using GST pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitation, validating the initial screening approach. Overexpression of CALB1, CDK2 and SAG was found to stimulate transcriptional activation by NF-kappaB, while SYT1 overexpression repressed TNFalpha-dependent NF-kappaB transcriptional activation in human embryonic kidney cells. Corresponding with this finding, RNA silencing of CDK2, SAG and SENP2 reduced NF-kappaB transcriptional activation, supporting a positive role for these proteins in the NF-kappaB pathway.

Mechanism upregulating survivin expression in tumour cells is poorly understood. In this study, we show that breast cancer patients harbouring a polymorphism G235A in the survivin promoter present a higher level of survivin expression. This polymorphism creates a binding site for the transcription factor GATA-1 inducing a second GATA-1-binding site in survivin promoter. At the mRNA level, GATA-1 was present in breast carcinomas and adjacent normal tissues, whereas the protein was only detected in carcinomas by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Transfection of wild-type and different constitutively active GATA-1 mutants (serine 26, 178 or 310) showed that only phospho-serine 26 GATA-1 was able to increase survivin expression. This increase was higher in G235A than in G235G cell lines. Phospho-serine 26 GATA-1 bound directly survivin promoter, with a stronger interaction in G235A than in G235G polymorphism indicating that both GATA-1-binding sites are functional. These data identify GATA-1 as a key feature in tumour aggressiveness by enhancing survivin expression and delineate its targeting as a possible new therapeutic strategy in breast carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2061372986,"Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is characterized by activation of the cortical and hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) and atonia of non-respiratory muscles with superimposed phasic activity or twitching, particularly of cranial muscles such as those of the eye, tongue, face and jaw. While phasic activity is a characteristic feature of REMS, the neural substrates driving this activity remain unresolved. Here we investigated the neural circuits underlying masseter (jaw) phasic activity during REMS. The trigeminal motor nucleus (Mo5), which controls masseter motor function, receives glutamatergic inputs mainly from the parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt), but also from the adjacent paramedian reticular area (PMnR). On the other hand, the Mo5 and PCRt do not receive direct input from the sublaterodorsal (SLD) nucleus, a brainstem region critical for REMS atonia of postural muscles. We hypothesized that the PCRt-PMnR, but not the SLD, regulates masseter phasic activity during REMS.To test our hypothesis, we measured masseter electromyogram (EMG), neck muscle EMG, electrooculogram (EOG) and EEG in rats with cell-body specific lesions of the SLD, PMnR, and PCRt. Bilateral lesions of the PMnR and rostral PCRt (rPCRt), but not the caudal PCRt or SLD, reduced and eliminated REMS phasic activity of the masseter, respectively. Lesions of the PMnR and rPCRt did not, however, alter the neck EMG or EOG. To determine if rPCRt neurons use glutamate to control masseter phasic movements, we selectively blocked glutamate release by rPCRt neurons using a Cre-lox mouse system. Genetic disruption of glutamate neurotransmission by rPCRt neurons blocked masseter phasic activity during REMS.These results indicate that (1) premotor glutamatergic neurons in the medullary rPCRt and PMnR are involved in generating phasic activity in the masseter muscles, but not phasic eye movements, during REMS; and (2) separate brainstem neural circuits control postural and cranial muscle phasic activity during REMS."
https://openalex.org/W2116706523,"A crucial role of segmental duplications (SDs) of the human genome has been shown in chromosomal rearrangements associated with several genomic disorders. Limited knowledge is yet available on the molecular processes resulting in chromosomal rearrangements in tumors. The t(9;22)(q34;q11) rearrangement causing the 5′BCR/3′ABL gene formation has been detected in more than 90% of cases with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In 10–18% of patients with CML, genomic deletions were detected on der(9) chromosome next to translocation breakpoints. The molecular mechanism triggering the t(9;22) and deletions on der(9) is still speculative. Here we report a molecular cytogenetic analysis of a large series of patients with CML with der(9) deletions, revealing an evident breakpoint clustering in two regions located proximally to ABL and distally to BCR, containing an interchromosomal duplication block (SD_9/22). The deletions breakpoints distribution appeared to be strictly related to the distance from the SD_9/22. Moreover, bioinformatic analyses of the regions surrounding the SD_9/22 revealed a high Alu frequency and a poor gene density, reflecting genomic instability and susceptibility to rearrangements. On the basis of our results, we propose a three-step model for t(9;22) formation consisting of alignment of chromosomes 9 and 22 mediated by SD_9/22, spontaneous chromosome breakages and misjoining of DNA broken ends."
https://openalex.org/W1976919956,"Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) was originally identified as part of a chromosomal translocation that contributes to the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Since its discovery, PML has been found to play diverse roles in different cellular processes. Notably, PML has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity that supports its role as a tumor suppressor. We have previously shown that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is able to affect cell proliferation and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-mediated cell death through modulation of the steady-state levels of PML. We have extended these studies to show that the interaction between PML and Pin1 is targeted by multiple extracellular signals in the cell. We show that H(2)O(2) up-regulates and IGF-1 down-regulates PML expression in a Pin1-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that H(2)O(2)- and IGF-1-mediated alteration in PML accumulation regulate MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Furthermore, we show that the control of cell migration by PML, and thus H(2)O(2) and IGF-1, results from PML-dependent decreased expression of integrin beta1 (ITGB1). Knockdown of Pin1 leads to decreased cell migration, lower levels of ITGB1 expression and resistance to IGF-1- and H(2)O(2)-induced changes in cell migration and ITGB1 expression. Taken together, our work identifies PML as a common target for H(2)O(2) and IGF-1 and supports a novel tumor suppressive role for PML in controlling cell migration through the expression of ITGB1."

Cyclin D1 is a pivotal regulator of cell cycle progression, and increased expression strongly correlates with malignant transformation. Here, we characterize the mechanism of Tax transactivation of cyclin D1. We find that cyclin D1 transcript levels are elevated in HTLV-1 infected cells and that Tax physically associates with the cyclin D1 gene in vivo. Tax binds the cyclin D1 promoter-proximal cyclic AMP response element (CRE) in the presence of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in vitro, and together the Tax-pCREB complex recruits the cellular co-activator p300 to the promoter through this unconventional Tax-responsive element. We further show that the transducer of regulated CREB 2 (TORC2) cooperates with Tax to further enhance p300 recruitment to the cyclin D1 promoter in vitro. Tax and TORC2 in combination stimulate cyclin D1 expression in vivo, demonstrating the functional outcome of the binding interactions. Together, our findings support a model in which Tax-induced accumulation of cyclin D1 shortens the G1 phase of the cell cycle, promotes mitotic replication of the virus, and drives selection and expansion of malignant T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2009540913,"Chicken avidin and bacterial streptavidin are widely employed in vitro for their capacity to bind biotin, but their pharmacokinetics and immunological properties are not always optimal, thereby limiting their use in medical treatments. Here we investigate the biochemical and biological properties of a new modified avidin, obtained by ligand-assisted sodium periodate oxidation of avidin. This method allows protection of biotin-binding sites of avidin from inactivation caused by the oxidation step and delay of avidin clearance from injected tissue by generation of aldehyde groups from avidin carbohydrate moieties. Oxidized avidin shows spectroscopic properties similar to that of native avidin, indicating that tryptophan residues are spared from oxidation damage. In strict agreement with these results, circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses confirm that the ligand-assisted oxidation preserves the avidin protein structure and its biotin binding capacity. In vitro cell binding and in vivo tissue residence experiments demonstrate that aldehyde groups provide oxidized avidin the property to bind cellular and interstitial protein amino groups through Schiff's base formation, resulting in a tissue half-life of 2 weeks, compared with 2 h of native avidin. In addition, the efficient uptake of the intravenously injected (111)In-BiotinDOTA (ST2210) in the site previously treated with modified avidin underlines that tissue-bound oxidized avidin retains its biotin binding capacity in vivo. The results presented here indicate that oxidized avidin could be employed to create a stable artificial receptor in diseased tissues for the targeting of biotinylated therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2026352068,"The secretin receptor, a prototypic family B G protein-coupled receptor, forms a constitutive homodimeric complex that is stable even in the presence of hormone. Recently, a model of this agonist-bound receptor was built based on high resolution structures reported for amino-terminal domains of other family members. Although this model provided the best solution for all extant data, including 10 photoaffinity labeling constraints, a new such constraint now obtained with a position 16 photolabile probe was inconsistent with this model. As the secretin receptor forms constitutive homodimers, we explored whether secretin might dock across both protomers of the complex, an observation that could also contribute to the negative cooperativity observed. To directly explore this, we prepared six secretin analogue probes that simultaneously incorporated two photolabile benzoylphenylalanines as sites of covalent attachment, in positions known to label distinct receptor subdomains. Each bifunctional probe was a full agonist that labeled the receptor specifically and saturably, with electrophoretic migration consistent with labeling a single protomer of the homodimeric secretin receptor. No band representing radiolabeled receptor dimer was observed with any bifunctional probe. The labeled monomeric receptor bands were cleaved with cyanogen bromide to demonstrate that both of the photolabile benzoylphenylalanines within a single probe had established covalent adducts with a single receptor in the complex. These data are consistent with a model of secretin occupying a single secretin receptor protomer within the homodimeric receptor complex. A new molecular model accommodating all constraints is now proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2044464633,"Background An accumulating body of evidence suggests that Dtnbp1 (Dysbindin) is a key susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Using the yeast-two-hybrid screening system, we examined the candidate proteins interacting with Dysbindin and revealed one of these candidates to be the transcription factor NF-YB. Methods We employed an immunoprecipitation (IP) assay to demonstrate the Dysbindin-NF-YB interaction. DNA chips were used to screen for altered expression of genes in cells in which Dysbindin or NF-YB was down regulated, while Chromatin IP and Reporter assays were used to confirm the involvement of these genes in transcription of Myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS). The sdy mutant mice with a deletion in Dysbindin, which exhibit behavioral abnormalities, and wild-type DBA2J mice were used to investigate MARCKS expression. Results We revealed an interaction between Dysbindin and NF-YB. DNA chips showed that MARCKS expression was increased in both Dysbindin knockdown cells and NF-YB knockdown cells, and Chromatin IP revealed interaction of these proteins at the MARCKS promoter region. Reporter assay results suggested functional involvement of the interaction between Dysbindin and NF-YB in MARCKS transcription levels, via the CCAAT motif which is a NF-YB binding sequence. MARCKS expression was increased in sdy mutant mice when compared to wild-type mice. Conclusions These findings suggest that abnormal expression of MARCKS via dysfunction of Dysbindin might cause impairment of neural transmission and abnormal synaptogenesis. Our results should provide new insights into the mechanisms of neuronal development and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2143372313,"All but 11 of the 323 known actin sequences have Tyr at position 53, and the 11 exceptions have the conservative substitution Phe, which raises the following questions. What is the critical role(s) of Tyr-53, and, if it can be replaced by Phe, why has this happened so infrequently? We compared the properties of purified endogenous Dictyostelium actin and mutant constructs with Tyr-53 replaced by Phe, Ala, Glu, Trp, and Leu. The Y53F mutant did not differ significantly from endogenous actin in any of the properties assayed, but the Y53A and Y53E mutants differed substantially; affinity for DNase I was reduced, the rate of nucleotide exchange was increased, the critical concentration for polymerization was increased, filament elongation was inhibited, and polymerized actin was in the form of small oligomers and imperfect filaments. Growth and/or development of cells expressing these actin mutants were also inhibited. The Trp and Leu mutations had lesser but still significant effects on cell phenotype and the biochemical properties of the purified actins. We conclude that either Tyr or Phe is required to maintain the functional conformations of the DNase I-binding loop (D-loop) in both G- and F-actin, and that the conformation of the D-loop affects not only the properties that directly involve the D-loop (binding to DNase I and polymerization) but also allosterically modifies the conformation of the nucleotide-binding cleft, thus increasing the rate of nucleotide exchange. The apparent evolutionary “preference” for Tyr at position 53 may be the result of Tyr allowing dynamic modification of the D-loop conformation by phosphorylation (Baek, K., Liu, X., Ferron, F., Shu, S., Korn, E. D., and Dominguez, R. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 11748–11753) with effects similar, but not identical, to those of the Ala and Glu mutations.

Actin is one of the most highly conserved proteins, with all actins having the same amino acid in at least 7% of the 375 positions (1.Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J.C. Protein Profile Actin. 4th Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 44Google Scholar) and about 95% of actins having the same amino acid in about 66% of the positions. The substitution in 74% of the positions that have at least one substitution is always the same amino acid, often a conservative substitution (1.Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J.C. Protein Profile Actin. 4th Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 44Google Scholar). Tyr-53 is an example of this last situation. All but 11 (3.5%) of the 323 actin sequences in the data base PROSITE, entry PDOC00340, have Tyr at position 53, with Phe replacing Tyr in all 11 exceptions: five Plasmodium actins (Q4ZIL3, Q8I440, P10988, P8687, and Q7RME1), three Trypanosoma actins (P12432, P12433, and P53477), and one actin each from Arabidopsis (Q8RY62), Euplotes (P20360), and Pichia (Q9P4D1). One could ask, in this and similar situations, what is the critical role of the amino acid (Tyr in this example) that leads to its strong conservation throughout evolution, and why is it, very occasionally, replaced by one, and only one, other amino acid (Phe in this example). The conservation of Tyr-53 is particularly striking because the immediately adjacent DNase I-binding loop (D-loop) 2The abbreviations used are: D-loopDNase I-binding looppY53-actinTyr-53-phosphorylated actinS1myosin subfragment 1TEVtobacco etch virusTEVCSTEV cleavage siteWTwild typeY/Aexpressed actin with Y53A mutationY/Eexpressed actin with Y53E mutationY/Fexpressed actin with Y53F mutationY/Yexpressed WT actinY/Lexpressed actin with Y53L mutationY/Wexpressed actin with Y53W mutationMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. in subdomain 2, originally defined as residues 40–50 (2.Kabsch W.

It may be relevant that Tyr-53 is dynamically phosphorylated when Dictyostelium amoebae are subjected to stress (3.Schweiger A. Mihalache O. Ecke M. Gerisch G. J.

To understand the consequences of Tyr-53 phosphorylation at the molecular level, we had previously determined some of the biochemical and biophysical properties and the atomic structure of pY53-actin isolated from Dictyostelium (10.Liu X.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11748-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly summarized, the crystal structure of pY53-actin shows the formation of hydrogen bonds between the phosphate group and residues Gly-48, Gln-49, and Lys-61 (14.Baek K. Liu X. Ferron F. Shu S. Korn E.D. Dominguez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11748-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), thus partially stabilizing the D-loop, which is fully disordered in unphosphorylated actin, allowing the resolution of D-loop residues Gly-42, Met-47, Gly-48, and Gln-49. As a consequence of the conformational change in the D-loop, phosphorylation of Tyr-53 reduces the rate of subtilisin cleavage of the D-loop (10.Liu X. Shu S. Hong M.S. Levine R.L. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13694-13699Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), reduces the affinity of monomeric actin for pancreatic DNase I (14.Baek K. Liu X. Ferron F. Shu S. Korn E.D.

Ferron F. Shu S. Korn E.D. Dominguez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11748-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr-53 also affects actin polymerization (10.Liu X. Shu S. Hong M.S. Levine R.L. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13694-13699Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The critical concentration is increased, the rates of nucleation and pointed end elongation are reduced, polymerization and ATP hydrolysis are partially uncoupled, and filaments of pY53-actin are unstable such that polymerized pY53-actin is predominantly in the form of very short oligomers. These observations raise the question whether the effects of Tyr-53 phosphorylation are due to the “loss” of tyrosine or the addition of phosphate. In the research reported in this paper, we initially studied the biochemical and biophysical properties of Dictyostelium actin with Tyr-53 replaced by either Phe, to mimic Tyr; Glu, to mimic the negative charge of phospho-Tyr; Ala, to remove the bulky (hydrophobic) side chain; or Leu and Trp, to determine whether any hydrophobic amino acid could replace Tyr-53 or if an aromatic amino acid were required. With that as background, we then examined the effects of expression of the mutant actins on cell growth and development. Dictyostelium actin cDNA (a generous gift of Dr. Gunther Gerisch (Max-Planck-Institut fÜr Biochemie, Martinsried, Germany)) was mutated at position Tyr-53 by PCR to Phe, Ala, Glu, Leu, or Trp. A FLAG sequence followed by a TEV-protease cleavage site (TEVCS) (DYKDDDDK-ENLYFQG) was fused to the N terminus of the mutated actins (Y/F, Y/A, Y/E, Y/L, and Y/W) and WT actin (Y/Y), which was expressed as a control. WT and mutant actin cDNAs were cloned into a pTIKL vector, which has an actin 15 promoter and G-418 resistance (15.Liu X. Ito K. Lee R.J. Uyeda T.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). WT and mutant actin DNAs were transfected into AX3 cells by standard electroporation. G-418-resistant cells were selected by growing cells on plates with HL-5 medium containing 16 μg/ml G-418, and cell lines were maintained on plates. For protein purification, cells were grown in suspension culture in five 4-liter flasks, or, for Y/W-actin, on multiple 25 × 25-cm plates. Cells were harvested; washed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; lysed (40 g/280 ml) in G-buffer (4 mm Tris, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) containing 0.6% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science); and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 40 g of DEAE-52 for 1 h, the mixture was loaded onto a 25 × 20-cm column, and the column was eluted with 100 ml of buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with a gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m KCl followed by 50 ml of the same buffer containing 0.5 m KCl. The fractions containing actin (identified by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and mixed with 8 ml of anti-FLAG resin (Sigma) in G-buffer. The column was washed with G-buffer and eluted with G-buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The FLAG-TEVCS-actins were then incubated on ice overnight with TEV-protease at a weight ratio of 20:1, to remove the FLAG-TEVCS peptide. The resultant actin was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a mono P HR 5/20 column (GE Healthcare) eluted with 120 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with a gradient of KCl from 0 to 500 mm. The actin fractions identified by SDS-PAGE were pooled, concentrated by Amicon Ultra-4 (Millipore) filtration to ∼1 mg/ml, and dialyzed against G-buffer overnight. The actin was centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge before use. Endogenous WT actin was purified as a by-product of the purifications of the mutant actins. WT actin was precipitated from the flow-through from the FLAG affinity column by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 50% saturation, dissolved in ∼30 ml of G-buffer, and polymerized on ice for 1 h after the addition of MgCl2 to 2 mm. The polymerized actin was collected by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellet was depolymerized by overnight dialysis against G-buffer. The depolymerized actin was further purified by chromatography on a 26 × 60-cm Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare) in G-buffer and a mono P HR 5/20 column, dialyzed against G-buffer overnight, and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge before use. The bacterial strain carrying the TEV-protease expression vector was a generous gift of Dr. David S. Waugh (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Expression and purification of TEV-protease were carried out as described by Tropea et al. (16.Tropea J.E. Cherry S. Waugh D.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 498: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric characterization of the proteins was carried out as described (10.Liu X. Shu S. Hong M.S. Levine R.L. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13694-13699Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins were injected by reverse-phase chromatography on a narrow bore C18 column, with a flow rate of 20 μl/min, and analyzed on an Agilent Technologies model 1100 high pressure liquid chromatograph coupled to an Agilent model G1969A mass spectrometer with a time-of-flight detector. Full-length myosin II and regulatory light chain kinase were purified as described (15.Liu X. Ito K. Lee R.J. Uyeda T.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the myosin light chain was phosphorylated by the addition of kinase, at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml, to ∼10 mg of myosin in 40 ml. Purified myosin II was dissolved in 50% glycerol and stored in liquid N2 before use. Expression and purification of S1 were performed according to the procedure described previously (17.Liu X. Shu S. Kovács M. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26974-26983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). S1 was kept in liquid N2 before use. Subtilisin (Sigma) dissolved in G-buffer was added to 16 μm actin in G-buffer at a molar ratio of 1:5,200. Digestion was performed at 23 °C for 1 h with samples removed at the indicated times for analysis by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The nucleotide exchange assay was performed as described (18.Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Free ATP was removed from G-actin by centrifugation of 65 μl of actin applied to a micro Bio-spin 30 chromatography column (Bio-Rad) in G-buffer minus ATP, the bound ATP was replaced by etheno-ATP (Molecular Probes), excess etheno-ATP was removed by centrifugal chromatography, and 0.1 mm ATP was added to 3 μm G-actin. The decrease in fluorescence as the ATP replaced bound etheno-ATP was monitored in an LS55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission wavelength of 410 nm. Endogenous and mutant actins in G-buffer were polymerized at 22 °C by the addition of KCl and MgCl2 to 100 and 2 mm, respectively. Polymerization was followed by right angle light scattering in a LS55 luminescence spectrometer with both emission and excitation wavelength of 360 nm and a slit width of 4 nm. Inorganic phosphate released by the hydrolysis of ATP during actin polymerization was measured by the Enzchek phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes). In this assay, phosphate is quantified by the increased absorption at 360 nm when 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside is converted to 2 amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl-purine and ribose-1-phosphate catalyzed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Actin at the indicated concentrations was preincubated for 8 min with the assay reagents to remove inorganic phosphate before initiating polymerization by the addition of KCl and MgCl2. The final reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside, 0.8 units of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and actin as indicated in a volume of 600 μl. The final mixture was divided into two samples: 450 μl for measuring phosphate release and 150 μl for measuring polymerization by light scattering. Actin at various concentrations in G-buffer was polymerized overnight at room temperature after the addition of KCl and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 100 and 2 mm, respectively, and the extent of polymerization was measured by light scattering. The in vitro motility assay was carried out at 30 °C according to Ito et al. (19.Ito K. Liu X. Katayama E. Uyeda T.Q. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 985-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with Dictyostelium myosin II. Actin at 5 μm in G-buffer was polymerized at room temperature for 3–5 h by the addition of MgCl2 to 2 mm and rhodamine-phalloidin to 5 μm, and the labeled actin was kept on ice until use. Motility buffer consisted of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Steady-state ATPase activity was assayed in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 150 nm S1, and F-actin at the indicated concentrations. The production of 32Pi was determined as described (20.Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after incubation at 30 °C for 12 min, during which period the reaction rates were constant. Actin was polymerized overnight in the presence of 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5. One drop of the filament suspension (0.1–0.5 mg/ml) was placed on a Formvar/carbon-coated, 400-mesh copper grid previously glow-discharged for 30 s in an EMScope TB500 sputter coater (Emscope Laboratories). After 1 min, the excess liquid was absorbed with filter paper. The grid was stained with a drop of 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s, the excess stain was removed with filter paper, and the sample was observed in a JEM-1200EX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL). SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Actin concentration was determined by absorption at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.62 cm2/mg. DNase I activity was measured by the change in A260 when Sigma DNA (50 μg/ml) was added to 0.7 nm Sigma DNase I and the indicated concentrations of G-actin in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 ml CaCl2, and 1 mm NaN3 as described (10.Liu X.

To measure cell growth, 50 ml of cells (1 or 2 × 105 cells/ml) in HL-5 medium containing 16 μg/ml G-418 were cultured in a 250-ml flask on a rotary shaker at 145 rpm and 21 °C, and cells were counted daily using a cellometer (AutoT4 cell counter, Nexcelom Bioscience). For development assays, cells growing in HL-5 medium were washed twice with starvation buffer (20 mm Mes (Sigma), pH 6.8, 0.2 mMCaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4), and 6 × 106 cells in 50 μl of starvation buffer were spread over one-third of a 10-cm diameter plate containing agarose in starvation buffer. Cells were observed for 48 h with a Discovery V12 stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a PlanApos ×1.0 objective and an AxioCam camera automated by AxioVision 4 software. For localization of total actin and expressed FLAG-TEVCS-actins, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in cold methanol at −20 °C for 5 min, washed, and then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 100-fold diluted rabbit anti-actin (catalog number A-200, Sigma) and 500-fold diluted anti-FLAG-antibody (catalog number F-3165, Sigma) in phosphate buffer supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% saponin. Secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyantate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), were diluted 750-fold. Images were observed under an LSM-510 laser-scanning fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Initially, Y/F, Y/A, and Y/E mutant actins, with an N-terminal FLAG-TEVCS tag, were expressed in Dictyostelium, purified, and separated from endogenous actin by FLAG-affinity chromatography, and the FLAG tag was removed by cleavage with TEV-protease, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the expressed actins (Y/F, Y/A, and Y/E) had an N-terminal glycyl group instead of the N-terminal acetyl group of endogenous actin and were purified by a different procedure than endogenous actin, wild type actin (Y/Y) was also expressed and purified to serve as a control for any differences not related to the mutations at position 53. The purity of typical actin preparations was determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), and their sequences were confirmed by mass spectrometry (Table 1). The typical yield of purified, expressed actin was 1 mg per 10 g of cells.TABLE 1Comparison of calculated and experimental masses of endogenous wild-type and expressed actinsActinCalculated massExperimental massDaDaWT41,657.741,657.9Y/Y41,672.741,672.8Y/F41,656.741,656.6Y/A41,580.641,580.6Y/E41,638.641,638.4Y/W41,695.741,695.4Y/L41,622.741,622.7 Open table in a new tab We first studied the effects of the Y/F, Y/A, and Y/E mutations on three properties of monomeric actin: cleavage of the D-loop by subtilisin, inhibition of DNase I activity, and nucleotide exchange. There was little, if any difference, in the rate or the products of subtilisin cleavage of Y/Y or Y/F compared with WT (Fig. 2). Y/A was also cleaved at the same rate as WT, and Y/E was cleaved only slightly more slowly (Fig. 2), but both Y/A and Y/E showed a minor cleavage product in addition to the major product. The cleavage products of Y/Y and the major cleavage products of Y/E had the expected masses (Table 2) for cleavage of the D-loop between Met-47 and Gly-48 (22.Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The mass of the minor product of subtilisin cleavage of Y/E was consistent with cleavage between residues Leu-67 and Lys-68 (Table 2).TABLE 2Comparison of calculated and experimental masses of the subtilisin cleavage products of wild-type and Y/E actinActinResiduesCalculated massExperimental massDaDaWTAcetyl-1–47aMass includes an N-terminal acetyl group.4,844.54,844.148–37536,831.236,830.2Y/EGlycyl-1–47bMass includes an N-terminal glycyl group.4,859.54,859.248–37536,797.136,796.768–37534,683.834,682.8a Mass includes an N-terminal acetyl group.b Mass includes an N-terminal glycyl group. Open table in a new tab Although the rates and products of subtilisin cleavage provided little evidence for a significant conformational change in the D-loop as a result of the Tyr-53 mutations, there was a substantial effect on the ability of Y/A and Y/E to inhibit DNase I activity. The concentration of actin required for 50% inhibition of 0.7 nm DNase I was the same for WT, Y/Y, and Y/F (2.5 nm), but significantly higher concentrations of Y/A (4.2 nm) and Y/E (5.8 nm) were required for 50% inhibition of DNase I activity (Fig. 3A). Thus, the data for DNase I inhibition demonstrate that the conformation of the D-loops of Y/A and Y/E, but not the D-loop of Y/F, were affected by the mutations and that the N-terminal glycyl group had no effect (Y/Y). The rates of nucleotide exchange of monomeric WT, Y/Y, and Y/F were essentially the same, with t½ of 15, 16, and 15 s, respectively, but nucleotide exchange of Y/A and Y/E was greatly accelerated, with t½ of 4.5 and 5.5 s, respectively (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that conformational changes in the D-loops of Y/A and Y/E allosterically affect the conformation of the nucleotide-binding cleft (see “Discussion”). The critical concentrations of WT, Y/Y, and Y/F actins were indistinguishable (0.3 μm), but Y/A and Y/E had significantly higher critical concentrations of 2 and 1.7 μm, respectively (Fig. 4A). The time courses of polymerization of WT, Y/Y, and Y/F were also similar (Fig. 4B); however, Y/A and Y/E polymerized significantly more slowly than WT, Y/Y, and Y/F (Fig. 4B). The filaments formed by Y/Y and Y/F were indistinguishable from WT filaments by negative staining electron microscopy; all three had clear helical patterns (Fig. 5). Y/A filaments were less clearly defined, with multiple imperfections, and were mixed with small oligomers. Y/E formed a few, imperfect filaments but mostly polymerized into small aggregates. Normally, under the conditions of polymerization used in these experiments, 1 mol of ATP is hydrolyzed per mol of actin polymerized. This was the case for polymerization of WT, Y/Y, and Y/F actins (Fig. 6); 5–6 μm ATP was hydrolyzed (Fig. 6A) during the polymerization of ∼5.7 μm actin (6 μm total actin minus the critical concentrations of 0.3 μm) (Figs. 4A and 6B), and the rate of ATP hydrolysis was very slow after polymerization was complete. In contrast, during the polymerization of ∼6 μm Y/A and Y/E actins (8 μm total actin minus ∼2 μm critical concentration) (Figs. 4A and 6B), 11–13 μm ATP was hydrolyzed, and ATP hydrolysis continued after polymerization was essentially complete (Fig. 6A). These data suggest that the Y53A and Y53E mutations increase the rate of ATP exchange in filamentous actin, as they do for monomeric actin, or, alternatively, the data might indicate a more rapid turnover of actin subunits in Y/A and Y/E. The apparently greater rates of polymerization of actin in the experiment described in Fig. 6B compared with that shown in Fig. 4B were due to the higher Mg2+ concentration (3 mm in Fig. 6B versus 2 mm in Fig. 4B). In a separate experiment, t½ for polymerization of WT actin was 500 s in 2 mm Mg2+versus 340 s in 3 mm Mg2+. Y/Y and Y/F were equally effective as WT in activating the MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium myosin S1 (Fig. 7A and Table 3), but Y/A and Y/E appeared to activate myosin MgATPase activity less well (Fig. 7A). However, the in vitro motility activities of Y/A and Y/E were indistinguishable from the activities of WT, Y/Y, and Y/F (Table 3). On the assumption that the relatively low activation of myosin MgATPase activity by Y/A and Y/E might have been due to the impaired ability of Y/A and Y/E to form filaments, which would have been stabilized by the phalloidin present in the motility assay, we repeated the actomyosin ATPase experiment in the presence of phalloidin. The results in Fig. 7B and Table 3 indicate this to be the case, and thus, none of the Tyr-53 mutations has a substantial effect on either the in vitro motility of actin or its ability to activate myosin MgATPase.TABLE 3Actin-activated myosin MgATPase and in vitro motility assays with endogenous wild-type and expressed actinsActinActin-activated ATPaseMotilityVmaxKmnVs−1μmμm/sWT with/without phalloidinaApplies only to ATPase assay; all in vitro motility assays have phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments.9.4 ± 0.142 ± 0.5623.66 ± 0.62Y/Y without phalloidin1048993.53 ± 0.58Y/F without phalloidin1262933.77 ± 0.76Y/A with phalloidin9.650853.86 ± 0.66Y/E with phalloidin9.632883.66 ± 0.78a Applies only to ATPase assay; all in vitro motility assays have phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments.

https://openalex.org/W2033937930,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) has an important role in the cellular response to a broad spectrum of DNA lesions. PARP-1 is strongly activated in response to double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), yet its contribution to the DSB response is poorly understood. Here we used bleomycin, a radiomimetic that generates DSBs with high specificity to focus on the response of PARP-1 to DSBs. We report that the induction of PARP-1 activity by bleomycin depends on the Ku antigen, a nonhomologous-DNA-End-Joining factor and protein phosphatase 5 (PP5). PARP-1 activation in response to bleomycin was reduced over 10-fold in Ku-deficient cells, whereas its activation in response to U.V. was unaffected. PARP-1 activation was rescued by reexpression of Ku, but was refractory to manipulation of DNA-dependent protein kinase or ATM. Similarly, PARP-1 activation subsequent to bleomycin was reduced 2-fold on ablation of PP5 and was increased 5-fold when PP5 was overexpressed. PP5 seemed to act directly on PARP-1, as its basal phosphorylation was reduced on overexpression of PP5, and PP5 dephosphorylated PARP-1 in vitro. These results highlight the functional importance of Ku antigen and PP5 for PARP-1 activity subsequent to DSBs."
https://openalex.org/W1977257542,"Background One of the most intriguing patterns in mammalian biogeography is the “island rule”, which states that colonising species have a tendency to converge in body size, with larger species evolving decreased sizes and smaller species increased sizes. It has recently been suggested that an analogous pattern holds for the colonisation of the deep-sea benthos by marine Gastropoda. In particular, a pioneering study showed that gastropods from the Western Atlantic showed the same graded trend from dwarfism to gigantism that is evident in island endemic mammals. However, subsequent to the publication of the gastropod study, the standard tests of the island rule have been shown to yield false positives at a very high rate, leaving the result open to doubt. Methodology/Principal Findings The evolution of gastropod body size in the deep sea is reexamined. Using an extended and updated data set, and improved statistical methods, it is shown that some results of the previous study may have been artifactual, but that its central conclusion is robust. It is further shown that the effect is not restricted to a single gastropod clade, that its strength increases markedly with depth, but that it applies even in the mesopelagic zone. Conclusions/Significance The replication of the island rule in a distant taxonomic group and a partially analogous ecological situation could help to uncover the causes of the patterns observed—which are currently much disputed. The gastropod pattern is evident at intermediate depths, and so cannot be attributed to the unique features of abyssal ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2160970227,"Tissue glucocorticoid levels in the liver and adipose tissue are regulated by regeneration of inactive glucocorticoid by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) and inactivation by 5α- and 5β-reductases. A low carbohydrate diet increases hepatic 11β-HSD1 and reduces glucocorticoid metabolism during weight loss in obese humans. We hypothesized that similar variations in macronutrient proportions regulate glucocorticoid metabolism in obese rats. Male Lister Hooded rats were fed an obesity-inducing ad libitum ‘Western’ diet (37% fat, n = 36) for 22 weeks, then randomised to continue this diet (n = 12) or to switch to either a low carbohydrate (n = 12) or a moderate carbohydrate (n = 12) diet for the final 8 weeks. A parallel lean control group were fed an ad libitum control diet (10% fat, n = 12) throughout. The low and moderate carbohydrate diets decreased hepatic 11β-HSD1 mRNA compared with the Western diet (both 0.7±0.0 vs 0.9±0.1 AU; p<0.01), but did not alter 11β-HSD1 in adipose tissue. 5α-Reductase mRNA was increased on the low carbohydrate compared with the moderate carbohydrate diet. Compared with lean controls, the Western diet decreased 11β-HSD1 activity (1.6±0.1 vs 2.8±0.1 nmol/mcg protein/hr; p<0.001) and increased 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase mRNAs (1.9±0.3 vs 1.0±0.2 and 1.6±0.1 vs 1.0±0.1 AU respectively; p<0.01) in the liver, and reduced 11β-HSD1 mRNA and activity (both p<0.01) in adipose tissue. Although an obesity-inducing high fat diet in rats recapitulates the abnormal glucocorticoid metabolism associated with human obesity in liver (but not in adipose tissue), a low carbohydrate diet does not increase hepatic 11β-HSD1 in obese rats as occurs in humans."
