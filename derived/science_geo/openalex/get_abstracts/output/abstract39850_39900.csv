https://openalex.org/W1998439550,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) encodes a trans-acting factor that activates the expression of genes linked to the HTLV-III long terminal repeat. By functional mapping of complementary DNA transcripts of viral messenger RNA's the major functional domain of the gene encoding this factor was localized to a region immediately before the env gene of the virus, a region previously thought to be noncoding. This newly identified gene consists of three exons, and its transcription into messenger RNA involves two splicing events bringing together sequences from the 5' part (287 base pairs), middle (268 base pairs), and 3'part (1258 base pairs) of the HTLV-III genome. A similar messenger RNA with a truncated second exon (70 base pairs) does not encode a trans-acting function. It is proposed that this second messenger RNA is the transcript of a gene (3'-orf) located after the env gene. Messenger RNA's were also identified for the env and gag-pol genes of HTLV-III."
https://openalex.org/W2056723350,"The surface glycoproteins T4 and T8 define different functional subsets of T lymphocytes and may act as recognition molecules mediating appropriate interactions between the T cell and its target. Previously we employed gene transfer and subtractive hybridization to isolate a T8 cDNA; now we have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone encoding the T4 molecule. The deduced protein sequence reveals that T4 is an integral membrane protein that shares significant amino acid and structural homologies with members of the immunoglobulin supergene family. The overall structure of T4 consists of an N-terminal variable (V)-like domain, a joining (J)-like region, a third extracellular domain, a membrane-spanning region homologous to class II MHC beta-chains, and a highly charged cytoplasmic domain. Comparison of the protein sequences deduced from the T4 and T8 cDNAs reveals structural similarities consistent with their postulated role as recognition molecules, as well as differences suggesting that the two proteins recognize different structures on the target cell."
https://openalex.org/W2028440457,"The retrovirus involved in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HTLV-III/LAV) contains a region that is necessary for stimulation of gene expression directed by the viral long terminal repeat. This region is located between nucleotides 5365 and 5607, immediately 5' to the envelope gene. A doubly-spliced message containing this region could encode an 86-amino acid protein with structural features similar to those of nucleic acid-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1531695673,"Cytosols from cultured myoblast cells (G-8 and H9c2) prepared in high salt (0.3 M KCl) possesses receptor like proteins for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) that sediment in the 3.2 S region of sucrose gradients. These receptors were characterized as having high affinity (Kd less than 0.1 nM) for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and are in low capacity (less than 80 fmol/mg of cytosol protein). Analog competition for receptor binding revealed that 1,25-(OH)2D3 was more potent than 24,25-(OH)2D3, or 25-(OH)2D3 for displacement of 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 from these 3.2 S region sedimenting receptors. Furthermore, the receptor proteins had affinity for DNA and eluted from Sephacryl S-200 as a macromolecule with Stokes radius (Rs) of 32 A. High salt cytosol from collagenase-dispersed skeletal muscle cells was also found to possess a 3.2 S 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor-like protein. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor concentration in both G-8 and H9c2 myoblast lines was found to down-regulate by 50-70% when cells were stimulated to differentiate to myotubes by lowering fetal calf serum to 5% of the medium. Moreover, we demonstrated that 1,25-(OH)2D3 can inhibit DNA synthesis and cell proliferation of the G-8 myoblast cells in a dose-dependent manner. 1,25-(OH)2D3 was more potent at inhibiting cell proliferation in cells grown in 5% serum than in 20% serum. The data suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 can act directly on muscle myoblast via a 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor that is similar to those found in intestine and bone. The data support the possibility that muscle is a target tissue for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the hormone may act to initiate terminal differentiation of myoblast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966124176,"We have mapped a transcriptional regulatory sequence within the 1.0 kb noncoding region of the bovine papilloma virus (BPV- 1) genome, using an enhancer dependent expression vector for chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase. This transcriptional regulatory element works independently of position and orientation, and its function is significantly augmented in BPV-1 transformed C127 cells and in monkey CV -1 cells acutely transfected with plasmids expressing BPV-1 early gene products. Using defined deletion mutants of the BPV-1 DNA and full-length viral cDNAs expressed from an SV40 early promoter, we demonstrate that the expression of this trans-activating factor maps to the 3′ open reading frames of the viral transforming region. A premature termination codon engineered into the E2 ORF eliminates expression of this diffusible trans-activation function establishing the E2 gene product as the diffusible trans-activating factor."
https://openalex.org/W2022627708,"Human T-cell leukemia viruses type I and II (HTLV-I and -II) exhibit several features characteristic of this retroviral family: the presence of an x-lor gene encoding a nuclear protein, transformation properties suggesting the involvement of a virus-associated trans-acting factor, and transcriptional trans-activation of the long terminal repeat (LTR) in infected cells. In the study described here the HTL x-lor products, in the absence of other viral proteins, were able to activate gene expression in trans directed by HTLV LTR. The regulation of the expression of particular genes in trans by HTLV x-lor products suggests that they play a role in viral replication and possibly in transformation of T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1966648387,"Plasmid DNA directing transcription of the noncoding (anti-sense) DNA strand can specifically inhibit the expression of several test genes as well as normal, endogenous genes. The anti-sense plasmid constructions can be introduced into eukaryotic cells by transfection or microinjection and function in both transient and stable transformation assays. Anti-sense transcripts complementary to as little as 52 bases of 5′ untranslated target gene mRNA specifically suppress gene activity as well as, or more efficiently than, anti-sense transcripts directed against the protein coding domain alone. Conditional anti-sense inhibition is accomplished with the use of hormone-inducible promoter sequences. Suppression of endogenous actin gene activity by anti-sense RNA is detected as a decrease in growth rate and as a reduction in the number of actin microfilament cables. These observations suggest that anti-sense RNA may be generally useful for suppressing the expression of specific genes in vivo and may be a potential molecular alternative to classical genetic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1974847515,"Administration of pharmacological doses of arginine-vasopressin, related peptides, and other pressor agents induced a profound release of atriopeptin immunoreactivity into the circulation. The stimulated release of atriopeptin apparently was related to increased arterial blood pressure. Neither the nonpressor vasopressin analog 1-deamino-D-Arg8-vasopressin nor arginine-vasopressin in the presence of a specific pressor antagonist caused atriopeptin to be released into the circulation. Urine output was correlated with the level of atriopeptin released. Physiological levels of arginine-vasopressin suppress diuresis and produced vasoconstriction. Pharmacological levels of the hormone stimulated the cardiac endocrine system to release atriopeptin, which may cause diuresis and vasodilation to physiologically antagonize the effects of vasopressin."
https://openalex.org/W2085534722,"A new procedure for generating and isolating random single-base substitutions in cloned DNA fragments is presented. The mutations are generated by treatment of single-stranded DNA with various chemicals, followed by the synthesis of the complementary strand with reverse transcriptase. Misincorporation frequently occurs when the enzyme encounters a damaged base in the mutagenized template DNA. The resulting duplex DNA fragments containing random single-base substitutions are cloned, amplified as a population, and isolated from wild-type DNA by preparative denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The physical separation of mutant DNA fragments makes it possible to isolate and characterize large numbers of site-directed single-base substitutions in the absence of a phenotypic selection. This procedure should be generally applicable to the fine-structure genetic analysis of regulatory and protein-coding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2074427164,"The excised introns of pre-messenger RNA's (pre-mRNA's) and intron-containing splicing intermediates are in a lariat configuration in which the 5' end of the intron is covalently joined by a 2',5'-phosphodiester bond to a specific adenosine residue near the 3' end of the intron. A 2',5'-phosphodiesterase activity in HeLa cell extracts has been detected that debranches RNA lariats, converting them to linear RNA molecules by specific cleavage of the 2',5'-phosphodiester bond. This lariat debranching activity is distinct from previously reported 2',5'-phosphodiesterases with regard to its biochemical and substrate requirements as well as its stringent cleavage specificity. The debranching activity is observed only if the RNA lariats generated during in vitro processing are deproteinized and added back to the extract. These results suggest that during the normal in vitro splicing reaction the 2',5'-phosphodiester bond of RNA lariats is protected from cleavage by the lariat debranching activity."
https://openalex.org/W2055555040,"The mechanism of site-specific genetic recombination mediated by Tn3 resolvase has been investigated by a topological approach. Extrapolation of a detailed model of synapsis and strand exchange predicts the formation of an additional DNA product with a specific knotted structure. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of DNA reacted in vitro revealed a product, about 0.1 percent of the total, with the appropriate mobility. A technique for determining DNA topology by electron microscopy was improved such that less than a nanogram of DNA was required. The structure of the knot was as predicted, providing strong evidence for the model and showing the power of the topological method."
https://openalex.org/W2050822975,A protonated form of a cloned simple repeating DNA sequence d(TC)n·d(GA) is detectable in equilibrium with the usual Watson-Crick base-paired form at pHs up to 7. This form is anomalously sensitive to a variety of single-strand-specific endonucleases. The observed pH dependent protection of N-7 of dG residues within the insert suggests that these residues are either Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen base-paired to protonated dC residues of the polypyrimidine strand. A structure in which dA:dT Watson-Crick base pairs alternate with Hoogsteen syndG:dCH+ pairs appears to be the most stereochemically acceptable structure consistent with the chemical properties of this protonated DNA. Protonated d(TC)n·d(GA)n interacts with an anti-Z DNA antibody raised against brominated d(GC)n·d(GC)n.
https://openalex.org/W2092771790,"The biological properties of recombinants of glycoprotein hormones in which the alpha and beta subunits were differentially deglycosylated have been investigated. Specific deglycosylation of the alpha subunit generated a recombinant that had more receptor-binding activity but did not produce hormone response in the target cells. The deglycosylated alpha + beta recombinant was also an antagonist of the action of the native hormone. Thus, the carbohydrates in the alpha subunit play a dominant role in the transduction of the hormone signal into the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2018323081,Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is an etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia. A viral gene pX encodes for p40x and it has been proposed that this protein trans-activates the viral long terminal repeat and possibly some cellular genes; this activation may be associated with T-cell transformation. The mechanism of pX gene expression and the primary structure of p40x are now reported. Two-step splicing generates the 2.1-kilobase pX mRNA; the initiator methionine for env becomes part of the pX protein. These splicing signals are conserved among all members of the HTLV family except for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated viruses.
https://openalex.org/W1565866576,"The primary structure of the plasmid ColE1 DNA has been determined. The plasmid DNA consists of 6646 base pairs (molecular mass of 4.43 MDa) and is 48.46% in GC content. The phi 80 trp insert of the composite plasmid of ColE1, pVH51, has also been determined. The determination of the nucleotide sequence of ColE1 DNA provides the basis for examining the relationships between the DNA sequence and the gene organization of the plasmid. The focus of this paper is to use this sequence data coupled with a review of the literature and our own work to examine the nine known functional regions of ColE1: imm (colicin E1 immunity), rep (replication function), inc (plasmid incompatibility and copy number control), bom (basis of mobility), rom (modulator of inhibition of primer formation by RNA I), mob (plasmid mobilization), cer (determinant for conversion of plasmid multimers to monomers), exc (plasmid entry exclusion), cea (structural gene for colicin E1), and kil (structural gene for the Kil protein)."
https://openalex.org/W1995302894,"The positive regulator encoded by phage lambda gene Q is a transcription antiterminator that affects RNA polymerase initiating at the phage late gene promoter, but not at other promoters. We show that this nucleotide-sequence-specific interaction of Q protein and RNA polymerase can occur while the enzyme is pausing after 16 nucleotides of the late gene transcript have been made. Furthermore, Q protein chases RNA polymerase from this early pause site, so that it both recognizes the enzyme and changes its transcription properties at this site. We suggest that the ability of Q-modified RNA polymerase to escape this pause reflects the change that allows it to go through terminators. We also show that NusA protein is required for efficient Q protein activity in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1980885251,"The human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV) are associated with T-cell malignancies in man and will transform normal human T cells in vitro. The mechanism of malignant transformation by HTLV is unknown but appears to be distinct from that of other classes of retroviruses, which induce malignant transformation through viral or cellular oncogenes. Recently a new gene, termed x, was identified in HTLV. This gene has been hypothesized to be the transforming gene of HTLV because of its conservation within the HTLV class of retroviruses. By in vitro mutagenesis of the HTLV-II x gene, it is now demonstrated that the presence of a functional x gene product is necessary for efficient HTLV transcription. Therefore, these studies provide direct evidence for an important function of the x gene in HTLV replication. The functional analogies between the x gene and transcriptional regulatory genes of some DNA viruses suggest that these viruses share similar mechanisms for cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1494074714,"Desulfovibrio gigas hydrogenase (EC 1.12.2.1) is a complex enzyme containing one nickel, one 3Fe, and two [Fe4S4] clusters (Teixeira, M., Moura, I., Xavier, A. V., Der Vartanian, D. V., LeGall, J., Peck, H. D., Jr., Huynh, B. H., and Moura, J. J. G. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 130, 481-484). This hydrogenase belongs to a class of enzymes that are inactive (the so-called oxygen-stable hydrogenases) and must go through an activation process in order to express full activity. The state of characterization of the active centers of the enzyme as isolated prompted us to do a detailed analysis of the redox patterns, activation profile, and catalytic redox cycle of the enzyme in the presence of either the natural substrate (H2) or chemical reductants. The effect of natural cofactors, as cytochrome C3, was also studied. Special focus was given to the intermediate redox species generated during the catalytic cycle of the enzyme and to the midpoint redox potentials associated. The available information is discussed in terms of a working hypothesis for the mechanism of the [NiFe] hydrogenases from sulfate reducing organisms in the context of activation process and catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1499329883,"Normal human monocyte-macrophages were cholesterol-loaded, and the rates of uptake and degradation of several lipoproteins were measured and compared to rates in control cells. Receptor activities for 125I-rabbit beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL), 125I-human low density lipoprotein, and 125I-human chylomicrons were down-regulated in cholesterol-loaded cells; however, the rate of uptake and degradation of 125I-human chylomicron remnants was unchanged from control cells. Cholesterol-loaded alveolar macrophages from a Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit, which lack low density lipoprotein receptors, showed receptor down-regulation for 125I-beta-VLDL but not for 125I-human chylomicron remnants. In addition to chylomicron remnants, apo-E-phospholipid complexes competed for 125I-chylomicron remnant uptake, but apo-A-I-phospholipid complexes did not. Chylomicrons competed for lipoprotein uptake in control cells but were not recognized under conditions of cholesterol loading. Chylomicron remnants and beta-VLDL were equally effective in competing for 125I-beta-VLDL and 125I-chylomicron remnant uptake in cholesterol-loaded macrophages. When normal human monocyte-macrophages were incubated in serum supplemented with chylomicron remnants, the cholesteryl ester content increased 4-fold over cells incubated in serum with low density lipoprotein added. We conclude: 1) specific lipoprotein receptor activity persists in cholesterol-loaded cells; 2) this receptor activity recognizes lipo-proteins (at least in part) by their apo-E content; and 3) cholesteryl ester accumulation can occur in monocyte-macrophages incubated with chylomicron remnants."
https://openalex.org/W2057138753,"DNA from a replication-defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) was reconstructed and transfected into psi-2 cells containing a packaging-defective mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Replication-incompetent retrovirus particles (helper virus-free containing genomes that express the transforming envelope gene of SFFV (gp52) transformed bone marrow cells in vitro and, after direct intravenous introduction of the vector, induced malignant erythroid disease in vivo. Disease induction was dependent on prior treatment of mice with phenylhydrazine, which probably increased the availability of erythroid target cells. Since there was no evidence of virus particle expression in mice with malignant disease, this study demonstrates the acute oncogenic potential of a limited number of erythroid cells expressing SFFV gp52. Direct inoculation of animals with nonreplicating retroviral vectors containing transforming genes may be useful in study the oncogenic effects of such genes."
https://openalex.org/W1967150179,"The T-cell receptor β-chain gene complex contains a duplication of Dβ, Jβ, and Cβ gene segments in mice and man. When DNA from many inbred strains of mice was screened an unusual allele of the beta locus was identified in New Zealand White (NZW) mice. This allele is distinguished by the deletion of an 8.8-kilobase segment of DNA containing Cβ1, Dβ2 and the Jβ2 cluster. Despite the fact that all NZW T-cell receptors must be derived from a single set of β-chain gene segments, this strain has functional T cells and is phenotypically normal. This deletion of T-cell receptor β-chain segments occurs in a strain known to contribute to lupus-like autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2037737845,"In experiments designed to study the mechanism by which peptide hormones binding to their plasma membrane receptors stimulate the expression of specific genes, the transcription of two neuroendocrine genes, prolactin and growth hormone, was analyzed in a rat pituitary cell line. The results showed that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) stimulates the transcription of discrete subsets of eukaryotic genes by at least two independent molecular mechanisms. Cyclic AMP stimulated growth hormone gene transcription and phosphorylation of a 19,000-dalton nuclear protein; this appears to reflect direct nuclear actions of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. In contrast, the stimulation by cyclic AMP of prolactin gene transcription appears to reflect activation of a discrete calcium-dependent event."
https://openalex.org/W2043134722,"The engrailed gene acts early in Drosophila embryogenesis and plays an essential role in the processes that establish and maintain the repeating segmental pattern. To begin molecular analysis of the role of the engrailed gene in embryonic pattern formation, we used a chromosomal walk to clone genomic sequences that encompass the locus, and have physically mapped the positions of 15 engrailed mutations. The positions of engrailed rearrangement mutations indicate that the engrailed complementation unit includes a minimum of 70 kb. The locus can be divided into two regions. Rearrangement mutations interrupting the centromere proximal 50 kb of the locus result in embryonic lethality while mutants altered in the distal 20 kb of the locus survive to show morphological abnormalities in several adult segments. It appears that long-range cis interactions play a role in the function of the engrailed gene."
https://openalex.org/W2080553531,"Visna virus is a pathogenic lentivirus of sheep that is related to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III), the probable etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The transcriptional activity of visna virus promoter and enhancer sequences was studied by means of an assay based on the transient expression of the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The results suggest that the high level of expression of visna virus is due in part to cis-acting enhancer sequences that give the viral promoter a high level of transcriptional activity. In addition, the rate of transcription from the visna virus promoter situated in a plasmid expressing the CAT gene was much greater in infected than uninfected cells. This phenomenon of trans-acting transcriptional activation may involve either virally or cellularly encoded factors."
https://openalex.org/W2011414023,"The putative transforming protein of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) is a 40-kilodalton protein encoded by the X region and is termed p40xI. On the basis of both subcellular fractionation techniques and immunocytochemical analysis, it is now shown that p40xI is a nuclear protein with a relatively short half-life (120 minutes). It is synthesized de novo in considerable quantities in a human T-cell line infected with and transformed by the virus in vitro, and it is not packaged in detectable amounts in the extracellular virus."
https://openalex.org/W1531206801,"A cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) can catalyze the phosphorylation of inosine (Worku, Y., and Newby, A.C. (1982) Biochem. J. 205, 503-510). This enzyme was purified to determine whether it could catalyze the formation of trace levels of phosphorylated acyclovir (ACV), a nucleoside analog with antiherpes activity. Acyclovir phosphorylating activity from rat liver co-chromatographed with the enzyme throughout the 1200-fold purification and through size exclusion chromatography or polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. In addition, the pH optimum, ATP stimulation, and phosphate inhibition of the ACV phosphorylating activity paralleled those of the 5'-nucleotidase. Finally, ACV phosphorylation was competitively inhibited by inosine (Kis = 6.5 mM; K'm (inosine) = 5.0 mM). This was consistent with phosphorylation at a common catalytic site. In addition to inosine and ACV, the guanine derivatives Guo, dGuo, 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine, and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine were substrates for the enzyme. The relative phosphorylation rates were, respectively, 100, 0.7, 19, 4, 0.3, and 0.7, at 0.1 mM phosphate acceptor. Approximate K'm values were, respectively, 5, 90, 10, 10, greater than 100, and greater than 100 mM. Although the substrate activity of ACV with the 5'-nucleotidase was inefficient, it appeared to be sufficient to account for the small amounts of ACV phosphates formed in uninfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1545526300,"Regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ cycling by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) was studied in saponin-permeabilized RINm5F insulinoma cells. Cells were incubated with mitochondrial inhibitors, and medium Ca2+ concentration established by nonmitochondrial pool(s) (presumably the ER) was monitored with a Ca2+ electrode. IP3 degradation accounted for the transience of the Ca2+ response induced by pulse additions of the molecule. To compensate for degradation, IP3 was infused into the medium. This resulted in elevation of [Ca2+] from about 0.2 microM to a new steady state between 0.3 and 1.0 microM, depending on both the rate of IP3 infusion and the ER Ca2+ content. The elevated steady state represented a bidirectional buffering of [Ca2+] by the ER, as slight displacements in [Ca2+], by small aliquots of Ca2+ or the Ca2+ chelator quin 2, resulted in net uptake or efflux of Ca2+ to restore the previous steady state. When IP3 infusion was stopped, [Ca2+] returned to its original low level. Ninety per cent of the Ca2+ accumulated by the ER was released by IP3 when the total Ca2+ content did not exceed 15 nmol/mg of cell protein. Above this high Ca2+ content, Ca2+ was accumulated in an IP3-insensitive, A23187-releasable pool. The maximal amount of Ca2+ that could be released from the ER by IP3 was 13 nmol/mg of cell protein. The data support the concept that in the physiological range of Ca2+ contents, almost all the ER is an IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store that is capable of finely regulating [Ca2+] through independent influx (Ca2+-ATPase) and efflux (IP3-modulated component) pathways of Ca2+ transport. IP3 may continuously modulate Ca2+ cycling across the ER and play an important role in determining the ER Ca2+ content and in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ under both stimulated and possibly basal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1985849136,Glucose-6-phosphatase activity in the rat brain in vivo was estimated by measuring the differential loss of tritium and carbon-14 from the glucose pool labeled by a mixture of [2-3H]glucose and [U-14C]glucose. The results provide no evidence of significant dephosphorylation of glucose-6-phosphate and do not support the hypothesis of a futile cycle involving glucose-6-phosphatase activity in the brain.
https://openalex.org/W1523629897,"The phosphorylation of the membrane skeleton components protein 4.1 and protein 4.9 in intact erythrocytes is shown to increase in the presence of either 1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate or 2 mM dibutyryl cAMP. The phosphorylation induced by these protein kinase activators is compared by two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping. In both proteins, the pattern of peptides phosphorylated in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate differs from the pattern of peptides phosphorylated in the presence of dibutyryl cAMP. The relative locations of the phosphorylated sites on protein 4.1 have been determined using limited proteolysis by alpha-chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1980553983,"Repeated administration of morphine in increasing doses delayed normal cell death in the ciliary ganglion of the chick embryo; the effect was completely blocked by naloxone. Survival of spinal motoneurons was not affected. Morphine also inhibited potassium-stimulated synthesis of acetylcholine in ganglion cells cocultured with muscle, suggesting that morphine can influence neurotransmission. Morphine's effect on cell death may be due to an inhibition of transmission at the neuromuscular junction, but opiates may also directly affect cell death. Although it is not known whether the endogenous opiates in the ciliary ganglion influence neuronal survival during embryogenesis, exogenous opiates can affect normal cell death in the autonomic nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2076314031,"The var1 gene specifies the only mitochondrial ribosomal protein known to be encoded by yeast mitochondrial DNA. The gene is unusual in that its base composition is nearly 90 percent adenine plus thymine. It and its expression product show a strain-dependent variation in size of up to 7 percent; this variation does not detectably interfere with function. Furthermore, var1 is an expandable gene that participates in a novel recombinational event resembling gene conversion whereby shorter alleles are preferentially converted to longer ones. The remarkable features of var1 indicate that it may have evolved by a mechanism analogous to exon shuffling, although no introns are actually present."
https://openalex.org/W2122397401,"Chicken cellular-fps (c-fps) sequences were substituted for viral-fps (v-fps) sequences in two retroviral genome structures, one that expressed a c-fps gene product that was indistinguishable from the normal c-fps gene product expressed in chicken bone marrow cells, and another that expressed a gag-fps fusion protein. When c-fps gene sequences (without linked gag gene sequences) were expressed at high levels in a viral vector, no transformation of fibroblasts was detected. It was previously demonstrated that the corresponding v-fps sequences could transform fibroblasts. When the same c-fps sequences were expressed in a form linked to gag gene sequences, transformation of fibroblasts and induction of tumors were observed. The data suggest that the c-fps gene product lacks transformation potential by itself even when overexpressed and that the transformation potential of the c-fps gene can be activated by either mutation (or mutations) in the fps coding region or by fusion with viral gag gene sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1482785943,"Rat hepatocyte protein kinase was activated by incubating the cells with various cAMP analogs. Boiled extracts were then prepared and Sephadex G-25 chromatography was carried out. The G-25 procedure separated the analogs from cAMP since the resin had the unexpected property of binding cyclic nucleotides with differing affinities. Separation was necessary because the analogs would otherwise interfere with the sensitive protein kinase activation method developed for assay of cAMP. The cAMP analogs, but not 5'-AMP, lowered basal cAMP by 50-70%. The effect was rapid, analog concentration-dependent, and occurred parallel with phosphorylase activation, suggesting that the cAMP analogs act through cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation. A cAMP analog completely blocked the cAMP elevation produced by relatively low concentrations of glucagon, but did not block the phosphorylase response, indicating that the cAMP analog substitutes for cAMP as the intracellular activator of protein kinase. One implication of the results is that elevation of cAMP and protein kinase activity by hormones has a negative feedback effect on the cellular cAMP level."
https://openalex.org/W1520716231,"Purified calmodulin-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from brain, a homodimer of 59-kDa subunits, was activated by limited proteolysis with trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, Pronase, or papain and could not be further stimulated by addition of Ca2+ and calmodulin. Proteolysis increased Vmax and had little effect on the Km for cGMP. Treatment with alpha-chymotrypsin in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) produced, sequentially, 57- and 45-kDa peptides from the bovine and 55-, 53-, and 38-kDa peptides from the ovine enzyme. This protease-treated phosphodiesterase exhibited a Stokes radius of 3.9 nm and an S20,w value of 4.55; comparison with the hydrodynamic properties observed for native enzyme (4.3 nm, 5.95 S) strongly suggests a dimeric protein of Mr approximately 80,000-90,000. The proteolyzed species does not interact significantly with calmodulin immobilized on agarose, nor does it show complex formation with 2-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-calmodulin even at micromolar concentrations of protein. Proteolysis, in the presence of calmodulin plus Ca2+, fully activated phosphodiesterase, producing the same intermediate peptides; however, final peptides from the bovine and ovine enzymes were 47 and 42 kDa, respectively, indicating a new, specific conformation of the enzyme. When EGTA was added to such incubations, these peptides were cleaved to those of the size seen when proteolysis was carried out entirely in the presence of EGTA. The initial rate of activation was increased by the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, suggesting that, in complex, phosphodiesterase exhibits a site with increased susceptibility to proteolysis. Since calmodulin can still interact with a fully activated form of the enzyme, it appears that retention of calmodulin binding can occur concomitantly with damage to that portion of the phosphodiesterase molecule responsible for suppression of its basal catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1583452925,"Two retroviral protein-tyrosine kinases, v-src and v-ros, have been reported to possess phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) kinase activity. Because the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a protein-tyrosine kinase with structural homology to p60v-src and because EGF stimulates PtdIns turnover in A431 cells, the EGF receptor has been examined for PtdIns kinase activity. Preparations of the EGF receptor, isolated from A431 cells and purified by two different methods of affinity chromatography, possessed an associated PtdIns kinase activity. This activity which co-purified with the EGF receptor represented only about 2% of the total PtdIns kinase activity of A431 membranes, and there was no correlation between the number of EGF receptors and the amount of PtdIns kinase activity in membranes from various cell types. A peptide substrate, angiotensin II, and PtdIns did not compete with each other as substrates for the protein-tyrosine and PtdIns kinase activities of the EGF receptor. When self-phosphorylated EGF receptor was fractionated by Sephacryl S-300 gel permeation chromatography, the peak of PtdIns kinase activity was separated from the comigrating peak of protein-tyrosine kinase activity and the self-phosphorylated EGF receptor. These results indicate that the protein-tyrosine kinase and PtdIns kinase activities which co-purify with the EGF receptor reside on different molecules. Angiotensin II and PtdIns did not compete as substrates for p60v-src isolated by immunoabsorption with a monoclonal antibody, suggesting that PtdIns kinase activity may also not be intrinsic to p60v-src."
https://openalex.org/W2003454367,"The human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV) are replication-competent retroviruses whose genomes contain gag, pol, and env genes as well as a fourth gene, termed x, which is believed to be the transforming gene of HTLV. The product of the x gene is now shown to be encoded by a 2.1-kilobase messenger RNA derived by splicing of at least two introns. By means of S1 nuclease mapping of this RNA and nucleic acid sequence analysis of a complementary DNA clone, the complete primary structure of the x-gene product has been determined. It is encoded by sequences containing the env initiation codon and one nucleotide of the next codon spliced to the major open reading frame of the HTLV-I and HTLV-II x gene."
https://openalex.org/W1485705846,"Utilizing the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line cultured in defined medium, we examined the quantitative and temporal relationships between Se supply and the activity of the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase, as well as the effects of selenium deficiency on phagocytic function. Glutathione peroxidase activity depended on the medium Se concentration up to 2.6 X 10(-8) M (sodium selenate, 5 ng/ml), above which a plateau occurred. HL-60 cells grown in medium without Se supplementation became GSH peroxidase deficient, with activity 1-3% that of Se-replete cells. Replenishment of the medium with sodium selenate returned enzyme activity to 23% that of replete cells by 24 h and to 85% by 7 days, a process blocked by cycloheximide. Se-deficient HL-60 cells induced to granulocytic differentiation by dimethylformamide showed decreased hexose monophosphate shunt activity in response to phorbol myristate acetate and to an exogenous enzymatic H2O2-generating system. However, Se-deficient and -replete cells showed equal responses to methylene blue, which stimulates the shunt independently from the glutathione cycle. Se-deficient mature HL-60 cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate released 2.3-fold more H2O2 than Se-replete cells and only slightly (not significantly) less O2. Se-deficient and -replete differentiated HL-60 cells did not differ significantly in their capacities for cell motility or for ingestion of serum-opsonized bacteria. Differences between the findings of the present study and previous in vivo rat studies may reflect both the defined in vitro environment of the cell line and the inverse ratios of catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities in human and rat granulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1575804210,"The NS protein of vesicular stomatitis virus is an auxiliary protein in the virus core (nucleocapsid) that plays a role in virus-specific RNA synthesis. NS exhibits a variety of phosphorylated forms, and the degree of phosphorylation correlates with the rate of RNA synthesis. However, chymotryptic peptide mapping has indicated that all forms of NS share a common cluster of phosphorylated residues. To locate these residues in the primary structure of the molecule, we performed a series of residue-specific chemical and enzymatic cleavages and separated radiophosphate-labeled peptides by gel electrophoresis. The data indicate that the constitutively phosphorylated sites in NS molecules reside in the amino-terminal region of the molecule, between residues 35 and 78. The previously reported resistance of the phosphoamino acids in this region to dephosphorylation by exogenous phosphatase suggests that this domain is embedded within the tertiary structure of the molecule or involved in quaternary interactions. In contrast, the amino acid residues that are phosphorylated secondarily, making NS more active in RNA synthesis, reside in more exposed regions of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2072509443,"Both elemental distribution and ion transport in cultured cells have been imaged by ion microscopy. Morphological and chemical information was obtained with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.5 μm for sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium in freeze-fixed, cryofractured, and freeze-dried normal rat kidney cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Ion transport was successfully demonstrated by imaging Na+-K+ fluxes after the inhibition of Na+- and K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase with ouabain. This method allows measurements of elemental (isotopic) distribution to be related to cell morphology, thereby providing the means for studying ion distribution and ion transport under different physiological, pathological, and toxicological conditions in cell culture systems."
https://openalex.org/W2382131528,"Skinned cells of chicken gizzard were used to study the effect of a smooth muscle phosphatase (SMP-IV) on activation and relaxation of tension. SMP-IV has previously been shown to dephosphorylate light chains on myosin. When this phosphatase was added to submaximally Ca2+-activated skinned cells, tension increased while phosphorylation of myosin light chains decreased. In contrast, when the myosin phosphatase was added to cell bundles activated in the absence of Ca2+ by a Ca2+-insensitive myosin light chain kinase, tension and phosphorylation of the myosin light chains both decreased. These data suggest that Ca2+ inhibits the deactivation of tension even when myosin light chains are dephosphorylated to a low level. Furthermore, comparison of Ca2+-activated cells caused to relax in CTP, in the presence or absence of Ca2+, shows that cells in the presence of Ca2+ do not relax completely, whereas in the absence of Ca2+ cells completely relax. Solutions containing Ca2+ and CTP, however, are incapable of generating tension from the resting state. Endogenous myosin light chain kinase is not active in solutions containing CTP and dephosphorylation of myosin light chains occurs in CTP solutions both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. These data imply that Ca2+ inhibits relaxation even though myosin light chains are dephosphorylated. These data are consistent with a model wherein an obligatory Ca2+-activated myosin light chain phosphorylation is followed by a second Ca2+ activation process for further tension development or maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1594247347,"Biochemical properties of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor system of the avian retina were found to change during the period when synapses form in ovo. Comparison of ligand binding to membranes obtained before and after synaptogenesis showed a significant increase in the affinity, but not proportion, of the high affinity agonist-binding state. There was no change in receptor sensitivity to antagonists during this period. Pirenzepine binding, which can discriminate muscarinic receptor subtypes, showed the presence of a single population of low affinity sites (M2) before and after synaptogenesis. The change in agonist binding was not due to the late development of receptor function; tests for receptor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover and for modulation of agonist binding by guanylylimidodiphosphate showed functional coupling to be present several days prior to the onset of synapse formation. However, detergent-solubilization of membranes eliminated differences in agonist binding between receptors from embryos and hatched chicks, suggesting a developmental change in interactions of the receptor with functionally related membrane components. A possible basis for altered interactions was obtained from isoelectric point data showing that the muscarinic receptor population underwent a transition from a predominantly low pI form (4.25) in 13 day embryos to a predominantly high pI form (4.50) in newly hatched chicks. The possibility that biochemical changes in the muscarinic receptor play a role in differentiation of the system by controlling receptor position on the surface of nerve cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1535096489,"A pentamethylene chain was used to covalently link the 3'-phosphate of oligothymidylates to the 9-amino group of an acridine derivative. Positively charged substituents were further attached to the 3'-phosphate group to form 3'-phosphotriesters. These molecules form specific complexes with poly(rA) which involve the formation of a number of A X T base pairs equal to that of thymines in the oligonucleotide. Absorption changes induced in the acridine absorption bands are similar to those expected upon intercalation of the acridine dye between A X T base pairs. The acridine covalently linked to the 3'-phosphate strongly stabilizes the complexes formed with poly(rA) as compared with the corresponding unsubstituted oligodeoxynucleotide. The presence of a positively charged substituent on the 3'-phosphate together with the acridine dye further enhances the interaction. The effect of salt concentration on complex stability depends on the number of negatively charged phosphate groups of the oligodeoxynucleotide and on the nature of the substituents borne by the 3'-phosphate group. When the oligothymidylate is substituted by an acridine dye, the stability of the poly(rA) complexes increases when salt concentration increases. If an additional positively charged substituent is present on the 3'-phosphate group, stability decreases when salt concentration increases for the shortest oligonucleotide (trimer) and increases with longer oligonucleotides. Thermodynamic parameters have been calculated from the concentration dependence of melting temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1639941291,"In this report, we show that fluoride activates dark-adapted rod outer segment phosphodiesterase, and that this activation is mediated, in analogy with adenylate cyclase, through a GTP binding protein. The GTP binding protein is released from dark-adapted rod outer segment membranes by exposure to fluoride and subsequent centrifugation. The 39-kilodalton subunit of the GTP binding protein, released from the membrane by this procedure, exhibits altered susceptibility to limited trypsin proteolysis, identical to that seen when hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs are bound to that subunit. Repeated exposure of dark-adapted rod outer segment membranes to fluoride and subsequent centrifugation results in maximal activation of the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase. Thus, activation of phosphodiesterase by fluoride in the dark appears similar to fluoride activation of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1573409432,"The modulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) synthesis in Xenopus laevis pituitary intermediate lobe (IL) during background adaptation and the role of dopamine and cAMP in mediating this effect were examined. Neurointermediate lobes (NILs) were pulselabeled in vitro with [3H]arginine and analyzed for POMC synthesis by acid-urea gel electrophoresis. After black background adaptation of the animal (7 days), POMC synthesis increased 5-6-fold, while after white background adaptation (7 days), POMC synthesis decreased by 76%. Dopamine (50 microM) suppressed POMC synthesis in NILs in culture. In the absence of dopamine, POMC synthesis was stimulated. Several experiments were conducted to determine the category of dopamine receptor in the X. laevis IL. A D-2 dopamine receptor agonist inhibited immunoreactive alpha-MSH release from the NIL in a D-2 antagonist-reversible manner. A D-1 receptor agonist or antagonist did not alter the release of immunoreactive alpha-MSH from the NIL. Dopamine (10 microM) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In addition, dopamine inhibition of POMC synthesis in cultured ILs was reversed by 8-Br-cAMP. These studies suggest that white background adaptation results in stimulation of the X. laevis D-2 receptor, which reduces cAMP production and POMC synthesis. Conversely, during black background adaptation the IL D-2 receptor is not stimulated, leading to increased cAMP production and POMC synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1595584861,"Major differences among the sequences of the repeat units of a very complex satellite DNA are located in domains which are sensitive to S1 nuclease under torsional stress, indicating that the domains assume unusual secondary or tertiary structures. Repeat units of the satellite, which accounts for 3% of the DNA of a land crab, have been inserted into pBR322 and the primary sequences of three cloned variants determined. The variants selected for sequencing include 1) RU (2089 base pairs (bp) ), representative of the average size of repeat units of cellular satellite; 2) TRU (1674 bp), truncated at an extra EcoRI site; and 3) EXT (2639 bp), extended by a 5-fold amplification of a 142-bp segment, one copy of which is present in RU and TRU (Bonnewell, V., Fowler, R.F., and Skinner, D.M. (1983) Science 221, 862-865). It appears that every copy of the satellite may be different and that the variants do not arise from cloning accidents. Extensive domains, as long as approximately 560 bp, are greater than 95% homologous among RU, TRU, and EXT; these conserved domains are composed of DNA whose base composition and sequences do not have remarkable features. By contrast, the sequences that comprise the divergent domains are unusually rich in 1) tracts of (dG X dC) 13-23 and arrangements of similar but not identical repetitive oligonucleotides or 2) alternating purines and pyrimidines (pu/py)."
https://openalex.org/W1595158545,"We have investigated the stability of the [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate-labeled nonactivated glucocorticoid-receptor complex in rat thymus cytosol containing 20 mM sodium molybdate. Cytosol complexes were analyzed under nondenaturing conditions by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of molybdate and under denaturing conditions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. When analyzed under nondenaturing conditions, complexes from fresh cytosol and from cytosol left for 2 h at 3 degrees C eluted from gel filtration as a single peak of radioactivity with a Stokes radius of approximately 7.7 nm, suggesting that no proteolysis of the complexes had occurred in either cytosol. When analyzed under denaturing conditions, however, whereas the fresh cytosol gave a receptor band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at Mr approximately 90,000 (corresponding to the intact complex), the cytosol that had been left for 2 h at 3 degrees C gave only a fragment (Mr approximately 50,000). This fragment, just as the intact complex, could be thermally activated to a DNA-binding form. Proteolysis of the receptor could be blocked by preparing the cytosol in the presence of EGTA, leupeptin, or a heat-stable factor present in the cytosol of rat liver and WEHI-7 mouse thymoma cells. From these results we conclude: (i) 20 mM molybdate does not protect the nonactivated glucocorticoid-receptor complex present in rat thymus cytosol against proteolysis under conditions which are commonly used for cell-free labeling of the receptor, and (ii) the demonstration of a Stokes radius of approximately 8 nm for the nonactivated glucocorticoid-receptor complex is not sufficient to indicate that the receptor complex is present in its intact form."
https://openalex.org/W2000507818,"Abstract Mammalian cell lysosomal enzymes or phosphorylated oligosaccharides derived from them are endocytosed by a phosphomannosyl receptor (PMR) found on the surface of fibroblasts. Various studies suggest that 2 residues of Man-6-P in phosphomonoester linkage but not diester linkage (PDE) are essential for a high rate of uptake. The lysosomal enzymes of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum are also recognized by the PMR on these cells; however, none of the oligosaccharides from these enzymes contain 2 phosphomonoesters. Instead, most contain multiple sulfate esters and 2 residues of Man-6-P in an unusual PDE linkage. In this study I have tried to account for the unexpected highly efficient uptake of the slime mold enzymes. The results show that nearly all of the alpha-mannosidase molecules contain the oligosaccharides required for uptake, and that each tetrameric, holoenzyme molecule has sufficient carbohydrate for an average of 10 Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides. None of the oligosaccharides or glycopeptides from the lysosomal enzymes bind to an immobilized PMR, but those with 2 PDE show slight interaction. Competition of 125I-beta-glucosidase uptake by various carbohydrate-containing fractions indicates that the best inhibitors are those with 2 PDE, either with or without sulfate esters. Furthermore, the uptake of a lysosomal enzyme isolated from a mutant strain (modA), which produces oligosaccharides with only 1 but not 2 PDE, is about 10-fold less than the uptake of wild-type enzyme which has predominantly 2 PDE. Complete denaturation of 125I-labeled wild-type beta-glucosidase in sodium dodecyl sulfate/dithiothreitol also reduces its uptake by about 10-fold. Taken together, these results suggest that the interactions of multiple, weakly binding oligosaccharides, especially those with 2 PDE, are important for the high rate of uptake of the slime mold enzymes. The conformation of the protein may be important in orienting the oligosaccharides in a favorable position for binding to the PMR."
https://openalex.org/W1495540871,"Several known inhibitors of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase were studied for their interactions with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) ribonucleotide reductase. MAIQ (4-methyl-5-amino-1-formylisoquinoline thiosemicarbazone) produced apparent inactivation of HSV-1 ribonucleotide reductase. Only catalytically cycling, not resting, enzyme could be inactivated. Double reciprocal replots of the rates of inactivation versus the concentration of MAIQ indicated that a reversible complex with the enzyme was formed prior to inactivation. In the presence of 10 microM CDP, the maximum rate of inactivation was 20 per h (t1/2 = 3 min). The half-maximum rate was achieved at about 15 microM MAIQ. INOX (periodate-oxidized inosine) also appeared to inactivate HSV-1 ribonucleotide reductase. In contrast to MAIQ, it readily inactivated resting as well as cycling enzyme. CDP retarded the rates of inactivation by INOX. An initial reversible complex between INOX and enzyme was not detectable under the conditions used. IMPY (2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo(2,3-a)imidazole) and guanazole (3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole) produced reversible inhibition. Although the data with both inhibitors were most consistent with the noncompetitive inhibition model (versus CDP), the data with guanazole were also marginally consistent with the uncompetitive model."
https://openalex.org/W1512553677,"T6 DNA topoisomerase has been purified from bacteriophage T6 infected Escherichia coli. Unlike the T4 DNA topoisomerase which has three subunits, it consists of two subunits of molecular weights 75,000 and 51,000. They are the products of T6 genes 39 and 52, respectively. The purified T6 enzyme can stimulate in vitro T6 DNA replication. It has an ATP-dependent DNA relaxation activity similar to the T4 enzyme. Either ATP or dATP can be used in both reactions. Using a Western blotting and radioimmuno-detection methods, we show that T6 39 subunit contains protein sequences specified by both the T4 39 and 60 genes. The 52-proteins of both phages appear to be identical. The T4 and T6 topoisomerase genes represent a naturally occurring example of gene separation or fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1520557956,"We have investigated the interaction of crotoxin (component A-component B complex) and of its isolated phospholipase subunit (component B) with hydrophobic compounds by ESR, using spin-labeled fatty acids as probes. The phospholipase subunit alone (component B) binds more than three labeled fatty acid molecules/molecule with different affinities, the highest corresponding to a Kd of 10 microM in the case of 5-doxyl palmitic acid. In contrast, the noncatalytic subunit (component A) and the crotoxin complex do not bind fatty acids. ESR studies of the component B-fatty acid complex reveal a strong immobilization of the whole length of the fatty acid chain, strong spin-spin interactions between bound fatty acids, and nonaccessibility of the bound paramagnetic probe to Ni2+ ions. This suggests that the phospholipase component B possesses a hydrophobic cleft which may contain one or two fatty acids. This hydrophobic cleft is not accessible to spin-labeled fatty acids in the crotoxin complex. An overall rotational correlation time of about 200 ns of the phospholipase component B was determined by saturation transfer ESR. This high value is incompatible with the diffusion of a polypeptide of 14,500 molecular weight. The hydrodynamic analysis of the fatty acid-component B complex led us to estimate an apparent molecular weight of 95,000 which reveals that fatty acids induce the formation of polymers (most probably octamers) of component B. We propose a model in which the phospholipase component B exists in two conformational states which differ by their hydrophobicity."
