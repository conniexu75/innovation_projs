In analyzing axon regeneration in different mutant mouse lines, we discovered that deletion of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes robust regeneration of injured optic nerve axons. This regeneration-promoting effect is efficiently blocked in SOCS3-gp130 double-knockout mice, suggesting that SOCS3 deletion promotes axon regeneration via a gp130-dependent pathway. Consistently, a transient upregulation of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was observed within the retina following optic nerve injury. Intravitreal application of CNTF further enhances axon regeneration from SOCS3-deleted RGCs. Together, our results suggest that compromised responsiveness to injury-induced growth factors in mature neurons contributes significantly to regeneration failure. Thus, developing strategies to modulate negative signaling regulators may be an efficient strategy of promoting axon regeneration after CNS injury.

Thus, developing strategies to modulate negative signaling regulators may be an efficient strategy of promoting axon regeneration after CNS injury. A salient feature of axon regeneration in mammals is the drastic difference between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) versus the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast to robust axon regeneration in the PNS neurons, regenerative growth in the adult CNS is minimal. Previous studies have been aimed at characterizing environmental inhibitory molecules in the adult CNS (reviewed by Harel and Strittmatter, 2006Harel N.Y. Strittmatter S.M.

While several myelin-associated molecules and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the glial scar have been implicated as inhibitors of axon regeneration (Filbin, 2006Filbin M.T.

An alternate explanation is that the adult PNS and CNS neurons differ in intrinsic growth ability (Goldberg and Barres, 2000Goldberg J.L.

Current hypotheses suggest that adult CNS neurons lose axonal growth ability. Several potential players have been implicated, such as development-dependent decline of neuronal cAMP levels (Cai et al., 2001Cai D. Qiu J. Cao Z. McAtee M. Bregman B.S. Filbin M.T. Neuronal cyclic AMP controls the developmental loss in ability of axons to regenerate.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4731-4739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Bcl-2 (Cho et al., 2005Cho K.S. Yang L. Lu B. Feng Ma H. Huang X. Pekny M. Chen D.F. Re-establishing the regenerative potential of central nervous system axons in postnatal mice.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Goldberg et al., 2002Goldberg J.L. Klassen M.P. Hua Y. Barres B.A. Amacrine-signaled loss of intrinsic axon growth ability by retinal ganglion cells.Science. 2002; 296: 1860-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar found a dramatic decrease in axonal growth rates of dissociated RGCs at the neonatal stage and suggested that this may be triggered by signals from amacrine cells. However, the molecular nature of such signals still remains unclear. Furthermore, other mechanisms might be involved in the transition from the rapid growth mode of immature neurons to the poor growth mode of mature CNS neurons. In an effort to identify molecular pathways that limit the intrinsic regenerative capacity of adult RGCs, we discovered that deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) or tuberous sclerosis protein 1 (TSC1), two negative regulators of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, in adult RGCs promotes robust axon regeneration following optic nerve injury (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). We also found that axotomy triggers a dramatic downregulation of mTOR activity in adult RGCs. Given the well-established role of mTOR in regulating cap-dependent protein translation (Ma and Blenis, 2009Ma X.M. Blenis J. Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), our results indicate that the diminished ability to synthesize new proteins contributes significantly to the failure of axon regeneration in adult RGCs. However, despite increased mTOR activity, PTEN or TSC1-deleted RGCs initiate axon regrowth only after axonal injury, suggesting that injury-induced signals may be required to activate the axonal regeneration program. What injury-triggered signals can promote axon regeneration? Studies in the PNS implicate several mechanisms, including injury-induced cytokines and growth factors (Zigmond et al., 1996Zigmond R.E. Hyatt-Sachs H. Mohney R.P. Schreiber R.C. Shadiack A.M. Sun Y. Vaccariello S.A. Changes in neuropeptide phenotype after axotomy of adult peripheral neurons and the role of leukemia inhibitory factor.Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 4: 75-90PubMed Google Scholar), local protein synthesis, and increased axonal transport of signaling components (Hanz et al., 2003Hanz S. Perlson E. Willis D. Zheng J.Q. Massarwa R. Huerta J.J. Koltzenburg M. Kohler M. van-Minnen J. Twiss J.L. Fainzilber M. Axoplasmic importins enable retrograde injury signaling in lesioned nerve.Neuron. 2003; 40: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). For example, sciatic nerve lesion promotes expression of interleukin 6 (IL6) in axotomized sensory neurons and/or Schwann cells in the lesion sites, subsequently activating the JAK/STAT pathway in injured sensory neurons (Cafferty et al., 2001Cafferty W.B. Gardiner N.J. Gavazzi I. Powell J. McMahon S.B. Heath J.K. Munson J. Cohen J. Thompson S.W. Leukemia inhibitory factor determines the growth status of injured adult sensory neurons.J.

The cytokine interleukin-6 is sufficient but not necessary to mimic the peripheral conditioning lesion effect on axonal growth.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5565-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway correlates with enhanced axonal regenerative responses in DRG neurons (Miao et al., 2006Miao T. Wu D. Zhang Y. Bo X. Subang M.C. Wang P. Richardson P.M. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 suppresses the ability of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 to stimulate neurite growth in rat primary sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9512-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). While IL6 can increase axonal growth in vitro and in vivo (Cafferty et al., 2001Cafferty W.B. Gardiner N.J. Gavazzi I. Powell J. McMahon S.B. Heath J.K. Munson J. Cohen J. Thompson S.W. Leukemia inhibitory factor determines the growth status of injured adult sensory neurons.J.

The cytokine interleukin-6 is sufficient but not necessary to mimic the peripheral conditioning lesion effect on axonal growth.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5565-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), IL6 knockout mice show normal axon regeneration (Cao et al., 2006Cao Z. Gao Y. Bryson J.B. Hou J. Chaudhry N. Siddiq M. Martinez J. Spencer T. Carmel J. Hart R.B. Filbin M.T. The cytokine interleukin-6 is sufficient but not necessary to mimic the peripheral conditioning lesion effect on axonal growth.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5565-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, how this and other related pathways are involved in regulating axon regeneration in the PNS remains unclear. A further question is whether these injury signals exist in the CNS. In this study, we present genetic results demonstrating a role of the gp130-dependent pathway in promoting axon regeneration in adult RGCs. To identify molecular pathways critical to axon regeneration, we applied optic nerve crush injury to assess axon regeneration in conditional floxed mice (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Intravitreal application of recombinant adeno-associated viruses expressing Cre (AAV-Cre) results in Cre-dependent reporter expression in more than 90% of RGCs and thus was used to delete floxed genes in mature RGCs in vivo. Regeneration of injured optic nerve axons was traced by injecting cholera toxin beta subunit (CTB), an anterograde tracer, into the vitreous of the retina. Neuronal survival was assessed by immunostaining the whole-mount sections with an anti-β-III tubulin antibody. We observed significant axon regeneration in SOCS3 conditional knockout mice. In AAV-GFP (control) treated SOCS3f/f mice (Mori et al., 2004Mori H. Hanada R. Hanada T. Aki D. Mashima R. Nishinakamura H. Torisu T. Chien K.R. Yasukawa H. Yoshimura A. Socs3 deficiency in the brain elevates leptin sensitivity and confers resistance to diet-induced obesity.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), a few axonal sprouts could be found close to the crush site, but none extended distally beyond 500 μm (Figures 1A and 1F). However, AAV-Cre treated SOCS3f/f mice exhibited significant enhancement in the number of regenerating axons beyond the crush site (Figures 1B and 1F). Cell viability analysis revealed significant increase of neuronal survival following optic nerve crush in SOCS3-deleted mice (Figures 1G and 1H). A similar regeneration phenotype was seen in the SOCS3f/f mice crossed with a Thy1-Cre line, where Cre expression starts from embryonic stages (Dewachter et al., 2002Dewachter I. Reversé D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuipéri C. Van den Haute C. Spittaels K. Umans L. Serneels L. Thiry E. et al.Neuronal deficiency of presenilin 1 inhibits amyloid plaque formation and corrects hippocampal long-term potentiation but not a cognitive defect of amyloid precursor protein [V717I] transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that SOCS3 deletion in RGCs promotes both neuronal survival and axon regeneration following optic crush injury. To examine the temporal effects of SOCS3 deletion, we assessed axon regeneration in SOCS3 conditional knockout mice at different postinjury time points. At 1 day postcrush (1 dpc), CTB-labeled axons stopped at the crush site, with no labeled fibers found distal to the lesion site (Figure 1C). At 3 dpc, a few short sprouts could be seen close to the lesion site (Figure 1D). However, at 7 dpc, more regenerating axons were observed beyond the crush site (Figure 1E). The AAV-GFP-injected control animals showed no axons beyond the lesion site at any time point (data not shown). This differs from the observation of numerous axonal sprouts seen at 3 dpc in PTEN-deleted mice (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), suggesting that the majority of axon regeneration in SOCS3-deleted RGCs starts between 3 and 7 days postinjury. Glial scar responses were similar in both control and SOCS3-deleted mice (Figure S1), suggesting that SOCS3 deletion in RGCs did not affect glial responses in the lesion site. Our previous studies suggested that mTOR activity is an important indicator of axon regenerative ability in RGCs (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the regulation of mTOR activity in SOCS3-deleted RGCs following optic nerve injury by immunohistochemical staining of anti-phospho-S6 (p-S6) antibody, a marker of the mTOR activity (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). In uninjured SOCS3f/f mice injected with either AAV-GFP (Figures 2A and 2C) or AAV-Cre (Figures 2B and 2C), similar percentages (∼8%–10%) of RGCs showed detectable p-S6 signals, implying that SOCS3 deletion does not affect the basal levels of mTOR activity of RGCs. As previously reported (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), p-S6 levels are significantly reduced following optic nerve crush injury. In SOCS3f/f mice, p-S6 signal is reduced at 1 dpc in both AAV-GFP- and AAV-Cre-treated mice (Figure 2), suggesting that SOCS3 deletion does not alter axotomy-triggered mTOR downregulation in the early postinjury stage. Significant differences in these groups appear at later time points. In the control group (SOCS3f/f with AAV-GFP), the percentages of p-S6-positive RGCs continue to decrease at 7 dpc (Figures 2A and 2C). However, SOCS3-deleted mice (SOCS3f/f with AAV-Cre) showed a significant recovery in the percentage of p-S6-positive RGCs starting at 3 dpc (Figures 2B and 2C). By 7 dpc, coinciding with the appearance of larger numbers of regenerating axons (Figures 1E and 1G), these SOCS3-deleted mice had percentages (∼8%) of p-S6-positive RGCs approaching levels observed before injury (Figures 2B and 2C). Thus, despite an initial injury-induced mTOR downregulation, SOCS3-deleted RGCs recover mTOR activity at late time points. Since SOCS3 is a negative regulator of signaling pathways in response to cytokines and perhaps other growth factors (Croker et al., 2008Croker B.A. Mielke L.A. Wormald S. Metcalf D. Kiu H. Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Roberts A.W. Socs3 maintains the specificity of biological responses to cytokine signals during granulocyte and macrophage differentiation.Exp. Hematol. 2008; 36: 786-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), SOCS3 deletion may allow RGCs to respond to injury-triggered factors, resulting in restoration of mTOR activity. SOCS3 was initially identified as a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway triggered by gp130 ligands such as interleukin-6, CNTF, and cardiotrophin-1 (Croker et al., 2008Croker B.A. Mielke L.A. Wormald S. Metcalf D. Kiu H. Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Roberts A.W. Socs3 maintains the specificity of biological responses to cytokine signals during granulocyte and macrophage differentiation.Exp. Hematol. 2008; 36: 786-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, Pennica et al., 1996Pennica D. Arce V. Swanson T.A. Vejsada R. Pollock R.A. Armanini M. Dudley K. Phillips H.S. Rosenthal A. Kato A.C. Henderson C.E. Cardiotrophin-1, a cytokine present in embryonic muscle, supports long-term survival of spinal motoneurons.Neuron. 1996; 17: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Most adult RGCs express both SOCS3 and gp130 (Figure S2). We attempted to examine the activation of gp130-dependent pathways by immunohistochemical methods but failed to detect tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 with available antibodies. This might be due to low abundance of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 protein within adult RGCs, as the same antibodies could detect specific signals in axotomized DRG neurons (data not shown). To directly test the contribution of gp130-dependent pathways to the effects of SOCS3 deletion on axon regeneration, we crossed gp130f/f mice (Betz et al., 1998Betz U.A. Bloch W. van den Broek M. Yoshida K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Addicks K. Rajewsky K. Müller W. Postnatally induced inactivation of gp130 in mice results in neurological, cardiac, hematopoietic, immunological, hepatic, and pulmonary defects.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and SOCS3f/f mice to generate mutants carrying two floxed genes. The double mutants received intravitreal viral injection to induce the deletion of both genes in RGCs. As expected, SOCS3 deletion resulted in increased neuronal survival and axon regeneration (Figures 3A, 3D, 3E, and 3H). However, gp130 knockout did not alter the survival of injured RGCs or regeneration of injured optic nerve axons (Figures 3B, 3D, 3F, and 3H). Interestingly, double knockout of SOCS3 and gp130 revealed a significant loss of the axon regeneration observed in SOCS3-deleted mice (Figures 3C and 3D), suggesting that axon regeneration induced by SOCS3 deletion is largely dependent upon gp130-mediated signaling. Surprisingly, neuronal survival in the double mutants is higher than controls (SOCS3f/f mice with AAV-GFP) or gp130f/f with AAV-Cre (Figures 3G and 3H), suggesting a contribution of gp130-independent pathways to the effects of SOCS3 deletion on neuronal survival. Thus, our results indicate that while gp130-dependent pathways are required for axonal regeneration, both gp130-dependent and gp130-independent pathways might be involved in neuronal survival effects of SOCS3 deletion. We next investigated the possible identity of gp130-dependent ligands that could be responsible for promoting axon regeneration following injury in SOCS3-deleted RGCs. These ligands could be derived from either glial cells in the lesion site and/or cells within the retina. To assess these possibilities, we used an explant culture. AAV-Cre or AAV-GFP was injected to the vitreous body of SOCS3f/f mice at the age of 4 weeks, and the retina was dissected 14 days postinjection. In the explants from the SOCS3f/f mice with AAV-GFP, only a few short sprouts grew out (Figures S3A and S3C). However, in the explants derived from SOCS3f/f mice with AAV-Cre, a dramatic increase in the number of neurites extending from the explants was observed (Figures S2B and S2C). These SOCS3-deleted retinal explants show a dramatic increase in the number of neurites in the absence of the injured optic nerve tissues, supporting the possibility that retina-derived ligands act on the gp130 and its coreceptors on RGCs. Previous studies suggest a possible upregulation of CNTF following injury (Müller et al., 2007Müller A. Hauk T.G. Fischer D. Astrocyte-derived CNTF switches mature RGCs to a regenerative state following inflammatory stimulation.Brain. 2007; 130: 3308-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2009Park K.K. Hu Y. Muhling J. Pollett M.A. Dallimore E.J. Turnley A.M. Cui Q. Harvey A.R. Cytokine-induced SOCS expression is inhibited by cAMP analogue: impact on regeneration in injured retina.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 41: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We therefore examined by in situ hybridization the levels of CNTF, IL-6, and cardiotrophin-1 following optic nerve injury. We observed a modest but consistent increase of CNTF mRNA in the ganglion cell layer of the mice at 6 hr after optic nerve injury (Figure S4B), while the expression levels of IL6 and CT-1 are not altered (Figures S4E and S4F and data not shown). However, we cannot distinguish the identity of the retinal cell types expressing CNTF. The upregulation of CNTF expression appears to be transient in nature, since it returns to control levels after 24 hr postinjury (Figure S4D). In line with this, a mild increase of SOCS3 mRNA signal was also transiently increased (data not shown). These results suggest that injury-induced upregulation of CNTF and perhaps other gp130-dependent cytokines may account for the effects of SOCS3 deletion on axon regeneration. Our results suggest that SOCS3 deletion allows mature RGCs to gain responsiveness to injury-induced cytokines. If this is the case, exogenously provided CNTF should further enhance axon regeneration from SOCS3-deleted RGCs. To test this, we intravitreously injected 1 μl CNTF immediately before injury and 3 days after injury. PBS-injected control animals (SOCS3f/f with AAV-GFP) showed no sign of axon regeneration (Figures 4A, 4E, and 4F), while CNTF showed modest axon regeneration in these control mice (Figures 4B, 4E, and 4F), consistent with previous reports (Müller et al., 2009Müller A. Hauk T.G. Leibinger M. Marienfeld R. Fischer D. Exogenous CNTF stimulates axon regeneration of retinal ganglion cells partially via endogenous CNTF.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 41: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, Leaver et al., 2006Leaver S.G. Cui Q. Bernard O. Harvey A.R. Cooperative effects of bcl-2 and AAV-mediated expression of CNTF on retinal ganglion cell survival and axonal regeneration in adult transgenic mice.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 3323-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SOCS3 knockout mice, treated with PBS, showed a similar regeneration effect to that observed in noninjected animals (Figures 4C, 4E, and 4F). In contrast, CNTF injection resulted in a dramatic increase of axon regeneration in SOCS3-deleted mice (Figures 4D, 4E, and 4F). The numbers and lengths of regenerating axons are comparable to that seen after PTEN deletion (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Thus, exogenous CNTF further enhances axon regeneration from SOCS3-deleted RGCs following optic nerve injury. In this study, we show that SOCS3 deletion in RGCs promotes dramatic axon regeneration following optic nerve injury in a gp130-dependent manner. Importantly, exogenously delivered CNTF could further enhance the extent of axon regeneration in SOCS3-deleted mice. Thus, reduced responsiveness to injury-induced growth-promoting factors may be an important limiting factor for successful axon regeneration in mature CNS neurons. These findings also provide a plausible explanation for previous observations that exogenously delivered cytokines have limited effects on promoting survival and regeneration following optic nerve injury (Cui et al., 1999Cui Q. Lu Q. So K.F. Yip H.K. CNTF, not other trophic factors, promotes axonal regeneration of axotomized retinal ganglion cells in adult hamsters.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 760-766PubMed Google Scholar, Watanabe et al., 2003Watanabe M. Tokita Y. Kato M. Fukuda Y. Intravitreal injections of neurotrophic factors and forskolin enhance survival and axonal regeneration of axotomized beta ganglion cells in cat retina.Neuroscience. 2003; 116: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or spinal cord injury (Lacroix et al., 2002Lacroix S. Chang L. Rose-John S. Tuszynski M.H. Delivery of hyper-interleukin-6 to the injured spinal cord increases neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and inhibits axonal growth.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 454: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the adult CNS, the receptors and signaling molecules that mediate the activity of CNTF and other cytokines are highly expressed in glial cells (Schöbitz et al., 1992Schöbitz B. Holsboer F. Kikkert R. Sutanto W. De Kloet E.R. Peripheral and central regulation of IL-6 gene expression in endotoxin-treated rats.Endocr. Regul. 1992; 26: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar). Upon injury, upregulated cytokines act as proinflammatory agents as a part of a defense mechanism, but excessive or prolonged activation could be detrimental to the CNS. SOCS3 family members, which are rapidly upregulated by cytokines (Croker et al., 2008Croker B.A. Mielke L.A. Wormald S. Metcalf D. Kiu H. Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Roberts A.W. Socs3 maintains the specificity of biological responses to cytokine signals during granulocyte and macrophage differentiation.Exp. Hematol. 2008; 36: 786-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), are crucial in executing tight control of the strength and duration of these cytokine-triggered signaling pathways. Thus, it is possible that limited regenerative responses of RGCs to injury-induced CNTF could be, at least partially, attributed to this characteristic tight regulatory mechanism of the JAK/STAT pathway. Previous studies in culture showed that a specific JAK2 inhibitor does not affect the axonal growth of embryonic DRG neurons but could efficiently block axonal elongation of adult sensory neurons after a conditioning lesion (Liu and Snider, 2001Liu R.Y. Snider W.D. Different signaling pathways mediate regenerative versus developmental sensory axon growth.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC164PubMed Google Scholar, Neumann and Woolf, 1999Neumann S. Woolf C.J. Regeneration of dorsal column fibers into and beyond the lesion site following adult spinal cord injury.Neuron. 1999; 23: 83-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Similarly, motoneuron-specific deletion of STAT3 has no significant effect on the survival of embryonic motoneurons, but results in increased death of motoneurons after facial nerve injury (Schweizer et al., 2002Schweizer U. Gunnersen J. Karch C. Wiese S. Holtmann B. Takeda K. Akira S. Sendtner M. Conditional gene ablation of Stat3 reveals differential signaling requirements for survival of motoneurons during development and after nerve injury in the adult.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Together with our findings, these studies suggest that gp130-dependent signaling may be critical for injury-induced responses such as neuronal survival and axon regeneration. In this regard, lens injury has been shown to promote axon regeneration after optic nerve injury (Fischer et al., 2000Fischer D. Pavlidis M. Thanos S. Cataractogenic lens injury prevents traumatic ganglion cell death and promotes axonal regeneration both in vivo and in culture.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3943-3954PubMed Google Scholar, Leon et al., 2000Leon S. Yin Y. Nguyen J. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. Lens injury stimulates axon regeneration in the mature rat optic nerve.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4615-4626PubMed Google Scholar) and a combinatorial treatment of lens injury and cAMP agonists results in robust axon regeneration (Müller et al., 2007Müller A. Hauk T.G. Fischer D. Astrocyte-derived CNTF switches mature RGCs to a regenerative state following inflammatory stimulation.Brain. 2007; 130: 3308-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of JAK/STAT pathway to these effects remains to be determined (Cui et al., 2008Cui Q. Benowitz L. Yin Y. Does CNTF mediate the effect of intraocular inflammation on optic nerve regeneration?.Brain. 2008; 131: e96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). How are cytokine-triggered pathways involved in controlling neuronal survival and axon regeneration? In SOCS3-deleted RGCs, mTOR is initially downregulated but recovers at later postinjury points, in contrast to the rapid and persistent suppression in injured RGCs in the control mice (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). These mTOR alterations correlate with the extent and time course of axon regeneration observed in both PTEN and SOCS3-deleted RGCs. These results support a model in which mTOR determines the competence of regeneration in RGCs, while SOCS3-regulated pathways act as an injury-induced signal that turns on the regenerative program in injured RGCs. The dynamics of mTOR activity implies that augmented and prolonged signaling events as a result of SOCS3 deletion could allow injured neurons to restore mTOR activity and regain axonal growth ability. Previous studies suggest the involvement of several signaling pathways, such as PI3K/akt, MAPK/ ERK, or JAK/STAT, in CNTF-triggered effects on neuronal survival after injury (Park et al., 2004Park K. Luo J.M. Hisheh S. Harvey A.R. Cui Q. Cellular mechanisms associated with spontaneous and ciliary neurotrophic factor-cAMP-induced survival and axonal regeneration of adult retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10806-10815Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, cytokine-triggered pathways may directly initiate an axon regrowth program via these signaling pathways. On the other hand, gp130-dependent signaling is required for axotomy-triggered expression of neuropeptides such as pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (Habecker et al., 2009Habecker B.A. Sachs H.H. Rohrer H. Zigmond R.E. The dependence on gp130 cytokines of axotomy induced neuropeptide expression in adult sympathetic neurons.Dev. Neurobiol. 2009; 69: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because these neuropeptides have been shown to promote axon growth, they might indirectly contribute to the survival and regeneration effects observed in SOCS3-deleted mice. Interestingly, while gp130 deletion abolishes the axon regeneration-promoting effect of SOCS3 knockout, a partial neuronal survival effect is preserved in SOCS3 and gp130 double mutants. In this regard, it has been previously shown that in cultured nonneuronal cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 could be induced by gp130-independent growth factors such as interleukin-2 and erythropoietin. In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated SOCS3 not only inhibits STAT activation but also binds to p120 RasGAP and activates Ras (Cacalano et al., 2001Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Tyrosine-phosphorylated SOCS-3 inhibits STAT activation but binds to p120 RasGAP and activates Ras.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Given the established role of Ras in neuronal survival (Reichardt, 2006Reichardt L.F. Neurotrophin-regulated signalling pathways.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether this or other mechanisms mediate the gp130-independent survival effect of SOCS3 deletion. Together with our previous finding of robust axon regeneration in RGCs with deletion of PTEN or TSC1 (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), our current results reveal a critical limiting mechanism of CNS axon regeneration: reduced or lost neuronal responses to growth-promoting factors. Thus, targeting negative regulators of signaling pathways of cytokine and growth factors to enhance neuronal responses to growth-promoting factors may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for promoting axon regeneration following CNS injury in the adult. Future studies will be geared toward determining whether these regenerating axons are able to reconnect with their targets and assessing whether other types of CNS neurons are sensitive to the manipulations of gp130-dependent or -independent signaling pathways. All experimental procedures were performed in compliance with animal protocols approved by the IACUC at Children's Hospital, Boston. C57BL6/J mice or various floxed mice (aged p21) including SOCS3f/f and/ or gp130f/f were injected intravitreally with 1 μl volume of AAV-GFP or AAV-Cre (titers at 0.5–1.0 × 1012) or CNTF (Peprotech, 1 μg/ml). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. For each intravitreal injection, the micropipette was inserted in peripheral retina, just behind the ora serrata, and was angled to avoid damage to the lens. Two weeks after injection, the left ON was exposed intraorbitally and crushed with jeweler's forceps (Dumont #5; Roboz) for 5 s ∼1 mm behind the optic disc. To preserve the retinal blood supply, care was taken not to damage the underlying ophthalmic artery. Mice received a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine as postoperative analgesic. Eye ointment containing atropine sulfate was applied preoperatively to protect the cornea during surgery. Complete optic nerve transection was verified by demonstrating that both retrograde and anterograde tracers fail to reach the retina or the superior colliculus, respectively, after lesion (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Preparation of AAVs was described in Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar. For anterograde labeling of RGC axons, l μl of cholera toxin β subunit (CTB) (2 μg/μl, Invitrogen) was injected into the vitreous with a Hamilton syringe. Animals were given a lethal overdose of anesthesia and perfused with 4% PFA. For the animals with an optic nerve injury, eyes with the nerve segment still attached were dissected out and postfixed in the same fixative overnight at 4°C. Tissues were cryoprotected through increasing concentrations of optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue Tek). Eyes were snap-frozen in dry ice and serial cross-sections (16 μm) were cut and stored at –20°C. Optic nerves were cut longitudinally (8 μm). Regenerating RGC axons in injured optic nerves distal to the crush site were quantified as described previously (Leon et al., 2000Leon S. Yin Y. Nguyen J. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. Lens injury stimulates axon regeneration in the mature rat optic nerve.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4615-4626PubMed Google Scholar, Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The number of CTB-labeled axons was estimated by counting the number of CTB-labeled fibers extending different distances from the end of the crush site in five sections (every fourth section) per animal. The cross-sectional width of the nerve was measured at the point at which the counts were taken and was used to calculate the number of axons per millimeter of nerve width. The number of axons per millimeter was averaged over all sections. Σad, the total number of axons extending distance d in a nerve having a radius of r, was estimated by summing over all sections having a thickness t (8 μm): Σad = πr2 × [average axons/mm]/t. Four-week-old SOCS3f/f mice were intravitreally injected with AAV-Cre as the treated group, or AAV-GFP as the control group (n = 4 each group). Retinas were isolated after 14 days. Retinas were then cut into eight pieces radially and cultured in laminin-poly-D-lysine-coated dishes. Culture medium was Neurobasal-A with 5% B27 supplement (GIBCO), penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO), and glutamine (GIBCO). Explants were maintained for 4 days and then fixed with 4% PFA. Outgrowing neurites were then stained with anti-TUJ1 antibody. For each animal, fluorescent images of three or four pieces of the explants were taken (100×, Nikon). With Metamorph software (Molecular Devices), the edge of the explant was outlined and areas at 0–40 μm, 40–80 μm, and 80–120 μm distal to the edge were defined all the way around the explant. The numbers of neurites were counted in the three zones and averaged over the three to four explants for each animal. The differences between the two groups were analyzed using t test.

Motor neurons have long been known to receive prominent “C bouton” cholinergic inputs from spinal interneurons, but the source and function of these synaptic inputs have remained obscure. We show here that the transcription factor Pitx2 marks a small cluster of spinal cholinergic interneurons, V0C neurons, that represents the sole source of C bouton inputs to motor neurons. The activity of these cholinergic interneurons is tightly phase locked with motor neuron bursting during fictive locomotor activity, suggesting a role in the modulation of motor neuron firing frequency. Genetic inactivation of the output of these neurons impairs a locomotor task-dependent increase in motor neuron firing and muscle activation. Thus, V0C interneurons represent a defined class of spinal cholinergic interneurons with an intrinsic neuromodulatory role in the control of locomotor behavior.

Thus, V0C interneurons represent a defined class of spinal cholinergic interneurons with an intrinsic neuromodulatory role in the control of locomotor behavior. Motor behaviors are constructed and constrained by neural circuits that coordinate the activation of skeletal muscles. The immediate task of regulating the limb muscles that control many aspects of vertebrate locomotor behavior has been assigned to circuits in the spinal cord, and in particular to networks of interneurons that determine the temporal dynamics of motor neuron activation. Elemental features of locomotion—the rhythm and pattern of motor neuron firing—are controlled by sets of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons that use fast-acting amino acid transmitters (Hochman and Schmidt, 1998Hochman S.

Locomotor programs can also undergo adaptive changes in response to the biomechanical demands of particular motor tasks (Gillis and Biewener, 2001Gillis G.B. Biewener A.A. Hindlimb muscle function in relation to speed and gait: in vivo patterns of strain and activation in a hip and knee extensor of the rat (Rattus norvegicus).J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2717-2731PubMed Google Scholar). These context-dependent features of locomotion involve moment-by-moment changes in the frequency of firing of spinal motor neurons, usually triggered by slower-acting modulatory networks of supraspinal and intraspinal origin (Jordan et al., 2008Jordan L.M.

Much has been learned about the organization and function of descending modulatory systems, but the identity, connectivity, and physiological roles of intrinsic spinal modulatory interneurons have been more difficult to untangle. In many regions of the CNS, modulatory influences on neuronal output and behavior are mediated by sets of cholinergic interneurons that elicit a diverse array of postsynaptic responses. The activation of cortical cholinergic systems modulates sensory threshold, states of attention, and the consolidation of memory (Pauli and O'Reilly, 2008Pauli W.M. O'Reilly R.C.

In subcortical regions, cholinergic interneurons regulate the output of dopaminergic pathways implicated in sensory-motor learning, action selection, and reward (Mena-Segovia et al., 2008Mena-Segovia J.

Mameli-Engvall M. et al.Nicotine reinforcement and cognition restored by targeted expression of nicotinic receptors.Nature. 2005; 436: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Many of these insights into cholinergic modulatory function have emerged through pharmacological manipulation of cholinergic receptor systems, although the widespread distribution of most receptors (Wess, 2003Wess J. Novel insights into muscarinic acetylcholine receptor function using gene targeting technology.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 414-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) has made it difficult to establish a clear link between the dynamics of cholinergic microcircuitry and physiological function (Wess, 2003Wess J. Novel insights into muscarinic acetylcholine receptor function using gene targeting technology.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 414-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Defining the contribution of individual classes of cholinergic modulatory interneurons to specific behaviors has therefore been a challenge. The spinal cord contains several classes of cholinergic interneurons with proposed roles in sensory processing and motor output (Barber et al., 1984Barber R.P. Phelps P.E. Houser C.R. Crawford G.D. Salvaterra P.M. Vaughn J.E. The morphology and distribution of neurons containing choline acetyltransferase in the adult rat spinal cord: an immunocytochemical study.J. Comp.

Spinal cholinergic neurons activated during locomotion: localization and electrophysiological characterization.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar). The best-characterized spinal cholinergic circuit involves a recurrent excitatory connection from motor neurons to Renshaw interneurons, mediated by the activation of nicotinic receptors (Willis, 1971Willis W.D. The case for the Renshaw cell.Brain Behav. Evol. 1971; 4: 5-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Alvarez and Fyffe, 2007Alvarez F.J. Fyffe R.E. The continuing case for the Renshaw cell.J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Motor neurons themselves also receive synaptic input from recurrent motor axon collaterals (Lagerbäck et al., 1981Lagerbäck P.A. Ronnevi L.O. Cullheim S. Kellerth J.O. An ultrastructural study of the synaptic contacts of alpha-motoneurone axon collaterals. I. Contacts in lamina IX and with identified alpha-motoneurone dendrites in lamina VII.Brain Res. 1981; 207: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). But the most prominent cholinergic input to motor neurons takes the form of C boutons, a set of large synaptic terminals that are concentrated on motor neuron cell bodies and proximal dendrites (Conradi and Skoglund, 1969Conradi S. Skoglund S.

Cholinergic C boutons align with postsynaptic m2 class muscarinic receptors and Kv2.1 class K+ channels (Hellström et al., 2003Hellström J. Oliveira A.L. Meister B. Cullheim S.

Postnatal development of cholinergic synapses on mouse spinal motoneurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 474: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that these synapses exert a modulatory influence on motor neuron firing (Brownstone et al., 1992Brownstone R.M. Jordan L.M. Kriellaars D.J. Noga B.R. Shefchyk S.J. On the regulation of repetitive firing in lumbar motoneurones during fictive locomotion in the cat.Exp. Brain Res. 1992; 90: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The activation of muscarinic receptors on spinal neurons reduces spike afterhyperpolarization and leads to a marked enhancement in the frequency of motor neuron firing (Miles et al., 2007Miles G.B. Hartley R. Todd A.J. Brownstone R.M. Spinal cholinergic interneurons regulate the excitability of motoneurons during locomotion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2448-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Conversely, blockade of muscarinic receptors in isolated spinal cord preparations decreases motor neuron output (Miles et al., 2007Miles G.B. Hartley R. Todd A.J. Brownstone R.M. Spinal cholinergic interneurons regulate the excitability of motoneurons during locomotion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2448-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Together, these findings have led to the idea that C bouton synapses exert a modulatory influence on spinal motor output. The neuronal source of C bouton terminals has proved elusive. They do not derive from descending supraspinal axons (McLaughlin, 1972McLaughlin B.J. Propriospinal and supraspinal projections to the motor nuclei in the cat spinal cord.J. Comp. Neurol. 1972; 144: 475-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, VanderHorst and Ulfhake, 2006VanderHorst V.G. Ulfhake B. The organization of the brainstem and spinal cord of the mouse: relationships between monoaminergic, cholinergic, and spinal projection systems.J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2006; 31: 2-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or from motor axon collaterals (Hellström et al., 1999Hellström J. Arvidsson U. Elde R. Cullheim S. Meister B. Differential expression of nerve terminal protein isoforms in VAChT-containing varicosities of the spinal cord ventral horn.J. Comp.

Spinal cholinergic interneurons regulate the excitability of motoneurons during locomotion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2448-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and so by elimination are thought to originate from one or more populations of spinal interneurons. The persistence of C boutons after intraspinal lesions has led to the suggestion that they derive from cholinergic interneurons that are interspersed among motor neurons in the ventrolateral spinal cord (Hellström, 2004Hellström, J. (2004). On the cholinergic C-bouton. PhD Thesis, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.Google Scholar). Analysis of the activity-induced pattern of c-fos expression during locomotion, however, shows strong labeling of cholinergic interneurons adjacent to the central canal (Huang et al., 2000Huang A. Noga B.R. Carr P.A. Fedirchuk B. Jordan L.M. Spinal cholinergic neurons activated during locomotion: localization and electrophysiological characterization.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, genetic lineage tracing in mice has provided evidence that C boutons derive from one or more of the cholinergic interneuron classes that populate the intermediate zone of the spinal cord (Miles et al., 2007Miles G.B. Hartley R. Todd A.J. Brownstone R.M. Spinal cholinergic interneurons regulate the excitability of motoneurons during locomotion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2448-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). But since there are no selective molecular markers for neurons that give rise to C boutons, the circuitry and physiology of this intrinsic cholinergic system, and its contribution to mammalian motor behavior, have yet to be defined. We set out to define discrete functional populations of interneurons in mouse spinal cord on the basis of their transcription factor profile, neurotransmitter phenotype, and connectivity. We show here that the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Pitx2 (Semina et al., 1996Semina E.V. Reiter R. Leysens N.J. Alward W.L. Small K.W. Datson N.A. Siegel-Bartelt J. Bierke-Nelson D. Bitoun P. Zabel B.U. et al.Cloning and characterization of a novel bicoid-related homeobox transcription factor gene, RIEG, involved in Rieger syndrome.Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) defines a small set of cholinergic V0 interneurons positioned close to the central canal, and we establish that these neurons represent the sole source of C bouton synapses. The firing of cholinergic V0 interneurons is tightly phase locked with motor neuron burst activity during fictive locomotor episodes, indicative of their recruitment during motor behavior. To explore the consequences of inactivating the output of these cholinergic interneurons, we eliminated choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), the sole synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine (ACh), from cholinergic V0 neurons. Mice in which cholinergic V0 neurons have been deprived of ChAT expression are impaired in their ability to increase the activation of specific muscles during certain locomotor behaviors, suggesting that recruitment of this set of cholinergic interneurons is required for the task-dependent enhancement of motor neuron firing. Together, our findings define the organization and properties of a discrete set of spinal cholinergic interneurons that exert a context-dependent modulatory influence on motor behavior. To define markers of discrete sets of spinal interneurons, we performed a microarray screen with cDNA probes derived from dorsal and ventral domains of p8 mouse lumbar spinal cord (Figure S1A). We identified 82 genes with a ventral:dorsal enrichment ratio of 3.0 or greater and used in situ hybridization histochemistry to determine the profile of expression of these genes. This analysis identified seven genes with patterns of expression that were confined to subsets of interneurons in intermediate and ventral spinal cord (Figure S1B–S1F). In this study, we focus on the phenotype, organization, and function of interneurons defined by one of these genes, which encodes the paired-like homeodomain protein Pitx2 (Semina et al., 1996Semina E.V. Reiter R. Leysens N.J. Alward W.L. Small K.W. Datson N.A. Siegel-Bartelt J. Bierke-Nelson D. Bitoun P. Zabel B.U. et al.Cloning and characterization of a novel bicoid-related homeobox transcription factor gene, RIEG, involved in Rieger syndrome.Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In postnatal lumbar spinal cord, expression of Pitx2 was confined to a longitudinally arrayed cluster of cells positioned close to the central canal (Figures 1A and 1B). A similar profile of Pitx2 expression was detected at thoracic and cervical levels, although at cervical levels the domain of Pitx2+ neurons extended slightly more laterally (Figures 1C and 1D). From the outset, Pitx2 expression was restricted to a small group of neurons (Figures S2A–S2C). At lumbar levels, Pitx2 expression was first detected at embryonic day (e) 11.5 to 12.0 (Figure S2C) and, by late embryonic stages, was restricted to a small group of neurons in the intermediate domain, close to the central canal (Figure S2D). The expression of Pitx2 by neurons in this medial column persisted until at least p30 (Figure S2E). Pitx2+ neurons comprised two phenotypic subsets: one that coexpressed the cholinergic markers ChAT and vAChT (vesicular acetylcholine transporter) and a second that expressed the vesicular glutamate transporter vGluT2 (Figures 1E–1I″). Neurons in the pericentral canal region of p8 lumbar spinal cord did not coexpress vAChT and vGluT2 (Figure S3), indicating that these two neurotransmitter-defined sets represent distinct subpopulations. Cholinergic and glutamatergic Pitx2+ neurons were differentially distributed along the rostro-caudal axis of the lumbar spinal cord. At rostral lumbar levels, the majority of Pitx2+ neurons expressed cholinergic markers, whereas glutamatergic Pitx2+ neurons predominated at more caudal lumbar levels (Figure 1J). Cholinergic and glutamatergic Pitx2+ neurons were also detected at thoracic and cervical levels of the spinal cord (data not shown). Thus, Pitx2 marks a small subset of interneurons that can be further subdivided on the basis of neurotransmitter phenotype. Pitx2 expression distinguishes this set of cholinergic interneurons from a nearby population of central canal cluster (C3) neurons (Barber et al., 1984Barber R.P. Phelps P.E. Houser C.R. Crawford G.D. Salvaterra P.M. Vaughn J.E. The morphology and distribution of neurons containing choline acetyltransferase in the adult rat spinal cord: an immunocytochemical study.J. Comp.

Neurol. 1984; 229: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that also express cholinergic phenotype, but lack Pitx2 expression (Figure S4). We used genetic lineage tracing to determine the developmental origin of cholinergic and glutamatergic Pitx2+ neurons. The provenance of these interneurons was analyzed in a Dbx1::nlsLacZ transgenic line in which the postmitotic perdurance of LacZ expression marks V0 interneurons (Pierani et al., 2001Pierani A. Moran-Rivard L. Sunshine M.J. Littman D.R. Goulding M. Jessell T.M. Control of interneuron fate in the developing spinal cord by the progenitor homeodomain protein Dbx1.Neuron. 2001; 29: 367-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In e12.5 Dbx1::nlsLacZ mice, we found that ∼80% of Pitx2+ neurons coexpressed LacZ (Figures 1L–M′), indicating that they correspond to V0 neurons. Analysis of Dbx1 null mutant embryos, which lack V0 interneurons (Pierani et al., 2001Pierani A. Moran-Rivard L. Sunshine M.J. Littman D.R. Goulding M. Jessell T.M. Control of interneuron fate in the developing spinal cord by the progenitor homeodomain protein Dbx1.Neuron. 2001; 29: 367-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), revealed an absence of Pitx2 expression from neurons in the intermediate spinal cord (Figures 1N and 1O), confirming the V0 identity of Pitx2+ interneurons. This transcriptionally defined population represents a very minor subset of the total V0 interneuron cohort: Pitx2 was expressed by only 5% of all LacZ+ neurons in e12.5 Dbx1::nlsLacZ embryos (Figures 1K and 1L). V0 interneurons have been shown to comprise Evx1/2+ (V0V) and Evx1/2− (V0D) divisions (Lanuza et al., 2004Lanuza G.M. Gosgnach S. Pierani A. Jessell T.M. Goulding M. Genetic identification of spinal interneurons that coordinate left-right locomotor activity necessary for walking movements.Neuron. 2004; 42: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Soon after their generation, virtually all Pitx2+ neurons coexpressed Evx1, albeit transiently (Figures 1P and 1Q). Thus, the cholinergic (V0C) and glutamatergic (V0G) interneuron populations marked by Pitx2 appear to constitute small subsets of V0V interneurons. To define the connectivity of V0C and V0G neurons, we crossed a mouse Pitx2::Cre line, which directs expression of Cre recombinase selectively in Pitx2+ neurons (Liu et al., 2003Liu W. Selever J. Lu M.F. Martin J.F.

A developmental switch in the response of DRG neurons to ETS transcription factor signaling.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e159Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). We detected fluorescent protein (FP) expression in a small subset of interneurons close to the central canal (Figures 2A and 2B). At rostral lumbar levels, FP expression was detected in 66% of all Pitx2+ neurons in Thy1.lsl.YFP mice and in 74% of all Pitx2+ neurons in Tau.lsl.mGFP mice (Figures 2C–2D′ and data not shown). Examination of the neurotransmitter status of genetically marked neurons in Tau.lsl.mGFP mice revealed FP expression in 94% of cholinergic Pitx2+ interneurons and in 56% of noncholinergic Pitx2+ interneurons. Thus, V0C interneurons are labeled with high efficiency in Tau.lsl.mGFP mice. To trace the targets of V0C and V0G neurons, we mapped FP-labeled axons and terminals in the spinal cord of Pitx2::Cre;Tau.lsl.mGFP mice, in conjunction with synaptic expression of the cholinergic markers vAChT and ChAT, and the glutamatergic marker vGluT2. Analysis of the overall pattern of FP-labeled axons and terminals from p8 to p25 revealed a high density in the ventral horn and intermediate zone and a lower density in the dorsal horn (Figures 3A and S5). In the ventral horn, the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of virtually all vAChT+ motor neurons were studded with large FP-labeled boutons (Figures 3B and 3C), whereas more distal dendritic domains exhibited a >20-fold lower FP+ bouton density (Figures 3H and 3I). We found that ∼99% of the FP-labeled boutons on motor neurons expressed vAChT, and none of them coexpressed vGluT2 (Figures 3D–3D″′). Conversely, 95% of all vAChT+ C boutons on motor neurons expressed FP. Consistent with their identity as C boutons, FP-labeled terminals on motor neurons were aligned with postsynaptic m2 muscarinic receptors and Kv2.1 channels (Figures 3F and 3G). These findings, taken together with the 94% labeling efficiency of cholinergic Pitx2+ interneuron cell bodies, indicate that V0C neurons represent the sole source of C boutons. Moreover, motor neurons receive preferential input from the V0C subset of Pitx2+ neurons. We next examined the connectivity of Pitx2+ neurons with spinal interneurons. We detected FP-labeled vGluT2+ boutons in the intermediate zone and dorsal horn of Pitx2::Cre;FP reporter mice (Figures 3E–3E″; data not shown), providing evidence that the V0G class of Pitx2+ neurons forms connections with spinal interneurons. We also detected a low density of FP-labeled vAChT+ boutons in the intermediate zone of the spinal cord of p20– p40 Pitx2::Cre;Tau.lsl.mGFP mice (data not shown), suggestive of synaptic contact with ventral interneurons. We therefore examined whether two classes of interneurons implicated in the regulation of motor neuron output, V2a interneurons (Peng et al., 2007Peng C.Y. Yajima H. Burns C.E. Zon L.I. Sisodia S.S.

The cell bodies and dendrites of calbindin+ Renshaw cells were contacted by many vAChT+ boutons (Figures 4A, 4E, 4F, and 4R).

https://openalex.org/W2112811821,"Neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have revealed regions of cerebral white matter with decreased microstructural organization (lowerfractional anisotropy or FA) among poor readers. We examined whether 100 hr of intensive remedial instruction affected the white matter of 8- to 10-year-old poor readers. Prior to instruction, poor readers had significantly lower FA than good readers in a region of the left anterior centrum semiovale. The instruction resulted in a change in white matter (significantly increased FA), and in the very same region. The FA increase was correlated with a decrease in radial diffusivity (but not with a change in axial diffusivity), suggesting that myelination had increased. Furthermore, the FA increase was correlated with improvement in phonological decoding ability, clarifying the cognitive locus of the effect. The results demonstrate the capability of a behavioral intervention to bring about a positive change in cortico-cortical white matter tracts.

A major challenge of cognitive neuroscience is to understand how changes in the structural properties of the brain underpin the plasticity exhibited whenever a person develops, ages, learns a new skill, or adapts to a neuropathology. Longitudinal studies have shown regional changes in the volume of gray matter that co-occur with skill acquisition or learning (Draganski et al., 2004Draganski B. Gaser C. Busch V. Schuierer G. Bogdahn U. May A. Changes in grey matter induced by training.Nature. 2004; 427: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, Draganski et al., 2006Draganski B. Gaser C. Kempermann G.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6314-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), but there is also growing acknowledgment that higher-level cognition is based on cofunctioning of a set of cortical areas in a dynamic large-scale network, highlighting the central role of cortical communication. Improved anatomical connectivity in motor tracts as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) has been associated with enriched experience (extensive childhood piano practice) in a correlational study using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Bengtsson et al., 2005Bengtsson S.L. Nagy Z. Skare S. Forsman L. Forssberg H. Ullen F. Extensive piano practicing has regionally specific effects on white matter development.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). (FA, which measures the anisotropy of the diffusion of water molecules (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996Basser P.J. Pierpaoli C. Microstructural and physiological features of tissue elucidated by quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI.J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 111: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar), is sensitive to axonal density, size, myelination, and the coherence of organization of fibers within a voxel, and thus provides an index of the structural integrity of white matter). Functional imaging studies have consistently demonstrated that children with reading disability display under-activation of a network of left-lateralized areas during reading, including occipito-temporal, temporo-parietal, and inferior frontal cortical regions (Hoeft et al., 2006Hoeft F.

However, skilled reading depends not only on the activation of a set of relevant cortical areas, but also on communication among them. Reading difficulty has also been associated with lower functional connectivity (the synchronization of neural activity) across areas of the reading cortical network (Hampson et al., 2006Hampson M.

This suggests that reading disability might be associated with structural properties of the white matter that provides the anatomical connectivity among the individual nodes of the reading network. Consistent with this view, several DTI studies of poor readers have found white matter regions with lower FA compared with controls (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu C. Plewes C. Paulson L.A. Roy D.

FA may be reduced in poor readers due to a number of possible differences in the microstructural properties of white matter, including reduced myelination, reduced axonal packing density, decreased axonal diameter, or reduced coherence of the orientation of axons within the region (Beaulieu, 2002Beaulieu C.

Dougherty R.F. Wandell B.A. White matter pathways in reading.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), all of which might impact the efficiency of communication (bandwidth) among cortical areas. Here we report a longitudinal DTI study indicating that intensive remedial reading instruction (approximately 100 hr) can change the structural integrity of the cortical white matter of children who are poor readers. The children's DTI data were first assessed before instruction began and then a second time after the instruction ended, approximately 6 months later. At the preremediation scan, the poor readers showed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the anterior left centrum semiovale region, relative to a control group of good readers. Subsequent to the instruction, the remediated poor readers had not only made substantial gains in their reading ability, but also showed significantly increased FA in the anterior left centrum semiovale, in contrast to good readers and to a control group of untreated poor readers. To help determine which microstructural properties had changed during remediation, we also examined the diffusivity in directions that are perpendicular to the principal axis of diffusion in anisotropic regions of white matter (radial diffusivity, (λ2 + λ3)/2), or parallel to it (axial diffusivity, λ1). For example, changes in radial diffusivity in the absence of changes in axial diffusivity have been associated with changes in myelin (Beaulieu, 2002Beaulieu C.

The results analyzed this way indicate that a behavioral intervention can bring about a positive change in the microstructure of human cortico-cortical white matter tracts, demonstrating the malleability of the anatomical connectivity that supports human cortical network function. Forty-seven children (8–12 years old) who were poor readers were randomly assigned to either an intensive 100 hr program of systematic and explicit remedial reading instruction focused primarily on developing word-level decoding skills (n = 35), or they were assigned to a control group that received normal classroom instruction (n = 12). There was also a control group of good readers (n = 25) of the same age. The remedial instruction was distributed over about 6 months of schooling, with instruction occurring in groups of three children with one teacher. (Although the remedial instruction came in one of four alternative forms (see Experimental Procedures), there were no reliable differences among the children assigned to the different forms in either initial behavioral measures or DTI measures, nor in the impacts of the instruction (see Supplemental Results and Discussion, available online). Hence the data reported here are collapsed across the children in the four forms of remedial reading instruction.) The remediated and unremediated poor readers scored equivalently at the preinstruction scan on multiple measures of reading ability, whereas the group of good readers scored significantly better than both groups of poor readers on every reading ability measure (see Table S1). The behavioral results indicated that the poor readers who received the remedial instruction showed significant improvement on most of the age-standardized Woodcock Reading Mastery Test – Revised (WRMT-R, Woodcock et al., 1998) reading ability measures when retested following the instruction period, but that the control poor readers did not show improvement on these measures, indicated by a reliable overall group by time effect (F1, 45 = 4.36, p < 0.05), with means shown in Table 1. Individual ANOVAs for each measure indicated that the interaction between group and time was reliable only for the subtest measuring non-word reading ability (Word Attack scores, F1, 45 = 5.22, p < 0.05), but not for the subtests measuring real word reading ability (Word Identification) or passage comprehension ability (Passage Comprehension). This pattern of outcomes suggests that the instruction specifically improved phonological decoding skills more than the standard reading curricula did. This conclusion was also supported by an analysis of changes in raw scores on all ability measures collected from the poor readers before and after the treatment phase (see Supplemental Results and Discussion and Table S2).Table 1Changes in Age-Standardized Woodcock Reading Mastery Test—Revised Scores between the Preremediation and Postremediation ScansChange in Scores GroupGroup × Time ANOVAPoor Readers (PR)Poor Reader Controls (PC)Interaction EffectMeasureTime 2 − Time1t(34)Time 2 − Time1t(11)F(1, 45)WRMT-R word attack5.53.98ap < 0.005.−0.3−0.175.22bp < 0.05.WRMT-R word identification2.52.50bp < 0.05.2.30.650.01WRMT-R passage comprehension1.10.86−3.0−1.042.18WRMT-R basic skills cluster4.25.06cp < 0.0005.2.60.870.48WRMT-R total reading cluster2.22.51 b1.50.470.08a p < 0.005.b p < 0.05.c p < 0.0005. Open table in a new tab The DTI results indicated that poor readers who received the remedial instruction showed a reliable increase in FA between the preremediation and postremediation scans, with a peak difference in the left anterior centrum semiovale, as shown in Figure 1A. Corresponding contrasts conducted for the two control groups that received no remedial instruction found no areas showing either an increase or decrease in FA between the two scans, indicating that the change in FA among the remediated poor readers was not due to maturational changes over the 6 month interval between the two scans. This same region also showed significantly reduced FA at the preremediation scan among all poor readers relative to the group of good readers (Figure 1B). The reliable increase in FA between the two scans among the poor readers, but no change in FA between the scans among the good readers, nor among the unremediated poor reader controls, resulted in a significant group (3) by time (2) interaction with a peak F value in the same region of the left anterior centrum semiovale (Figure 2A), strongly suggesting that intensive remedial reading instruction led to changes in some microstructural property of white matter in a region of left frontal white matter, a region that differed between good and poor readers prior to the treatment. Additional analyses presented in the Supplemental Results confirmed that these findings were not due to the particular voxel-based analysis methods that were used; essentially identical results were obtained using unsmoothed data and nonparametric statistical inference methods (see Supplemental Results and Discussion and Figures S1 and S2). Because increased FA in highly organized white matter can occur due to either a relative decrease in radial diffusivity or a relative increase in axial diffusivity (or both), a further analysis examined the remediation effect in each of these components separately in the region shown in Figure 2A. It was the radial diffusivity that had changed in the remediated poor readers subsequent to the instruction. There was a reliable group by time interaction for radial diffusivity in this same region (F2, 69 = 5.92, p < 0.005); this measure reliably decreased among the remediated poor readers (t(34) = 3.98, p < 0.0005), but showed no change in either the good readers or the poor reader controls, as shown in Figure 2C. This pattern of radial diffusivity effects mirrors the findings for FA (a reliable increase in FA among poor readers who received remedial instruction but no reliable change in FA among the two unremediated groups; Figure 2B). By contrast, the other component of FA, axial diffusivity, showed no significant changes between phases for any group at this location, nor was there a reliable interaction (Figure 2D). The pattern of diffusivity effects indicates that the difference in FA between poor and good readers before remediation is due to initially higher radial diffusivity in the poor readers, and that the change in FA results from a change in some microstructural feature (e.g., myelination, packing density, or axon diameter) that affects radial diffusivity. The pattern of results also argues against the preremediation differences in FA between good and poor readers being due to the existence of more crossing fibers or smaller diameter axons in the poor readers in the area, and argues against the proposition that the changes in FA resulting from remediation were due to changes in either of these microstructural features, both of which would be expected to affect axial diffusivity. This leaves increased myelination as a plausible mechanism of the microstructural change. The findings of increased reading ability and increased FA strongly suggest that the remedial instruction brought about a change in both variables, but say little about the relation between the two variables. To investigate this relation in more detail and to assess which aspects of reading ability were associated with increased FA, an exploratory stepwise hierarchical multiple regression analysis examined how well the change in raw reading scores of an individual poor reader could account for that individual's change in FA in the region. This analysis (which also took the change in age between scans into account) indicated that a model including the change in raw scores on two subtests from the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE, Torgesen et al., 1999Torgesen J.K. Wagner R.K. Rashotte C.A. Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE). Pro-ed, Austin, TX1999Google Scholar) provided the best fit to the change in FA data among poor readers (R2 = 0.10, F2, 43 = 2.36, p = 0.11). The change in Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (PDE, a measure of non-word reading fluency similar to the WRMT-R WA subtest) was positively associated with change in FA (partial r = 0.23, p = 0.06). In contrast, the change in the Sight-Word Efficiency (SWE, a measure of real word reading fluency similar to the WRMT-R Word ID subtest) showed a negative partial correlation with change in FA (pr = −0.21). No other variables met the criteria for entry into the model. An identical analysis conducted with radial diffusivity in the region as the dependent measure also showed that these same two measures provided the best fit to the data (R2 = 0.13, F2, 43 = 3.41, p < 0.05) with change in PDE significantly negatively associated with change in radial diffusivity (pr = −0.23, p < 0.05) and change in SWE positively associated with the change (pr = 0.29). In contrast, for axial diffusivity, an identical stepwise regression analysis indicated that no change in any of the raw ability measures explained enough variance for entry into the model (p's > 0.15). The outcome of these analyses indicate that there is a coupling between the behavioral change in reading and the anatomical change measured by FA and radial diffusivity, and indicates that increased phonological decoding ability provides the best predictor of increased FA and decreased radial diffusivity. These results and conclusions are further supported by additional analyses (described in the Supplemental Results and Discussion) of the relationships between individual differences in various reading abilities and various diffusion tensor measures in the entire sample of good and poor readers, (using reading and diffusion measures obtained prior to the remediation), in the cluster that eventually showed an increase in FA among the remediated poor readers. Multiple regression analyses indicated that individual differences in phonological decoding ability (as measured by WRMT-R WA scores) were strongly positively related to FA (see Figure S3), strongly negatively related to radial diffusivity, and only weakly negatively related to axial diffusivity at the time of the preremediation scan (see Figure S4). These findings suggest that radial diffusivity drives the positive relationship between FA and individual differences in reading ability measured at the initial scan. In addition, both FA and radial diffusivity were more strongly related to Word Attack scores than to Word ID scores, suggesting that connections passing through the cluster area may be more important for phonological processing than for direct access to meaning via a direct orthographic route (see Supplemental Results and Discussion). To determine the orientation of the tracts showing the remediation-related change and to identify the cortical areas that they likely connect, fiber tractography was carried out on group-averaged diffusion tensor data, using as a seed region the cluster of voxels showing a reliable group by time interaction. These group-averaged tracts were remarkably similar in their gross morphology between the good and poor readers and also across the two scanning sessions, as shown in Figure 3A, indicating the reliability of the data and the tracking methods. The principal direction of diffusion in the region showing a group difference in FA at the preremediation scan remained the same at the follow-up scan, and the fibers identified as passing through the regions were remarkably consistent between the two scans for both groups of subjects, suggesting that microstructural changes in the white matter within the region, rather than changes in the orientation of fibers, are responsible for the remediation effect and for the relationship of reading ability to the diffusion measures. The principal diffusion direction was anterior-posterior in all groups, and fibers passing through this region extended anteriorly and medially to terminate in a medial region of the superior frontal gyrus (Figure 3B) and extended posteriorly and superiorly to terminate in the left paracentral lobule (Figure 3C). To check for consistency with previous DTI studies of white matter abnormalities among poorer readers in a left temporo-parietal region (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu C. Plewes C. Paulson L.A. Roy D.

Although there were no statistically reliable effects in the voxel-wise analyses, the FA was reliably lower among poor readers at the initial scan when the average FA across the entire region of interest was examined and the specific analysis was closely matched to those previous studies. A review of diffusion studies of this region (Ben-Shachar et al., 2007Ben-Shachar M. Dougherty R.F. Wandell B.A. White matter pathways in reading.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) suggests that the reduced FA among poorer readers is probably due to increased fiber crossings, and if this is indeed case, then intensive reading remediation would not be expected to change the coherence or the orientation of the fibers. Consistent with this expectation, there was no remediation effect in the region (see Supplementary Results and Discussion). The finding of longitudinally measured, experimentally mediated changes in the structural properties of left hemisphere white matter in children with reading problems reveals the considerable potential of behavioral remediation and rehabilitation programs, and furthers the understanding of reading disability and brain plasticity. The most important finding is clearly that both reading ability and the structural integrity of left hemisphere white matter can be increased by extensive practice in word decoding skills. This finding suggests that whatever the cause of abnormally low FA among poor readers may be, the abnormality is amenable to behavioral treatment when provided within an age window in which maturation, experience, and development are still capable of influencing FA. The precise microstructural properties underlying both the initial group differences in FA and radial diffusivity and the remediation-related changes in these measures may"

Here we demonstrate that the histone methyltransferase complex GLP/G9a controls cognition and adaptive responses in a region-specific fashion in the adult brain.

This transcriptional alteration is associated with complex behavioral abnormalities, including defects in learning, motivation, and environmental adaptation. The behavioral changes triggered by GLP/G9a deficiency are similar to key symptoms of the human 9q34 mental retardation syndrome that is associated with structural alterations of the GLP/EHMT1 gene.

A possible clue to the genetic mechanisms underlying cognition and environmental adaptation could be obtained through identification of genes responsible for mental retardation disorders. Recent studies show that many of the proteins associated with mental retardation syndromes in mice and humans are involved in epigenetic control of gene expression (Chelly et al., 2006Chelly J.

It has been found that altered expression of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases as well as of proteins involved in histone or DNA methylation are associated with mental retardation syndromes (Kramer and van Bokhoven, 2009Kramer J.M. van Bokhoven H. Genetic and epigenetic defects in mental retardation.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These epigenetic regulators govern expression of large numbers of potentially unrelated genes. Yet, despite differences in specific functions of the distinct epigenetic regulators and their targets, impairment of chromatin function leads to symptomatically similar mental retardation syndromes (Chelly et al., 2006Chelly J.

Genetic and epigenetic defects in mental retardation.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that mental retardation is triggered not by changes in specific target gene(s) but by the inability of neurons to respond adequately to environmental signals under conditions of greatly distorted transcriptional homeostasis (Ramocki and Zoghbi, 2008Ramocki M.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Failure of neuronal homeostasis results in common neuropsychiatric phenotypes.Nature. 2008; 455: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Transcriptional homeostasis relies largely on the balance between positive and negative regulation of gene transcription. In mammals, di- or trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) is commonly associated with gene silencing in eu- or heterochromatin, respectively (Jenuwein and Allis, 2001Jenuwein T.

This finding raises a question about the potential ability of the GLP/G9a complex to function as a master regulator of lineage-specific gene expression in the brain. In support of this model, we show that postnatal neuron-specific ablation of the histone methyltransferases GLP/G9a leads to derepression of nonneuronal and early neuron progenitor genes in various brain areas. We also demonstrate that these changes in gene expression are associated with cognitive and behavioral defects in adult mice. The impaired brain function manifests itself either by a mental retardation-like syndrome in mice with forebrain-specific ablation of GLP/G9a or by more selective behavioral defects that follow GLP/G9a deficiency in specialized neuronal subpopulations. Collectively, our findings have revealed GLP/G9a as a key regulator of cognition, motivation, and adaptive behavior in adult mice. To address the role of GLP and G9a in adult brain function, we employed conditional GLP and G9a gene inactivation in postnatal mouse neurons. Gene exons encoding the SET-domain of GLP (Figure 1A) or G9a (Sampath et al., 2007Sampath S.C. Marazzi I. Yap K.L. Sampath S.C. Krutchinsky A.N. Mecklenbräuker I. Viale A. Rudensky E. Zhou M.M.

The SET-domain is essential for the histone lysine methyltransferase activity of GLP and G9a (Tachibana et al., 2002Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y.

The functional inactivation of GLP and G9a genes in postnatal neurons was accomplished by using Cre recombinase driven by the Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha gene promoter (Camk2a-Cre). This promoter is specifically active in postnatal forebrain neurons and Camk2a-Cre mice have been successfully employed for conditional modification of numerous genes in the forebrain (Casanova et al., 2001Casanova E. Fehsenfeld S. Mantamadiotis T. Lemberger T. Greiner E. Stewart A.F. Schütz G.

Generation of a conditional allele of the CBP gene in mouse.Genesis. 2004; 40: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to Camk2a-Cre mice, we also used Cre-expressing mice that enable conditional ablation of GLP or G9a specifically in dopamine 2 receptor (Drd2) or dopamine 1 receptor (Drd1) expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum (Gong et al., 2007Gong S. Doughty M. Harbaugh C.R. Cummins A. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Gerfen C.R. Targeting Cre recombinase to specific neuron populations with bacterial artificial chromosome constructs.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9817-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues from Camk2a-Cre; GLPfl/fl mice showed GLP deficiency in neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and hypothalamus (Figure 1B). Postnatal, forebrain-specific deficiency of GLP led to drastic reduction in neuronal euchromatic H3K9me2 levels (Figures 1C and S1). Similar changes in euchromatic H3K9me2 levels occurred in neurons of Camk2a-Cre mice homozygous for the mutant G9a allele (Camk2a-Cre; G9afl/fl) (Figure 1C), confirming the previously reported essential role of the GLP/G9a complex in euchromatic H3K9me2 (Peters et al., 2003Peters A.H.

Conditional inactivation of GLP or G9a in striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, or cortex led to upregulation of a large number of genes (Figure 2A, Tables S1–S9). Comparison of gene expression within the functionally distinct, GLP- or G9a-deficient brain regions, as well as the cross-area comparison, revealed about 60 genes that collectively comprise a genetic “signature” of GLP or G9a deficiency in the adult forebrain (Figures 2B–2D). In addition to the commonly expressed genes, each of the individual G9a- or GLP-deficient brain areas shows upregulation of additional neuronal genes depending on the specific brain region (Tables S2–S9). Combined GLP and G9a deficiencies (Camk2a-Cre; GLPfl/fl; G9afl/fl) had no additional impact on gene expression changes as compared to mice with a single methyltransferase deficiency (data not shown). The vast majority of the “signature” genes encode for proteins that are normally not expressed in adult neurons (Figures 2C and 2D). A significant fraction of these genes is involved in development and function of the skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, hematological, and immune systems (Figures 2C and 2D). The degree of GLP and G9a impact on repression of nonneuronal genes is highlighted by neuronal expression of Afamin (Afm) or α-fetoprotein (Afp) in the striatum and cortex of GPL- or G9a-deficient mice (Tables S1, S4, S5, S8, and S9). Afamin and α-fetoprotein belong to the family of serum albumins and are highly expressed in the embryonic liver but are transcriptionally silenced in mature neurons (Lichenstein et al., 1994Lichenstein H.S. Lyons D.E. Wurfel M.M. Johnson D.A. McGinley M.D. Leidli J.C. Trollinger D.B. Mayer J.P. Wright S.D. Zukowski M.M.

Biol. 2005; 25: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to suppression of genes of nonneuronal lineage, GLP and G9a appear to control development-stage-dependent neuronal gene expression. In particular, deficiency in GLP or G9a in adult neurons reactivates expression of the transcriptional regulator Dach2 (Tables S1–S11), which is expressed during embryonic brain, eye, and limb development (Davis et al., 2001Davis R.J. Shen W. Sandler Y.I. Heanue T.A. Mardon G. Characterization of mouse Dach2, a homologue of Drosophila dachshund.Mech. Dev. 2001; 102: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Upregulation of Dach2 is particularly interesting in view of the human DACH2 gene localization on the X chromosome in a region that is affected in a number of human mental retardation syndromes (Davis et al., 2001Davis R.J.

The neuron-specificity of the observed gene expression changes was validated by using the bacTRAP approach (Doyle et al., 2008Doyle J.P. Dougherty J.D. Heiman M. Schmidt E.F. Stevens T.R. Ma G.

Expression of an eGFP-tagged ribosomal protein selectively in Drd1 or Drd2 MSNs (Drd1-Cre; Drd1-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl or Drd2-Cre; Drd2-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl) allows Drd1 or Drd2 cell-type-specific polyribosome associated mRNA purification. Comparative analysis of polyribosome associated mRNA of G9a-deficient and wild-type Drd1 or Drd2 MSNs showed that G9a deficiency in Drd1 or Drd2 MSNs leads to neuron-intrinsic expression of most of the previously identified nonneuronal/neuron-progenitor genes, including Afm, Afp, Anxa10, Bank1, Ces7, Corin, Dach2, Defb1, Expi, Gbe1, Gkn1, Lama2, Lamb3, Musk, Myh1, Nxf3, Olfm4, Serpinb1b, Serpinb5, Ttn, and Tnnt2 (Tables S1, S10, and S11). This result indicates that the derepression of nonneuronal genes in GLP- or G9a-deficient postnatal neurons is likely to be neuron intrinsic. Deficiency in GLP or G9a and ensuing changes in gene expression had no apparent impact on the structural organization of the affected brain areas (Figure 3A). Moreover, the specific neuronal cell architecture in the striatum and the hippocampus was not altered by forebrain-specific postnatal GLP or G9a deficiency (Figures 3B–3E). Similarly, the lack of GLP/G9a had no major impact on regulation of neuronal morphology and basal electrophysiological features of Drd2-expressing MSNs in the striatum of Drd2-Cre; G9afl/fl mice (Figure 4). Preservation of neuronal cell survival, morphology, and cell-type-specific electrophysiological features in GLP- or G9a-deficient neurons rules out an essential role of GLP/G9a and H3K9me2 in regulation of vital cellular processes. Similar conclusions have been achieved by studies that evaluated the impact of G9a deficiency on fibroblasts, peripheral lymphocytes, and cardiomyocytes (Sampath et al., 2007Sampath S.C. Marazzi I.

https://openalex.org/W1981117587,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies suggest that the effect of apoE on amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation plays a major role in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, understanding proteins that control apoE metabolism may provide new targets for regulating A beta levels. LDLR, a member of the LDL receptor family, binds to apoE, yet its potential role in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. We hypothesized that LDLR overexpression in the brain would decrease apoE levels, enhance A beta clearance, and decrease A beta deposition. To test our hypothesis, we created several transgenic mice that overexpress LDLR in the brain and found that apoE levels in these mice decreased by 50%-90%. Furthermore, LDLR overexpression dramatically reduced A beta aggregation and enhanced A beta clearance from the brain extracellular space. Plaque-associated neuroinflammatory responses were attenuated in LDLR transgenic mice. These findings suggest that increasing LDLR levels may represent a novel AD treatment strategy."

The underlying molecular mechanism of the isoflurane-induced apoptosis is largely unknown. We, therefore, set out to assess whether isoflurane can induce apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2 family proteins, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and activating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. We performed these studies in cultured cells, primary neurons, and mice. Here we show for the first time that treatment with 2% isoflurane for 6 h can increase pro-apoptotic factor Bax levels, decrease anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 levels, increase ROS accumulation, facilitate cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, induce activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and finally cause apoptosis as compared with the control condition. We have further found that isoflurane can increase the mRNA levels of Bax and reduce the mRNA levels of Bcl-2. The isoflurane-induced ROS accumulation can be attenuated by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA. Finally, the anesthetic desflurane does not induce activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. These results suggest that isoflurane may induce apoptosis through Bcl-2 family proteins- and ROS-associated mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

Apoptosis is a programmed cell death which can be triggered by environmental and/or developmentally associated signals (14Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12780) Google Scholar). The central components of the apoptosis process are a group of proteolytic enzymes called caspases, which can be activated by various types of stimulation (15Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6140) Google Scholar). The extrinsic, death receptor pathway involves activation of caspase-8, which then cleaves caspase-3, leading to apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 16Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). The intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway is regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins, including the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bax (for review, see Ref. 17Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3308) Google Scholar) and involves cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol. The released cytochrome c then activates caspase-9, which consequently induces caspase-3 activation, leading to apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 16Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). The other signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis are the caspase-2-dependent pathway and the caspase-independent pathway (for review, see Ref. 16Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that isoflurane may induce apoptosis by elevating cytosolic calcium levels (Refs. 13Wei H. Liang G. Yang H. Wang Q. Hawkins B. Madesh M. Wang S. Eckenhoff R.G. Anesthesiology. 2008; 108: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and 18Zhang G. Dong Y. Zhang B. Ichinose F. Wu X. Culley D.J. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E. Xie Z. J.

However, the subsequent targets, e.g. signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis, after the isoflurane-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium levels, are unknown. Finally, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been suggested to be associated with mitochondrial damage, leading to apoptosis (Ref. 20Tian C. Murrin L.C. Zheng J.C. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 21Szeto H.H. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1147: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present studies we set out to determine the effects of isoflurane on protein and mRNA levels of Bax and Bcl-2, mitochondria-associated ROS accumulation, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3, and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. We also assessed the effects of desflurane, another commonly used inhalation anesthetic, on the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. We performed these studies in human neuroglioma cells stably transfected with human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (H4-APP cells) because we have shown that isoflurane can induce apoptosis in the H4-APP cells. We also performed the studies in the primary neurons from naïve mice, the non-tumor cells without overexpression of human APP, and in naïve mice. We employed H4 human neuroglioma cells, stably transfected to express full-length APP (H4-APP cells) in the experiments. The cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing 9% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine and was supplemented with 220 μg/ml G418. The protocol was approved by Massachusetts General Hospital Standing Committee on Animals (Boston) on the Use of Animals in Research and Teaching. Naïve (C57BL/6J) mice with the gestation stage of day 15 were euthanized with carbon dioxide. We then performed a cesarean section to pull out the embryos and decapitate them in a 100-mm dish of phosphate-buffered saline. We placed the head on the top of a 100-mm dish and dissected out the cortices, removed meninges, and placed the neurons into another 100-mm dish of phosphate-buffered saline. The neurons were dissociated by trypsinization and trituration. The dissociated neurons were resuspended in serum-free B27/neurobasal medium and were placed into 6-well plates with a confluent rate of 50%. 7–10 days after the harvest, the neurons were exposed to the isoflurane treatment. Isoflurane or desflurane was delivered from an anesthesia machine to a sealed plastic box in a 37 °C incubator containing 6-well plates seeded with 1 million cells or 0.25 million neurons in 1.5 ml of cell or neuron culture media. A Datex infrared gas analyzer (Puritan-Bennett, Tewksbury, MA) was used to continuously monitor the delivered concentrations of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and isoflurane or desflurane. The H4-APP cells and primary neurons were treated for 6 h with 2% isoflurane or 12% desflurane plus 21% oxygen, and 5% carbon dioxide as described by Xie et al. (7Xie Z. Dong Y. Maeda U. Alfille P.

Staurosporine (STS, 100 μm) was used as a positive control in the experiment of cytochrome c immunocytochemistry studies. In the interaction studies, 10 μm intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA was administrated to the cells 1 h before the isoflurane treatment. H4-APP cells or primary neuron pellets were detergent-extracted on ice using an immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) plus protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were collected, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and quantified for total proteins by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Cytochrome c levels in the cytosol were detected by a mitochondrial isolation kit for cultured cells (Pierce), which can isolate mitochondria from cytosol and allow us to detect cytochrome c levels in cytosol. Specifically, the harvested cells were placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and each of the tubes was centrifuged at 850 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was removed and discarded from each of the tubes. Then we added 400 μl of the mitochondrial isolation reagent A into each of the tubes. After 5 s of vortex, each of the tubes was incubated on ice for 2 min. Then we added 5 μl of the mitochondrial isolation reagent B into each of the tubes, and each tube was then put in a vortex at maximum speed for 5 s. We then incubated each of the tubes on ice for 5 min before adding 400 μl of the mitochondrial isolation reagent C into each of the tubes, and tubes were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Then we transferred the supernatant to a new 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged each of these tubes at 3000 × g for 15 min. Finally, we collected the supernatant, which contained the cytosol fraction, and the pellet, which contained the isolated mitochondria. We used a Spin-X UF 500 concentrator (Corning, Lowell, MA), which enhanced the concentration of cytochrome c in cytosol for Western blot analysis. The mice anesthesia was similar to that described by Xie et al. (10Xie Z. Culley D.J. Dong Y. Zhang G. Zhang B. Moir R.D. Frosch M.P. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E. Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The animal protocol was approved by Massachusetts General Hospital Standing Committee on Animals on the Use of Animals in Research and Teaching. C57/BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were randomly assigned to either an anesthesia or a control group. Mice randomized to the anesthesia group received 1.4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen for 2 h in an anesthetizing chamber, whereas the control group received 100% oxygen at an identical flow rate for 2 h in an identical chamber. The mice breathed spontaneously, and the concentration of anesthetics, oxygen, and carbon dioxide was measured continuously (Datex, Tewksbury, MA). The temperature of the anesthetizing chamber was controlled to maintain rectal temperature of the animals at 37 ± 0.5 °C. Mean arterial blood pressure was measured non-invasively using two tail cuffs (Kent Scientific Corp., Torrington, CT) in the anesthetized mice. The isoflurane anesthesia did not significantly affect blood pressure and blood gas of the mice (10Xie Z. Culley D.J. Dong Y. Zhang G. Zhang B. Moir R.D. Frosch M.P. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E. Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Anesthesia was terminated by discontinuing isoflurane and placing animals in a chamber containing 100% oxygen until 20 min after return of the righting reflex. They were then returned to individual home cages until sacrifice. Mice were sacrificed by decapitation 6 h after isoflurane anesthesia. The brain was removed rapidly, and the prefrontal cortex was dissected out and frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent processing for determinations of Bcl-2 protein levels. The harvested brain tissues were homogenized on ice using an immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) plus protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were collected, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and quantified for total proteins by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). The harvested H4-APP cells, primary neurons, and brain tissues were subjected to Western blot analyses as described by Xie et al. (23Xie Z. Romano D.M. Tanzi R.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 67-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bax antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Beverly, MA) was used to recognize Bax (20 kDa). Bcl-2 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) was used to recognize Bcl-2 (28 kDa). Rabbit polyclonal cytochrome c antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) was used to recognize cytochrome c (14 kDa). Rabbit polyclonal caspase-9 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) was used to recognize two caspase-9 fragments (17 and 37 kDa). Rabbit polyclonal cleaved caspase-8 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) was used to recognize two caspase-8 fragments (18 and 41 kDa). A caspase-3 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) was used to recognize full-length caspase-3 (35–40 kDa) and caspase-3 fragment (17–20 kDa) resulting from cleavage at aspartate position 175. Antibody anti-β-actin (1:10,000, Sigma) was used to detect β-actin (42 kDa). Each band in the Western blot represents an independent experiment. We have averaged results from three to eight independent experiments. The quantification of Western blots was performed as described by Xie et al. (7Xie Z. Dong Y. Maeda U. Alfille P. Culley D.J. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E. Anesthesiology. 2006; 104: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, the intensity of signals was analyzed by using the National Institutes of Health image program (National Institutes of Health Image 1.62, Bethesda, MD). We quantified the Western blots using two steps. First, we used levels of β-actin to normalize (e.g. determining ratio of full-length caspase-3 amount to β-actin amount) levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 to control for any loading differences in total protein amounts. Second, we presented changes in levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 in treated cells or mice as percentages of those in cells or mice with the control condition. Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR was carried out using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels were determined and standardized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control. Primers of mouse Bax (QT00102536), Bcl-2 (QT00156282), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (QT01658692) were purchased from Qiagen. Organelle LightsTM intracellular-targeted fluorescent proteins (Invitrogen) was used in the experiments according to the protocol provided by the company. Briefly, 1 million H4-APP cells were placed in a 100-mm dish. We added the diluted Organelle LightsTM transduction solution (Component A) to the plate and incubated the cells at 25 °C in the dark for 2 h with gentle rocking. Next, we aspirated the Organelle LightsTM transduction solution, added the enhancer (Component B), and incubated the cells for another 2 h in 37 °C. We finally removed the enhancer, added the culture medium, and incubated cells at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were then used for isoflurane treatment, mitochondrial immunocytochemistry staining with fluorescence microscopy (100×), and ROS accumulation staining (see below). OxiSelectTM ROS assay kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc. San Diego, CA) was used in the experiments according to the protocol provided by the company. Briefly, cultured H4-APP cells were placed in a clear 96-well cell culture plate overnight in the incubator. We then added the 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate/media solution to the cells. The 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate-loaded H4-APP cells were then exposed to 2% isoflurane for 6 h. Finally the treated cells were analyzed by using the fluorescence microscopy (100×) to detect the ROS images. Parts of the treated cells were lysed by adding 100 μl of cell lysis buffer and were mixed thoroughly and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. We then transferred 150 μl of the mixture to each well of a 96-well plate that is suitable for fluorescence measurement. Finally, we read the fluorescence with a fluorometric plate reader at 480/530 nm. ApoTrackTM cytochrome c Apoptosis ICC Antibody kit (Mitosciences, Eugene, OR) was used in the experiments according to the protocol provided by the company. Specifically, H4-APP cells were placed on coverslips overnight in the incubator. At the end of the isoflurane treatment, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then placed in the antigen retrieval buffer and were heated to 95 °C for 10 min. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, the coverslips were then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 10 min. We blocked the nonspecific reaction with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. We incubated the cells on the coverslips with anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1:200, Mitosciences) and anti-complex Vα monoclonal antibody (for mitochondrial staining, 1:200, Mitosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Then the cells on coverslips were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature away from light. Finally, the coverslips were incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in a humidified dark chamber for 10 min, and were analyzed in mounting medium under a 100× objective lens fluorescence microscope. Tetramethyl-rhodamine red kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used for TUNEL staining. Specifically, cells or neurons were grown on coverslips overnight in the incubator. The cells or neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min after the isoflurane treatment or control condition. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were incubated with a permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) at 4 °C for 10 min. The coverslips were incubated with a TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified dark chamber. The negative control was prepared by incubating the coverslips in label solution only. The coverslips for the positive controls were incubated with DNase I recombinant. Finally, the coverslips were incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in a humidified dark chamber for 10 min. Samples were then analyzed in mounting medium under a fluorescence microscope. The TUNEL-positive cells were counted manually in five randomly selected areas under a 20× objective microscope lens by an investigator who was blinded to the experiments. The TUNEL-positive cells were expressed as the fold of the number of nuclei. One-fold of TUNEL-positive cells in the figure refers to the control levels for the purposes of comparison to experimental conditions. Given the presence of background caspase activation and apoptosis in the cells and neurons, we did not use absolute values to describe changes in caspase activation and apoptosis. Instead, apoptosis and caspase activation were presented as a percentage or fold of those of the control group. 100% caspase activation or 1-fold apoptosis refers to control levels for purposes of comparison to experimental conditions. We presented changes in levels of Bax, Bcl-2, ROS, cytochrome c, caspase activation, and apoptosis in treated cells, neurons, or mice as a percentage or fold of those in cells, neurons, or mice after the control condition. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. The number of samples varied from 3 to 8, and the samples were normally distributed. Analysis of variance with repeated measurements or t tests was used to compare the difference from the control group. p values less than 0.05 (* or #) and 0.01 (**) were considered statistically significant. The significance testing was two-tailed, and we have used SAS software (Cary, NC) to analysis the data. The common inhalation anesthetic isoflurane has been shown to induce caspase activation and apoptosis (7Xie Z. Dong Y. Maeda U. Alfille P. Culley D.J. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E.

Anesthesiology. 2001; 95: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying these effects, however, is largely unknown. Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g. pro-apoptotic factor Bax and anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2), ROS accumulation, and the mitochondrial pathway are all involved in apoptosis (for review, see Refs. 16Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar, 17Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev.

Therefore, we set out to determine the effects of isoflurane on levels of Bax, Bcl-2, and ROS, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and apoptosis in H4-APP cells, primary neurons from naïve mice, and brain tissues of naïve mice. We employed H4-APP cells in the current experiments because we have established the isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the cells. The cells were harvested at the end of the isoflurane treatment and were subjected to Western blot by which Bax antibody was used to detect levels of Bax (20 kDa). Bax immunoblotting showed visible increases in the levels of Bax after the isoflurane treatment as compared with the control condition (Fig. 1A). The quantification of the Western blot revealed that the isoflurane treatment increased the levels of Bax: 100 versus 146%, p = 0.04 (Fig. 1B). Then, we assessed the effects of isoflurane on Bax levels in the primary neurons from naïve mice. Bax immunoblotting showed visible increases in the levels of Bax after the isoflurane treatment as compared with the control condition in the neurons (Fig. 1C). The quantification of the Western blot revealed that the isoflurane treatment increased the levels of Bax: 100 versus 170%, p = 0.008 (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, we were able to show that the isoflurane treatment increased the mRNA levels of Bax as compared with the control condition (Fig. 1E, p = 0.02) in the primary neurons from naïve mice. These results suggest that isoflurane may increase the Bax protein levels via enhancing the generation of Bax. Next, Bcl-2 immunoblotting showed visible decreases in the levels of Bcl-2 after the isoflurane treatment as compared with the control condition (Fig. 2A) in H4-APP cells. The quantification of the Western blot showed that the isoflurane treatment decreased the levels of Bcl-2: 100 versus 57%, p = 0.017 (Fig. 2B). The isoflurane treatment also decreased the Bcl-2 levels in the primary neurons from naïve mice: 100 versus 61%, p = 0.027 (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, the isoflurane treatment decreased the mRNA levels of Bcl-2 in the primary neurons from naïve mice (Fig. 2E, p = 0.049). These results suggest that isoflurane may decrease the Bcl-2 protein levels via reducing the generation of Bcl-2. To determine the in vivo relevance of these in vitro findings, we also assessed the effects of isoflurane on Bcl-2 levels in brain tissues of naïve mice. Naïve mice were subjected to anesthesia with 1.4% isoflurane for 2 h as described before (10Xie Z. Culley D.J. Dong Y. Zhang G. Zhang B. Moir R.D. Frosch M.P. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E. Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Quantitative Western blot revealed that anesthesia with 1.4% isoflurane for 2 h led to decreases in Bcl-2 levels in vivo (Fig. 2, F and G, 100 versus 63%, p = 0.004). Because Bax and Bcl-2 have been suggested to be associated with mitochondrial damage (Refs. 26Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Next, we assessed the effects of isoflurane on ROS levels in H4-APP cells. The H4-APP cells were treated with 2% isoflurane for 6 h, and the cel"

This is seen following focal binocular lesions, which induce rapid changes in receptive field size and position. To follow the dynamics of the circuitry underlying these changes, we imaged the intrinsic long-range horizontal connections within the lesion projection zone (LPZ) in adult macaque primary visual cortex. To image the same axons over time, we combined viral vector-mediated EGFP transfer and two-photon microscopy. The lesion triggered, within the first week, an approximately 2-fold outgrowth of axons toward the center of the LPZ. Over the subsequent month, axonal density declined due to a parallel process of pruning and sprouting but maintained a net increase relative to prelesion levels. The rate of turnover of axonal boutons also increased. The axonal restructuring recapitulates the pattern of exuberance and pruning seen in early development and correlates well with the functional changes following retinal lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2138050265,"Promises are one of the oldest human-specific psychological mechanisms fostering cooperation and trust. Here, we study the neural underpinnings of promise keeping and promise breaking. Subjects first make a promise decision (promise stage), then they anticipate whether the promise affects the interaction partner's decision (anticipation stage) and are subsequently free to keep or break the promise (decision stage). Findings revealed that the breaking of the promise is associated with increased activation in the DLPFC, ACC, and amygdala, suggesting that the dishonest act involves an emotional conflict due to the suppression of the honest response. Moreover, the breach of the promise can be predicted by a perfidious brain activity pattern (anterior insula, ACC, inferior frontal gyrus) during the promise and anticipation stage, indicating that brain measurements may reveal malevolent intentions before dishonest or deceitful acts are actually committed."
https://openalex.org/W2153498428,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small, non-coding RNAs that modulate mRNA stability and post-transcriptional translation. A growing body of evidence indicates that specific miRNAs can affect the cellular function of cardiomyocytes. In the present study, miRNAs that are highly expressed in the heart were overexpressed in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, and cellular ATP levels were assessed. As a result, miR-15b, -16, -195, and -424, which have the same seed sequence, the most critical determinant of miRNA targeting, decreased cellular ATP levels. These results suggest that these miRNAs could specifically down-regulate the same target genes and consequently decrease cellular ATP levels. Through a bioinformatics approach, ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (Arl2) was identified as a potential target of miR-15b. It has already been shown that Arl2 localizes to adenine nucleotide transporter 1, the exchanger of ADP/ATP in mitochondria. Overexpression of miR-15b, -16, -195, and -424 suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter construct fused with the 3′-untranslated region of Arl2. In addition, miR-15b overexpression decreased Arl2 mRNA and protein expression levels. The effects of Arl2 siRNA on cellular ATP levels were the same as those of miR-15b, and the expression of Arl2 could restore ATP levels reduced by miR-15b. A loss-of-function study of miR-15b resulted in increased Arl2 protein and cellular ATP levels. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that mitochondria became degenerated in cardiomyocytes that had been transduced with miR-15b and Arl2 siRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2013478045,"Synaptic transmission requires the localization of presynaptic release machinery to active zones. Mechanisms regulating the abundance of such synaptic proteins at individual release sites are likely determinants of site-specific synaptic efficacy. We now identify a role for the small GTPase Rab3 in regulating the distribution of presynaptic components to active zones. At Drosophila rab3 mutant NMJs, the presynaptic protein Bruchpilot, calcium channels, and electron-dense T bars are concentrated at a fraction of available active zones, leaving the majority of sites devoid of these key presynaptic release components. Late addition of Rab3 to mutant NMJs rapidly reverses this phenotype by recruiting Brp to sites previously lacking the protein, demonstrating that Rab3 can dynamically control the composition of the presynaptic release machinery. While previous studies of Rab3 have focused on its role in the synaptic vesicle cycle, these findings demonstrate an additional and unexpected function for Rab3 in the localization of presynaptic proteins to active zones."
https://openalex.org/W2003659122,"Ferritins are important iron storage and detoxification proteins that are widely distributed in living kingdoms. Because plant ferritin possesses both a ferroxidase site and a ferrihydrite nucleation site, it is a suitable model for studying the mechanism of iron storage in ferritin. This article presents for the first time the crystal structure of a plant ferritin from soybean at 1.8-Å resolution. The soybean ferritin 4 (SFER4) had a high structural similarity to vertebrate ferritin, except for the N-terminal extension region, the C-terminal short helix E, and the end of the BC-loop. Similar to the crystal structures of other ferritins, metal binding sites were observed in the iron entry channel, ferroxidase center, and nucleation site of SFER4. In addition to these conventional sites, a novel metal binding site was discovered intermediate between the iron entry channel and the ferroxidase site. This site was coordinated by the acidic side chain of Glu173 and carbonyl oxygen of Thr168, which correspond, respectively, to Glu140 and Thr135 of human H chain ferritin according to their sequences. A comparison of the ferroxidase activities of the native and the E173A mutant of SFER4 clearly showed a delay in the iron oxidation rate of the mutant. This indicated that the glutamate residue functions as a transit site of iron from the 3-fold entry channel to the ferroxidase site, which may be universal among ferritins.

Ferritin is a class of iron storage proteins distributed ubiquitously in plants, mammals, and bacteria. This protein class plays an important role in storage and detoxification of excess iron in a living cell. Although the primary sequences of ferritins vary, their three-dimensional structures of 24 structurally equivalent subunits assembled into a cage-like oligomer and related by 4-, 3-, and 2-fold symmetry axes (1Harrison P.M.

Each subunit has four helices (A-D), each of which is composed of ∼30 amino acid residues, along with a fifth short helix (E) having 10 residues or more, resulting in the formation of a “four-helix bundle.” In general, the outer shell diameters of the spherical oligomeric ferritin composed of 24 subunits are ∼120 Å, whereas the inner cavity diameters are ∼80 Å. Up to 4500 iron atoms are deposited in the inner cavity of ferritin (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar, 2Theil E.C.

These exhibit some common aspects related to the iron storage mechanism: (i) they exist around the 3-fold symmetry channel, (ii) constitute a ferroxidase center in the four-helix bundle, and (iii) constitute a nucleation site facing the inner cavity of ferritin (4Lawson D.M.

On the other hand, the L-type ferritin lacks the ferroxidase center, but possesses the nucleation site.

In contrast to the case of the H and L chains of mammalian ferritin, all of the identified plant ferritin subunits have similar primary sequences, especially in their deduced ferroxidase center and nucleation site. Although the primary structures of plant ferritins are basically well conserved with those of mammalian ferritins (Fig. 1), plant ferritins show two further differences: first, plant ferritin possesses the N-terminal extension regions, which can be divided into two parts based on their functions (37Briat J.F. Labouré A.M. Laulhère J.P. Lescure A.M. Lobréaux S. Pesey H. Proudhon D. Wuytswinkel O. Abadía J. Iron Nutrition in Soils and Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 265-276Google Scholar). The upstream one is called a “transit peptide” responsible for transportation of the polypeptide chain to plastid, whereas the downstream one is called an “extension peptide” (EP) with an unknown function (38Ragland M. Briat J.F. Gagnon J. Laulhere J.P. Massenet O. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18339-18344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that EP helps to stabilize the oligomeric protein shell (39Laulhere J.P. Laboure A.M. Briat J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3629-3635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40van Wuytswinkel O. Savino G. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 41van Wuytswinkel O. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Second, plant ferritins can incorporate and store iron without the differentiation of subunits. As mentioned above, all plant ferritins possess both a ferroxidase center and a nucleation site. These observations led us to hypothesize that a crystallographic analysis of plant ferritin would offer new insight into the pathway of metal ion transfer from the iron entry channel via the ferroxidase center to the nucleation site and inner cavity of the ferritin shell. With respect to the three-dimensional structures of plant ferritin, Lobréaux et al. (42Lobreaux S. Yewdall S.J. Briat J.F. Harrison P.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) presented the deduced structure of ferritin from pea (Pisum sativum) using a computer simulation. They predicted that the main chain structure of plant ferritin can be superimposed onto human H chain ferritin up to 1 Å of the root mean square distance (42Lobreaux S. Yewdall S.J. Briat J.F. Harrison P.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be considered that its overall structure, including structure of the 3-fold symmetry channel, ferroxidase center, and nucleation site, is highly conserved. However, the actual metal binding sites and precise orientation of side chains of metal ligands have remained unclear. On the other hand, we have attempted to crystallize plant ferritin from soybean (SFER1) to obtain the real structure of these active sites; however, the diffraction data from the crystal were not sufficient to provide high resolution structural analysis (43Masuda T. Mikami B. Goto F. Yoshihara T. Utsumi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1645: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, to address the question of the metal ion pathway in the ferritin oligomer, we have crystallized a recombinant plant ferritin subunit from soybean (SFER4). The high resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis of this soybean ferritin subunit has revealed a novel metal binding site between the 3-fold symmetry channel and ferroxidase center. The deletion of this site resulted in a delay of the iron oxidation/nucleation process, suggesting that this site functions as a transit site for metal translocation in ferritin. Based on these results, coupled with the extremely high conservation of this site, we propose that this site is part of the metal ion pathway widely distributed in ferritin from various species. Cloning of the soybean ferritin SFER4 cDNA (GenBankTM number AB062756) was performed as described previously (44Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T. Ezure T. Suzuki T. Kobayashi S. Shikata M. Utsumi S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 56: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The SFER4 cDNA fragment containing NcoI and BamHI restriction sites was cloned into pET21d (Novagen, San Diego, CA) through restriction sites NcoI and BamHI using a PCR-based method. The E173A SFER4 variant was obtained by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis using pET_SFER4 as a template. The DNA sequence of the resulting plasmid pET_ SFER4 and pET_SFER4-E173A was verified by automated DNA sequencing (ABI PRISM 3100, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The constructs were then introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The positive transformants of each construct were grown at 37 °C on LB medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter of carbenicillin, and protein expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when the cell density reached an A600 of 0.6. Eventually, the cells were harvested by centrifugation after 3 h of induction and resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.2 μm pepstatin, 0.5 g/liter leupeptin) to a concentration of 40 g (fresh weight bacteria)/liter, followed by disruption by sonication. The supernatant of the resulting crude extract was collected by centrifugation and fractionated by 50–60% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The pellet was re-suspended in Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) and dialyzed against the same buffer. The protein solution was applied to an ion-exchange column (Q-Sepharose 26/10, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), followed by elution with 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Finally, the protein solution was concentrated and purified on a gel filtration column (Superdex 200pg 16/60, GE Healthcare), equilibrated with Buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl). The resulting SFER4 and SFER4-E173A were electrophoretically pure (data not shown). The protein concentrations were estimated by A280, using molar absorptivity (ϵM) of 17,420 cm−1 m−1, calculated from amino acid composition (45Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Initial crystals of native SFER4 were obtained after about 2 weeks (Wizard I; B-Bridge, Mountain View, CA) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The optimized crystallization drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of mother liquid composed of 15% PEG 1000, 0.2 m calcium acetate, 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.8, and protein solution containing 10 mg/ml of recombinant SFER4. Orthorhombic crystals of SFER4 (space group P21212; a = 222.610, b = 220.886, c = 122.452 Å; VM = 2.61 Å3/Da for 24 monomers per asymmetric unit) of ∼0.5 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm appeared within 3 weeks at 20 °C. The crystallization condition of the E173A variant was the same as that of the native crystal. Diffraction data of the native and E173A crystals were collected to 1.8- and 1.9-Å resolution at 77 K at the SPring-8 beamline 44XU after flash cooling with 30% of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as a cryoprotectant. Data were processed, merged, and scaled with HKL-2000 (HKL Research, Charlottesville, VA) (46Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

Water molecules were added using the COOT autofind function with a lower cutoff of 3 σ in the |Fo| − |Fc| map. Metal ions were positioned into higher (|Fo| − |Fc|) residual densities and according to shorter bond distances with neighboring water molecules or other protein ligands. A Bijvoet difference Fourier map calculated from the final protein model was used to identify the metal binding sites. The final refinement was carried out using PHENIX software (51Adams P.D.

https://openalex.org/W2092305992,"A gain field, the scaling of a tuned neuronal response by a postural signal, may help support neuronal computation. Here, we characterize eye and hand position gain fields in the parietal reach region (PRR). Eye and hand gain fields in individual PRR neurons are similar in magnitude but opposite in sign to one another. This systematic arrangement produces a compound gain field that is proportional to the distance between gaze location and initial hand position. As a result, the visual response to a target for an upcoming reach is scaled by the initial gaze-to-hand distance. Such a scaling is similar to what would be predicted in a neural network that mediates between eye- and hand-centered representations of target location. This systematic arrangement supports a role of PRR in visually guided reaching and provides strong evidence that gain fields are used for neural computations."
https://openalex.org/W2037295429,"The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or stem-like cancer cells (SLCCs) is regarded as the cause of tumor formation and recurrence. However, the origin of such cells remains controversial with two competing hypotheses: CSCs are either transformed from tissue adult stem cells or dedifferentiated from transformed progenitor cells. Compelling evidence has determined the chromosomal aneuploidy to be one of the hallmarks of cancer cells, indicating genome instability plays an important role in tumorigenesis, for which CSCs are believed to be the initiator. To gain direct evidence that genomic instability is involved in the induction of SLCCs, we utilized multiple approaches to enhance genomic instability and monitored the percentage of SLCC in cultured cancer cells. Using side population (SP) cells as a marker for SLCC in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and CD133 for human neuroblastoma cells, we found that DNA damage inducers, UV and mitomycin C were capable of increasing SP cells in NPC CNE-2 and neuroblastoma SKN-SH cells. Likewise, either overexpression of a key regulator of cell cycle, Mad2, or knock down of Aurora B, an important kinase in mitosis, or Cdh1, a key E3 ligase in cell cycle, resulted in a significant increase of SP cells in CNE-2. More interestingly, enrichment of SP cells was observed in recurrent tumor tissues as compared with the primary tumor in the same NPC patients. Our study thus suggested that, beside transformation of tissue stem cells leading to CSC generation, genomic instability could be another potential mechanism resulting in SLCC formation, especially at tumor recurrence stage."
https://openalex.org/W2152934729,"Runx2 is a key transcription factor regulating osteoblast differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis, and FGF2 is one of the most important regulators of skeletal development. The importance of the ERK mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in cranial suture development was demonstrated by the findings that the inhibition of FGF/FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling by a MEK blocker prevents the premature suture closure caused by an Fgfr2 mutation in mice. We previously demonstrated that ERK activation does not affect Runx2 gene expression but that it stimulates Runx2 transcriptional activity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Runx2 activation by FGF/FGFR or ERK was still unclear. In this study, we found that FGF2 treatment increased the protein level of exogenously overexpressed Runx2 and that this increase is reversed by ERK inhibitors. In contrast, overexpression of constitutively active MEK strongly increased the Runx2 protein level, which paralleled an increase in Runx2 acetylation. As Runx2 protein phosphorylation mediated by ERK directly correlates with Runx2 protein stabilization, acetylation, and ubiquitination, we undertook to identify the ERK-dependent phosphorylation sites in Runx2. Analysis of two C-terminal Runx2 deletion constructs showed that the middle third of the protein is responsible for ERK-induced stabilization and activation. An in silico analysis of highly conserved ERK targets indicated that there are three relevant serine residues in this domain. Site-directed mutagenesis implicated Ser-301 in for ERK-mediated Runx2 stabilization and acetylation. In conclusion, the FGF2-induced ERK MAP kinase strongly increased the Runx2 protein level through an increase in acetylation and a decrease in ubiquitination, and these processes require the phosphorylation of Runx2 Ser-301 residue.

C2C12 cells and 293T cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Following transient transfection, the 293T cells were further cultured in serum-free DMEM for 16 h. After stimulation with FGF2 (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium for an additional 8 h, cells were harvested and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. For the kinase inhibitor experiment, the cells were pretreated for 1 h with U0126 (10 μm), SB203580 (25 μm), or JNKII (50 μm), and then treated with 10 ng/ml FGF2. Cells were transfected using HilyMax transfection reagent (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) or Attractene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. 293T cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes for 16 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were transfected with the DNA construct or with empty vector. The cells were then transferred to fresh growth medium for 24 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in HEPES lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors mixture 1/2. Total cell lysates containing 1 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated with the primary antibody and protein G-agarose beads. The agarose beads were washed, and bead-bound proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gel proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, the blots were probed with antibodies and detected using a SUPEX Western blot detection kit (DyneBio, Seongnamsi, Korea). C2C12 cells were cultured in 96-well assay plates and transfected with 100 ng/well reporter vector and/or 200 ng/well expression vector plus 10 ng/well Renilla luciferase vector in serum-free medium. After 6 h of transfection, cells were cultured overnight in fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, which was then replaced with serum-free medium with or without 10 ng/ml FGF2, and incubation was continued for 8 h. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocols. The lysates were analyzed with the GloMax-multi Detection System (Promega). 293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-Runx2 with or without (CA) MEK expression vector. Transfected cells were treated with 50 μg/ml CHX and harvested. The level of Runx2 was analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc antibody. 293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-Runx2 (wild type or mutants) and Flag-ubiquitin. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 and 10 ng/ml FGF2 for 8 h. Myc-Runx2 was immunoprecipitated using the anti-Myc antibody and protein G-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and probed with the anti-Flag antibody. FGF2 is known to activate the Runx2 transcription factor in osteoblasts (31Xiao G. Jiang D. Gopalakrishnan R. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36181-36187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and acetylation of Runx2 are the main mechanisms of increasing its transcriptional activity (34Jeon E.J. Lee K.Y. Choi N.S. Lee M.H. Kim H.N. Jin Y.H. Ryoo H.M. Choi J.Y. Yoshida M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 16502-16511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), but their relationship in Runx2 regulation has not been clearly defined. We first determined whether Runx2 protein and acetylation levels are regulated by FGF2. First of all, we measured the change of total and acetylated endogenous Runx2 protein level by FGF2 treatment in MC3T3-E1. FGF2 treatment increased total and acetylated Runx2 protein level, and an ERK-specific inhibitor, U0126, dramatically blocked FGF2-induced increase of Runx2 (Fig. 1a). To estimate the Runx2 stability by MEK, The 293T cell were transfected Runx2 with or without CA-MEK. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide for the indicated time and harvested. CA-MEK clearly extends the half-life of the Runx2 protein and enhances the accumulation of Runx2 (Fig. 1b). Immunoblot analysis showed that both total and acetylated Runx2 levels were increased by FGF2 treatment (Fig. 1c). Runx2 transcriptional activity in C2C12 cells was increased by overexpression of Runx2 or by FGF2 treatment alone. FGF2 treatment synergistically up-regulated Runx2 transcriptional activity in C2C12 cells transiently overexpressing Runx2 (Fig. 1d). As the MAP kinase pathway is the major downstream signaling pathway for FGF/FGFR and Runx2 is also known to be activated by this pathway, we examined which MAP kinases are responsible for FGF2-dependent increases in total and acetylated Runx2 protein levels. For this purpose, we treated cells with kinase-specific inhibitors 1 h before FGF2 treatment. U0126, SB203580, and JNKII are selective inhibitors for the ERK, p38, and JNK MAP kinases, respectively. The ERK-specific inhibitor U0126 completely blocked FGF2-dependent increases in total and acetylated Runx2 protein levels and Runx2 transcriptional activity, but blocking p38 or JNK had no effect in this respect (Fig. 2, a and b). These results strongly show that FGF2 up-regulates Runx2 protein and acetylation levels via the ERK MAP kinase pathway.FIGURE 2The ERK MAP kinase pathway is required for FGF2-enhanced Runx2 stability and transcriptional activity. a, 293T cells were transfected with the pCDNA3.1–3xMyc-Runx2 expression vector. 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 16 h, pretreated for 1 h with 10 μm U0126, 25 μm, SB203580, or 50 μm JNKII, and then treated or not for 8 h with 10 ng/ml FGF2. Acetylated Runx2 and total Runx2 were detected as in Fig. 1. b, C2C12 cells were transiently co-transfected with the 3xMyc-Runx2 and pGL3–6XOSE-Luc vectors plus pRL-TK vectors. After 24 h, the cells were serum-starved for 16 h, pretreated or not for 1 h with the indicated inhibitor, and then treated or not for 8 h with 10 ng/ml FGF2. Runx2 transcriptional activity was estimated with the luciferase assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increases in FGF2-dependent Runx2 acetylation and protein were blocked by an ERK-specific inhibitor (Fig. 2), and ERK activation can selectively rescue impaired bone phenotypes caused by Runx2 haploinsufficiency (25Ge C. Xiao G. Jiang D. Franceschi R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the ERK MAP kinase is a crucially important signaling molecule for regulating the post-translational modification of Runx2 and its transcriptional activity. Therefore, we questioned whether phosphorylation of Runx2 by the ERK MAP kinase affects its acetylation and stability. To identify Runx2 sites phosphorylated by the FGF2-stimulated ERK MAP kinase, we made two Runx2 deletion constructs; the first, ΔPST1, is composed of amino acids 1–258 (259–558 are deleted), and the second, ΔPST2, contains amino acids 1–397 (398–558 are deleted) (Fig. 3a). The Runx2 ΔPST1 construct exhibited a complete absence of the FGF2-induced increase in the Runx2 protein level and activity, whereas the Runx2 ΔPST2 construct retained FGF2 responsiveness (Fig. 3, b–d). These results indicate that the PST domain of Runx2 (amino acids 259–397) plays a crucial role in FGF2-stimulated acetylation and stability and that this region contains putative ERK phosphorylation sites that are stimulated by FGF2. To identify specific phosphorylation sites in Runx2 recognized by FGF2-stimulated ERK, we analyzed the region between amino acids 259 and 397 using PhosphoScansite 2.0, a proteome-wide program that predicts cell signaling interactions using short sequence motifs (36Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Potential sites were Ser-282, Ser-301, and Ser-319 (Fig. 4a). To test these candidates, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to substitute serine residues with alanine to induce constitutive dephosphorylation of the residue. These mutations were confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 4b). The Runx2-S282A and Runx2-S319A mutants still showed increased Runx2 acetylation levels and transcription activity after FGF2 treatment, like wild-type Runx2. Interestingly, the Runx2-S301A mutant almost completely lacked FGF2-stimulated acetylation and transcription activity (Fig. 4, c and d). To confirm the effect of the ERK kinase on Runx2 acetylation and stability, as well as to confirm the functional site, we used constitutively active MEK (CA-MEK) instead of FGF2. CA-MEK can also stimulate Runx2 acetylation and stability and transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 4, c and d, the Runx2-S301A mutant did not show MEK responsiveness (Fig. 4, e and f). Our data indicate that Ser-301 of Runx2 is a critical ERK phosphorylation site responsible for FGF2-stimulated Runx2 acetylation and stability. It has been reported that Runx2 is degraded through a Smurf-mediated ubiquitination pathway (37Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Specifically, a previous study showed that BMP2 signaling stimulates p300-mediated Runx2 acetylation, increasing transactivation function, and inhibiting Smurf1-mediated degradation of Runx2 (34Jeon E.J. Lee K.Y. Choi N.S. Lee M.H. Kim H.N. Jin Y.H. Ryoo H.M. Choi J.Y. Yoshida M. Nishino N. Oh B.C. Lee K.S. Lee Y.H. Bae S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16502-16511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To determine whether the phosphorylation of Runx2 by the FGF2-stimulated ERK MAP kinase can similarly protect it from degradation by ubiquitination, resulting in an increase in Runx2 stability and transactivation function, we performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay. Although wild-type Runx2 and Runx2-S301A ubiquitination was detected in this assay, Runx2-S301A was modified to a greater extent. In addition, ubiquitination of wild-type Runx2 was decreased by FGF2, but Runx2-S301A was not changed in this respect (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the FGF2 enhances Runx2 protein stability by decreasing ubiquitination and that Ser-301 phosphorylation of Runx2 by activated ERK protects it from ubiquitination-mediated degradation. The importance of RUNX2 in osteogenesis has been clearly demonstrated by mouse models and human genetic studies (5Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S. Albright S. Lindhout D.

It is also known that many osteogenic ligands promote osteogenesis not only by stimulating Runx2 expression but also by promoting Runx2 transcriptional activity. Many kinases are involved in ligand-dependent Runx2 regulation. For example, parathyroid hormone inhibits RUNX2 through protein kinase A (39Li T.F. Dong Y. Ionescu A.M. Rosier R.N. Zuscik M.J. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Drissi H. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). BMP2 or TGF-β1 stimulates Runx2 through Smad phosphorylation and the p38 or ERK MAP kinases (40Ryoo H.M. Lee M.H. Kim Y.J.

Bae S.C. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 319-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although it was indicated that these kinases phosphorylate Runx2 Ser/Thr residues, little information was available concerning which residue is phosphorylated and how phosphorylation stimulates protein activity (33Kim B.G. Kim H.J. Park H.J. Kim Y.J. Yoon W.J. Lee S.J. Ryoo H.M. Cho J.Y. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1166-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 43Wee H.J. Huang G. Shigesada K. Ito Y. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Among these kinases, the ERK MAP kinase is commonly activated by BMP2, TGF-β1, and FGF2 treatment in osteoblasts (31Xiao G. Jiang D. Gopalakrishnan R. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36181-36187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 44Xiao G. Gopalakrishnan R. Jiang D. Reith E. Benson M.D. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We previously showed that FGF2 treatment increases the endogenous Runx2 protein level (16Kim H.J. Kim J.H. Bae S.C. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 319-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether this increase came from an increase in de novo Runx2 expression or from the prolonged presence of previously synthesized Runx2. Our additional prior results also indicated that Runx2 protein acetylation by BMP2 strongly increases its stability (34Jeon E.J. Lee K.Y. Choi N.S. Lee M.H. Kim H.N. Jin Y.H. Ryoo H.M. Choi J.Y. Yoshida M. Nishino N. Oh B.C. Lee K.S. Lee Y.H. Bae S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16502-16511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that FGF2 strongly increased Runx2 acetylation as well as stability. Moreover, treatment of Runx2-overexpressing cells with FGF2 conferred a strong synergistic increase in Runx2 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1), indicating the importance of acetylation for Runx2 stability and transcriptional activity. Our next result showed that the FGF2-induced increase of Runx2 acetylation and transcriptional activation clearly correlated with activation by the ERK MAP kinase. Several studies have shown that ERK activation stimulates Runx2 activity and osteoblast differentiation (26Kanno T. Takahashi T. Tsujisawa T. Ariyoshi W. Nishihara T. J.

Connect Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 109-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the FGF2-increased stabilization, acetylation, and activation of Runx2 are clearly caused by ERK and not by other MAP kinases. The ERK MAP kinase is principally involved in the phosphorylation of Ser/Thr protein residues. To determine which domain of Runx2 is responsible for its acetylation by FGF2 treatment, we analyzed two C-terminal deletion constructs, which showed that a critical residue might be in the amino acid 259–397 region. The basal level of the total and acetylated ΔPST1 Runx2 seems to be increased compared with wild-type Runx2. We previously reported that lysine residues in the central and C-terminal regions of Runx2 increases the susceptibility of protein to degradation, and that acetylation of the lysine residues protects Runx2 from degradation using Runx2-KR-225/230/350/351 mutant (37Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because of the ΔPST1 Runx2 removed most of Runx2 acetylation by p300, the basal level of ΔPST1 Runx2 was increased compared with wild type. However, this is not relevant, because we focused on which site in the Runx2 is responsible for the ERK signal. It has been reported that the PST region of RUNX2 is required for FGF2-induced transcription activity (31Xiao G. Jiang D. Gopalakrishnan R. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36181-36187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, this study did not explain how Runx2 phosphorylation regulates its transcriptional activity nor did it identify the ERK phosphorylation site. Several groups have studied Runx2 phosphorylation residues and their functions. Wee et al. (43Wee H.J. Huang G. Shigesada K. Ito Y. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that Ser-104 and Ser-451 are phosphorylated and are implicated in negatively regulating RUNX2 function. We also previously showed that the Runx2 Ser-247 residue is phosphorylated by direct PKC-δ activation (33Kim B.G. Kim H.J. Park H.J. Kim Y.J. Yoon W.J. Lee S.J. Ryoo H.M. Cho J.Y. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1166-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An ERK-specific phosphorylation site has been reported for AML1. The Ser-249 and Ser-266 residues of AML1 are major and minor ERK-dependent phosphorylation sites, respectively, and ERK phosphorylation potentiates the transactivation ability of AML1 (48Tanaka T. Kurokawa M. Ueki K. Tanaka K. Imai Y. Mitani K. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Yazaki Y. Shibata Y. Kadowaki T. Hirai H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3967-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ERK phosphorylation residues in AML1 are also conserved in human RUNX2 and mouse Runx2. There are three highly conserved ERK MAP kinase target sites, Ser-282, Ser-301, and Ser-319, and each residue is found in mouse and rat Runx2 proteins as well. Based on a recent report of Ge et al., Ser-301 and Ser-319 are the phosphorylation target sites of ERK-MAP kinase (49Ge C. Xiao G. Jiang D. Yang Q. Hatch N.E. Roca H. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32533-32543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this report, our site-directed mutagenesis studies of these serine residues showed that acetylation of Runx2 protein is dependent on Ser-301 phosphorylation. Therefore, even though both Ser-301 and Ser-319 are important targets of Runx2 phosphorylation by ERK-MAP kinase, phosphorylation of Ser-301 only is able to trigger subsequent Runx2 acetylation and stabilization. Ge et al. showed Ser-319 phosphorylation directly by mass spectroscopic (MS) analysis. Meanwhile, they could not provide direct evidence of Ser-301 phosphorylation by MS analysis but provided indirect evidence such as metabolic radiolabeling and gel mobility shift data. They assumed that the difficulties in identification of Ser-301 phosphorylation in MS analysis might result from some changes in secondary structure by subsequent post-translational modification (49Ge C. Xiao G. Jiang D. Yang Q. Hatch N.E. Roca H. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32533-32543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This assumption is quite well matched with our present evidence that phosphorylation of Ser-301-mediated acetylation or other modifications may influence the Runx2 secondary structure and make Ser-301 phosphorylation hardly detectable. These results indicate that the proximal PST domain, and especially Ser-301, is critical for FGF2-induced Runx2 phosphorylation, acetylation, and stabilization. Matsuzaki et al. (50Matsuzaki H. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Aoyama H. Yoshimochi K. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11278-11283Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) reported that acetylation and phosphorylation cooperatively regulate the function of Foxo1, because acetylated Foxo1 becomes more sensitive to PKB-dependent phosphorylation. This finding supports the possibility that phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Runx2 is relevant to acetylation and that Runx2 acetylation regulates its transcriptional activity. In this study, we found that FGF2 decreases Runx2 ubiquitination and that Runx2-S301A did not show this phenotype after FGF2 treatment. These data suggest that Runx2 phosphorylation controls ubiquitination in an ERK-dependent manner. Sears et al. (51Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) reported that activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway extends the half-life of the Myc protein and enhances the accumulation of Myc activity, and that phosphorylation of Ser-62 is required for the Ras-induced stabilization of Myc (52Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-456 plays a role in the regulation of Checkpoint kinase 2 stability after DNA damage (53Kass E.M. Ahn J. Tanaka T. Freed-Pastor W.A. Keezer S. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30311-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and PKC-mediated Ser-193 phosphorylation regulates c-FLIP ubiquitination and stability (54Kaunisto A. Kochin V. Asaoka T. Mikhailov A. Poukkula M. Meinander A. Eriksson J.E. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of specific serine residues can control target protein stability by ubiquitination. We have focused on ERK-dependent Runx2 phosphorylation and post-translational modification. However, many bone-derived growth and signaling factors can regulate Runx2 as activation cofactors. Histone deacetylase-6 interacts with RUNX2 and represses Runx2-dependent transcription (55Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We previously reported that BMP2 signaling stimulates p300-mediated Runx2 acetylation, increasing its transactivation activity and inhibiting Smurf-1-mediated degradation (34Jeon E.J. Lee K.Y. Choi N.S. Lee M.H. Kim H.N. Jin Y.H. Ryoo H.M. Choi J.Y. Yoshida M. Nishino N. Oh B.C. Lee K.S. Lee Y.H. Bae S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16502-16511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). TGF-β can stimulate p300-dependent RUNX3 acetylation through inhibiting ubiquitination-mediated degradation (56Jin Y.H. Jeon E.J. Li Q.L. Lee Y.H. Choi J.K. Kim W.J. Lee K.Y. Bae S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29409-29417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains to be clarified whether the ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Runx2 involves cofactors. In conclusion, we have shown that the FGF2-stimulated ERK activation and subsequent phosphorylation of Ser-301 in the Runx2 protein is clearly related to an increased acetylation level, which subsequently stabilizes Runx2 by inhibiting ubiquitin-dependent degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2108109908,"Discrimination tasks require processing, interpreting, and linking sensory information to the appropriate motor response. We report that neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC) represent visual motion with precision comparable to cortical neurons at early stages of motion processing, and readily adapt this representation to behavioral context. We found that direction selectivity, recorded while the monkeys discriminated directions, decreased when they judged motion speed and ignored its direction. This decrease was more pronounced in neurons classified as narrow-spiking (NS) putative interneurons than in broad-spiking (BS) putative pyramidal neurons. However, during passive fixation, when the link between motion and its behavioral relevance was removed, both cell types showed a severe selectivity loss. Our results show that flexible sensory representation during active discrimination tasks is achieved in the PFC by a specialized neuronal network of both NS neurons readily adjusting their selectivity to behavioral context, and BS neurons capable of maintaining relatively stable sensory representation."

We report the 2.8 A resolution crystal structure of the C-terminal globular domain of PglB and its comparison with the previously determined structure from the archaeon Pyrococcus AglB. The two distantly related oligosaccharyltransferases share unexpected structural similarity beyond that expected from the sequence comparison. The common architecture of the putative catalytic sites revealed a new catalytic motif in PglB. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses confirmed the contribution of this motif to the catalytic function. Bacterial PglB and archaeal AglB constitute a protein family of the catalytic subunit of OST along with STT3 from eukaryotes. A structure-aided multiple sequence alignment of the STT3/PglB/AglB protein family revealed three types of OST catalytic centers. This novel classification will provide a useful framework for understanding the enzymatic properties of the OST enzymes from Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2043611992,"Monocular deprivation (MD) is a well-known paradigm of experience-dependent plasticity in which cortical neurons exhibit a shift of ocular dominance (OD) toward the open eye. The mechanisms underlying this form of plasticity are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate the involvement of callosal connections in the synaptic modifications occurring during MD. Rats at the peak of the critical period were deprived for 7 days, resulting in the expected OD shift toward the open eye. Acute microinjection of the activity blocker muscimol into the visual cortex contralateral to the recording site restored binocularity of cortical cells. Continuous silencing of callosal input throughout the period of MD also resulted in substantial attenuation of the OD shift. Blockade of interhemispheric communication selectively enhanced deprived eye responses with no effect on open eye-driven activity. We conclude that callosal inputs play a key role in functional weakening of less active connections during OD plasticity."

Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways were also activated. Although Fas ligand neutralizing antibody could inhibit the former pathway, the mechanism of activation of the latter remained unknown. PV antibodies increased cytochrome c release, suggesting damage to mitochondria. The immunoblotting experiments revealed penetration of PVIgG into the subcellular mitochondrial fraction. The antimitochondrial antibodies from different PV patients recognized distinct combinations of antigens with apparent molecular sizes of 25, 30, 35, 57, 60, and 100 kDa. Antimitochondrial antibodies were pathogenic because their absorption abolished the ability of PVIgG to cause keratinocyte detachment both in vitro and in vivo. The downstream signaling of antimitochondrial antibodies involved JNK and late p38 MAPK activation, whereas the signaling of anti-desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) antibody involved JNK and biphasic p38 MAPK activation. Using KCs grown from Dsg3−/− mice, we determined that Dsg3 did not serve as a surrogate antigen allowing antimitochondrial antibodies to enter KCs. The PVIgG-induced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor and Src was affected neither in Dsg3−/− KCs nor due to absorption of antimitochondrial antibodies. These results demonstrated that apoptolysis in PV is a complex process initiated by at least three classes of autoantibodies directed against desmosomal, mitochondrial, and other keratinocyte self-antigens. These autoantibodies synergize with the proapoptotic serum and tissue factors to trigger both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of cell death and break the epidermal cohesion, leading to blisters.

However, changing the concentration of the odor had little effect upon oscillatory frequency. Our recordings in vivo and computational models based on these results suggested that the main effect of increasing odor concentration was to recruit additional, less well-tuned ORNs whose firing rates were tightly constrained by adaptation and saturation.

For a particular modality in a given species, oscillation frequency often seems unrelated to stimulus intensity. In the locust olfactory system, for example, odors elicit ∼20 Hz oscillations that vary little in frequency even when odor concentration varies over five orders of magnitude (Stopfer et al., 2003Stopfer M.

Laurent G. Bazhenov M. Adaptive regulation of sparseness by feedforward inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In some cases, though, stimulus intensity does appear to modulate oscillation frequency; the changing velocity of a visual stimulus, for example, can systematically change the frequency of gamma oscillations in the cat visual cortex (Gray and Prisco, 1997Gray C.M. Prisco G.V.D. Stimulus-dependent neuronal oscillations and local synchronization in striate cortex of the alert cat.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3239-3253PubMed Google Scholar). What determines the frequencies of these oscillations? Here, we used the insect olfactory system to clarify the encoding of odor intensity and the relationship between stimulus intensity and oscillation frequency. In insects, odor molecules are first detected by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Axons from ORNs converge upon glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL, analogous to the olfactory bulb) where excitatory projection neurons (PNs, analogous to mitral cells) and local interneurons (LNs), most of which are inhibitory, interact. PNs send excitatory inputs to LNs, and LNs send rapid inhibitory feedback to PNs via GABAA-like receptors. In locusts, honeybees, and Drosophila, this feedback circuit has been shown to synchronize groups of PNs, resulting in regular oscillating waves of output that depolarize Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body (MB). These waves can be detected as a local field potential (LFP; Laurent and Naraghi, 1994Laurent G. Naraghi M. Odorant-induced oscillations in the mushroom bodies of the locust.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2993-3004PubMed Google Scholar, Stopfer et al., 1997Stopfer M. Bhagavan S. Smith B.H. Laurent G.

Stopfer M. Odor-evoked neural oscillations in Drosophila are mediated by widely branching interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8595-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We found that odors evoked oscillatory responses in the moth Manduca sexta much like those described in the locust, honeybee, and fly. Further, in the moth, we found that lengthy odor pulses evoked oscillations that began at ∼40 Hz but then suddenly decreased to ∼15–20 Hz. Simultaneous LFPs and recordings from the moth's antenna (electroantennogram, EAG) showed that the net response intensity of ORNs decreased in parallel to the shift in oscillation frequency. This suggested that oscillation frequency might be determined by the intensity of the response of the ORN population. In apparent contradiction, though, we also found that odor-evoked oscillation frequency remained remarkably constant across a broad range of odor concentrations. What then is the relationship between stimulus intensity and oscillation frequency? Our approach, combining experimental and computational methods, led to several conclusions. First, we found that the frequency of odor-evoked oscillations in the moth olfactory system is determined by the intensity of input to the oscillatory AL network but that this intensity is determined by sensory adaptation and saturation of ORNs rather than by the intensity of olfactory stimuli. Second, extending prior work, we demonstrated that the vast majority of olfactory dynamic range is encoded in the periphery by the number of responsive ORNs rather than by the firing rates of those ORNs. And third, we characterized a new stable oscillatory regime in which principle neurons participating in an oscillatory network can fire much faster than the oscillation frequency. To characterize the moth olfactory system's neural responses, we delivered a variety of odors (nonpheromones, see Experimental Procedures) over a wide range of concentrations and a range of durations from 100 ms (as moths might experience while flying in an odor plume) to 4 s (as moths might experience when sampling food from flowers). All odor stimuli in our panel induced robust oscillations in the LFP recorded in the MB calyx (a target of PNs, Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows an example of oscillations elicited by a presentation of dilute benzyl alcohol vapor to the ipsilateral antenna of a moth that was mostly intact but with its brain exposed for electrophysiological recording (see Experimental Procedures). The first of a series of odor presentations typically elicited only weak oscillations in the LFP; however, oscillatory power increased rapidly over the first four or five presentations (Figure S1). Odor pulses briefer than ∼1 s elicited fast, 30–40 Hz oscillations in the moth MB; notably, odor pulses longer than ∼1 s produced oscillations that were initially fast but then dramatically slowed to 10–20 Hz (Figures 1C–1E).

Neural oscillations and the decoding of sensory information, Ph.D thesis, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California.Google Scholar) and we (Figure S2) had previously observed similar but less pronounced decreases in LFP oscillation frequency in the locust. Where and by what mechanism are the oscillations generated? In the moth, we made simultaneous recordings of LFPs from the AL and the MB. All odors that we tested induced both fast and slow oscillations in both the AL and the MB; further, the AL-LFP and MB-LFP signals were highly coherent (n = 10, Figure 1F). We next made simultaneous intracellular recordings from pairs of AL neurons together with LFP recordings from the MB (Figure 2; all neurons morphologically identified by dye injection and subsequent confocal imaging). Figure 2A shows an example of a simultaneous recording of the MB-LFP, a PN, and an LN. For most oscillation cycles, a spike in the PN was closely followed (within ∼2 ms) in the LN by either a single spike or an EPSP, suggesting that LNs received odor-driven periodic input from PNs. And, reciprocally, the membrane potential of this PN revealed a periodic hyperpolarization and depolarization after each spike, suggesting that IPSPs from the inhibitory LNs regulated the timing of spikes in the PN. Sliding-window cross-correlations showed that the membrane potential fluctuations in this LN and PN were tightly coupled to LFP oscillations recorded in the MB (spikes clipped; Figure 2B). The oscillations slowed during each trial. Are the fast and slow oscillations generated in the AL? We made intracellular recordings from 14 PNs and 30 LNs, each simultaneously with LFPs recorded in the MB; Figure 2C displays the spike-LFP phase relationships for spikes pooled from all recorded cells. Spikes in PNs reliably phase locked to the LFP at a point just past the peak of each cycle during fast (mean direction and 95% confidence interval = 2.79° ± 9.1°; 1950 spikes) and slow (23.4° ± 3.3°; 7005 spikes) oscillations. Spikes in LNs phase locked to the LFP just after the PNs during fast (71.4° ± 3.0°; 2623 spikes) and slow (72.6° ± 1.1°; 12,723 spikes) oscillations. The spike phase distributions of PNs and LNs were each significantly different from uniform distributions (Rayleigh test, p < 0.05), indicating strong phase locking. The temporal relationships of these populations match those shown in the simultaneously recorded example (Figure 2A). Together, the reliable, periodic relationships among AL neurons suggested that the timed inhibition of PNs by LNs was important for producing synchronous oscillations. To test this, we selectively abolished fast inhibition from LNs to PNs by locally injecting picrotoxin (PCT, a blocker of the GABAA-like inhibition in Manduca, Waldrop et al., 1987Waldrop B. Christensen T.A. Hildebrand J.G. GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition of projection neurons in the antennal lobes of the sphinx moth, Manduca sexta.J. Comp. Physiol. [A]. 1987; 161: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) into the AL while recording LFPs from the MB. Injection of PCT (n = 6) reversibly and significantly reduced odor-evoked fast and slow oscillations; control injections of saline (n = 5) had no effect (Figure S3). Thus, inhibition from LNs within the AL is required for the generation of odor-elicited oscillations. Both fast and slow oscillations are generated within the AL and are transmitted to the MB by PNs. To test whether followers of PNs in the MB are sensitive to the oscillatory synchrony of their input, we made intracellular recordings from a set of KCs (n = 20, all morphologically identified by dye injection and subsequent confocal imaging). During odor presentations, the membrane potentials of KCs revealed pronounced subthreshold fluctuations that were tightly coupled to simultaneously recorded LFP oscillations. In our four recordings from KCs that revealed subthreshold activity, peaks of the membrane potential oscillations reliably occurred during falling phases of the LFP oscillation (Figures 3A and 3B; see Experimental Procedures). Further, odor-evoked spikes in KCs were phase locked to the falling phases of LFP oscillations during fast (117.1° ± 12.2°; 329 spikes) and slow (125.7° ± 5.8°; 706 spikes) oscillations (Figure 3C). The spike phase distributions for KCs, like those of PNs and LNs, were significantly different from uniform distributions (Rayleigh test, p < 0.05). We found that the timing of spikes in PNs, LNs, and KCs became more precise (less jitter around the preferred phase) as the oscillation frequency decreased (Figure S4). Together, these results indicated that oscillations strongly influence the timing of spikes in the KCs. We had observed that long odor pulses elicited oscillations that shifted dramatically in frequency. What causes this shift? We found that, during long odor pulses, EAGs decreased in amplitude with timing roughly matching that of the frequency shift in the LFP (Figure 1B). The decrease in EAG amplitude was probably caused by sensory adaptation within the ORNs (Kaissling et al., 1987Kaissling K.E. Strausfeld C.Z. Rumbo E.R. Adaptation processes in insect olfactory receptors. Mechanisms and behavioral significance.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1987; 510: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a mechanism that reduces the intensity of response to an ongoing stimulus. The nearly parallel changes in ORN output intensity and oscillation frequency suggested to us that the intensity of the stimulus may determine oscillation frequency. To test this, we delivered a wide range of concentrations of three odors (hexanol, octanol, and geraniol), expecting to find that higher concentrations elicited more intense responses from ORNs and perhaps faster oscillations in the LFP. Indeed, the range of odor concentrations we used elicited a wide range of responses in the EAG (Figures 4A and 4B) and in the LFP (Figure S5) from small, near-basal fluctuations to deep, saturating deflections; thus, the range of odor concentrations that we used effectively elicited a wide range of response intensities from the population of ORNs. Lower odor concentrations evoked weaker LFP oscillations; higher concentrations evoked stronger oscillations (Figure 4C). However, we found that the initial LFP oscillation frequency remained almost constant across five or more orders of magnitude of odor concentration (Figure 4D). Together, these results appeared contradictory: decreasing drive from ORNs appeared to result in dramatically reduced oscillation frequency, yet experimentally changing the intensity of the input to ORNs had little or no such effect. The EAG aggregates the responses of many ORNs in the antenna. Thus, we next characterized the responses of individual ORNs on the moth antenna while delivering odor pulses of different concentrations (Figure 5; n = 37 ORNs from 9 preparations; see Experimental Procedures). We found that individual responsive ORNs revealed a small dynamic range, firing at rates that varied only within narrow spans of concentration. ORNs responding to moderate odor concentrations (e.g., 0.01%–1% of hexanol; see Experimental Procedures) showed firing rates that quickly saturated (Figure 5F, green lines) or even decreased (Figure 5F, red lines) as odor concentration increased. And ORNs that initially responded vigorously to an odor presentation (e.g., with firing rates >40 Hz) quickly slowed their firing (Figures 5B and 5C). This sensory adaptation was evoked by all odors tested and all concentrations whenever the initial firing rate exceeded ∼40 Hz (Figures 5D and 5E). Faster-firing ORNs underwent greater adaptation (Figure 5E), suggesting that ORNs better tuned for a given odor would adapt more. Thus, we found that each ORN fired at a rate tightly constrained by adaptation and saturation. To quantify the dynamic range of individual ORNs relative to that of the population, we fit concentration response curves with the Hill equation (Figures 5F and 5G; Firestein et al., 1993Firestein S.

Gelperin A. Rinberg D. Olfactory coding with all-or-nothing glomeruli.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 3134-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In our sample of ORNs and odors, we found that response thresholds were widely distributed across concentrations spanning about six orders of magnitude (C10, Figure 5H). Consistent with this, increasing numbers of ORNs participated in the response as odor concentrations increased (Figures 5F and 5H). And most ORNs had Hill coefficients greater than 1 (mean = 1.1269; median = 0.802), corresponding to a dynamic range spanning less than two orders of magnitude (Figures 5I and 5J; Koulakov et al., 2007Koulakov A. Gelperin A. Rinberg D. Olfactory coding with all-or-nothing glomeruli.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 3134-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two orders of magnitude encoded by individual ORNs corresponded to only about 2/6, or 33%, of the dynamic range provided by the whole ORN population. Further, we found that the firing rates in the ORN population fit Gaussian distributions (Figure 5K). As odor concentration increased, the width of the distribution (number of responsive ORNs) broadened but the height of the distribution (firing rate) remained about the same (Figure 5K). These results indicate that, in the moth, the great majority of olfactory dynamic range is encoded as changes in the size of the population of responsive ORNs. Our analysis of individual ORNs revealed that the frequency transition in LFP oscillations followed a temporal profile closely matching that of the adaptation rate of the most active ORNs (Figures 5L and S6). Yet, experimentally changing the intensity of input to the ORNs (odor concentration) had little if any such effect. To explain these apparently contradictory findings and to understand how oscillation frequency is determined, we incorporated our physiological measurements into a full-scale, map-based network model (reduced type, Rulkov, 2002Rulkov N.F.

Biol. Phys. 2008; 34: 279-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of the moth AL (Figure 6A). We simulated input to the AL network as synaptic currents applied to odor- and concentration-specific populations of PNs and LNs (Assisi et al., 2007Assisi C. Stopfer M. Laurent G. Bazhenov M. Adaptive regulation of sparseness by feedforward inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures). In our model, as in vivo, this input caused the population of PNs to spike and to synchronize through feedback inhibition mediated by LNs (Figure 6B). Synchronized spiking in the model AL was manifest as periodic oscillations of the LFP (Figure 6B, top; calculated as the average activity of all PNs). We had found that the adaptation of ORN firing rates followed a temporal profile matching that of the frequency transition in LFP oscillations (Figures 5L and S6). How does adaptation influence the dynamical properties of the AL network? To simulate activation and adaptation of the odor responses of ORNs, we drove our network model with a rapidly rising and then slowly decaying input (Figure 6B, bottom) with the size of the AL population receiving external stimulation (input “width”) held constant. During the simulated odor's onset, the rapid increase in input intensity quickly entrained the network to generate ∼40 Hz oscillations (Figures 6B and 6C). The subsequent decrease in stimulus amplitude initially led to a reduction in the LFP amplitude, signaling a decrease in the synchrony of spiking across the population of responsive PNs. But as the input intensity continued to decrease, synchrony suddenly resumed, although now at ∼20 Hz. During this transition, the interspike interval (ISI) distributions of both PNs and LNs (Figures 6C and 6D) lengthened. Our intracellular recordings from PNs and LNs had revealed qualitatively similar changes in ISI distribution (Figure S7). In our model, a 40%–50% decrease in stimulus intensity caused a frequency shift (Figure 6B) matching what we had observed in vivo (Figures 1D and 1F). This result suggested that a change in stimulus intensity similar to what occurs in vivo, and not the size of the responsive ORN population, could explain much of the change in oscillation frequency. Other factors such as the strengths and the time constants of synaptic currents could influence oscillation frequency as well (Figure S8). To test the range of possible responses in the AL, we next analyzed the steady-state network dynamics of our model as a function of input intensity. Throughout these stimulations we held constant both the size of the AL population receiving external input and the amplitude of the input; in separate experiments we systematically changed the input amplitude to LNs and PNs to explore a broad space of parameters. Our model showed that the AL network could generate oscillations with a wide range of frequencies, including 20–40 Hz, depending on the net intensity of its input (Figure 6E, left panel). Further, individual PNs and LNs could change average firing rate as a function of excitatory and inhibitory input intensity (Figure 6E, middle and right panels). In our model, inhibitory LNs almost always spiked at the frequency of the LFP oscillations; notably, excitatory PNs could fire faster with either one or two spikes during each oscillatory cycle (Figures 6C and 6D). These results match those of our intracellular recordings (Figure S7). How do changes in odor concentration influence the dynamical properties of the AL network? Our model had shown that, for a network with a fixed number of responsive neurons, increasing the amplitude of external stimuli led to a progressive increase in oscillation frequency (Figure 6E). But our recordings from ORNs had shown that, as the concentration of an odorant increased, more types of receptors began to respond (Figure 5K; see also Stewart et al., 1979Stewart W.B. Kauer J.S.

Carlson J.R. Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). To simulate this effect of changing odor concentration, we varied the proportion of the PN and LN populations (parameter σ, width of the curve in Figure 7A; compare to Figure 5K) driven by external excitatory input. We found that varying the size of the stimulated neuronal population only slightly varied the frequency of oscillations (Figures 7B–7D). When driven by very low odor concentrations (“narrow” input, i.e., σ = 0.2), the frequency of LFP oscillations increased slowly upon odor onset (Figure 7C, left); several oscillatory cycles were required to engage all the neurons in oscillatory dynamics. Our model suggested that the main effect of varying the size of the responsive neuronal population was to vary the coherence of the moth AL network, but not its frequency. Because sensory input to our model was simulated using a Gaussian profile, when input underwent adaptation, two factors changed: (1) active PNs decreased their firing rates, and (2) the size of the active PN population decreased (Figure 6C). To test which factor most directly underlies the LFP's frequency shift, we provided our model a simplified square input profile rather than a realistic Gaussian input profile; the simplified input drove all stimulated PNs and LNs identically and gave zero input to all nonstimulated PNs and LNs, thus holding the size of the active PN population constant over time even as the input adapted. With this constrained input, adaptation still caused the oscillatory frequency to decrease (Figure S9A). In contrast, decreasing the size of the stimulated AL population (to model a decrease in odor concentration) did not affect oscillation frequency (Figure S9B). Consistent with this result, an even simpler model consisting of only a single PN and a single LN, reciprocally coupled (Figure 7D), showed that changing the intensity of the input caused a shift in oscillation frequency (Figure 7E). Taken together, these models suggest that input intensity regulates the firing frequency of active PNs, which directly determines the network oscillatory frequency. To test the robustness of our results and to gain a more intuitive understanding of the mechanism that underlies the oscillatory response transition in the AL, we designed an additional, simplified “firing rate” version of our more realistic map-based model of the AL network (see Experimental Procedures). To test whether the oscillatory frequency of the AL network is determined by the firing rates of activated PNs, we systematically varied the threshold required to activate PNs, effectively removing weakly activated ORNs from the network (Figure 8A). Even though this manipulation (like decreasing odor concentration) greatly decreased the size of the active population of neurons and caused the overall input to the network to change dramatically (Figure 8B), the oscillatory frequency remained constant (Figure 8C). Next, we simulated the effect of sensory adaptation by altering the response intensity of the most strongly activated PNs (Figure 8D). This manipulation, which kept the number of active neurons constant but reduced overall input to the network (compare Figures 8B and 8E), greatly altered oscillatory frequency (Figure 8F), consistent with results we obtained with our spiking map-based model and with our physiology experiments. Further, our simplified rate model showed that adaptation of the ORNs was sufficient to shift the oscillatory frequency of the AL network (Figures 8G and 8H); a version of the model lacking adaptation showed no shift in frequency (Figures 8I and 8J). These results, combined with those of our physiological recordings and spiking model show that, for any given odor or concentration, oscillation frequency is controlled by a small subset of ORNs and PNs, those that are most highly responsive. In summary, our computational models (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8) demonstrated that the shifts in LFP frequency that we observed in vivo during lengthy odor stimulations can be explained by gradual changes in the intensity of output from a stable group of ORNs to the AL. This intensity level is determined mainly by the adaptation and saturation of the peripheral receptor neurons (ORNs) rather than by the intensity of the environmental stimulus (odor concentration). Our results show that, in the periphery, the great majority of the olfactory system's dynamic range is encoded by the size of the responsive"

Neurol. 2001; 60: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Clinically indistinguishable diseases have been documented regardless of which of the aforementioned NPC proteins is mutated (8Sleat D.E. Wiseman J.A. El-Banna M. Price S.M. Verot L. Shen M.M.

Genet. 2003; 64: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that NPC1 and NPC2 function in concert in a common pathway to facilitate the trafficking of cholesterol and other cargo from lysosomes (10Subramanian K. Balch W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15223-15224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is a fact that cholesterol homeostasis is significantly disturbed in patients with NPC disease; however, we reason that any molecule that accumulates in lysosomes that cannot readily permeate out by passive or active transport mechanisms will experience excessive accumulation and potentially altered cellular homeostasis in patients with NPC disease. An example of such cargo includes lysosomotropic endogenous amines that accumulate into lysosomes according to an ion-trapping mechanism (11de Duve C. de Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that NPC1 plays an important functional role in regulating amine accumulation in lysosomes (12Kaufmann A.M. Krise J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24584-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Specifically, amine-induced vacuolization of lysosomes was shown to require functional NPC1 and involve retrograde fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes to create hybrid organelles. Certain lysosomotropic amines were shown to significantly stimulate late endosome/lysosome fusion events as well as the overall rate of cell secretion of lysosomal cargo. Importantly, these events were only observed in cells with functional NPC1. Considering that mutations in NPC1 and NPC2 have been shown to be phenotypically indistinguishable in nearly all assays examined, we sought to determine here if NPC2 functions like NPC1 in the secretion of membrane-impermeable lysosomal cargo and in the regulation of lysosomal amine content. We comparatively examined wild type and NPC1 and NPC2 mutant fibroblasts as well as cells mimicking a NPC1/NPC2 double mutant, which were created by treating NPC1 or NPC2 mutant fibroblasts with NPC1 or NPC2 siRNA. Surprisingly, we found significant differences between all cell types examined. Our results suggest that NPC1 functions independently of NPC2 in late endosome/lysosome retrograde fusion that leads to the creation of hybrid organelles. We also provide evidence to support the notion that NPC2 is required for fission of membrane vesicles from the hybrid organelles, which most likely leads to the reformation of lysosomes as well as the subsequent trafficking of lysosomal cargo to other cellular destinations. The relationship between these findings and amine trafficking and regulation in late endocytic compartments is addressed. AlexaFluor (AF) 647 succinimidyl ester, AF555 succinimidyl ester, and biotinylated dextran amine (Mr 10,000) were obtained from Invitrogen. [3H]dextran (Mr 70,000) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Carboxylate-modified streptavidin-labeled latex beads (∼800 nm), dextran (70,000 Mr), neutral red (NR), nocodazole, chloroquine (CQ), and TLC plates were all purchased from Sigma. Wild type human foreskin fibroblasts (CRL-2076, Coriell Cell Repository, Camden, NJ) and human foreskin fibroblasts with a mutant form of NPC1, denoted NPC1−/− (CCR, catalogue ID GM03123), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Two human fibroblast lines with mutant forms of the NPC2 protein, denoted NPC2−/− GM17910 (CCR, catalogue ID GM17910) and NPC2−/− GM18455 (Coriell, catalogue ID GM18455), were grown in Earl's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% FBS. Chinese hamster ovary cells containing a deletion of the NPC1 locus, denoted NPC1-null (M12 cells) (13Millard E.E. Srivastava K. Traub L.M. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38445-38451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), were a kind gift from Dr. D. Ory (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and were grown in DMEM/F-12 with 5% FBS. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, wild type, NPC1+/−/NPC2+/−, NPC1+/−/NPC2+/+, NPC1−/−/NPC2+/+, and NPC1−/−/NPC2−/−) were a kind gift from Dr. P. Lobel (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ) and were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS. Fibroblasts with Sandhoff disease (Coriell, catalogue ID GM11707) and with mucolipidosis type IV (Coriell, catalogue ID GM02408) were grown in Earl's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% FBS. All cells and experiments were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere unless otherwise stated. All fibroblasts were grown to 80–90% confluency before experiments were performed. To deplete wild type fibroblasts of LDL-derived cholesterol, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 72 h before use. The indicated fibroblasts were plated at 50,000 cells/well at 37 °C in 6-well plates 24 h before release experiments. Cells were incubated with a total of 1 mg/ml 70,000 Mr dextran including 0.1 mg/ml [3H]dextran (25 μCi/ml) for a total of 6 h at 37 °C. Monolayers were then washed 4 times with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) and replaced with dextran-free DMEM at 37 °C. The supernatant was subsequently removed and replaced with DMEM at the indicated time points. The supernatant was assayed for radioactivity by mixing with 5 ml of ScintiVerse BD Mixture (Fisher) using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman; LS 60001C). To account for nonspecific [3H]dextran-associated release, the experiment was repeated at 4 °C, and these values were subtracted from the total amount released at 37 °C for all time points. For drug-treated fibroblasts, U18666A (10 μm) and progesterone (10 μg/ml) were incubated with cells for 6 h before experimentation and for the duration of the experiment. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay was employed to evaluate rates of late endosome/lysosome retrograde fusion as previously described (12Kaufmann A.M. Krise J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24584-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Kaufmann A.M. Goldman S.D. Krise J.P. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 386: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts were plated on 4-well cell culture slides (1.7 cm2) at 50,000 cells per well at 37 °C 1 day before testing. Before experimentation, biotinylated dextran amine was conjugated to AF647, and the carboxylate-modified streptavidin-labeled latex beads were conjugated to AF555 using previously reported protocols (14Kaufmann A.M. Goldman S.D. Krise J.P. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 386: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were incubated with 2.5 mg/ml biotinylated dextran amine-AF647 for 2 h and chased in DMEM for 6 h. Monolayers were then washed once with D-PBS, pulsed with AF555-latex beads for 20 min, and washed 4 times with DMEM before obtaining FRET measurements. This point was defined as the initial FRET ratio for all FRET assays and is reported as such in subsequent figures. FRET measurements were made using a Photon Technologies International Ratiomaster microscope-mounted spectrofluorometer with photomultiplier tube detection (Birmingham, NJ). Multiple measurements were made: a control for bead loading, (donor excitation/emission, AF555, excitation 550 nm; emission 610/40 nm), the FRET signal (donor excitation/acceptor emission, FRET, excitation 550 nm; emission 710/60 nm), and a control for dextran loading (acceptor excitation/emission, AF647; excitation 650 nm; emission 670/40 nm). All dichroic and emission filters used were from Chroma (Rockingham, VT). NPC1 or NPC2 protein expression was silenced using previously described siRNA constructs (15Ganley I.G. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17890-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, NPC1−/− (GM03123) or NPC2−/− (GM17910) fibroblasts were plated at 50,000 cells per well at 37 °C on a 4-well cell culture slide 24 h before transfections. siRNA constructs as well as scrambled controls (Ambion, Austin, TX) were transfected into cells using serum-free DMEM and siPORT-Amine (Ambion) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used 72 h post-transfection to allow for sufficient NPC1 or NPC2 knockdown. Knockdown was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal rabbit NPC1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), polyclonal goat NPC2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibody (Santa Cruz). Indicated fibroblasts were grown to ∼80% confluency in 4-well cell culture slides and transfected with the fluorescent fusion proteins NPC1-GFP (provided by Dr. M. Scott, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and Rab9-YFP (provided by Dr. S. Pfeffer, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 per the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Cells were transfected for 48 h to achieve sufficiently high protein expression. Treated cells were incubated with 100 μm CQ for 3 h. To confirm the specificity of the NPC1 siRNA for the NPC1 gene, we utilized an orthologous form of NPC1, namely NPC1-GFP. The NPC1 siRNA used previously targeted human-specific mRNA to achieve knockdown. NPC1-GFP is derived from a mouse origin and contains six different nucleotides in the siRNA binding region (as compared with human NPC1) and, therefore, is not effectively suppressed by the NPC1 siRNA. Wild type fibroblasts were transfected with NPC1-GFP 48 h before treatment with NPC1 siRNA. [3H]Dextran secretion was then measured 72 h post-transfection with siRNA. Wild type, NPC1−/−, (GM03123), NPC2−/− (GM17910), and NPC2−/− (GM18455) fibroblasts were plated on 4-well cell culture slides (BD Biosciences) at 50,000 cells/well at 37 °C 24 h before use. On the day of experimentation, cells were incubated with the lysosomotropic agents NR and CQ (70 and 100 μm, respectively) in DMEM for 6 h at 37 °C. The indicated cells were treated with 1 μm nocodazole for 1 h before and concurrent to NR treatment. Cells were then washed 3 times at 37 °C with D-PBS and subsequently prepared for microscopy. Images were captured on a Zeiss Meta 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY) with an argon laser at 458 nm. All size and area measurements were done using ImageJ software (available from the NIH online at rsbweb.nih.gov) using a background subtraction followed by the Threshold algorithm to define vacuole dimensions and the Analyze algorithm to size all identified vacuoles. The average number of sized vacuoles per cell ranged from 106 to 1744 with an average of 463. A minimum of five cells was evaluated for each treatment. Fibroblasts were plated on 8-well cell culture slides at 25,000 cells per well at 37 °C 24 h before microscopy. Fibroblasts were washed once with D-PBS and fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution in D-PBS for 7 min at room temperature. Fibroblasts were then permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in a 10% FBS in D-PBS solution for 30 min. Primary antibodies for lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1, rabbit, monoclonal, Developmental Studies Hybridoma, Iowa City, IA) and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR, mouse, monoclonal; Developmental Studies Hybridoma; Iowa City, IA) diluted 1:50 in 0.05% saponin in a 10% FBS solution of D-PBS were applied to the cells at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were then washed twice with 0.1% saponin in a 10% FBS in D-PBS solution. Next, fibroblasts were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit AF488 and goat anti-mouse AF647; Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in a 0.05% saponin in 10% FBS solution. Cells were then washed twice with D-PBS and prepared for imaging. CQ-treated cells were incubated with 100 μm for 3 h before immunofluorescence analysis. Images were acquired with an Olympus/3I Spinning Disk Confocal/TIRF inverted microscope with laser lines (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) at 488 and 635 nm. Images were acquired using a Hamamatsu ImagEM CCD Camera. Co-localization was quantified in ImageJ using the Colocalization plug-in. Cholesterol efflux was measured similarly to a previously published protocol (16Millard E.E. Gale S.E. Dudley N. Zhang J. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28581-28590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts were plated on 6-well plates at 50,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day media were replaced with DMEM containing lipoprotein-free serum for 48 h. Cells were then washed once with lipoprotein-free DMEM and refrigerated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml [14C]cholesteryl oleate-labeled LDL (LDL was labeled with [14C]cholesteryl oleate according to previous protocols (17Krieger M. Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4093-4101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in lipoprotein-free DMEM and incubated for 4 h at 18 °C. Cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated for 2 additional hours in lipoprotein-free DMEM. 4% methyl-β-cyclodextrin in lipoprotein-free DMEM was then applied for 10 min to extract membrane cholesterol, and media fractions were pooled. Cells were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH. Cholesterol was extracted using a 2:1 mixture of chloroform/methanol after the addition of 50 μg of cholesterol, 50 μg of cholesteryl oleate, and 0.001 μCi of [3H]cholesteryl oleate. Samples were then dried under nitrogen, and TLC was run. TLC running buffer was a 90:30:1 mixture of heptane/ethyl ether/acetic acid, and visualization was done using iodine. Lipids were quantified using liquid scintillation counting after scraping of the appropriate spots off the TLC plates. Efflux was expressed as a fraction of radioactivity in media divided by total radioactivity in media and cells. Esterification assays were based on a previously published report (16Millard E.E. Gale S.E. Dudley N. Zhang J. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28581-28590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 6-well plates at 100,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day cells were fed lipoprotein-free DMEM for 24 h. 50 μg/ml LDL was then added and incubated for 16 h. Afterward, ∼1 μCi of [3H]oleate was pulsed for 2 h, cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, and lipids were extracted using a 3:2 mixture of hexane and isopropyl alcohol. After the addition of 50 μg of cholesteryl oleate and 0.001 μCi of [14C]cholesteryl oleate, samples were dried under nitrogen, and TLC was run. TLC running conditions were identical to cholesterol efflux TLC conditions. Lipids were quantified using liquid scintillation counting, and data were normalized to protein content. We and others have shown that mutations in NPC1 impair vesicle-mediated egress of a variety of membrane-impermeable cargo from lysosomes, including dextran, sucrose, and small molecular weight amines (12Kaufmann A.M. Krise J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24584-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F.

Ther. 2006; 316: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). More recently, Tang et al. (20Tang Y. Leao I.C. Coleman E.M. Broughton R.S. Hildreth J.E.K. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 7982-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown that NPC1 is required for the efficient trafficking of HIV-1 viral proteins from late endosomes/lysosomes after infection. To our knowledge, no prior investigations have evaluated how mutations in NPC2 influence the release of such membrane-impermeable cargo from cells. We were interested in determining if NPC2-deficient cells had impaired lysosomal release kinetics similar to what had previously been observed in cells with mutations in NPC1 (12Kaufmann A.M. Krise J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24584-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More importantly, we questioned whether or not cells with deficiencies in both proteins had release profiles that were similar to those from cells with single protein mutations. To examine this we evaluated the release of [3H]dextran (70,000 Mr) from human skin fibroblasts that were appropriately pulsed-chased to ensure specific localization within lysosomes (data not shown). We comparatively analyzed wild type and NPC1 and NPC2 mutant fibroblasts. The cumulative percent of dextran released into the culture medium is plotted as a function of time for each of the cell lines. As previously reported (12Kaufmann A.M. Krise J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24584-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), wild type fibroblasts release ∼80% of the total dextran in the cells at 24 h post-dextran incubation (Fig. 1A). NPC1 mutant fibroblasts had significantly reduced dextran secretion relative to wild type fibroblasts (∼45% at 24 h, Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we found that NPC2 mutant cells exocytosed even less dextran than did NPC1 mutant cells at the 24-h time point (∼25%, Fig. 1A). We subsequently sought to determine whether deficiencies in NPC1 and NPC2 in the same cell resulted in dextran secretion phenotypes that were similar to single mutants or if the defects in secretion were additive. If the dextran secretion profiles were similar to that of either single mutant profile, it would support the notion that the two proteins work together at the same step in retrograde trafficking. Alternatively, if the secretion was significantly less than either single mutant, this would suggest that both NPC1 and NPC2 function in the egress of lysosomal dextran but possibly in different steps. Because we could not readily acquire fibroblasts with loss of function mutations in both NPC1 and NPC2, we used siRNA to silence the expression of NPC1 in NPC2 mutant fibroblasts and to silence the expression of NPC2 in NPC1 mutant fibroblasts. These mutant cells treated with siRNA are referred to as NPC1−/−/NPC2−/− pseudo-double mutants. According to densitometric analysis of Western blots, we were able to suppress NPC1 and NPC2 expression by ∼95% (data not shown). Unexpectedly, both pseudo-double mutants released about half the dextran of non-transfected NPC2 mutant cells (∼15% at 24 h, Fig. 1A). Because it is possible that the transfection procedure itself could have negatively impacted dextran release, we also examined mutant cells that were transfected with scrambled siRNA and found that the dextran release was not significantly different from non-transfected mutant cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). Additionally we tested the specificity of the siRNA to NPC1 on cells expressing an orthologous NPC1 (mouse NPC1-GFP), which lacks the human siRNA target sequence. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1B, cells with functional NPC1-GFP treated with NPC1 siRNA showed significantly greater dextran release at the 24-h time point as compared with cells treated with NPC1 siRNA alone. It is possible that the aforementioned alterations in dextran secretion profiles associated with the cells harboring mutations in NPC proteins could be due to alterations in lipid homeostasis and not directly due to mutations in the NPC proteins themselves. Indeed, it has been shown that the ability of late endosomes and lysosomes to fuse can depend on lipid accumulation in these compartments (21Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Love D.C. Cooney A. Comly M. Neufeld E. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4466-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To examine this, we evaluated dextran release in cells that had functional NPC proteins but had lysosomal lipid storage disorders. Specifically, we tested fibroblasts from patients with mucolipidosis type IV and from patients with Sandhoff disease. Mucolipidosis type IV cells harbor mutations in mucolipin, a protein responsible for subcellular lipid transport (22Chen C.S. Bach G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These cells accumulate sphingolipids, phospholipids, and acid mucopolysaccharides. Sandhoff disease is characterized by GM2 ganglioside hyper-accumulation (23Bolhuis P.A. Oonk J.G. Kamp P.E. Ris A.J. Michalski J.C. Overdijk B. Reuser A.J. Neurology. 1987; 37: 75-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jatzkewitz H. Pilz H. Sandhoff K. J. Neurochem. 1965; 12: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, there was no statistically significant change in dextran secretion at 24 h for both lipid storage disorders as compared with wild type fibroblasts. Additionally, we incubated wild type fibroblasts in serum-free media for 72 h (conditions which deplete LDL-derived cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes) and then tested their dextran release. Again, no difference in dextran secretion was seen at 24 h. Collectively, these data suggest that significant alterations in late endosomal/lysosomal lipid homeostasis cannot alone account for the alterations in dextran secretion observed with our studies. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of a well known inducer of the NPC disease phenotype, U18666A, on dextran secretion in wild type cells or those with functional mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2. In wild type cells, treatment with 10 μm U18666A significantly inhibited dextran secretion (supplemental Fig. S2A), consistent with previously published results from this laboratory (12Kaufmann A.M. Krise J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24584-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells with single mutations in NPC2 that were treated with U18666A had dextran secretion profiles that were indistinguishable from untreated NPC2 mutant fibroblasts (Fig. 1D). Conversely, cells with single mutations in NPC1 experienced a significantly reduced dextran secretion when treated with U18666A compared with untreated NPC1 mutant fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). The finding that cells with mutations in NPC1 or NPC2 respond differently to U18666A treatment is interesting and suggests that U18666A may preferentially inhibit NPC2-mediated events involved in the retroendocytic r"
https://openalex.org/W2039180870,"Post-translational modifications of ribosomal proteins are important for the accuracy of the decoding machinery. A recent in vivo study has shown that the rimO gene is involved in generation of the 3-methylthio derivative of residue Asp-89 in ribosomal protein S12 (Anton, B. P., Saleh, L., Benner, J. S., Raleigh, E. A., Kasif, S., and Roberts, R. J. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105, 1826-1831). This reaction is formally identical to that catalyzed by MiaB on the C2 of adenosine 37 near the anticodon of several tRNAs. We present spectroscopic evidence that Thermotoga maritima RimO, like MiaB, contains two [4Fe-4S] centers, one presumably bound to three invariant cysteines in the central radical S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) domain and the other to three invariant cysteines in the N-terminal UPF0004 domain. We demonstrate that holo-RimO can specifically methylthiolate the aspartate residue of a 20-mer peptide derived from S12, yielding a mixture of mono- and bismethylthio derivatives. Finally, we present the 2.0 A crystal structure of the central radical AdoMet and the C-terminal TRAM (tRNA methyltransferase 2 and MiaB) domains in apo-RimO. Although the core of the open triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel of the radical AdoMet domain was conserved, RimO showed differences in domain organization compared with other radical AdoMet enzymes. The unusually acidic TRAM domain, likely to bind the basic S12 protein, is located at the distal edge of the radical AdoMet domain. The basic S12 protein substrate is likely to bind RimO through interactions with both the TRAM domain and the concave surface of the incomplete TIM barrel. These biophysical results provide a foundation for understanding the mechanism of methylthioation by radical AdoMet enzymes in the MiaB/RimO family."
https://openalex.org/W2090418707,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) exists as two major isoforms that differ in the length of the N terminus, the shorter AQP4-M23 and the longer AQP4-M1. Both isoforms form tetramers, which can further aggregate in the plasma membrane to form typical orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) whose dimension depends on the ratio of the M1 and M23. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the M23 isoform can be produced directly by the M1 mRNA. In cells transiently transfected with AQP4-M1 coding sequence we observed besides AQP4-M1 the additional presence of the AQP4-M23 isoform associated with the formation of typical OAPs observable by two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE and total internal reflection microscopy. The mutation of the second in-frame methionine M23 in AQP4-M1 (AQP4-M1(M23I)) prevented the expression of the M23 isoform and the formation of OAPs. We propose ""leaky scanning"" as a translational mechanism for the expression of AQP4-M23 protein isoform and that the formation of OAPs may occur even in the absence of AQP4-M23 mRNA. This mechanism can have important pathophysiological implications for the cell regulation of the M1/M23 ratio and thus OAP size. In this study we also provide evidence that AQP4-M1 is mobile in the plasma membrane, that it is inserted and not excluded into immobile OAPs, and that it is an important determinant of OAP structure and size."
https://openalex.org/W2089118589,"One mechanism of prostate tumors for escape from androgen ablation therapies is mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). We investigated the unique properties of the AR L701H mutant, which is strongly stimulated by cortisol, by a systematic structure-function analysis. Most amino acid substitutions at position 701 did not affect AR activation by 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Further analysis of the AR Leu701 variants showed that AR L701M and AR L701Q, like AR L701H, had changed ligand responsiveness. AR L701M was strongly activated by progesterone but not by cortisol, whereas the opposite was observed for AR L701Q and AR L701H. Next, we analyzed a panel of structurally related steroids to study which of the OH groups at positions 11β, 17α, and 21, which discriminate cortisol from progesterone, underlie the differential responses to both hormones. The results showed that the 17α-OH group was essential for activation of AR L701H and AR L701Q, whereas its absence was important for activation of AR L701M. Modeling indicated a conserved H-bonding network involving the steroidal 17α-OH group, His701 or Gln701, and the backbone of Ser778. This network is absent in Leu701 and in other mutants. A hydrophobic leucine or methionine at position 701 is unfavorable for the 17α-OH group. Our results indicate that the specific amino acid residue at position 701, its interaction with the backbone of Ser778, and the steroidal 17α-hydroxyl group of the ligand are all important for the distinct transcriptional responses to progesterone and cortisol of AR mutants, including the prostate cancer mutant L701H. One mechanism of prostate tumors for escape from androgen ablation therapies is mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). We investigated the unique properties of the AR L701H mutant, which is strongly stimulated by cortisol, by a systematic structure-function analysis. Most amino acid substitutions at position 701 did not affect AR activation by 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Further analysis of the AR Leu701 variants showed that AR L701M and AR L701Q, like AR L701H, had changed ligand responsiveness. AR L701M was strongly activated by progesterone but not by cortisol, whereas the opposite was observed for AR L701Q and AR L701H. Next, we analyzed a panel of structurally related steroids to study which of the OH groups at positions 11β, 17α, and 21, which discriminate cortisol from progesterone, underlie the differential responses to both hormones. The results showed that the 17α-OH group was essential for activation of AR L701H and AR L701Q, whereas its absence was important for activation of AR L701M. Modeling indicated a conserved H-bonding network involving the steroidal 17α-OH group, His701 or Gln701, and the backbone of Ser778. This network is absent in Leu701 and in other mutants. A hydrophobic leucine or methionine at position 701 is unfavorable for the 17α-OH group. Our results indicate that the specific amino acid residue at position 701, its interaction with the backbone of Ser778, and the steroidal 17α-hydroxyl group of the ligand are all important for the distinct transcriptional responses to progesterone and cortisol of AR mutants, including the prostate cancer mutant L701H. The androgen receptor (AR) 2The abbreviations used are: ARandrogen receptorDHT5α-dihydrotestosteroneAISandrogen insensitivity syndromePAISpartial AISCAIScomplete AISLBDligand-binding domainAREandrogen response elementLucluciferaseCPAcyproterone acetate. is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that is activated by the androgens testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The androgen-AR axis is essential for normal male development and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the functions of male-specific organs, including the prostate (1Brinkmann A.O.

A disturbed androgen-AR axis has been implicated in a number of malignancies, including androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and prostate cancer (2Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 179: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3Taplin M.E. Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2007; 4: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). AIS is caused by AR inactivation and is characterized by defective masculinization of 46,XY individuals. It ranges from mild undervirilization (mild AIS) to partial (PAIS) or even complete (CAIS) female phenotypic outcomes. An active AR pathway is involved in prostate cancer. Initially, prostate cancer growth is dependent on androgens. Therefore, treatment of metastasized tumors aims at inhibiting the AR pathway by suppressing testicular androgen production by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs or by blocking AR activity using antiandrogens. Despite an initial response, tumors eventually regain the ability to grow, leading to an endocrine therapy-resistant stage of the disease. Although tumor growth is androgen-independent at this stage, the AR pathway still appears to be active (4Mostaghel E.A. Page S.T. Lin D.W. Fazli L. Coleman I.M. True L.D. Knudsen B. Hess D.L.

In response to binding of an antagonist, helix 12 adopts a different orientation, preventing the AR LBD from obtaining the active conformation necessary to induce transcription (16Masiello D.

The incidence of AR mutations is low in primary prostate tumors but increases in advanced disease during endocrine therapy (6Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Ko Y.J. Small E.J. Upton M. Rajeshkumar B.

The majority of AR mutations collocate at several regions in the LBD mapping to amino acid residues 670–678, 701–730, and 874–919 (18Buchanan G. Greenberg N.M. Scher H.I. Harris J.M. Marshall V.R. Tilley W.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1273-1281PubMed Google Scholar). The first AR mutation reported was a threonine-to-alanine substitution at position 877 that was identified in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line (19Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Later, it was found that Thr877 serves as an AR mutational hot spot in recurrent prostate tumors (20Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Wu J.H. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis and functional studies of the AR T877A mutant demonstrated that this amino acid substitution alters the size, shape, and properties of the ligand-binding pocket, allowing several non-natural ligands and even antiandrogens to bind and activate the receptor (12Sack J.S.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5780-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It seems that AR T877A drives tumor growth through aberrant activation by the antiandrogen used for treatment. A second AR mutational hot spot identified in prostate cancers is residue 701. The AR mutation substituting Leu for His at position 701 (L701H) has been reported in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients (24Suzuki H. Sato N. Watabe Y. Masai M. Seino S. Shimazaki J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe M. Ushijima T. Shiraishi T. Yatani R. Shimazaki J. Kotake T. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Jpn. J. Clin.

The same mutation, in combination with T877A, is also present in the AR of MDA-PCa cell lines, which were originally derived from a bone metastasis of an orchiectomized prostate cancer patient (26Navone N.M. Olive M. Ozen M. Davis R. Troncoso P. Tu S.M. Johnston D. Pollack A. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Logothetis C.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2493-2500PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zhao X.Y. Boyle B. Krishnan A.V. Navone N.M. Peehl D.M. Feldman D. J. Urol. 1999; 162: 2192-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). AR L701H and AR L701H/T877A are somewhat less sensitive to androgens but are highly responsive to the glucocorticoids cortisol and cortisone, which circulate at concentrations high enough to activate both mutant receptors (28Krishnan A.V.

Peehl D.M. Feldman D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Thus, androgen-independent growth of prostate tumors containing the L701H mutation differs from that of prostate tumors containing the T877A mutation by being driven by endogenously circulating ligands. Previously, the T877A substitution has been studied in detail (23Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Dubbink H.J. Doesburg P. Hersmus R. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5780-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed a systematic structure-function analysis of AR residue 701 to obtain further insight in the ligand responsiveness of AR L701H. Screening revealed that, in addition to AR L701H, also AR L701M and AR L701Q had a changed but differential ligand specificity. Functional studies with a panel of structurally related steroids showed that the presence of a hydroxyl group at position 17α is critical for activation of AR L701H and AR L701Q but not AR L701M. Modeling of the various mutations in the AR LBD structure revealed that a unique H-bonding network involving His701 or Gln701, the steroidal 17α-OH group, and the backbone oxygen of Ser778 plays an important role in the cortisol response. The structure-function analysis described in this study includes the clarification of the properties of the AR L701H mutant in prostate cancer. DHT, progesterone, cortisol, and 11-desoxycorticosterone were purchased from Steraloids (Wilton, NH); 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 11β-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-desoxycortisol, and 21-desoxycortisol were from Sigma; and hydroxyflutamide was from Schering (Bloomfield, NJ). Corticosterone was kindly provided by Dr. Albert Brinkmann (Erasmus Medical Center), and bicalutamide (Casodex) was a gift from AstraZeneca (Macclesfield, United Kingdom). All AR L701X mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the mammalian AR cDNA expression vector pSVAR0 (30Brinkmann A.O.

The primers used were 5′-CTTTGCAGCCTTGNNNTCTAGCCTCAATG-3′ (with the bases encoding AR residue 701 indicated in boldface) and its complementary sequence. AR L701H/T877A was generated by QuikChange mutagenesis of AR Leu701 in the pSVARL vector, which expresses the AR T877A mutant (19Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C.

All mutations were verified by sequence analysis, and Western blotting was performed to analyze size and expression of the AR mutants. Construction of the mammalian expression plasmid encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain-AR FXXLF peptide and the (ARE)2TATA-Luc reporter ((PRE)2-E1b-Luc, where PRE is progesterone response element) has been described previously (31Dubbink H.J.

Hep3B cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. For transient transfection assays, Hep3B cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well of a 24-well plate and allowed to grow for 24 h. Four hours prior to transfection, the medium was replaced with α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and hormone or vehicle. Twenty-four hours after addition of transfection mixtures (described below), cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured as described previously (31Dubbink H.J. Hersmus R. Verma C.S. van der Korput H.A. Berrevoets C.A. van Tol J. Ziel-van der Made A.C. Brinkmann A.O. Pike A.C. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2132-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation assays were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 50 ng of AR expression construct, and 100 ng of (ARE)2TATA-Luc reporter construct per well. In mammalian one-hybrid assays, FuGENE 6 mixtures contained 50 ng of Gal4 DNA-binding domain-peptide, 50 ng of AR expression construct, and 150 ng of (UAS)4TATA-Luc reporter per well. For Western blot analysis, Hep3B cells were transfected with 50 ng of AR expression construct as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). Lysates were boiled and subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, after which proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with monoclonal antibodies directed against the AR N-terminal domain (F39.4.1), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Proteins were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent blotting substrate (Pierce), followed by exposure to x-ray film. Residue 701 was mutated systematically in a proprietary wild-type AR structure bound to DHT and the publicly available AR L701H structure (33Matias P.M. Carrondo M.A. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Zhao X.Y. Wegg A. Crusius K. Egner U. Donner P. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Each mutation has been minimized in YASARA using the YAMBER2 force field (34Krieger E. Darden T. Nabuurs S.B. Finkelstein A. Vriend G. Proteins. 2004; 57: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and visually inspected. We performed a systematic structure-function analysis of AR residue 701 to obtain further insight in the effect of the L701H mutation on AR ligand responsiveness. AR Leu701 was substituted with any other amino acid residue, and the resultant AR mutant was tested for DHT (100 nm) response in transiently cotransfected Hep3B cells. With the (ARE)2TATA-Luc as reporter, most AR mutants, including AR L701H, were strongly activated by DHT (Fig. 1A). Responses were somewhat less if a polar residue (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, or Tyr) was present at AR position 701. Substitution of the Leu with Gly or Trp strongly reduced activation by DHT, whereas substitution with a charged residue (Asp, Glu, Arg, or Lys) completely abrogated AR transcriptional activity. Similar results were obtained if murine mammary tumor virus-Luc was used as the reporter construct (data not shown). Western blot analysis demonstrated that all AR Leu701 mutants were expressed at levels comparable with wild-type AR levels (Fig. 1B). The AR L701I and AR L701F mutants have previously been identified in individuals with PAIS and CAIS, respectively (35Ahmed S.F. Cheng A. Dovey L. Hawkins J.R. Martin H. Rowland J. Shimura N. Tait A.D. Hughes I.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 36Chávez B. Vilchis F. Zenteno J.C. Larrea F. Kofman-Alfaro S. Clin. Genet. 2001; 59: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Despite normal responses of both AR mutants at high DHT concentrations (100 nm) (Fig. 1A), the activities of AR L701F and AR L701I were substantially lower than those of wild-type AR at 1 nm DHT (Fig. 1C). These reduced DHT responses may account for the CAIS and PAIS phenotypes found in individuals carrying the AR L701F and AR L701I mutations. Analysis of the x-ray structure of wild-type AR in complex with DHT showed that the 3-keto group of DHT is hydrogen-bonded to Gln711 and Arg752 (Fig. 1D) (12Sack J.S. Kish K.F. Wang C. Attar R.M. Kiefer S.E. An Y. Wu G.Y. Scheffler J.E. Salvati M.E. Krystek Jr., S.R. Weinmann R. Einspahr H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4904-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The 17β-OH group is stabilized via hydrogen bonds to Asn705 and Thr877. Leu701 is located near the steroidal D-ring and has hydrophobic contacts with C17. The side chain of Leu701 is buried in a predominantly hydrophobic pocket consisting of Phe697, Leu700, Leu704, Ser778, Met780, Phe876, Leu880, and Val889 (Fig. 1E). We modeled the replacement of Leu701 with each amino acid and evaluated the structure. These analyses showed that, in addition to the wild-type leucine, also other aliphatic residues (Val, Ile, Met, and Ala) were tolerated sterically and formed varying degrees of favorable van der Waals interactions with the surrounding hydrophobic pocket. As expected, Ala701 and Gly701 formed less hydrophobic contacts in the receptor than the other aliphatic residues, potentially resulting in a less stable protein. This may be the cause of the strongly reduced DHT response of AR L701G. Although polar residues were sterically tolerated at position 701, their lower DHT responses are most likely due to their presence in an unfavorable hydrophobic pocket. Large residues such as Trp, Phe, and Tyr could not be tolerated in the Leu701 hydrophobic pocket without causing significant clashes with the protein structure. The presence of these large residues required structural modification of the receptor, which likely explains the strongly reduced DHT responses and the CAIS phenotype observed in the individual carrying the AR L701F mutation. The lack of a charged residue in the environment surrounding Leu701 prohibited mutation to a charged residue. Without a charged partner, this would result in the destabilization of the receptor. We next studied the transcriptional activities of the AR Leu701 mutants induced by progesterone and cortisol. In control experiments, we first determined the transcriptional responses of wild-type AR, the AR L701H and AR T877A single mutants, and the AR L701H/T877A double mutant to both steroids using the (ARE)2TATA-Luc reporter. In Hep3B cells, all receptor mutants responded similarly as described previously for CV-1 cells and a murine mammary tumor virus-Luc reporter (Fig. 2A) (29Zhao X.Y. Malloy P.J. Krishnan A.V. Swami S. Navone N.M. Peehl D.M. Feldman D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type AR was activated only by DHT, AR L701H was additionally activated by cortisol but not by progesterone. The opposite was observed for AR T877A. AR L701H/T877A displayed combined characteristics of both single mutants by responding strongly to both progesterone and cortisol. Although the majority of AR Leu701 mutants were activated by DHT (Fig. 1A), they showed weak or no responses to progesterone and cortisol (Fig. 2B). However, apart from AR L701H, three mutants had a modified but distinct ligand responsiveness. The activities of AR L701I and AR L701M were clearly induced upon incubation with progesterone but not with cortisol, whereas AR L701Q, like AR L701H, was induced by cortisol and not by progesterone (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained using a murine mammary tumor virus-Luc reporter construct (data not shown). Because AR L701M showed the strongest responses to progesterone, this mutant was selected for further examination. Progesterone and cortisol are structurally highly similar (Fig. 3A). Cortisol differs from progesterone by the presence of hydroxyl groups at positions 11β, 17α, and 21. To study which of these hydroxyl groups differentially affects transcriptional activation of AR L701M, AR L701H, and AR L701Q, we tested a panel of steroids intermediary between progesterone and cortisol with varying combinations of hydroxyl groups at positions 11β, 17α, and 21 (Fig. 3A). Our results demonstrate that wild-type AR and AR L701M on one hand and AR L701H and AR L701Q on the other display two different transcriptional activation profiles (Figs. 3, B and C, and 4), which are characterized by differential responses to steroids containing a hydroxyl group at position 17α (17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 21-desoxycortisol, 11-desoxycortisol, and cortisol). AR L701M and wild-type AR, which contain a hydrophobic residue at position 701, did not respond at all to these steroids (Figs. 3B and 4, A and B). In contrast, AR L701H and AR L701Q, which harbor a polar residue at position 701, were stimulated by steroids containing the 17-OH group (Figs. 3C and 4, C and D). All steroids containing a hydroxyl group at position 11β (11β-hydroxyprogesterone, corticosterone, 21-desoxycortisol, and cortisol) were less capable of activating the AR mutants than steroids without this hydroxyl group (progesterone, 11-desoxycorticosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and 11- desoxycortisol, respectively) (Figs. 3, B and C, and 4). This demonstrates that the 11β-OH group is unfavorable for AR activation. Steroids without the 21-OH group (progesterone, 11β-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and 21-desoxycortisol) or with the 21-OH group (11-desoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-desoxycortisol, and cortisol) were equally capable of activating AR L701H and AR L701Q, suggesting that the 21-OH group is not relevant for specificity (Figs. 3C and 4, C and D). The transcriptional activities of AR L701M and wild-type AR were slightly affected if the 21-OH group was present (Figs. 3B and 4, A and B). The crystal structure of wild-type AR bound to DHT showed that Leu701 has hydrophobic contacts with C17 of the steroid. The structure of the AR L701H/T877A double mutant has been elucidated in complex with 9α-fluorocortisol (33Matias P.M. Carrondo M.A. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Zhao X.Y. Wegg A. Crusius K. Egner U. Donner P. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This structure revealed an H-bond between the steroidal 17α-OH group and the polar His701. The histidine residue was also well positioned to make an H-bond to the backbone of Ser778 (Fig. 5A). On the basis of this structure, we modeled Gln and Met at position 701. Modeling revealed that Gln701 is able to make an H-bond to a 17α-OH group of the ligand in a manner similar to His701 (Fig. 5B). In addition, Gln701 also replicates the H-bond with the backbone of Ser778 that is seen in the AR L701H structure (Fig. 5B). None of the other amino acid substitutions at 701 were able to reproduce this H-bonding network. The other amide-containing side chain amino acid, Asn (Fig. 5C), and the small polar residues Thr, Ser, and Cys are sterically tolerated and were able to make the H-bond with the steroid. However, unlike His701 or Gln701, these residues are unable to interact with Ser778. The polar interaction of Asn, Thr, and Ser with the steroid's 17α-OH group should prevent the burying of this hydrophilic group into a hydrophobic part of the pocket. Despite this, the AR L701N, AR L701T, and AR L701S mutations did not show strong activation by cortisol as seen for AR L701H and AR L701Q (Fig. 2B). We therefore conclude that the additional interaction with Ser778 that is unique for AR L701H and AR L701Q must have an important role in activating the AR, perhaps by further stabilizing the protein. Although both a histidine and a glutamine residue at position 701 were able to contribute to the same H-bonding network, AR L701Q displayed lower activities than AR L701H (Figs. 3C and 4, C and D). This might be explained by potential differences in the angles, distances, and electrostatics of the polar interactions, which underlie the relative strength of a hydrogen-bonding network. Contrary to this, modeling showed that the 17α-OH group in both the wild-type and L701M mutant structures is unfavorably buried in a hydrophobic pocket, explaining the lack of activity upon incubation with steroids containing the 17α-OH group (Figs. 3B and 4B). Met701 actually appears to fill the pocket marginally better than Leu701 and results in an electrostatically favorable sulfur-sulfur contact between Met701 and Met780 (Fig. 5, D and E). This improved packing and sulfur-sulfur contact could have a positive effect on protein stability, which may explain the increased activation of the AR L701M mutant compared with the wild-type receptor. The molecular basis for progesterone activation of AR L701M and AR L701H, but not AR L701Q, is somewhat speculative. As shown in Fig. 5 (D and E), Met701 moderately improved packing compared with Leu701. Modeling suggests that also His701 better fills the pocket than Leu701 (Figs. 1D and 5A), which indicates that AR L701M and AR L701H are inherently more stable than wild-type AR. Additionally, modeling of progesterone to wild-type AR and AR L701Q appears to introduce clashes between the residues at position 701 and the 17β-group of the steroid. These clashes did not occur if progesterone was modeled to AR L701M and AR L701H. These findings, combined with the observation that progesterone does not require the receptor to adapt to the presence of a 17α-OH group, might give some indication as to why progesterone activates AR L701M and AR L701H, but not wild-type AR and AR L701Q, only at high ligand concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3, the presence of the 11β-OH group is unfavorable for activating the AR Leu701 mutants. Modeling suggests that the most likely explanation is a clash of the steroidal 11β-OH group with Met895, which is also a Met residue in the progesterone receptor but a smaller Leu in the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors (37Poujol N. Wurtz J.M. Tahiri B. Lumbroso S. Nicolas J.C. Moras D. Sultan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24022-24031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This may explain the general tolerance of 11β-OH steroids in the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors but not in the AR and progesterone receptor. Different coactivator groove-interacting peptides display distinct binding modes (31Dubbink H.J. Hersmus R. Verma C.S. van der Korput H.A. Berrevoets C.A. van Tol J. Ziel-van der Made A.C. Brinkmann A.O. Pike A.C. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2132-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For example, LXXLL peptides are shifted in the AR groove toward Lys720 compared with FXXLF peptides (38Askew E.B. Gampe Jr., R.T. Stanley T.B. Faggart J.L. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

In addition, AR T877A bound to cyproterone acetate (CPA) strongly interacts with LXXLL motifs but less with FXXLF motifs, whereas the opposite is observed if it is bound to hydroxyflutamide (42Brooke G.N. Parker M.G. Bevan C.L. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Ozers M.S. Marks B.D. Gowda K. Kupcho K.R. Ervin K.M. De Rosier T. Qadir N. Eliason H.C. Riddle S.M. Shekhani M.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the interaction capacities of distinct peptides containing FXXLF, FXXFF, FXXMF, and LXXLL sequences with the different AR Leu701 mutants in the presence of steroids from our panel. Peptide interactions were studied in mammalian one-hybrid assays as described previously (31Dubbink H.J. Hersmus R. Verma C.S. van der Korput H.A. Berrevoets C.A. van Tol J. Ziel-van der Made A.C. Brinkmann A.O. Pike A.C. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2132-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, for AR L701M, AR L701H, and AR L701Q, the relative interaction of the AR FXXLF peptide correlated with the relative transcriptional activation capacity. Similar results were obtained for AR T877A and AR L701H/T877A (data not shown). Although we found that AR T877A preferred binding of LXXLL motifs in the presence of CPA and FXXLF-like motifs in the presence of hydroxyflutamide as demonstrated previously (42Brooke G.N. Parker M.G. Bevan C.L. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Ozers M.S. Marks B.D. Gowda K. Kupcho K.R. Ervin K.M. De Rosier T. Qadir N. Eliason H.C. Riddle S.M. Shekhani M.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we did not observe a similar effect for the AR Leu701 mutants (supplemental Fig. 1). Also, the interaction patterns of FXXLF-like motifs with the AR Leu701 mutants in the presence of progesterone and cortisol were similar to those with DHT and corresponded to the capabilities of these steroids to induce transcription (supplemental Fig. 2, A–D). In line with these data, the AIS mutants AR L701I and AR L701F showed an altered binding preference for neither FXXLF nor LXXLL peptides (supplemental Fig. 2E). The relative peptide interaction capacities of both mutant receptors were comparable with the transcriptional activities at different DHT concentrations (compare Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 2E). Together, these results suggest that, unlike AR T877A, amino acid residue 701 in the AR does not directly or indirectly influence the conformation of the coactivator groove. Many AR mutations found in prostate cancer, including T877A and W741C, result in antiandrogen-responsive receptors, leading to failure of antiandrogen treatment of metastasized prostate cancer (23Steketee K.

Yamaoka M. Kanzaki N. Kusaka M. Miyamoto M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 149-153PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously (23Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Dubbink H.J. Doesburg P. Hersmus R. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5780-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), AR T877A is strongly activated by hydroxyflutamide and CPA but not by bicalutamide (Fig. 7). Vice versa, AR W741C is strongly activated by bicalutamide but not by hydroxyflutamide (44Hara T. Miyazaki J. Araki H. Yamaoka M. Kanzaki N. Kusaka M. Miyamoto M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 149-153PubMed Google Scholar) and CPA (Fig. 7). It was shown previously that AR L701H is not responsive to hydroxyflutamide (29Zhao X.Y. Malloy P.J. Krishnan A.V. Swami S. Navone N.M. Peehl D.M. Feldman D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Here, we extended these observations by investigating the effects of the antiandrogens hydroxyflutamide, bicalutamide, and CPA on the transcriptional activities of AR L701H and the other AR Leu701 mutants. Fig. 7 shows that, similar to the responses to the panel of steroids (Fig. 3), AR L701H and AR L701Q on one hand and wild-type AR and AR L701M on the other displayed different responses to the antiandrogens. AR L701H and AR L701Q were activated neither by hydroxyflutamide nor by bicalutamide or CPA. AR L701M showed weak agonistic responses to hydroxyflutamide and CPA, which were comparable with wild-type AR. Both receptors could not be activated by bicalutamide. The Leu-to-His substitution is the only mutation found at position 701 in prostate cancer patients (24Suzuki H. Sato N. Watabe Y. Masai M. Seino S. Shimazaki J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe M. Ushijima T. Shiraishi T. Yatani R. Shimazaki J. Kotake T. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Jpn. J. Clin.

Urol. 1999; 162: 2192-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). AR L701M and AR L701Q mutations have never been found, possibly because two base substitutions are needed to mutate the Leu codon into a codon for Met or Gln. The lack of activation of the AR L701H mutant by antiandrogens strongly suggests that this AR mutant does not drive prostate tumor growth upon binding of an antiandrogen used for treatment. This provides an additional clue for the conclusion that, in these cases, tumor growth is dependent on endogenously circulating ligands such as cortisol. This finding indicates a different mechanism of tumor growth than observed for the AR T877A and AR W741C mutants, which are dependent on antiandrogens for their transcriptional activity. In addition to the prostate cancer mutant L701H, we detected two other mutations, L701M and L701Q, that result in an AR with modified ligand specificity. We have shown that these mutants can be subdivided on the basis of their transcriptional activation profiles and structural conformation, in which the interaction between AR residue 701, the backbone of Ser778, and the steroidal 17α-hydroxyl group plays a crucial role. The largely identical structural and functional properties of AR L701H and AR L701Q were instrumental in explaining the altered ligand specificity of the AR L701H mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1973300535,"Acquired resistance through genetic mutations is a common phenomenon in several cancer therapies using molecularly targeted drugs, best exemplified by the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Overcoming acquired resistance is a daunting therapeutic challenge, and little is known about how these mutations evolve. To facilitate understanding the resistance mechanisms, we developed a novel culture model for CML acquired resistance in which the CML cell line KCL-22, following initial response to imatinib, develops resistant T315I BCR-ABL mutation. We demonstrate that the emergence of BCR-ABL mutations do not require pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations derived from the original patient as the subclones of KCL-22 cells can form various BCR-ABL mutations upon imatinib treatment. BCR-ABL mutation rates vary from cell clone to clone and passages, in contrast to the relatively stable mutation rate of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene. Strikingly, development of BCR-ABL mutations depends on its gene expression because BCR-ABL knockdown completely blocks KCL-22 cell relapse on imatinib and acquisition of mutations. We further show that the endogenous BCR-ABL locus has significantly higher mutagenesis potential than the transduced randomly integrated BCR-ABL cDNA. Our study suggests important roles of BCR-ABL gene expression and its native chromosomal locus for acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and provides a new tool for further studying resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2004049050,"Cuticle-degrading proteases are involved in the breakdown of cuticle/eggshells of nematodes or insects, a hard physical barrier against fungal infections. Understanding the 3-dimensional structures of these proteins can provide crucial information for improving the effectiveness of these fungi in biocontrol applications, e.g., by targeted protein engineering. However, the structures of these proteases remain unknown. Here, we report the structures of two cuticledegrading proteases from two species of nematophagous fungi. The two structures were solved with X-ray crystallography to resolutions of 1.65 Å (Ver112) and 2.1 Å (PL646), respectively. Crystal structures of PL646 and Ver112 were found to be very similar to each other, and similar to that of proteinase K from another fungus Tritirachium album. Differences between the structures were found among residues of the substrate binding sites (S1 and S4). Experimental studies showed that the enzymes differed in hydrolytic activity to synthetic peptide substrates. Our analyses of the hydrophobic/ hydrophilic and electrostatic features of these two proteins suggest that their surfaces likely play important roles during fungal infection against nematodes. The two crystal structures provide a solid basis for investigating the relationship between structure and function of cuticle-degrading proteases.—Liang, L., Lou, Z., Ye, F., Yang, J., Liu, S., Sun, Y., Guo, Y., Mi, Q., Huang, X., Zou, C, Meng, Z., Rao, Z., Zhang, K.-Q.

https://openalex.org/W2089694099,"The high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), a DNA architectural protein, is highly regulated during development and plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Indeed, HMGA2 was overexpressed in many different kinds of tumors. However, the mechanisms regulating HMGA2 expression remain elusive. Using microarray analysis, we found that HMGA2, along with a dozen of other genes, was co-repressed by ZBRK1, BRCA1, and CtIP. BRCA1 exerts its transcriptional repression activity through interaction with the transcriptional repressor ZBRK1 in the central domain, and with CtIP in the C-terminal BRCT domain. Here, we show that ZBRK1, BRCA1, and CtIP form a repression complex that coordinately regulates HMGA2 expression via a ZBRK1 recognition site in the HMGA2 promoter. Depletion of any of the proteins in this complex via adenoviral RNA interference in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells activates HMGA2 expression, resulting in increased colony formation in soft agar. Similarly, depletion of ZBRK1, or ectopic overexpression of HMGA2, in MCF10A cells induces abnormal acinar size with increased cell number and inhibits normal acinar formation. Consistently, many BRCA1-deficient mouse breast tumors express higher levels of HMGA2 than BRCA1-proficient tumors. These results suggest that activation of HMGA2 gene expression through derepression of the ZBRK1/BRCA1/CtIP complex is a significant step in accelerating breast tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2146575291,"We have demonstrated previously that the Myc oncoprotein blocks cancer cell differentiation by forming a novel transcriptional repressor complex with histone deacetylase and inhibiting gene transcription of tissue transglutaminase (TG2). Moreover, induction of TG2 gene transcription and transamidase activity is essential for the differentiating effects of retinoids in cancer cells. Here, we show that two structurally distinct TG2 protein isoforms, the full-length (TG2-L) and the short form (TG2-S), exert opposing effects on cell differentiation. Repression of TG2-L with small interfering RNA, which did not affect TG2-S expression, induced dramatic neuritic differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. In contrast, overexpression of TG2-S or a GTP-binding-deficient mutant of TG2-L (R580A), both of which lack the GTP-binding Arg-580 residue, induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation, which was blocked by an inhibitor of transamidase activity. Whereas N-Myc repressed and retinoid activated both TG2 isoforms, repression of TG2-L, but not simultaneous repression of TG2-L and TG2-S, enhanced neuroblastoma cell differentiation due to N-Myc small interfering RNA or retinoid. Moreover, suppression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expression alone induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation, and VIP was up-regulated by TG2-L, but not TG2-S. Taken together, our data indicate that TG2-L and TG2-S exert opposite effects on cell differentiation due to differences in GTP binding and modulation of VIP gene transcription. Our findings highlight the potential importance of repressing the GTP binding activity of TG2-L or activating the transamidase activity of TG2-L or TG2-S for the treatment of neuroblastoma, and possibly also other Myc-induced malignancies, and for enhancing retinoid anticancer effects."
https://openalex.org/W2134705169,"Brain regions that are structurally connected might become functionally connected by synchronization in the gamma-frequency band. In a recent issue of Nature, Colgin et al. show spatially and temporally fine-grained gamma-band synchronization between different parts of the rat hippocampal formation, suggesting a theta-modulated switching of gamma-mediated communication. Brain regions that are structurally connected might become functionally connected by synchronization in the gamma-frequency band. In a recent issue of Nature, Colgin et al. show spatially and temporally fine-grained gamma-band synchronization between different parts of the rat hippocampal formation, suggesting a theta-modulated switching of gamma-mediated communication. In a recent issue of Nature, Colgin et al. show that hippocampal area CA1 can synchronize in the gamma-frequency band with area CA3 or with medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), but usually not with both at the same time (Colgin et al., 2009Colgin L.L. Denninger T. Fyhn M. Hafting T. Bonnevie T. Jensen O. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Nature. 2009; 462: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). When CA1 synchronizes with CA3, this occurs at a relatively low gamma-frequency band, between 25 and 50 Hz. By contrast, when CA1 synchronizes with MEC, this occurs at a relatively high gamma-frequency band, between 65 and 140 Hz. This pattern of synchronization likely results in a functional coupling of CA1 to either CA3 or MEC. CA1 receives input from both CA3 and MEC (Figure 1). While MEC input conveys information about the current position of the animal, CA3 input conveys information about spatial memories. With some simplification, I would like to call the MEC input to CA1 the external “data” and CA3 input to CA1 the internal “model.” The new results of Colgin et al. suggest that these two inputs are accepted by CA1 at different times. When CA1 gamma-synchronizes selectively with one of its inputs, this most likely renders this input more effective, while functionally disconnecting the nonsynchronized input (Fries, 2009Fries P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Gamma-rhythmic activity is brought about by the interplay between local excitatory and inhibitory neuron groups (Buzsáki, 2006Buzsáki G. Rhythms of the Brain. Oxford University Press, Oxford2006Crossref Scopus (2894) Google Scholar, Tiesinga and Sejnowski, 2009Tiesinga P. Sejnowski T.J.

Psychophysiol. 2000; 38: 315-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The local inhibitory network plays a key role by imposing gamma-rhythmic inhibition onto the entire local network. This gamma-rhythmic input is typically mediated via strong perisomatic synapses and thereby conveys a powerful gamma-rhythmic modulation of neuronal excitability (Figure 1). Gamma-rhythmic excitability fluctuations cause gamma-rhythmic modulations of the gain of synaptic input. Input is therefore most effective when it is itself rhythmic and synchronized to its target. In the Colgin et al. study, the target is CA1 and the observed synchronizations to either CA3 or MEC might thus render one of those inputs effective in a selective manner. One interesting prediction is that the selective efficacy of one out of two inputs might be revealed in the population spiking activity of CA1. When CA1 activity reflects the present position of the animal, this should coexist with gamma-band synchronization to MEC. By contrast, when CA1 spiking activity reflects spatial memories unrelated to the present position, this should coexist with gamma-band synchronization to CA3. Future studies might test this prediction. This scheme of neuronal Communication-through-Coherence (CTC) allows the switch of effective connectivity without the need to change structural connectivity (Fries, 2009Fries P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Structural connectivity cannot be modified as flexibly as the pattern of synchronization. Colgin et al. actually find that the selective gamma-band synchronization of CA1 with one of its partners builds up and decays again within the cycle of the theta rhythm. The theta rhythm is the most prominent rhythm of the hippocampus and has a frequency that ranges from 4 to 8 Hz. This frequency band governs some exploratory behaviors like whisking in rodents and free-viewing saccades in monkeys and humans (Berg et al., 2006Berg R.W. Whitmer D. Kleinfeld D. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6518-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Otero-Millan et al., 2008Otero-Millan J. Troncoso X.G. Macknik S.L. Serrano-Pedraza I. Martinez-Conde S. J. Vis. 2008; 8: 21.1-21.18Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The theta rhythm has therefore been called an exploratory rhythm, and this might hold not only at the behavioral, but also at the neurophysiological level. Neuronal networks explore different aspects of sensory data and try to fit learned models to them (Fries, 2009Fries P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Data exploration and model fitting might correspond to the two forms of CA1 synchronization that seem to route MEC and CA3 information, respectively. If CA1 is to provide any sort of integration of the two different types of information, it must keep a trace of one until the other arrives. This might be facilitated by the fact that the two types of information appear to be handled by different sets of neurons in CA1. Colgin et al. find that two largely nonoverlapping sets of CA1 neurons synchronize to the gamma rhythms of MEC and CA3, respectively. Thus, MEC might load new sensory “data” into one set of CA1 neurons during some theta cycles, while during other theta cycles, another set of CA1 neurons might retrieve memorized “models” from CA3. This proposal provides an interesting framework that provides questions for future work: How do the two sets of neurons interact and integrate the specific information they have? How does one set keep its information until the other information comes in? The data of Colgin et al. already give some hint: MEC synchronizes most strongly with CA1 near the trough of the theta cycle. During this theta phase, CA1 is particularly prone for long-term potentiation, and MEC input could leave a trace particularly easily. By contrast, CA3 synchronizes with CA1 most precisely during the early descending part of the theta cycle. This theta phase is associated with memory retrieval. These considerations lead to another important question: What triggers the switch from synchronization with MEC to synchronization with CA3? Colgin et al. report that across theta cycles, CA1 tends to synchronize with CA3 for several theta cycles in a row and then switches to synchronization with MEC, again for several theta cycles in a row. The switching is thus not a simple regular alternation, but is governed by time constants that last across several theta cycles and could be either intrinsic to the hippocampus or coming from outside. It is intriguing to speculate that a framework of gamma-mediated selective communication that is switching communication partners across theta cycles might hold beyond rat hippocampus. In the hippocampus of awake macaque monkeys, a recent study (Jutras et al., 2009Jutras M.J. Fries P. Buffalo E.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12521-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) described two separate gamma-frequency bands that are strikingly similar to those described by Colgin et al. in the rat. While in the rat, the two gamma bands range from 25 to 50 Hz and from 65 to 140 Hz, the monkey shows gamma bands from 30 to 60 Hz and from 60 to 100 Hz. Similar dual gamma-frequency bands have also been described occasionally in human visual cortical activity assessed with magnetoencephalography (Hoogenboom et al., 2006Hoogenboom N. Schoffelen J.M. Oostenveld R. Parkes L.M. Fries P. Neuroimage. 2006; 29: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Swettenham et al., 2009Swettenham J.B. Muthukumaraswamy S.D. Singh K.D. J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). While two coexisting gamma-frequency bands thus appear common to different neural systems, it is less clear whether this duality is functionally significant and if so how. The selective synchronization of one target to either one of two different sources can also be achieved within one gamma band. If one gamma band is sufficiently wide, two (or even more) individual gamma rhythms can fluctuate through the width of the band to avoid being correlated with each other. It is another interesting question for future research to find out whether the coexistence of two separate gamma bands allows neuronal computations beyond those supported by a single gamma band. Besides the two gamma-frequency bands, the main structural and dynamical prerequisites for a theta-modulated communication through gamma coherence can be found widespread:(1)A neuronal target group typically receives convergent input from several distinct sources. In sensory cortex, competing feedforward inputs converge on common postsynaptic targets (Fries, 2009Fries P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The same targets receive also feedback input. Source switching à la Colgin et al. might apply both to competing feedforward inputs and to feedforward versus feedback input.(2)Gamma-band rhythms can be found abundantly in the brain, particularly in the neocortex (Fries, 2009Fries P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). They can be synchronized locally, but also among distant neuronal groups (Buzsáki, 2006Buzsáki G. Rhythms of the Brain. Oxford University Press, Oxford2006Crossref Scopus (2894) Google Scholar).(3)The strength of gamma-band synchronization is typically modulated by the phase of lower-frequency rhythms, particularly theta rhythms (Buzsáki, 2006Buzsáki G. Rhythms of the Brain. Oxford University Press, Oxford2006Crossref Scopus (2894) Google Scholar, Canolty et al., 2006Canolty R.T. Edwards E. Dalal S.S. Soltani M. Nagarajan S.S. Kirsch H.E.

Thus, the theta-modulated switching among alternative gamma-synchronization links described by Colgin et al. is likely a fundamental process of neuronal computation. It will be an important task for future research to test some of the predictions that flow from the discussed concepts and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1973597432,"Although it has been reported that osteopontin, a matrix glycoprotein and proinflammatory cytokine, mediates obesity-induced adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and insulin resistance, it remains unclear how osteopontin is up-regulated in adipose tissue in obese humans and animals. In this study, we incubated U937 mononuclear cells with adipocytes in a transwell system and studied how cell interaction regulated osteopontin expression. Results showed that coculture of U937 cells with adipocytes led to a marked increase in osteopontin production when compared with that released by independent cultures of U937 cells. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide or palmitic acid-induced TLR4 activation and high glucose further augmented the coculture-stimulated osteopontin secretion. Similar observations were made in the coculture of human primary monocytes and adipocytes. Real time PCR studies showed that coculture of U937 cells and adipocytes increased osteopontin mRNA in U937 cells, but not adipocytes, suggesting that adipocyte-derived soluble factor may stimulate osteopontin expression by U937 cells. In our studies to explore the underlying mechanism, we found that the neutralizing antibodies against interleukin (IL)-6 or IL-6 small interfering RNA transfection in adipocytes effectively inhibited coculture-stimulated osteopontin expression, suggesting that IL-6 released by adipocytes plays an essential role in the coculture-stimulated osteopontin expression by U937 cells. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that cell interaction, TLR4 activation, and high glucose up-regulate osteopontin expression, and adipocyte-derived IL-6 played a major role in the up-regulation."

The current study aimed to identify and characterize heparanase splice variants. LEADS, Compugen's alternative splicing modeling platform (Compugen, Tel Aviv, Israel), was used to search for splice variants in silico; tumor-derived cell lines (i.e., CAG myeloma) and tumor biopsies were utilized to validate T5 expression in vivo; signaling (i.e., Src phosphorylation) was evaluated following T5 gene silencing or overexpression and correlated with cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor xenograft development. A novel spliced form of human heparanase, termed T5, was identified. In this splice variant, 144 bp of intron 5 are joined with exon 4, which results in a truncated, enzymatically inactive protein. T5 overexpression resulted in increased cell proliferation and larger colonies in soft agar, mediated by Src activation. Furthermore, T5 overexpression markedly enhanced tumor xenograft development. T5 expression is up-regulated in 75% of human renal cell carcinoma biopsies examined, which suggests that this splice variant is clinically relevant. Controls included cells overexpressing wild-type heparanase or an empty plasmid and normal-looking tissue adjacent the carcinoma lesion. T5 is a novel functional splice variant of human heparanase endowed with protumorigenic characteristics.—Barash, U., CohenKaplan, V., Arvatz, G., Gingis-Velitski, S., Levy-Adam, F., Nativ, O., Shemesh, R., Ayalon-Sofer, M., Ilan, N., Vlodavsky, I.

https://openalex.org/W1987059978,"The T cell-specific tyrosine kinase, p56lck, plays crucial roles in T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated T cell activation. Here, we report that SOCS-6 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-6) is a negative regulator of p56lck. SOCS-6 was identified as a protein binding to the kinase domain of p56lck through yeast two-hybrid screening. SOCS-6 bound specifically to p56lck (F505), which mimics the active form of p56lck, but not to wild type p56lck. In Jurkat T cells, SOCS-6 binding to p56lck was detected 1–2 h after TCR stimulation. Confocal microscopy showed that upon APC-T cell conjugation, SOCS-6 was recruited to the immunological synapse and colocalized with the active form of p56lck. SOCS-6 promoted p56lck ubiquitination and its subsequent targeting to the proteasome. Moreover, SOCS-6 overexpression led to repression of TCR-dependent interleukin-2 promoter activity. These results establish that SOCS-6 acts as a negative regulator of T cell activation by promoting ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.

Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Upon engagement of the antigen-major histocompatibility complex with TCR-CD4-CD8 complexes, p56lck phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the CD3 ξ-chain and provides the binding site for ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase (6.Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Subsequent ZAP-70 activation leads to phosphorylation of signaling proteins, including LAT, and amplification of TCR-mediated signaling (7.Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A.

In this process, p56lck migrates to T cell-APC contact regions known as immunological synapses (IS) and thereby enhances TCR signaling (9.Holdorf A.D. Lee K.H. Burack W.R. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Nat.

Given the importance of p56lck function in T cell activation, establishing how p56lck activity is regulated is essential to understand that activation.

The structure of p56lck is similar to that of other Src family kinases and exhibits the following common domains: N-terminal attachment sites for saturated fatty acid addition, a unique region; an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain; an SH2 domain; a tyrosine kinase domain (SH1); and a C-terminal negative regulatory site, tyrosine 505 (Tyr-505) (11.Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). p56lck kinase activity is regulated by intramolecular interactions through its regulatory domains and/or phosphorylation (11.Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of Tyr-394 in the activation loop of the kinase domain increases enzymatic activity, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr-505 renders the enzyme less active. Phosphorylated Tyr-505 interacts with its own SH2 domain, promoting a closed conformation and maintaining the kinase in an inactive state (12.Gervais F.G. Chow L.M. Lee J.M. Branton P.E. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7112-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phenylalanine substitution of the regulatory tyrosine residue (Y505F) results in a constitutively active form of the protein. The status of the regulatory tyrosine is maintained both by a kinase, Csk, which phosphorylates it (13.Bergman M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A. Amrein K.E. Autero M. Burn P. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and by a transmembrane phosphatase, CD45, which dephosphorylates it (14.Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In addition, p56lck kinase activity is regulated through intramolecular interaction of the SH3 domain with a proline-rich motif in the SH2-kinase linker region. This interaction maintains a conformation in which the kinase domain is inaccessible (15.Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition to intramolecular interaction, protein stability of active p56lck also regulates enzymatic activity. Upon T cell activation, c-Cbl interacts with the SH3 domain of p56lck through its proline-rich motif and then depletes p56lck from plasma membrane lipid rafts (16.Hawash I.Y. Kesavan K.P. Magee A.I. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5683-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Depleted p56lck is ubiquitinated by c-Cbl and subsequently degraded by the proteasome upon T cell activation (17.Rao N. Miyake S. Reddi A.L. Douillard P. Ghosh A.K. Dodge I.L. Zhou P. Fernandes N.D. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3794-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the other hand, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) prevents active p56lck from being targeted for degradation by ubiquitination (18.Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19.Giannini A. Bijlmakers M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5667-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20.Yorgin P.D.

Recent work also suggests that TCR-induced ubiquitination occurs at the IS (21.Wiedemann A. Müller S. Favier B. Penna D. Guiraud M. Delmas C. Champagne E. Valitutti S. Immunol. Lett. 2005; 98: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). During TCR stimulation, ubiquitinated proteins accumulate at the T cell-APC contact site (21.Wiedemann A. Müller S. Favier B. Penna D. Guiraud M. Delmas C. Champagne E. Valitutti S. Immunol. Lett. 2005; 98: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified SOCS-6 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-6) as a protein binding to the kinase domain of p56lck. SOCS-6 is a member of eight SOCS family proteins, including cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS) and SOCS-1–7 (22.Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G.

SOCS proteins contain N termini of various lengths and sequence, an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal SOCS box. The model for activity of SOCS proteins, which is based primarily on studies of CIS and SOCS-1–3, is that upon cytokine binding SOCS genes are rapidly up-regulated, and their protein products block further signaling by inactivating JAK-STAT pathways or targeting binding partners to E3 ubiquitin ligases, thus blunting cytokine responses (26.Kile B.T.

SOCS proteins are connected to the E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex via interaction of SOCS box with elongin BC (27.Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

The elongin BC complex associates with members of the cullin family and Rbx1 to form an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex (29.Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Unlike other SOCS family members, such as SOCS-1–3 and CIS, relatively little is known about functions of SOCS-4–7. SOCS-6 does not interact with molecules in the JAK-STAT pathway or inhibit cytokine signaling (30.Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N. Boivin L.M. Shang Y. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol.

Here, through yeast two-hybrid screening using p56lck as bait, we found that SOCS-6 associated with p56lck and targeted it to proteasomal degradation by promoting its ubiquitination. In response to TCR stimulation, SOCS-6 was recruited to the immunological synapse and colocalized with the active form of p56lck. Furthermore, SOCS-6 overexpression inhibited TCR-dependent IL-2 promoter activation. Theses results provide a novel inhibitory mechanism of T cell activation operating at the level of stability of active p56lck protein. Screening was performed as described previously (33.Park D. Yun Y. Mol. Cells. 2001; 12: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar). The bait plasmid, pGBT9-p56lck SH2-kinase (F505), encodes the SH2 and kinase domains of p56lck. The 2 × 106 transformants of a mouse T cell lymphoma cDNA library (BD Biosciences) were screened. Isolation of true positive clones and determination of binding specificity were performed as described previously (34.Hur E.M. Son M. Lee O.H. Choi Y.B. Park C. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Full-length SOCS-6 cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the mouse T cell lymphoma cDNA library as template and cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). EF/BOS plasmids expressing SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS were obtained from Dr. Tracy A. Willson (35.Alexander W.S. Starr R. Metcalf D. Nicholson S.E. Farley A. Elefanty A.G. Brysha M. Kile B.T.

As baits for the yeast two-hybrid assay, corresponding DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with Pyrobest enzyme (Takara) using primers with EcoRI (5′-primer) or BamHI (3′-primer) site extension. Amplified regions include p56lck kinase (amino acids (aa) 225–509), p56lck SH2-kinase (aa 123–509), p56lck SH2 (aa 123–225), p60src SH2-kinase (aa 150–533), p59fyn SH2-kinase (aa 143–534), Jak1 kinase (aa 855–1152), Tyk2 kinase (aa 897–1176), Itk SH2-kinase (aa 239–615), ZAP-70 kinase (aa 338–600), Abl SH2-kinase (aa 112–493), platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase (aa 560–1014), and epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (aa 1018–1210) domains. After digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, fragments were inserted into corresponding sites of pGBT9 (BD Biosciences). As prey, DNA fragments encoding SOCS-6, SOCS-1, SOCS-2, and p56lck SH2-kinase domain were amplified by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGAD424 (BD Biosciences) using the method described above. For mapping the binding domain using the two-hybrid system, fragments encoding N- or C-terminal deletion mutants of SOCS-6 were generated by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBT9. For in vitro transcription/translation or for mammalian cell expression, DNA fragments encoding Myc/His-tagged SOCS-6 or deleted forms of SOCS-6 were cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pcDNA 3.1 Myc-His (Invitrogen). Internal deletion mutants, SOCS-6 ΔSH2 and ΔKID, were generated by mutagenesis using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To generate GST fusion proteins, a DNA fragment encompassing the p56lck kinase domain was inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX4T-2 (GE Healthcare). The pMT123 plasmid coding for the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin (36.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D.

Blood. 2006; 107: 1521-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are described elsewhere. The pSUPER plasmid (39.Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar) expressing siRNA was produced as described previously (38.Ahn E. Lee H. Yun Y. Blood. 2006; 107: 1521-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Three different 19-nucleotide gene-specific sequences corresponding to 592–610 (TGGAGACCTGCATCTTCAC), 704–722 (GGATCACGGAGCTATTGTC), and 1346–1364 (GGACATACGTCCATAGTTG) in the human SOCS-6 coding region were selected as targets to construct siRNA-expressing vectors. The construct expressing nucleotides 704–722 was determined as effective in reducing SOCS-6 levels and used for the remaining experiments. For control siRNA of nucleotides 704–722, the sequence was changed at the two underlined nucleotides, GGATCACCGAGCTATTCTC. GST or GST-p56lck kinase domain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. SOCS-6 and deletion mutants were synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine using TnT T7-quick coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega). 35S-Labeled proteins were mixed with immobilized GST or GST fusion protein in 1 ml of binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After five washes with 1 ml binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Polyclonal anti-SOCS-6 serum was generated by immunizing rabbits with GST-SOCS-6 fusion protein purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). Polyclonal anti-p56lck serum was also generated using the same method (34.Hur E.M. Son M. Lee O.H. Choi Y.B. Park C. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). OKT3 antibody was previously described (37.Choi Y.B. Kim C.K. Yun Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5242-5249PubMed Google Scholar). To precipitate p56lck, anti-p56lck antibody conjugated to beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-p56lck antibody (Upstate) was employed. Other antibodies were obtained from commercial sources and include the following: anti-SOCS-6, anti-CIS, anti-SOCS-1, anti-HA, anti-ubiquitin, and anti-His tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (UCHT-1) (BD Biosciences); anti-phospho-Src (Tyr-417) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); anti-actin (Sigma), and Alexa 568- or 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Proteasome inhibitors, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLnL) and epoxomycin (Sigma), and Staphylococcus enterotoxin E (SEE) (Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL) were also used. Transfection and T cell activation were performed as described previously (34.Hur E.M. Son M. Lee O.H. Choi Y.B. Park C. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm epoxomycin for 6 h. Jurkat T cells were transfected by electroporation (BTX Co., Ltd.). Briefly, 1.5 × 107 Jurkat T cells were combined with 20 μg of DNA in an electroporation cuvette, pulsed once at 240 V for 25 ms, and incubated overnight at 37 °C for further processing. pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences) was included in the DNA mixture to estimate transfection efficiency. We routinely obtained transfection efficiency of greater than 50% as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of green fluorescent protein-expressing cells. For the in vivo binding assay, Jurkat T cells were activated by cross-linking CD3 with the OKT3 monoclonal antibody. Cells were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor LLnL for 2 h prior to CD3 stimulation. 5 × 107 cells were stimulated by incubating them on plates coated with 10 μg/ml OKT3 antibody in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for the indicated times. After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were extracted in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h on ice. To assay p56lck ubiquitination, 5 × 106 Jurkat T cells were preincubated with LLnL for 2 h and activated by anti-CD3 cross-linking. Subsequently, cells were stimulated by incubation with 10 μg/ml UCHT-1 antibody in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for the indicated times. After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were extracted in NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide, and a protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice. Primary T cells were purified from C57BL/6 mice. Briefly, Thy1.2+ T cells were isolated from pooled lymph nodes and spleen cells by positive selection using the magnetic-activated cell sorting column (Miltenyi Biotec). Resting T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (2.5 μg/ml) antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were prepared in TNE buffer and incubated with 40 μl of 50% slurry of anti-p56lck antibody-conjugated beads overnight at 4 °C. The precipitated p56lck-immune complex was washed five times with TNE or NETN buffer. For Western blot analysis, immune complexes or cell extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Bands were detected using the Advanced ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding Myc-SOCS-6 and p56lck (Tyr-505). T cell-APC conjugates were then formed using Raji B cells as APC (34.Hur E.M. Son M. Lee O.H. Choi Y.B. Park C. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Prior to conjugation, Raji B cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml SEE at 37 °C for 1 h. Transfected Jurkat T cells and Raji B cells were mixed 1:1, immediately transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Slides were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min at room temperature, and incubated with indicated antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, slides were exposed to Alexa 568- or Alexa 488-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After mounting, photographs were taken using a LSM510 META confocal microscope equipped with an Axiovert ×100 1.4 oil immersion objective lens (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Cross-talk was resolved through multitracking of the laser source. Images were automatically assessed for distribution of conjugates along a single two-dimensional optical section (along the x-y axis). The degree of colocalization of two molecules was analyzed by using LSM510 META software. All pixels with the same position in both images were considered coincidental, and the brightness level of each pixel was plotted on the x and y axes. Pearson's correlation coefficient (Rp) provides information on the intensity distribution within the colocalizing region. Rp value of 1.0 represents 100% colocalization. Conjugates with Rp value >0.5 was considered as conjugates with colocalization. For the IL-2-firefly luciferase (IL-2-Luc) reporter assay, Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 μg each of IL-2-Luc along with indicated amounts of plasmids expressing SOCS-6, SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, or CIS using SuperfectTM (Qiagen). The total amount of DNA was kept constant by adjusting with empty vector plus 1 or 10 ng of pTK-R-Luc (Renilla luciferase; Promega, Madison, WI) to normalize transfection efficiency. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated by incubating on OKT3-coated plates or by treatment with 5 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus 500 ng/ml A23187 for 12 h at 37 °C, and then extracted with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assessed using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). To understand the regulatory mechanism of p56lck, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a T cell lymphoma cDNA library using the activated F505 mutant form of p56lck SH2-kinase as bait (34.Hur E.M. Son M. Lee O.H. Choi Y.B. Park C. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37.Choi Y.B. Kim C.K. Yun Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5242-5249PubMed Google Scholar). Partial nucleotide sequencing of positives identified four clones encoding parts of SOCS-6. Binding of SOCS-6 to p56lck was further analyzed in additional yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1). SOCS-6 interacted with the p56lck kinase domain but not with the SH2 domain. SOCS-6 binding was not affected by introduction of a mutation in the autophosphorylation site (the p56lck SH2-kinase (Ala-273) mutant, a catalytically inactive form), indicating that association of p56lck with SOCS-6 does not require kinase activity. Binding specificity of SOCS-family proteins, SOCS-1, 2, and 6, to various protein-tyrosine kinases was analyzed using combinations of baits and preys shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, SOCS-6 more readily bound to the SH2-kinase domain of p56lck (F505) than to that of p60src (Phe-527) and p59fyn (Phe-528). Moreover, SOCS-6 did not interact with kinase domains of other protein-tyrosine kinases examined, namely Abl, Itk, ZAP-70, Jak, Tyk2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor, indicating specificity of the interaction between SOCS-6 and p56lck. As reported previously (25.Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we found that SOCS-1 and SOCS-2 interacted with Jak1/Tyk2 and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, respectively, further supporting specificity of the assay (Fig. 1). Next, we determined the SOCS-6 domain required for interaction with p56lck using SOCS-6 deletion mutants (Fig. 2A). SOCS-6 consists of a long, unique N terminus, an SH2 domain, and a SOCS box. Interestingly, we observed that the N terminus only, but not the SH2 or SOCS box domain, bound to the p56lck kinase domain, and through subsequent domain analysis, we found that a region between aa 47 and 218, thereafter designated the kinase-interacting domain (KID), participates in the interaction. To confirm results shown in Fig. 2A, a set of SOCS-6 deletion mutants shown in Fig. 2B was tested for binding in a GST pulldown assay. In vitro translated and radiolabeled SOCS-6 WT, N, ΔSB, and ΔSH2, all of which contain the N terminus, bound to the GST-p56lck kinase domain but not to GST only. However, SOCS-6 ΔN and ΔKID did not bind to GST-p56lck kinase indicating that KID is essential for binding (Fig. 2C). These results establish p56lck as the first molecule interacting with a unique N-terminal region of SOCS-6. In addition, they explain why a previous report did not detect an interaction between p56lck and SOCS-6 in a yeast two-hybrid assay because the SOCS-6 construct employed as bait in that study lacked the N-terminal region (25.Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether SOCS-6 binds p56lck in mammalian cells. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing SOCS-6 and p56lck (WT or F505). Because SOCS proteins are known to target interacting proteins for proteasomal degradation, we treated cells for 6 h with epoxomicin, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor. In subsequent coimmunoprecipitations, SOCS-6 protein was detected in the p56lck (F505) immunoprecipitates but not in the p56lck (WT) immunoprecipitates, indicating that SOCS-6 specifically interacts with the active (F505) form of p56lck (Fig. 3A). Next, we asked whether endogenous p56lck bound to SOCS-6 following T cell activation. Jurkat T cells were stimulated by CD3 cross-linking, and after 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, interaction between p56lck and SOCS-6 was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, SOCS-6 was detected in p56lck immunoprecipitates starting from 10 min with maximum binding seen at 60 and 120 min after T cell activation but only in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor LLnL (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results show that SOCS-6 interacts with active p56lck and targets active p56lck to proteasomal degradation 60–120 min after T cell activation. When T cells en"

Here, we found that efficient degradation of a physiological substrate UbcH10 requires not only an exogenous polyubiquitin chain modification but also its unstructured N-terminal region. Interestingly, the unstructured N-terminal region of UbcH10 directly binds the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, and it mediates the initiation of substrate translocation. To promote ubiquitin- dependent degradation of the folded domains of UbcH10, its N-terminal region can be displaced by exogenous proteasomal binding elements. Moreover, the unstructured N-terminal region can initiate substrate translocation even when UbcH10 is artificially cyclized without a free terminus. Polyubiquitinated circular UbcH10 is completely degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Accordingly, we propose that degradation of some polyubiquitinated proteins requires two binding interactions: a polyubiquitin chain and an intrinsic proteasomal binding element in the substrates (likely an unstructured region); moreover, the intrinsic proteasomal binding element initiates substrate translocation regardless of its location in the substrates.

The 26 S proteasome-mediated protein degradation is highly regulated and plays pivotal roles in many cellular processes including cell cycle progression, gene transcription, and signal transduction (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is a 2.4-MDa complex consisting of the four ring-stacked, barrel-shaped 20 S proteasome and the 20-subunit regulatory complex, PA700 (19 S regulatory particle) (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). PA700 is essential for processing polyubiquitinated proteins (2DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), it possesses activities of binding a polyubiquitin (polyUb) 4The abbreviations used are: polyUbpolyubiquitinAPC/Canaphase-promoting complex/cyclosomeCDcircular dichroismODCornithine decarboxylaseUbubiquitinSuc-LLVY-AMCsuccinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcourmarinGSTglutathione S-transferaseCIDcollision-induced dissociationMSmass spectroscopy. chain, which engages the substrates to the 26 S proteasome; deubiquitinating the substrates, which could clear the steric restriction of a polyUb chain to facilitate substrate translocation; hydrolyzing ATP that could be used for unfolding the substrates to feed them into the narrow substrate translocation channel consisting of the axial pore of the ATPase ring in PA700 and the α-subunit ring chamber of the 20 S proteasome. Eventually, unfolded substrates are translocated into the central β chamber of the 20 S proteasome for proteolysis. There are three distinct peptidase activities located in the central degradation chamber: the β1-subunit has a caspase-like activity, the β2-subunit has a trypsin-like activity, and the β5-subunit has a chymotrypsin-like activity (2DeMartino G.N.

Binding a substrate to the 26 S proteasome is the initial step for proteolysis. In ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation, three endogenous subunits of the 26 S proteasome have been shown to bind Ub or polyUb chains: the S5a subunit binds a polyUb chain through its two Ub interacting motifs (3Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar); the Adrm1 subunit binds mono or diUb through a pleckstrin-homology domain interaction (4Schreiner P. Chen X. Husnjak K. Randles L. Zhang N. Elsasser S. Finley D. Dikic I. Walters K.J. Groll M. Nature. 2008; 453: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 5Husnjak K. Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L. Shi Y. Hofmann K. Walters K.J. Finley D. Dikic I. Nature. 2008; 453: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar); and the S6′ ATPase subunit binds a polyUb chain as identified by a chemical cross-linking assay (6Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Usually, a tetraUb is the minimal chain length for providing a high binding affinity to the 26 S proteasome (7Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Besides the endogenous proteasomal subunits, several studies have shown that shuttle proteins, such as Rad23, Dsk2, and free Rpn10 (S5a), can help delivery of polyubiquitinated proteins to the yeast 26 S proteasome and promote degradation (8Elsasser S. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, delivering a polyubiquitinated protein to the 26 S proteasome is not a warrant for proteasomal destruction because efficient degradation requires coordinated actions of substrate recognition, deubiquitination, unfolding, translocation, polypeptide hydrolysis, and ATP hydrolysis. Some substrates including both unstructured and folded proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome without a polyubiquitin chain modification. Interestingly, degradation of unstructured proteins by the 26 S proteasome is ATP hydrolysis-independent, indicating that substrate translocation does not consume energy (9Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Presumably, unstructured substrates can enter into the degradation chamber by passive diffusion as proposed by the Brownian ratchet model (11Smith D.M. Benaroudj N. Goldberg A. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, we recently found that the 26 S proteasome degrades unstructured proteins at obviously different rates (12Zhang N.Y. Tang Z. Liu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20288-20298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that the 26 S proteasome discriminates unstructured proteins for proteolysis. Using protein fusion techniques, several studies have shown that an unstructured region could promote degradation (13Prakash S. Tian L. Ratliff K.S. Lehotzky R.E. Matouschek A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 14Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). At least one function of an unstructured region is to initiate substrate translocation and thus, promote degradation (16Schrader E.K. Harstad K.G. Matouschek A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depending on the location of the unstructured region, a substrate could translocate into the degradation chamber from either a free terminus (processive degradation) or an internal site (endoproteolysis). Unequivocal evidence for initiating degradation from an internal site has been demonstrated by using cyclized unstructured proteins, which lack free termini as model substrates (15Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Whereas unambiguous biochemical evidence for endoproteolysis of polyubiquitinated proteins is currently lacking. Physiologically, endoproteolysis might be the mechanism for regulating partial protein proteolysis in processing some transcription factors based on studies in intact cells or using crude cell lysates (17Tian L. Holmgren R.A. Matouschek A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Piwko W. Jentsch S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, releasing of the transcriptionally active N-terminal p90 domain from Spt23, a process stimulated by mono or oligoubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation (19Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 20Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), can still proceed when the C terminus is blocked from degradation by the methotrexate-stabilized dihydrofolate reductase domain in yeast cells (18Piwko W. Jentsch S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, degradation has to initiate from an internal site of Spt23 to produce the intact N-terminal p90 domain. Proteasomal degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a well-characterized example for Ub-independent proteolysis of folded proteins (21Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Upon binding to antizyme 1, the C-terminal 37-amino acid PEST domain of ODC is exposed and mediates Ub-independent degradation of ODC by initiating translocation (22Zhang M. MacDonald A.I. Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20959-20965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By fusion with other proteins, the PEST domain of ODC has been shown to facilitate protein degradation in cells (23Loetscher P. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11213-11220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to its role for initiating translocation, the PEST domain of ODC needs to bind the 26 S proteasome to mediate Ub-independent degradation (24Takeuchi J. Chen H. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), reminiscent of a role of polyUb chains that tether polyubiquitinated proteins to the 26 S proteasome. Moreover, the binding function of the PEST domain can be bypassed by providing an alternative proteasomal binding element such as fusing ODC to the Rpn10 (S5a) subunit of the proteasome (24Takeuchi J. Chen H. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which delivers ODC to the 26 S proteasome by integrating it into the 26 S proteasome complex (24Takeuchi J. Chen H. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Janse D.M. Crosas B. Finley D. Church G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21415-21420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this report, we reconstituted Ub-dependent degradation of the human mitotic-specific E2 enzyme UbcH10 to evaluate substrate recognition and translocation. We found that, in addition to a polyUb chain, a direct interaction between the unstructured N-terminal region of UbcH10 and the 26 S proteasome is mandatory for UbcH10 degradation. These results reveal that the 26 S proteasome recognizes some polyubiquitinated substrates via binding both a polyUb chain and an intrinsic proteasomal binding element in the substrates. Furthermore, we found that the N-terminal region of UbcH10 initiates translocation even when UbcH10 is cyclized. Circular UbcH10 undergoes complete degradation in the presence of a polyUb chain. Thus, our results provide unequivocal in vitro evidence that the 26 S proteasome can catalyze endoproteolysis of polyubiquitinated, folded proteins. Ubiquitin aldehyde, epoxomicin, MG132, and the thrombin cleavage capture kit were purchased from Calbiochem. Succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcourmarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC) was purchased from Bachem. Antibodies were purchased against the following proteins: UbcH10 (Boston Biochemical), Cdc27 (Santa Cruz) and polyhistidine (Sigma). Anti-proteasome antibodies were gifts from Dr. G. N. DeMartino (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The coding sequence of full-length UbcH10 or N-terminally truncated UbcH10 mutant (ΔN10-, ΔN20-, or ΔN28-UbcH10) was subcloned into the pET28(a) vector (Novagen) using the NheI and XhoI sites. Thus, a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site were appended at the N terminus of UbcH10 or UbcH10 mutants, followed by a C-terminal His6 tag. To obtain circular UbcH10 or ΔN10-UbcH10, DNA coding sequence of UbcH10 or ΔN10-UbcH10 was subcloned into the pTWIN1 vector (New England Biolabs) using the SapI site. Certain linkers were introduced to facilitate protein cyclization as indicated in the figure legends. To generate PEST-ΔN28-UbcH10 expression plasmid, the coding sequences of the 37-amino acid PEST domain in ODC and ΔN28-UbcH10 were inserted into the pET28(a) vector by two step ligations using the NdeI, EcoRI, and XhoI sites. To generate Syn1–28-ΔN28-UbcH10, the coding sequences of the N-terminal 28 amino acids of α-synuclein and ΔN28-UbcH10 were sequentially inserted into the PstI, EcoRI, and XhoI sites of the pET28(a) vector in which the original NcoI site was replaced with the PstI site. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and induced by adding 0.2–0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C or 6 h at room temperature. His6-tagged or GST-tagged proteins were purified by using Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Invitrogen) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Circular UbcH10 or ΔN10-UbcH10 was produced and purified according to the protocol provided by New England Biolabs. K48-linked Ub4 chain was synthesized according to an established protocol (26Pickart C.M. Raasi S. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). CD measurements were carried out with a J-810 Jasco spectropolarimeter using a 1.0-mm pathlength quartz cuvette. Spectra were recorded from 250–200 nm with 8 average scans at room temperature. 7.0 μm UbcH10 or UbcH10 mutants were kept in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Buffer alone was recorded and subtracted as the blank. The α-helix content was calculated based on the absorption at 222 nm (27Kwok S.C. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35248-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of UbcH10 or UbcH10 mutants was performed according to our previously published method (12Zhang N.Y. Tang Z. Liu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20288-20298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) complex E3 ligase immunoprecipitated from Xenopus egg extracts. A sample from in-gel trypsin digestion of Ub4-UbcH10 or Ub4-ΔN28-UbcH10 was analyzed on a LTQ-FT Ultra hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Peptide desalting and separation were achieved using a dual capillary/nano pump HPLC system (Agilent 1200, Palo Alto, CA). The nano pump run was 60 min at a flow rate of 350 nl/min. A 70-min gradient from 12 to 35% acetonitrile was used to separate the peptides. The HPLC run was monitored by sequentially recording MS scans in the ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) cell, whereas three MS/MS were obtained in the ion trap via collision-induced dissociation (CID). A raw distiller (UCSF) was used to create de-isotoped centroided peak lists from the raw spectra. These peak lists were searched against all human entries in the SwissProt protein data base using MascotTM server (Version 2.2, Matrix Science). For searches, mass tolerances were ± 10 ppm for MS peaks, and ± 0.6 Da for MS/MS fragment ions. Trypsin specificity was used allowing for 1 missed cleavage. The variable modifications of Met oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, peptide N-terminal Q pyroglutamic acid formation, glycine-glycine of lysine were allowed for the search. An expected value (p value) of <0.05 was considered significant. The 26 S proteasome was purified from bovine red blood cells according to a previous report (10Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The purified 26 S proteasomes usually contain 50% doubly capped and 50% singly capped proteasomes as determined by a native-PAGE assay. We preincubated a 1:2 molar ratio of purified 26 S proteasomes with purified PA700 to produce predominantly doubly capped 26 S proteasome. Degradation was performed according to our published method (10Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol.

The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, then loaded into Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad), which were pre-equilibrated in the degradation buffer and centrifuged according to the manufacturer's instruction. The flow-through was immediately mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer. Proteins in the flow-through were analyzed by immunoblotting. Homemade Sephadex G-100 spin columns were used to assay the interaction between Ub4 conjugates and the 26 S proteasome. The binding assay contained 18 nm of doubly capped 26 S proteasome and 100 nm Ub4 conjugates. The 26 S proteasome was preincubated with 2 μm ubiquitin aldehyde and 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline to block its deubiquitinating activities and 100 μm epoxomicin to block its proteolytic activities. To assay the interaction between UbcH10 and the 26 S proteasome by gel filtration, 200 nm of 26 S proteasome was preincubated with 200 μm MG132 at room temperature for 10 min before adding 2 μm of UbcH10 or ΔN28 UbcH10. After 10 min of incubation, 300-μl mixtures were injected into a Superdex 200 (10/30) gel filtration column on a fast performance liquid chromatography system. Fractions were immunoblotted with an anti-S7 (a subunit of PA700) antibody or an anti-UbcH10 antibody. The 26 S proteasome, UbcH10, or ΔN28 UbcH10 alone was run as a control. Ub-dependent degradation of the E2 enzyme UbcH10 is critical to maintain the levels of several proteins that are substrates of the APC/C E3 Ub ligase during the G1-S phase transition (29Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2004; 432: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Structurally, UbcH10 has four α-helices and four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets with an unstructured N-terminal region containing the first 29 amino acids (30Lin Y. Hwang W.C. Basavappa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21913-21921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether the unstructured N-terminal region of UbcH10 could function similarly as the C-terminal PEST domain of ODC to mediate Ub-independent degradation, we generated bacterial expression constructs for purification of full-length UbcH10 or N-terminally truncated UbcH10 in which the first 28 amino acids were deleted (Fig. 1A). Of note, all UbcH10 and its N-terminally truncated mutants used in this study contained a His6 tag on both N and C termini except where otherwise specified. ΔN28-UbcH10 had indistinguishable secondary structures in comparison with full-length UbcH10 as determined by CD spectrometry (Fig. 1B), indicating that deletion of the unstructured N-terminal region has no effect on the UbcH10 folded structure. Based on absorptions at 222 nm in CD spectra, UbcH10 and ΔN28-UbcH10 contained 21.2% α-helix content, consistent with the value of 26.1% calculated from the crystal structure (30Lin Y. Hwang W.C. Basavappa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21913-21921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Next, we determined whether UbcH10 and ΔN28-UbcH10 can be degraded by purified 26 S proteasomes (Fig. 1, C and D). To exclude any potential effect of the unstructured His6 tag and the thrombin site at the N terminus on degradation, the N-terminal His6/thrombin tag in UbcH10 or ΔN28-UbcH10 was removed by thrombin cleavage for this assay (data not shown), whereas the C-terminal His6 tag was intact. UbcH10-His6 was very slowly cleaved by purified 26 S proteasomes with the accumulation of a large fragment that was recognized by an anti-UbcH10 and an anti-polyhistidine antibody (Fig. 1E), indicating that only the N-terminal region of UbcH10 is accessible for cleavage. Consistent with this finding, deletion of the unstructured N-terminal region caused ΔN28-UbcH10-His6 to be resistant to cleavage by the 26 S proteasome (Fig. 1F). Together, these results demonstrate that the unstructured N-terminal region of UbcH10 can initiate proteasomal degradation; however, it cannot drive complete proteolysis. We have previously reported that K48-linked Ub4-UbcH10 is efficiently degraded by purified 26 S proteasomes (10Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine whether a K48 Ub4 chain can target N-terminally truncated UbcH10 for proteasomal degradation, we generated bacterial expression constructs for purification of UbcH10 deletion mutants in which the first 10, 20, or 28 amino acids were deleted (Fig. 1A and data not shown). A previous study showed that the N-terminal truncation impairs autoubiquitination of UbcH10 catalyzed by Cdh1-activated APC/C, but allows ubiquitination catalyzed by Cdc20-activated APC/C (29Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2004; 432: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The role of the N-terminal region of UbcH10 to enhance UbcH10 autoubiquitination by Cdh1 is unclear. We immunoprecipitated Xenopus APC/C E3 Ub ligase from metaphase egg extracts that lack Cdh1. We found that all UbcH10 mutants were able to be conjugated with a K48-linked Ub4 chain as efficiently as full-length UbcH10 in the presence of E1 and immunoprecipitated APC/C E3 Ub ligase. Furthermore, the conjugated Ub4 chain was resistant to 10 mm dithiothreitol treatment (data not shown), indicating the conjugate is not the ubiquitination intermediate where Ub is linked to the catalytic cysteine of E2s by a thioester bond. We first attempted to identify the K48 Ub4 conjugation site in UbcH10 and ΔN28 UbcH10. Trypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometric determination found that K48 Ub4 was conjugated on the lysine 119 in both UbcH10 and ΔN28 UbcH10 (Fig. 2A and data not shown), demonstrating that they use the same lysine residue for Ub4 conjugation. We next evaluated whether Ub4-conjugated UbcH10 or UbcH10 mutants bind efficiently to the 26 S proteasome using a size exclusion spin column assay. The Sephadex G-100 (exclusion limit of 100 kDa) trapped Ub4-conjugated UbcH10 or UbcH10 mutants after centrifugation (lane 3 in Fig. 2B). In contrast, Ub4 conjugates were coeluted with the 2.4-MDa 26 S proteasome after centrifugation when they were mixed together (lane 2 in Fig. 2B), indicating a direct interaction between them. Furthermore, we examined whether Ub4-conjugated UbcH10 or UbcH10 mutants are able to efficiently bind the S5a subunit of the 26 S proteasome, one of the primary polyUb chain receptors of mammalian 26 S proteasomes (3Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, we found that Ub4-conjugatged UbcH10 and its N-terminally truncated mutants all efficiently bound to GST-S5a, but not GST (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, we conclude that a K48-linked Ub4 chain can target UbcH10 and its N-terminal deletion mutants to the 26 S proteasome. Next, we examined whether Ub4-conjugated UbcH10 mutants are proteolytic substrates of purified 26 S proteasomes. Compared with the 12-min degradation, inhibition of the 26 S proteasome by epoxomicin caused the accumulation of more non-ubiquitinated UbcH10 or ΔN10-UbcH10 concomitantly with more Ub4-conjugated forms left (Fig. 2, C, D, and G), indicating degradation. In contrast, Ub4-ΔN20-UbcH10 and Ub4-ΔN28-UbcH10 were only slowly deubiquitinated without degradation as evidenced by the accumulation of mono-, di-, and tri-ubiquitinated UbcH10 mutants (Fig. 2, E, F, and G). Similar results were obtained when only C-terminally His6-tagged UbcH10 or ΔN28 UbcH10 was used for ubiquitination, and then proteasomal degradation (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that the degradation-resistance of ΔN28-UbcH10 is not caused by the N-terminal His6 tag. Also, an N-terminally truncated UbcH10 mutant (ΔN27-UbcH10) was found to be stable in HeLa cell lysates, although it is ubiquitinated (29Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2004; 432: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, the unstructured N-terminal region of UbcH10 is necessary for mediating its Ub-dependent degradation. Next, we sought to understand why the N-terminal region of UbcH10 is required to mediate Ub-dependent degradation. One possible reason for the degradation-resistance of Ub4-ΔN20- and Ub4-ΔN28-UbcH10 is that both of them have shorter unstructured N-terminal regions compared with that in full-length or ΔN10-UbcH10 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). To assess this possibility, we cleaved the N-terminal His6/thrombin tag in ΔN10-UbcH10 by thrombin digestion (Fig. 3A). The resulting shorter ΔN10-UbcH10 has an unstructured N-terminal region containing a total of 24 amino acids in which 19 amino acids are from the original UbcH10 N terminus (termed ΔN10-UbcH1024). The length of the unstructured N-terminal region in ΔN10-UbcH1024 is equal to that in ΔN28-UbcH10, which mostly consists of a His6 tag and the thrombin cleavage sequence. CD spectroscopic determination revealed that deletion of the N-terminal His6 tag had no effect on the secondary structures of ΔN10-UbcH10 (data not shown). After conjugation with a K48-linked Ub4 chain, Ub4-ΔN10-UbcH1024 was efficiently degraded by purified 26 S proteasomes (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that the length of the unstructured N terminus is not responsible for the degradation-resistance of Ub4-ΔN28-UbcH10. Another possible reason for the degradation-resistance of Ub4-ΔN20- and Ub4-ΔN28-UbcH10 is that they might lack a translocation initiation site. However, His6-ΔN28-UbcH10-His6 was slowly cleaved by purified 26 S proteasomes with the accumulation of a large degradation fragment recognized by an anti-UbcH10 antibody (supplemental Fig. S3A), indicating that the unstructured N-terminal His6/thrombin tag region in His6-ΔN28-UbcH10-His6 can initiate substrate translocation for partial cleavage. Similarly, the 24-amino acid unstructured N terminus in ΔN10-UbcH1024 was slowly cleaved by the 26 S proteasome as well (supplemental Fig. S3B). Thus, degradation of Ub4-conjugated ΔN10-UbcH1024 but His6-ΔN28-UbcH10-His6 suggests that the unstructured N-terminal region of UbcH10 has an additional function besides initiating substrate translocation. The C-terminal PEST domain of ODC was shown to promote degradation of its fused proteins (22Zhang M. MacDonald A.I. Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20959-20965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether the unstructured PEST domain can replace the N-terminal region of UbcH10 to mediate degradation of ΔN28-UbcH10. To test this, we fused the PEST domain of ODC at the N terminus of ΔN28-UbcH10 (Fig. 3C). The size exclusion spin column assay showed that PEST-ΔN28-UbcH10 bound the 26 S proteasome (Fig. 3D), whereas ΔN28-UbcH10 did not (Fig. 4A), indicating that the PEST domain mediates the substrate binding of the"
https://openalex.org/W2147428279,"Sus1 is a central component of the yeast gene gating machinery, the process by which actively transcribing genes such as GAL1 become associated with nuclear pore complexes. Sus1 is a component of both the SAGA transcriptional co-activator complex and the TREX-2 complex that binds to nuclear pore complexes. TREX-2 contains two Sus1 chains that have an articulated helical hairpin fold, enabling them to wrap around an extended alpha-helix in Sac3, following a helical hydrophobic stripe. In SAGA, Sus1 binds to Sgf11 and has been proposed to provide a link between SAGA and TREX-2. We present here the crystal structure of the complex between Sus1 and the N-terminal region of Sgf11 that forms an extended alpha-helix around which Sus1 wraps in a manner that shares some similarities with the Sus1-Sac3 interface in TREX-2. However, the Sus1-binding site on Sgf11 is somewhat shorter than on Sac3 and is based on a narrower hydrophobic stripe. Engineered mutants that disrupt the Sgf11-Sus1 interaction in vitro confirm the importance of the hydrophobic helical stripe in molecular recognition. Helix alpha1 of the Sus1-articulated hairpin does not bind directly to Sgf11 and adopts a wide range of conformations within and between crystal forms, consistent with the presence of a flexible hinge and also with results from previous extensive mutagenesis studies (Klöckner, C., Schneider, M., Lutz, S., Jani, D., Kressler, D., Stewart, M., Hurt, E., and Köhler, A. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 12049-12056). A single Sus1 molecule cannot bind Sgf11 and Sac3 simultaneously and this, combined with the structure of the Sus1-Sgf11 complex, indicates that Sus1 forms separate subcomplexes within SAGA and TREX-2."

In normal tissues, human and mouse Piwil2 are primarily expressed in testis but widely expressed in tumors. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In vertebrates, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling plays an important role in patterning embryo and control of cell growth and differentiation. A previous study has shown a role for Zili, a Piwil2 gene in zebrafish, in germ cells in zebrafish. Here we report that zili functions in patterning the early embryo and inhibits TGF-β signaling.

Ectopic expression of zili causes fusion of the eyes and reduction of mesodermal marker genes expression, suggesting that zili functions to inhibit Nodal signaling and mesoderm formation. Genetic interaction shows that zili inhibits Nodal and bone morphogenetic protein signaling. The results of protein interaction assays identify that Zili binds to Smad4 via its N-terminal domain and prevents the formation of Smad2/3/4 and Smad1/5/9/4 complexes to antagonize TGF-β signaling.

All of the animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practices as defined by the National Zebrafish Resources of China and The Zebrafish Book (17Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1993Google Scholar), and all of the animal work was approved by the National Zebrafish Resources of China and West China Hospital. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) AB strain was provided by the National Zebrafish Resources of China and kept at 28.5 °C. The embryos were obtained by natural mating and cultured in embryo medium (17Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1993Google Scholar). Staging of the embryos was carried out according to Kimmel et al. (18Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8773) Google Scholar). Based on homology analysis, hili and mili mRNA sequence were used to search the homologous zebrafish genomic and expressed sequence tag sequence. Four pairs of primers (85U and 1158L; 891U and 1953L; 1759U and 2760L; and 2627U and 3519L) were designed for amplifying the coding region of zili (supplemental Table S1). Subsequently, recombinant PCR was used for gaining the complete coding region. 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed using the SMARTTM rapid amplification of cDNA ends cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) with designed specific primers (3345U for 3′ and 182L for 5′ end; supplemental Table S1). The whole zili mRNA sequence was obtained by assembling the sequences acquired as described above. Zili antibody was raised in rabbits with the synthetic peptide MDPKRPTFPSPPGVI+C published by Houwing et al. (11Houwing S. Berezikov E. Ketting R.F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2702-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Primer sequences for amplifying the 470-bp β-actin were designed according to Kaslin et al. (19Kaslin J. Nystedt J.M. Ostergård M. Peitsaro N. Panula P. J.

The coding sequence of zili was cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) for capped mRNA synthesis. Myc/HA/FLAG tag coding sequence was added upstream of zili and Smads cDNA, respectively, and fused sequences were cloned into pcDNA3.1+ for capped mRNA synthesis and transfection. The full-length coding region of zili was also cloned into pEGFP-N1 for expression of Zili-GFP fusion protein to generate plasmid that was used for testing the effectiveness of zili-MO1. Interesting the fragments were cloned into pSPT18/19 (Roche Applied Science) for antisense RNA synthesis. TRIpure reagent, a gel extraction kit, and a high purity plasmid preparation kit were purchased from Bioteke Corporation (Beijing, China) for total RNA extraction, PCR product purification, and plasmid preparation. IHC was performed as described in the Zebrafish Book (17Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1993Google Scholar); in situ hybridization protocols were performed as described in the Zebrafish Book (17Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book.

For two-color whole mount RNA in situ hybridization between zili and vasa or nanos1, zili RNA probe was labeled by digoxigenin, and vasa or nanos1 was labeled by Fluorescein. Colocalization of vasa RNA and Zili protein was performed as described by Knaut et al. (21Knaut H. Pelegri F. Bohmann K. Schwarz H. Nüsslein-Volhard C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 875-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and Ober and Schulte-Merker (22Ober E.A. Schulte-Merker S. Dev.

Three zili morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, a translation blocker (zili-MO1, 5′-GAT CCA TTT CTT CCT CTG TTG CAC T-3′), a splice inhibitor (zili-MO2, 5′-TGG TGT TAC TGA ATG TCA CCT GAT C-3′), and 5-mis-pair control morpholino (zili-cMO, 5′-GAT gCA TTT gTT CgT CTc TTG gAC T-3′) were designed and synthesized by Gene-tools (Philomath, OR). After lineage by appropriate restriction enzymes, capped mRNAs were synthesized using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE® kit (Ambion); antisense RNAs for in situ hybridization were synthesized using a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (SP6/T7) (Roche Applied Science) and purified by MEGAclear (Ambion). Two nonoverlapping probes, localizing at positions 252–1293 and 2763–3626 bp, were designed for zili in situ hybridization detection. Morpholinos or synthetic capped mRNAs were injected into single-cell embryos. The injection dose was an estimated amount received by a single embryo. For the RNA injection experiment, the control embryos were injected with GFP mRNA. Composite of capped mRNAs or mopholinos were injected into single-cell embryos, and 100 embryos at the 50% epiboly stage were used for immunostaining and immunoprecipitation analysis. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA transfection into HEK293 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The Universal protein extraction buffers were purchased from Bioteke Corporation (Beijing, China). Immunostaining, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as described in the product information. Antibodies against FLAG tag, HA tag, and Myc tag were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Abcam. Antibodies against Smad2/3/4 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. A bacterial two-hybrid experiment was performed as the described in the protocol provided by the exclusive Stratagene BacterioMatch® II two-hybrid system. Both zili and Smad4 were inserted into pBT and pTRG plasmid, respectively, by EcoRI and XhoI restriction. The 3656-bp nucleotide sequence of zili mRNA has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession number EF186090. For the functional regions analysis below, we analyze the zili mRNA sequence by bioinformatics protocols. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, the predicted open reading frame from nucleotides 282 to 3422 is 3138 bp in length and encodes a polypeptide of 1046 amino acid residues. Similar to other Piwi protein members, Zili also has PAZ and Piwi conserved domains at position 483–569 and 741–1032, suggesting functional similarity and conservation. Later, Houwing et al. (11Houwing S. Berezikov E. Ketting R.F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2702-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) submitted another 3389-bp sequence related to zili gene under accession number FJ168029. They analyzed Zili protein expression in primordial germ cells (PGCs) by an antibody raised against the N terminus of Zili, and found that Zili protein can be detected in PGCs from 3 days post-fertilization onwards. However, they did not detect the whole mount spatiotemporal expression pattern of Zili. Here, we also raised the antibody in rabbits according to the synthetic peptide MDPKRPTFPSPPGVI+C published by Houwing et al. (11Houwing S. Berezikov E. Ketting R.F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2702-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and analyzed the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Zili by using whole mount IHC. Consistent with Houwing et al., Zili can be detected in PGCs at 3 days post-fertilization (Fig. 1, K–M). However, expression of Zili also can be detected in axis before 3 days post-fertilization. The results show that the Zili protein appears in the one-cell stage and in all blastodermal cells until the dome stage (Fig. 1, A–C). At the onset of gastrulation, Zili expression starts to concentrate on the axis (Fig. 1D). When segmentation starts, Zili is expressed in axis ubiquitously (Fig. 1, E and F), and then branchial and pharyngeal arches gradually gain stronger expression (Fig. 1G). Interestingly, Zili expression on the axis begins to weaken after Prim-5 stage (24 hpf) (Fig. 1, H–K). At 3 days post-fertilization, Zili can be detected in PGCs easily but not in other parts of embryo. Next, expression of zili mRNA during zebrafish embryogenesis was examined by using whole mount in situ hybridization, and two nonoverlapping probes for zili, localizing at positions 252–1293 bp (probe 1) and 2763–3626 bp (probe 2), were used to demonstrate specificity and obtain identical spatially restricted expression patterns (20Thisse C. Thisse B. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). The results of in situ hybridization show that spatiotemporal expression pattern of zili transcript is similar to Zili protein (supplemental Fig. S2). Differently, expression of zili transcript is detectable weakly in two clusters both laterally from the eight-somite stage onwards (supplemental Fig. S2, D–S). Double staining with zili and vasa or nanos1, PGCs markers, shows that the both lateral cluster domains of zili colocalize with the vasa or nanos1 expression domain, and the results detected by probe 2 are consistent with probe 1 (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting the specificity and identical spatially restricted expression patterns of zili transcript. Additionally, we also performed reverse transcription-PCR to detect zili mRNA from the one-cell stage (supplemental Fig. S3M), and the amplified fragment was confirmed by sequencing. These expression patterns suggest that zili is maternal expressed and plays a role not only in PGCs development but also in early axis formation especially before 24 hpf. To study the function of zili, endogenous expression of zili was knocked down by injecting a translation blocker (zili-MO1) antisense morpholino, which was able to block production of the Zili-GFP fusion protein from a Zili-GFP fusion expression plasmid (supplemental Fig. S4, A–C). Embryos injected with 5 ng of zili-MO1 exhibited dorsalized phenotypes at 24 hpf, including loss of the ventral tail fin and a shorter tail (Fig. 2B), which were described by Mullins et al. (23Mullins M.C. Hammerschmidt M. Kane D.A. Odenthal J. Brand M. van Eeden F.J. Furutani-Seiki M. Granato M. Haffter P. Heisenberg C.P. Jiang Y.J. Kelsh R.N. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Development. 1996; 123: 81-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the specification of zili-MO1, zili mRNA was synthesized for rescuing the phenocopy mediated with zili-MO1. The results showed that 30 pg of zili mRNA can relieve the dorsalized phenotypes in 86% (n = 147) embryos (supplemental Fig. S4, E and J), suggesting that zili-MO1 could specifically block translation of zili mRNA. Furthermore, according to the recommendations of Eisen and Smith (24Eisen J.S. Smith J.C. Development. 2008; 135: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), a splice inhibitor (zili-MO2) was designed and synthesized against zili to identify the specific effects of zili-MO1 once again. Consistent with zili-MO1, injected embryos also exhibited dorsalized phenotypes (supplemental Figs. S4, F–J, and S5), suggesting that dorsalization is the specific phenotype caused by zili knockdown, and injection of 5 ng zili-MO1 was used in experiments below. To investigate the role of zili in embryonic development, we then injected zebrafish embryos with synthetic zili mRNA. Injection with 30 pg of zili mRNA caused partial or complete fusion of the eyes (Fig. 2, C and E) in 11% (n = 12) embryos at 24 hpf, resembling the lefty1 mRNA injection (Fig. 2G), which result from insufficient Nodal signaling of TGF-β pathway (25Cheng S.K. Olale F. Brivanlou A.H. Schier A.F. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E30Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Overexpression of zili also caused a partial loss of the notochord and tail reduction. Injection of zili mRNA also led to reduction of axial and lateral mesodermal marker shh and snail1 expression at 24 hpf (Fig. 2, I–K and M–O). These results suggest that zili functions to inhibit mesoderm formation. Evidence above suggests that the lack of Zili protein lead to dorsalization of embryo in early development of zebrafish. However, Houwing et al. (11Houwing S. Berezikov E. Ketting R.F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2702-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) reported that the screened zili mutant ziliG51STOP does not display any patterning defects, suggesting that 50 amino acids at N terminus of Zili protein may play a role to maintain the normal early embryogenesis. So we isolated the sequence encoding the 50 amino acids at the N terminus of Zili protein and transcribed to mRNA. Injection of 50 pg of Zili-N50 mRNA to the one-cell stage embryos also caused fusion of the eyes, partial loss of notochord, tail reduction, and reduction of shh and snail1 expression at 24 hpf (Fig. 2, D, F, L, and P). Moreover, we asked whether Zili-N50 could rescue the deficiency of complete Zili protein and maintain normal embryogenesis. Coinjection of Zili-N50 mRNA and zili-MO1 or 2 were performed, and phenocopy of dorsalization caused by zili-MOs can be recovered (supplemental Fig. S4, K–M). The results of the patterning defect caused by zili-N50 mRNA similar to complete zili mRNA and effects of zili-N50 mRNA to recover zili-MOs suggest that a role for zili-N50 is similar to complete Zili protein during early embryogenesis. This may provide some explanation as to why the mutant ziliG51STOP does not show any patterning defect during early embryogenesis. Because zili overexpression caused fusion of the eyes, suggesting inhibition of Nodal signaling of TGF-β pathway, we asked whether zili was involved in Nodal signals and mediated their activities. We analyzed Nodal signaling factor sqt and cyc expression in the zebrafish embryos in which activities of the zili were altered transiently. Injection with zili-MO induced sqt and cyc expression in 54% (n = 28) and 64% (n = 36) embryos and zili mRNA abolished these factors in 96% (n = 40) and 45% (n = 20) embryos at the 50% epiboly stage (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, we tested the genetic interaction between zili and sqt/cyc that is essential for the formation of the axial mesoderm. Coinjection with 10 pg of zebrafish sqt mRNA and zili-cMO led to expanded expression of shh in 67% embryos (n = 40) at the bud stage. When the same amount of sqt mRNA and zili-MO were coinjected, the percentage of expanded shh increased to 80% (n = 48). In contrast, coinjection with sqt mRNA and 30 pg of zili mRNA caused the percentage of embryos with expanded shh expression decreasing to 47% (n = 32), and a similar case occurs when we examine the dorsal marker gsc (26Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) expression (Fig. 3, B and D). Furthermore, the genetic interaction between zili and cyc was consistent with zili and sqt. The percentage of expanded expression of shh and gsc decreased with the increased zili expression (Fig. 3, C and E). These results suggest that zili antagonizes the Nodal signal activity of the TGF-β pathway during the early development of zebrafish embryos. Nodal pathway activity is transduced by the R-Smads Smad2 and/or Smad3, together with the common mediator-Smad (co-Smad) Smad4 (16Shen M.M. Development. 2007; 134: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 27Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). The Smad2/3 interacts with Smad4 to activate responsive gene expression. So we asked whether zili could inhibit the endogenous interaction between Smad2/3 and Smad4. Immunoprecipitation experiments in zebrafish embryos revealed that the amount of Smad2/3 coimmunoprecipitated with Smad4 decreased in the presence of the increasing amount of Zili (Fig. 4, A and B), although neither the Smad2/3 level nor the Smad4 level in total embryo lysate was altered. Next, to test the physical interaction between Zili and Smad2/3/4, we performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation of endogenous Zili and Smad2/3/4 in zebrafish embryos. The result indicated that Zili was coimmunoprecipitated with Smad4 (Fig. 4C) and not with Smad2/3 (data not shown). In addition, the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 could not be altered by ectopic Zili expression (supplemental Fig. S6). Immunostaining in zebrafish embryo cells at the 50% epiboly stage revealed that Zili was located almost in the nuclei and overlapped well with Smad4 in the nucleus (Fig. 4D). Thus, Smad4 is a binding partner of Zili. These results suggest that Zili inhibits the interaction between Smad2/3 and Smad4 solely by competing with Smad2/3 for Smad4. To further consolidate interaction between Zili and Smad4, we constructed a series of Zili protein deletion mutants to identify the functional domains of Zili that are required for interacting with Smad4. The Zili mutant ZD1, deletion of 161 amino acids at the N terminus of the Zili protein, failed to bind to Smad4, whereas other deletion mutants, including PAZ and Piwi conserved domain deletion, retained the ability to bind Smad4 (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the 161 amino acids at N terminus of Zili protein is responsible for interaction with Smad4. This result and the discovery of Piwil2 in mouse (Mili) interacting with Tdrd1 by Wang et al. (28Wang J. Saxe J.P. Tanaka T. Chuma S. Lin H. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 640-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) suggest that the N terminus is an important functional region to Piwil2. Then we constructed Smad4 protein deletion mutants to identify the domain of Smad4 for binding to Zili. The results show that the MH2 domain of Smad4 is the binding site of Zili (Fig. 5, E and F), which is same site to which Smad2/3/1/5/9 bind (29Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). In addition, interaction between Zili and Smad4 was also validated by the two-hybrid experiment (supplemental Fig. S7). According to the suggestion of mutant ziliG51STOP and the role for Zili-N50 in early embryogenesis described above, we asked whether the isolated 50 amino acids at the N terminus of the Zili protein could bind to Smad4. First, deletion of 50 amino acids at the N terminus of the Zili protein (ZD-N50) was constructed for the coimmunoprecipitation with Smad4. The result shows that the ability of Zili protein without the 50 amino acids at the N terminus to bind to Smad4 is obviously weaker than complete protein (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the 50-amino acid region at the N terminus of Zili is important for binding to Smad4. Then interaction of Smad4 with the isolated 50 amino acids (Zili-N50) was examined. As shown in Fig. 5D, Zili-N50 was coimmunoprecipitated with Smad4. Our results show that Zili functions in early embryogenesis, and the N terminus is the key region to this process. Houwing et al. (11Houwing S. Berezikov E. Ketting R.F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2702-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) focus on the role for Zili in germ cell and Piwi-interacting RNAs, the well known function of Piwi protein depending on PAZ and PIWI domain (6Seto A.G. Kingston R.E. Lau N.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results and the well known function suggest that zili gene has multiple functional regions and possesses functional diversity, participating in different biological processes at different developmental stages. Because Smad4 is the co-Smad of TGF-β pathway and related to BMP signaling (12Whitman M. Raftery L. Development. 2005; 132: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 30Kondo M. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we investigated the interaction between Zili and the rest of the Smads. In HEK293 cells, with Smad4 as a positive control, overexpressed Zili bound weakly to Smad6a, which is not the binding partner of Smad4; interaction with other Smads, including Smad1, 3b, 5, 6b, 7, and 9, was almost undetectable (Fig. 6A). This result suggests that Zili may compete with Smad1/5/9 for Smad4 to inhibit BMP signaling. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Zili overexpression inhibited the interaction of Smad4 with Smad1/5/9 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, B–D). These effects were confirmed by examination of the expression of the BMP ligand bmp2b and the known BMP transcriptional target vent (31Ramel M.C. Lekven A.C. Development. 2004; 131: 3991-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) at the Shield stage (Fig. 6E). As described by Houwing et al. (11Houwing S. Berezikov E. Ketting R.F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2702-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), the ziliG51STOP/G51STOP mutant is a good model for elucidating the role for Zili in Piwi-interacting RNAs control and germ cell differentiation. As shown by Houwing et al. in their Fig. 3B, by whole mount in situ hybridization of wild type and ziliG51STOP/G51STOP (zili−/− in the figure) gonads at 6 weeks post-fertilization (upper panel) and 7 weeks post-fertilization (lower panel), using an antisense probe for vasa, the authors observed a strong reduction in the amount of vasa-positive cells, which are completely lost at 8 weeks post-fertilization. Consistent with this result, with careful observation, supplemental Fig. S7A in Houwing et al. (11Houwing S. Berezikov E. Ketting R.F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2702-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) paper shows that the brown staining reduces remarkably but is still clearly visible in the ziliG51STOP/G51STOP (zili−/− in the figure) gonads at 6 weeks of age compared with wild type siblings, suggesting the existence of protein that can be recognized by the Zili antibody used in the study. In brief, the remarkable reduction in the number of germ cells in zili mutant (ziliG51STOP/G51STOP) gonads at 6 weeks of age compared with wild type siblings (Fig. 3B in Houwing's paper) provides an explanation as to why the brown staining (indicating the existence of protein recognized by the Zili antibody) is reduced but visible in the mutant (ziliG51STOP/G51STOP) gonads at 6 weeks of age (supplemental Fig. S7A in Houwing's paper), and this explanation is evidenced by the significant reduction of Ziwi (red) protein in the mutant (ziliG51STOP/G51STOP) gonads at 6 weeks post-fertilization compared with wild type siblings (Fig. 3C in Houwing's paper). Considering that the mutant (G51STOP) identified by sequencing by Houwing et al. cannot encode entire Zili protein, the above results suggest the existence of a mutant Zili (G51STOP) protein that can also be recognized by the antibody raised against the N terminus of Zili (11Houwing S. Berezikov E. Ketting R.F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2702-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) in the zili mutant (ziliG51STOP/G51STOP). Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides function by binding to premessenger or messenger RNA, blocking access to the RNA. Diminution of the entire Zili protein induced by translation blocker (zili-MO1) and splice inhibitor (zili-MO2) morpholino used in this study was identified by the Zili antibody raised by the synthetic peptide published by Houwing et al. (supplemental Fig. S5B), and the specification of the zili-MOs is also confirmed (supplemental Fig. S4). Logically, the fact that the mutant (ziliG51STOP/G51STOP) screened by Houwing et al. does not display any patterning defect suggests that the 50 amino acids at the N terminus of the Zili protein may play a role in maintaining normal early embryogenesis. Our analysis of the 50 amino acids at the N terminus of the Zili protein may provide some explanation as to why the mutant ziliG51STOP keeps normal patterning during early embryogenesis. Stringent control of TGF-β signaling through the regulation of Smads is critical for normal embryo patterning. Smad4, co-Smad in TGF-β pathway, is involved in Nodal and BMP signaling and regulates genes related to different biological progress. Assembly of the Smad activator complex allows subsequent nuclear import of R-Smads. The inhibition of the interaction of Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/9 with Smad4 conversely serves as an important countermechanism for TGF-β signaling (32Inman G.J. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33Xu L. Kang Y. Cöl S. Massagué J. Mol.

Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Here we present several lines of evidence demonstrating that Zili inhibits the complex formation of phosphorylated R-Smads with Smad4, which provides some insights into how TGF-β signaling is terminated. First, zili inhibits the transcriptional activity of the Nodal and BMP ligands sqt, cyc, and bmp2b (Figs. 3A and 6E). Second, zili antagonizes the activity of Nodal and BMP signaling mediated with sqt, cyc, and bmp2b by detecting the marker genes shh, gsc, and vent (Figs. 3, B–E, and 6E). Third, overexpression of zili weakens the interaction of Smad4 with Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/9 (Figs. 4, A and B, and 6, B–D). Lastly, Zili binds to Smad4 and colocalizes in nucleus (Fig. 4, C and D). Because the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 could not be affected by ectopic zili expression, Zili demolishes the complex of Smad2/3/4 and Smad1/5/9/4 solely by competing with Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/9 for Smad4 to inhibit the activity of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 7). To study the function of piwil2 gene in zebrafish (zili), we examined its expression patterns during early embryogenesis and got clues that zili played a role not only in PGC development but also in early axis formation. Ectopic expression of zili on zebrafish embryo development suggested that zili inhibited TGF-β signaling and mesoderm formation. Subsequently, the results of interaction between Zili and Smads proteins showed that Zili was a binding partner of Smad4 and prevented formation of the Smad2/3/4 and Smad1/5/9/4 complexes. Briefly, this work shows that zili functions to early embryogenesis beyond the germ line as a novel negative regulator of TGF-β signaling by interacting with Smad4, extending the function of Piwi proteins in vertebrates. Considering that inactivation of Smad4-mediated pathway could lead to cancer and mammal Piwil2 functioned in cancer and testis, our study might offer a new perspective to other biological approaches.

The rational design of an inhibitor for MβLs has been limited by an incomplete knowledge of their catalytic mechanism and by the structural diversity of their active sites. Here we show that the MβL GOB from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is active as a monometallic enzyme by using different divalent transition metal ions as surrogates of the native Zn(II) ion. Of the metal derivatives in which Zn(II) is replaced, Co(II) and Cd(II) give rise to the most active enzymes and are shown to occupy the same binding site as the native ion. However, Zn(II) is the only metal ion capable of stabilizing an anionic intermediate that accumulates during nitrocefin hydrolysis, in which the C–N bond has already been cleaved. This finding demonstrates that the catalytic role of the metal ion in GOB is to stabilize the formation of this intermediate prior to nitrogen protonation. This role may be general to all MβLs, whereas nucleophile activation by a Zn(II) ion is not a conserved mechanistic feature.

The design of an efficient pan-MβL inhibitor has been mostly limited by a striking diversity in the active site structures, catalytic profiles, and metal ion requirements for activity among different enzymes.

Comparison of their structures reveals a common αβ/βα sandwich fold, in which diverse insertions and deletions have resulted in different loop topologies and, ultimately, in different zinc coordination environments and metal site occupancies (Fig. 1). MβLs bind up to two metal ions in their active sites. In B1 and B3 enzymes, Zn1 is tetrahedrally coordinated to three histidine ligands (His116, His118, and His196 in Fig. 1, A and C) and a water/OH− molecule (3H site), which is the attacking nucleophile (13Fabiane S.M.

The coordination polyhedron of Zn2 in B1 enzymes is provided by Asp120, Cys221, His263, and one or two water molecules (DCH site) (Fig. 1A) (13Fabiane S.M. Sohi M.K. Wan T. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H.

Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Notably, this site constitutes the active species in mono-Zn(II) B2 enzymes (Fig. 1B) (24Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Instead, two mutations (C221S and R121H) affect the Zn2 coordination geometry in B3 MβLs, and the metal ion is now bound to Asp120, His121, His263, and one or two water molecules, whereas Ser221 is no longer a metal ligand (DHH site) (Fig. 1C) (28Ullah J.H.

A remarkable exception is constituted by the deepest branching member of the MβL B3 subclass, GOB from E. meningoseptica (4Hall B.G. Salipante S.J. Barlow M. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In all reported GOB sequences, His116 and Ser221 are substituted by Gln and Met, respectively, suggesting the presence of an unusually perturbed metal binding site within this subclass. We have recently reported a biochemical and biophysical characterization of GOB-18 (33Morán-Barrio J. González J.M. Lisa M.N. Costello A.L. Peraro M.D. Carloni P. Bennett B. Tierney D.L. Limansky A.S. Viale A.M. Vila A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18286-18293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast to all known MβLs, GOB-18 is fully active against a broad range of β-lactam substrates using a single Zn(II) ion. Based on spectroscopic, mutagenesis, and modeling experiments, we already proposed that the Zn(II) ion is bound to Asp120, His121, His263, and one or two solvent molecule(s) (i.e. in the canonical Zn2 site of dinuclear MβLs) (Fig. 1D). These findings are puzzling because, although it is accepted that B2 lactamases may work without a metal-activated nucleophile (24Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 36Simona F. Magistrato A. Dal Peraro M. Cavalli A. Vila A.J. Carloni P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28164-28171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), this is not the case for B3 lactamases (37Hu Z. Periyannan G. Bennett B. Crowder M.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 14207-14216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of mono-Zn(II) L1 has revealed that the single metal ion is located in the 3H site (i.e. the one involved in nucleophile activation) (38Nauton L. Kahn R. Garau G. Hernandez J.F. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A recent kinetic and spectroscopic study in L1 has also indicated that mono-Zn(II) L1 in solution is active with the metal ion localized in the 3H site (37Hu Z. Periyannan G. Bennett B. Crowder M.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 14207-14216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no precedent of a B3 lactamase without a metal-activated nucleophile. The absence of a crystal structure for GOB has precluded a possible description of the role of the metal site in this enzyme, which is still unclear. Here we report a series of experiments that allow us to propose that the metal site in GOB is involved in stabilization of an anionic intermediate that accumulates during catalysis, thus favoring C–N bond cleavage after the nucleophilic attack. These results are unprecedented because these intermediates have been only identified in catalysis by dinuclear lactamases (16Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10788-10789Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10013-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 37Hu Z. Periyannan G.

All reagents were purchased from Sigma with the exception of the NAP-10 gel filtration column purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Metal-free buffers were prepared adding Chelex 100 (Sigma) to normal buffers and stirring for 0.5 h. This was performed as previously described (33Morán-Barrio J. González J.M. Lisa M.N. Costello A.L. Peraro M.D. Carloni P. Bennett B. Tierney D.L. Limansky A.S. Viale A.M. Vila A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18286-18293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), employing plasmid pET9a-GOB-18 or pET9a-D120S GOB-18 and Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus RIL as the bacterial host. Protein purity was higher than 95% as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically employing ϵ280 = 32,200 m−1 cm−1. Apo-GOB-18 was generated as previously described (33Morán-Barrio J. González J.M. Lisa M.N. Costello A.L. Peraro M.D. Carloni P. Bennett B. Tierney D.L. Limansky A.S. Viale A.M. Vila A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18286-18293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and metal removal was corroborated by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Zn(II)-GOB-18 was prepared by dialyzing 50–100 μm apo-GOB-18 against 300 volumes of buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl containing ZnSO4 at a concentration equal to the protein concentration in the dialysis bag). Zn(II)-D120S GOB-18, Co(II)-GOB-18, Co(II)-D120S GOB-18, Ni(II)-GOB-18, Ni(II)-D120S GOB-18, Cd(II)-GOB-18, and Cd(II)-D120S GOB-18 were instead generated by dialyzing 50–100 μm apo-GOB-18 or apo-D120S GOB-18 against 300 volumes of buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl containing ZnSO4, CoSO4, NiCl2, or CdCl2, respectively, at a concentration equivalent to 5 times the protein concentration in the dialysis bag). Excess metal was then removed by a second dialysis with 500 volumes of metal-free buffer. All dialysis steps (8–12 h each) were run at 4 °C. Metal content determinations were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Metrolab 250 instrument operating in the flame mode. Nitrocefin hydrolysis catalyzed by different GOB-18 metal variants was followed, employing a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer for slow reactions and an SX.18-MVR stopped-flow spectrometer associated with a PD.1 photodiode array (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK) or an absorbance photomultiplier for fast reactions. All measurements were performed in metal-free buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl). Reaction temperature was 30 °C for all GOB-18 metal variants with the exception of Zn(II)-GOB-18, where the reaction temperature was 4 °C. Enzyme and substrate concentrations were adjusted to 10–30 and 5–15 μm, respectively, to attain single turnover conditions. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to fit single-wavelength absorbance changes with the program Dynafit (40Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Groups of data corresponding to hydrolysis of nitrocefin were fitted simultaneously. The molar extinction coefficients of nitrocefin used were as follows: substrate ϵ390 = 18,400 m−1 cm−1; product ϵ390 = 6,300 m−1 cm−1, ϵ490 = 17,400 m−1 cm−1, ϵ665 = 500 m−1 cm−1. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of nitrocefin were calculated as kcat = k2k3/(k2 + k3) and Km = k3(k−1 + k2)/k1(k2 + k3) for Zn(II)-GOB-18 and kcat = k2 and Km = (k−1 + k2)/k1 for all other GOB-18 metal variants. All reactions were performed at 30 °C in buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl). Antibiotic hydrolysis was monitored following the absorbance variation resulting from the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring, using the following extinction coefficients: imipenem, Δϵ300 = −9,000 m−1 cm−1; penicillin G, Δϵ235 = −800 m−1 cm−1; cefotaxime, Δϵ260 = −7,500 m−1 cm−1. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were derived from nonlinear fit of the Michaelis-Menten equation to initial rate measurements recorded on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. In each case, kcat values have been calculated taking into account the concentration of metallated mononuclear enzyme. Measurements were performed at 25 °C, using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter flushed with N2. Samples were prepared dialyzing the corresponding protein solution against 300 volumes of buffer 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, twice for 8–12 h, at 4 °C. NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance II 600 spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz. 1H NMR paramagnetic spectra were acquired under conditions to optimize detection of the fast relaxing isotropically shifted resonances, either using the superWEFT pulse sequence (41Inubushi T. Becker E.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 128-133Google Scholar) or water presaturation. These spectra were recorded over large spectral widths with acquisition times ranging from 16 to 80 ms and intermediate delays from 2 to 35 ms. 1H NMR spectra in the diamagnetic envelope were obtained employing a selective shaped pulse for solvent saturation (42Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic radius determination by pulsed field gradient 1H NMR was performed according to Ref. 43Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar. A 113Cd NMR experiment was performed at 133 MHz, with a 5-mm reverse broad band probe. About 260,000 free induction decays were recorded, acquiring 32,768 complex points in 100 ms, with a 30° observe pulse (4 s), a spectral width of 160,000 Hz (1,200 ppm), and a relaxation delay of 0.5 s. The external reference was Cd(ClO4)2. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Samples were in buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl). The experiment was performed employing a setup with six BaF2 detectors. Radioactive 111mCd was produced on the day of the experiments by the Cyclotron Department at the University Hospital in Copenhagen. Preparation and purification of 111mCd were as previously described (44Hemmingsen L. Bauer R. Bjerrum M.J. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. Formicka G. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7145-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A 25-μl 111mCd-containing solution was mixed with non-radioactive cadmium acetate and buffer (Hepes and NaCl; see final concentrations below). pH was adjusted to 7.5 at room temperature. Apo-GOB-18 in 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl was added at a final enzyme concentration of 40 μm, and pH was adjusted to 7.5 at room temperature. The total volume of the sample was 750 μl. Sample was then left 2 h at room temperature to allow binding of Cd(II) to the protein and subsequently run through a gel filtration column (NAP10), using 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl as eluent. 111mCd-containing protein fractions were pooled (four fractions with a volume of 250 μl each). The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in the PAC instrument, where the temperature was set to −20 °C and controlled by a Peltier element. Fits to PAC data were carried out with 300 data points, disregarding the first five points due to systematic errors in these. The analytical expression for the perturbation function is known, and five parameters are fitted for each nuclear quadrupole interaction (45Hemmingsen L. Sas K.N. Danielsen E. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 4027-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In radiotracer (109Cd) experiment condition were the same as for PAC experiments. Nitrocefin, a synthetic cephalosporin, has been extensively employed as a chromogenic probe of the mechanism of MβLs. Benkovic and co-workers (16Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10788-10789Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10013-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) reported for the first time the accumulation of a reaction intermediate in the hydrolysis of nitrocefin by the B1 enzyme CcrA from B. fragilis. The same intermediate was also reported for the B3 enzyme L1 (37Hu Z. Periyannan G. Bennett B. Crowder M.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 14207-14216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 46McManus-Munoz S. Crowder M.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and for an evolved mutant of the B1 lactamase BcII (39Tomatis P.E. Fabiane S.M. Simona F. Carloni P. Sutton B.J. Vila A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20605-20610Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In all cases, this intermediate was stabilized exclusively by the dinuclear forms of these enzymes. We studied the hydrolysis of nitrocefin catalyzed by mono Zn(II)-GOB-18 employing a stopped-flow equipment coupled to a photodiode array. Besides the decay of the substrate absorption at 390 nm and the rise of the product absorption at 490 nm, the sequence of electronic absorption spectra obtained clearly shows the accumulation and the decay of a species with an intense absorption band centered at 665 nm, identical to the one reported for the anionic intermediate previously observed for dinuclear enzymes (Fig. 2A). In order to obtain a minimal kinetic mechanism for the UV-visible data, we performed similar experiments with different amounts of nitrocefin and enzyme measuring the evolution of the absorbance at 390, 490, and 665 nm (Fig. 2B). Data were then subjected to simultaneous global fit. The kinetic model that fits the experimental data best is as follows. E+S↔k−1k+1ES→k2El→k3E+PSCHEME 1 The individual kinetic constants obtained were employed to calculate kcat = 4.4 ± 0.1 s−1 and Km = 18 ± 3 μm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These values compare very well with the steady-state kinetic parameters determined under the same experimental conditions: kcat = 4.0 ± 0.3 s−1 and Km = 25 ± 5 μm, strongly supporting the proposed model. The finding of a reaction intermediate in mononuclear Zn(II)-GOB-18 similar to that reported for dinuclear enzymes suggests that the Zn2 ion is involved in its stabilization in all cases. To further explore the role of this metal ion, we decided to probe the mechanism of nitrocefin hydrolysis by GOB-18 substituted with a variety of transition divalent metal ions. Cytoplasmic overexpression of GOB-18 in E. coli gives rise to a mixture of the Fe(III) and Zn(II) variants (33Morán-Barrio J. González J.M. Lisa M.N. Costello A.L. Peraro M.D. Carloni P. Bennett B.

We have already optimized a procedure for metal depletion (33Morán-Barrio J. González J.M. Lisa M.N. Costello A.L. Peraro M.D. Carloni P. Bennett B. Tierney D.L. Limansky A.S. Viale A.M. Vila A.J. J.

The apoprotein can then be fully loaded with metal ions by dialysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). We have now prepared different metal derivatives (referred to as M(II)-GOB-18 hereafter) using Co(II), Ni(II), and Cd(II) as surrogates of the native Zn(II) ion. The metal content of each M(II)-GOB-18 variant was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Similar values were obtained for several protein preparations. The metal content of the different M(II)-GOB-18 derivatives never exceeded 1 eq per protein molecule in agreement with the metal content of the native enzyme (Table 1).TABLE 1Metal content of GOB-18 variants as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopyGOB-18 variantMetal equivalentsZn(II)-GOB-180.97Co(II)-GOB-180.72Ni(II)-GOB-180.83Cd(II)-GOB-180.77 Open table in a new tab In order to determine the essentiality of the Zn(II) ion in the stabilization of the anionic intermediate in the hydrolysis of nitrocefin by GOB-18 and to explore the mechanistic changes induced by the metal replacements, reactions catalyzed by the different M(II)-GOB-18 derivatives were studied similarly to those above described for the native Zn(II) enzyme. Two major facts result from these experiments: 1) the intermediate is not accumulated in the reaction catalyzed by M(II)-GOB-18 derivatives as detected by Zn(II)-GOB-18 (direct conv"
https://openalex.org/W2000414414,"D-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase (DTD) is an editing enzyme that removes D-amino acids from mischarged tRNAs. We describe an in-depth analysis of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum DTD here. Our data provide structural insights into DTD complexes with adenosine and D-amino acids. Bound adenosine is proximal to the DTD catalysis site, and it represents the authentic terminal adenosine of charged tRNA. DTD-bound D-amino acids cluster at three different subsites within the overall active site pocket. These subsites, called transition, active, and exit subsites allow docking, re-orientation, chiral selection, catalysis, and exit of the free D-amino acid from DTD. Our studies reveal variable modes of D-amino acid recognition by DTDs, suggesting an inherent plasticity that can accommodate all D-amino acids. An in-depth analysis of native, ADP-bound, and D-amino acid-complexed DTD structures provide the first atomic snapshots of ligand recognition and subsequent catalysis by this enzyme family. We have mapped sites for the deacylation reaction and mark possible routes for entry and egress of all substrates and products. We have also performed structure-based inhibitor discovery and tested lead compounds against the malaria parasite P. falciparum using growth inhibition assays. Our studies provide a comprehensive structural basis for the catalytic mechanism of DTD enzymes and have implications for inhibition of this enzyme in P. falciparum as a route to inhibiting the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2165014900,"The GTF2IRD1 gene is of principal interest to the study of Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). This neurodevelopmental disorder results from the hemizygous deletion of a region of chromosome 7q11.23 containing 28 genes including GTF2IRD1. WBS is thought to be caused by haploinsufficiency of certain dosage-sensitive genes within the deleted region, and the feature of supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) has been attributed to reduced elastin caused by deletion of ELN. Human genetic mapping data have implicated two related genes GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I in the cause of some the key features of WBS, including craniofacial dysmorphology, hypersociability, and visuospatial deficits. Mice with mutations of the Gtf2ird1 allele show evidence of craniofacial abnormalities and behavioral changes. Here we show the existence of a negative autoregulatory mechanism that controls the level of GTF2IRD1 transcription via direct binding of the GTF2IRD1 protein to a highly conserved region of the GTF2IRD1 promoter containing an array of three binding sites. The affinity for this protein-DNA interaction is critically dependent upon multiple interactions between separate domains of the protein and at least two of the DNA binding sites. This autoregulatory mechanism leads to dosage compensation of GTF2IRD1 transcription in WBS patients. The GTF2IRD1 promoter represents the first established in vivo gene target of the GTF2IRD1 protein, and we use it to model its DNA interaction capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2084240148,"A major challenge of assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs) is to mimic the natural environment required to sustain oocyte and embryo survival. Herein, we show that the ceramide-metabolizing enzyme, acid ceramidase (AC), is expressed in human cumulus cells and follicular fluid, essential components of this environment, and that the levels of this enzyme are positively correlated with the quality of human embryos formed in vitro. These observations led us to develop a new approach for oocyte and embryo culture that markedly improved the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The addition of recombinant AC (rAC) to human and mouse oocyte culture medium maintained their healthy morphology in vitro. Following fertilization, the number of mouse embryos formed in the presence of rAC also was improved (from approximately 40 to 88%), leading to approximately 5-fold more healthy births. To confirm these observations, immature bovine oocytes were matured in vitro and subjected to IVF in the presence of rAC. Significantly more high-grade blastocysts were formed, and the number of morphologically intact, hatched embryos was increased from approximately 24 to 70%. Overall, these data identify AC as an important component of the in vivo oocyte and embryo environment, and provide a novel technology for enhancing the outcome of assisted fertilization.

https://openalex.org/W1977370658,"We have shown previously that the loss of abdominal pigmentation in D. santomea relative to its sister species D. yakuba resulted, in part, from cis-regulatory mutations at the tan locus. Matute et al. claim, based solely upon extrapolation from genetic crosses of D. santomea and D. melanogaster, a much more divergent species, that at least four X chromosome regions but not tan are responsible for pigmentation differences. Here, we provide additional evidence from introgressions of D. yakuba genes into D. santomea that support a causative role for tan in the loss of pigmentation and present analyses that contradict Matute et al.'s claims. We discuss how the choice of parental species and other factors affect the ability to identify loci responsible for species divergence, and we affirm that all of our previously reported results and conclusions stand."

During spliceosome activation, a large structural rearrangement occurs. The Prp19 complex and related factors are involved in the catalytic activation of the spliceosome. Recent mass spectrometric analyses have shown that Ski interaction protein (SKIP) and peptidylprolyl isomerase-like protein 1 (PPIL1) are Prp19-related factors that constitute the spliceosome B, B*, and C complexes. Here, we report that a highly flexible region of SKIP (SKIPN, residues 59–129) is intrinsically disordered. Upon binding to PPIL1, SKIPN undergoes a disorder-order transition. A highly conserved fragment of SKIP (residues 59–79) called the PPIL1-binding fragment (PBF) was sufficient to bind PPIL1. The structure of PBF·PPIL1 complex, solved by NMR, shows that PBF exhibits an ordered structure and interacts with PPIL1 through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Three subfragments in the PBF (residues 59–67, 68–73, and 74–79) show hook-like backbone structure, and interactions between these subfragments are necessary for PBF·PPIL1 complex formation. PPIL1 is a cyclophilin family protein. It is recruited by SKIP into the spliceosome by a region other than the peptidylprolyl isomerase active site. This enables the active site of PPIL1 to remain open in the complex and still function as a peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase or molecular chaperon to facilitate the folding of other proteins in the spliceosomes.

For example, in the A complex to B complex transition, ∼25 proteins are recruited and more than 35 non-snRNP proteins associated. These include the Prp19·CDC5 complex and Prp19-related factors. Subunits of these become more stably integrated in the B* complex (8Makarov E.M. Makarova O.V. Urlaub H. Gentzel M. Will C.L. Wilm M. Lührmann R.

Ski interaction protein (SKIP) and peptidylprolyl isomerase-like protein 1 (PPIL1) belong to Prp19-related factors and are included in this stable RNP core. Both of them are believed to be involved in the activation of the spliceosome (2Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol.

Neuwald A.F. Spahr C.S. Spector D.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4308-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant negative SKIP (residues 87–342 of SKIP) results in a 1,25- (OH)2D3-dependent transient accumulation of the unspliced transcripts (12Zhang C. Dowd D.R. Staal A. Gu C.

Commun. 2004; 316: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported that SKIP affected the splicing of a natural gene product, the downstream intron, and aberrant splicing. An ortholog of SKIP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Prp45p, is essential for pre-mRNA splicing; it interacts with splicing factors Prp46p (14Albers M. Diment A. Muraru M. Russell C.S. Beggs J.D. RNA. 2003; 9: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Diehl B.E. Pringle J.R. Genetics. 1991; 127: 287-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SKIP is also a multifunctional protein, which is involved in transcription initiation, transcription elongation, and the cell cycle. As a transcriptional coactivator, it is linked to activation of important transcription factors, such as vitamin D receptor, CBF1, Smad2/3, and MyoD (16Folk P. Půta F. Skruzný M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was proposed that SKIP may be a transcription/splicing coupling factor based on the participation of SKIP in transcription and splicing. PPIL1 (166 residues) belongs to a novel subfamily of cyclophilin, which contains a single domain (PPIase domain) and has a SKIP-binding region and a cyclosporin A (inhibitor of peptidylprolyl isomerase)-binding region (17Xu C. Zhang J. Huang X. Sun J. Xu Y. Tang Y. Wu J. Shi Y. Huang Q. Zhang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15900-15908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SKIP recruits PPIL1 into the spliceosome. The N-proximal 180 amino acids of SnwA (ortholog of human SKIP) interact with CypE (ortholog of human PPIL1) in Dictyostelium discoideum (18Skruzný M. Ambrozková M. Fuková I. Martínková K. Blahůsková A. Hamplová L. Půta F. Folk P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1521: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Xu et al. (17Xu C. Zhang J.

Nevertheless, how they bind and the structural basis of their binding are still unknown. Here, we report that a large region in SKIP (71 residues) is intrinsically disordered in the free state and undergoes a disordered-ordered transition upon binding to PPIL1. We further identified that a shorter fragment of SKIP (PBF, PPIL1 binding fragment of the SKIP, residues 59–79) was involved in PPIL1 interaction. Furthermore, the complex structure of PBF·PPIL1 was determined by NMR, and the details of the interaction interfaces are described. The biological implication of the disorder-order transition of SKIPN upon binding PPIL1 during the spliceosome assembly is discussed. The human PPIL1 mutant clone (A43S) was a gift from Prof. Q. H. Zhang. Clones, including wild-type PPIL1, SKIPN (residues 59–129 of SKIP), PBF (residues 59–79 of SKIP), SKIP172 (residues 1–172 of SKIP), PPIL1-(GGGS)4-PBF (linking the C-terminal of PPIL1 and PBF with the sequence Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser repeated four times), and PPIL1 mutants (K30A, K30D, K91A, K91D, R131K, R131E, R131A, L116A, L116D, and I136A/V139A) were constructed by using megaprimer PCR (19Aiyar A. Leis J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar) or PCR (supplemental Table S1). All selected clones were verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant PPIL1 plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. Cells were grown in either Luria-Bertani medium for unlabeled samples or minimal medium with H2O or ∼75% D2O supplemented as appropriate with glucose or [13C6]glucose and 15NH4Cl for 15N-, 15N/13C-, or 15N/13C/2H-labeled PPIL1 samples. Cultures were induced at an A600 nm of 0.6–0.8 with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C or 37 °C. Proteins were purified with a Ni-NTA column and then a Superdex 75 gel-filtration column. To obtain 15N/13C/2H-labeled SKIPN, we cultured cells with media dissolved in ∼100% D2O. SKIPN is a highly soluble protein (>2 mm). For protein SKIPN expressed in ∼100% D2O, all the deuterium in the amide groups can be rapidly exchanged with the proton from water. Therefore, the completed backbone chemical shift assignment of SKIPN was performed using three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments. To obtain PBF, we constructed the PBF clone with vector pET32(c). PBF fused with Trx, and an enterokinase cleavage site was expressed in E. coli cells. Purified fused proteins (∼15.4 mg) were dialyzed against the cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and then incubated with enterokinase (37 units) at 20.5 °C for ∼16 h in 15.5-ml mixture and then further separated on a Ni-NTA column. The resultant Ala-Met-PBF was mixed with purified unlabeled His6-tagged-PPIL1 (molar ratio of PBF/PPIL1 was ∼1/1.3) and loaded onto a new Ni-NTA column. The complex Ala-Met-PBF·PPIL1 was eluted after washing with the washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8). Expression and purification of SKIPN, SKIP172, PPIL1-(GGGS)4-PBF, and PPIL1 mutants were the same as those for PPIL1. Before use, the buffer of these samples was exchanged into Buffer A containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2‰ NaN3, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.5. The purity of these proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Unlabeled peptides (PBF, its subfragments, and its mutants (supplemental Table S2)) were synthesized by GL Biochem or Sangon (Shanghai). They were supplied with stringent analytical specifications (purity level above 98%), which included high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis. Before use, peptides were weighed and dissolved in Buffer A, and the pH of each sample was systematically controlled and, if necessary, adjusted to a value of 6.5 by addition of dilution NaOH or HCl solution. All spectra were recorded at 25 °C on Bruker DMX500 or DMX600 spectrometers. The standard NMR methodology was used as described (17Xu C. Zhang J. Huang X. Sun J. Xu Y. Tang Y. Wu J. Shi Y. Huang Q. Zhang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15900-15908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sequential and side-chain assignments for SKIPN(15N/13C/2H), SKIPN(15N/13C/2H)·PPIL1 (molar ratio is 1:1.5), PBF(15N/13C)·PPIL1 (molar ratio is ∼1:1.3), PPIL1(15N/13C/2H)·PBF (molar ratio is 1:3.1), and PPIL1-(GGGS)4-PBF(15N/13C) were performed. Sequential assignments of SKIPN include HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HNN, and HN(C)N (20Panchal S.C. Bhavesh N.S. Hosur R.V. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were derived from multidimensional NOE spectra with mixing times of 130 ms. NOE experiments included three-dimensional 13C-separated and 15N-separated NOE spectra. For interface NOE restraints, two-dimensional 15N,13C double-half-filter NOE spectra were recorded by using samples PBF(15N/13C)·PPIL1 and PPIL1(15N/13C/2H, expressed in medium with ∼75% D2O)·PBF (Fig. 6C). Freeze-dried 15N/13C-PPIL1-(GGGS)4-PBF was dissolved in 100% D2O, and 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded to identify slow exchanging amide protons of the sample. Due to the difficulty in obtaining full side-chain assignments of the sample PBF(15N/13C)·PPIL1, a fused protein PPIL1-(GGGS)4-PBF was prepared. Cross-peaks of PBF for the fused protein (red) are well overlapped with those for the complex SKIPN (15N/13C/2H)·PPIL1 (blue, supplemental Fig. S1B). The same is true for the cross-peaks of PPIL1 in the fused protein (red) and PPIL1(15N):SKIPN (blue, supplemental Fig. S1C), demonstrating that PPIL1-(GGGS)4-PBF is representative of the PPIL1·PBF complex in structure (supplemental Fig. S1A). In total, for the fused protein, except for Pro and the linker (GGGS)4, 97% backbone and >90% atoms of the side chain were assigned. Comparing two-dimensional 15N,13C double-half-filter NOESY of the samples PBF(15N/13C)·PPIL1 and PPIL1(15N/13C/2H)·PBF with the 13C-separated NOESY of the sample 15N/13C-PPIL1-(GGGS)4-PBF, we obtained 17 unambiguous interface constrains between PPIL1 and PBF (Asp184-HB2/HB3 and HA with Ile136-QG2, Gly185-HA2 and HA3 with Val132-QG2, Pro189-HA with Ile97-QD1, Glu190-HA with Leu90-QD2, His192-HA with Thr93-QG2, Leu198-QD1 with Gly137-HA2 and HA3 and Asn140-HB2 and HB3, Met200-QE with Asn140-HB2 and HB3 and Ala95-QB, Gly201-HA2 and HA3 with Ala117-QB). The CSI (21Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) program was used to obtain the backbone dihedral angles in secondary structures on the basis of chemical shift information. These constrains were added during the automatic NOE assignment by program CYANA 2.1 (22Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). After refined by manually, the initial structures of PPIL1·PBF calculated by CYANA were further chosen for refinement in explicit water by using CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Biol. 2005; 38: 550-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 20 structures with the lowest energy were chosen for structural analysis. The chemical shift index (CSI) provides the secondary structural preferences of each residue of SKIPN. Here, a random-coil reference dataset from c-GGXGG-NH2 peptides in 8 m urea at pH 2.3 was adopted (26Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and the corresponding correction factors (27Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R. Chung J. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) were used to correct local sequence-dependent contributions. The error derived from the differences in the acquisition temperature and pH was processed by the inherent correction function of the CSI in NMRView (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11632) Google Scholar). The temperature dependences of the CD spectra for proteins SKIPN and SKIP172 were obtained using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with the Julabo temperature-controller F25-HD. SKIPN or SKIP172 was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, before use. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at wavelengths between 190 nm and 250 nm using a 0.1-cm path length cell. Near-UV CD spectra were recorded at wavelengths between 240 and 320 nm using a 1-cm path length cell. All CD spectra were the average of three or five successive spectra. Mean ellipticity values per residue ([θ]) were calculated as [θ] = 3300 mΔA/(lcn), where l represents path length, n is the number of residues (80 residues for SKIPN and 178 residues for SKIP172), m is the molecular mass in daltons (9,040 Da for SKIPN and 20,055 Da for SKIP172), and c is the protein concentration expressed in milligrams/ml. DSC experiments were carried out with a VP-DSC calorimeter. Calorimetric cells were kept under an excess pressure of 30 p.s.i. to prevent degassing during the scan. In all measurements, the buffer from the last dialysis step was used in the reference cell of the calorimeter. Several buffer-buffer baselines were obtained before each run with a protein solution to ascertain proper equilibration of the calorimeter. An additional buffer-buffer baseline was obtained after each protein run to check that no significant change in instrumental baseline had occurred. Lysozyme (Fluke) was used as the control. Data were analyzed using the MicroCal VP-DSC standard analysis software. SKIPN was coupled to a carboxymethyl-dextran CM5 sensor chip with an amine coupling kit. Binding was observed upon injection of different concentrations of PPIL1 or its mutants. The plateau values reached after completion of the association reactions were analyzed by using a Langmuir binding isotherm. 15N relaxation experiments were carried out at 25 °C using published methods (29Farrow N.A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). 15N T1 relaxation rates were measured with 8 relaxation delays: 11, 62, 142, 243, 364, 525, 757, and 1150 ms. 15N T2 relaxation rates were measured with 6 relaxation delays: 17.6, 35.2, 52.8, 70.4, 105.6, and 140.8 ms. A recycle delay of 1 s was used for measurement of T1 and T2 relaxation rates. The spectra measuring 1H-15N NOE were acquired with a 2-s relaxation delay followed by a 3-s period of proton saturation. The spectra recorded in the absence of proton saturation employed a relaxation delay of 5 s. The exponential curve fitting and extract of T1 and T2 were processed by Sparky. To investigate the PPIL1 and PBF binding sites, 0.35 mm 15N-labeled PPIL1 or 15N-labeled SKIPN in Buffer A was used for NMR titration experiments at 25 °C. 15N-1H HSQC of sample was recorded until there was no change in the spectrum. The final molar ratios were 1:2 for 15N-labeled SKIPN:K30A and 15N-labeled SKIPN:K91A, 1:3 for 15N-labeled SKIPN:K30D, 1:5 for 15N-labeled SKIPN:R131K, and 15N-labeled SKIPN:R131A. For 15N-labeled PPIL1 titrating with PBF or its mutants, their final molar ratios were more than 1:6. Backbone amide proton chemical shifts of protein SKIPN alone are poorly dispersed (7.8–8.6 ppm) in 1H-15N correlated NMR spectra (Fig. 2, A and C), indicating that SKIPN may be an unstructured protein fragment. CSI provides the secondary structural preferences of each amino acid residue (26Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Biomol.

As shown in Fig. 3A, the average deviations of the 13CA, 13CB, 13CO, and 1HN chemical shifts from random coil values (Δδ) for SKIPN are <1.0, 1.5, 0.5, and 0.3 ppm, respectively, which indicate that free SKIPN has no secondary structural preferences.FIGURE 3Characteristics of protein SKIPN in the free state.

For far-UV CD spectra, 0.2 mg/ml SKIPN was used. For near-UV CD spectra, 2 mg/ml SKIPN was used. D, the heat capacity of 1 mg/ml SKIPN (gray line) was recorded by nano-DSC at a rate of 1 °C/min. Lysozyme (black line) at 3 mg/ml was used as control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CD spectra and DSC experiments further confirm that SKIPN is an unstructured protein fragment. SKIPN has negative bands near 199 nm and low ellipticity above 210 nm from 5 to 95 °C (Fig. 3B), which are consistent with those of disordered proteins (30Greenfield N.J. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2876-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar, 31Venyaminov S.Yu. Baikalov I.A. Shen Z.M. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Upon temperature increases from 5 to 95 °C in 5 °C steps, signals at far-UV CD208 nm and CD220 nm characterized α-helical structure, and CD200 nm characterized coil structure increased or decreased linearly rather than in as a state transition (Fig. 3C). This result suggests that SKIPN has no temperature-dependent structure transition. The ellipticity in 275 nm related with four Tyr residues in SKIPN (no Trp residue) shows slight changes (Fig. 3C), reflecting the high mobility of aromatic side chains (32Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Further evidence for an unfolded state is seen in DSC experiments (Fig. 3D). For the control sample, a transition temperature at ∼72 °C was found. For SKIPN, there was no transition found. These data show that SKIPN in the free state is an unstructured fragment in solution from 4 to 95 °C. To probe the dynamic properties of SKIPN in solution, 15N longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times and steady-state 1H-15N NOE were measured for free states. The average values of T1 (Fig. 4A), T2 (Fig. 4B), and 1H-15N NOE for positive values (Fig. 4C) of SKIPN were 0.50 s, 0.18 s, and 0.12, respectively. The steady-state 1H-15N NOE is an excellent measure of flexibility in proteins (33Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 34Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, residues with negative NOE values can be divided into five regions, including Ala63 to Ala70, Leu86 to Ile88, Gly94, Val120, and Met125. Small positive or negative NOE values show that SKIPN alone (9.0 kDa) is very flexible, especially for these five regions in solution. Together, the experiments demonstrate that free SKIPN in solution is an intrinsically unstructured protein with backbone flexibility varying by region. Upon titration of PPIL1 into 15N-labeled SKIPN, the intensity of some cross-peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC for the free SKIPN diminished, new resonances appeared, and the intensity enhanced concomitant with the formation of the SKIPN·PPIL1 complex. Exchange between the free and bound states of residues from Gly59 to Arg78 of SKIPN was slow on the chemical shift timescale, and cross-peaks corresponding to both states were observed at intermediate SKIPN·PPIL1 concentration ratios. This is consistent with 15N-labeled PPIL1 titrating with SKIPN, which is also a slow rate exchange process. As shown in Fig. 2B, when the molar ratio of SKIPN·PPIL1 reached ∼1:1.5, cross-peaks of the free state related to both states were nearly diminished. In the bound state, peaks of Gly61, Phe64, Glu66, Ile67, His68, Tyr72, Leu74, Asp75, Gly77, and Arg78 are well dispersed in two-dimensional 15N,1H-TROSY spectrum, especially for Glu66 (chemical shift of HN is 10.4 ppm), which suggests that upon binding to PPIL1, intrinsically unstructured SKIPN undergoes a disorder-order transition. It has been previously reported that SKIPN (residues 59–129 of SKIP) is sufficient to associate with PPIL1 (17Xu C. Zhang J. Huang X. Sun J. Xu Y. Tang Y. Wu J. Shi Y. Huang Q. Zhang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15900-15908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, we further demonstrated that PBF (residues 59–79 of SKIP) is the PPIL1-binding region. As shown in Fig. 2B, well dispersed peaks in the two-dimensional 15N,1H-TROSY spectrum result from residues Gly61 to Arg78, which suggests that this region of SKIPN may be involved in PPIL1 binding. The chemical shift deviations of HN and H between SKIPN alone and complexed with PPIL1 are shown in supplemental Table S3. To further investigate this fragment, 15N/13C-labeled Ala-Met-PBF (residues 59–79 of SKIPN) was prepared. By comparing cross-peaks in 1H-15N-correlated NMR spectra of Ala-Met-PBF(15N/13C)·PPIL1 (Fig. 5A) and SKIPN(15N/13C/2H)·PPIL1 (Fig. 2B), we found that the well dispersed peaks of PBF were overlapped between two spectra. Moreover, the average transverse relaxation time of PBF (42 ms) was much lower than that of the other residues of SKIPN (103 ms) in the complex state (Fig. 5B), indicating that PBF binds tightly with PPIL1 while the remaining residues of SKIPN are in the bound state. These results demonstrate that the PBF of SKIP constitutes a PPIL1-binding region. The coordinates of 20 NMR structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank"

Phosphatidylcholine, an indispensible membrane component, requires the enzyme CCTα for its biosynthesis. Nuclear expression of CCTα is needed for expansion of the nuclear membrane network, but mechanisms for CCTα nuclear import are unknown. Herein, we show that in epithelia, extracellular Ca2+ triggers CCTα cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. CCTα nuclear import was associated with binding to 14-3-3ζ, a key regulator of protein trafficking. 14-3-3ζ was both sufficient and required for CCTα nuclear import. Helix G within the 14-3-3ζ binding groove interacts with a putative molecular signature within the CCTα carboxyl-terminal phosphoserine motif (residues 328-343). 14-3-3ζ was critically involved in preserving phosphatidylcholine synthesis and cell viability in a model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection where Ca2+ concentrations increase within epithelia. Thus, 14-3-3ζ controls CCTα nuclear import in response to calcium signals, thereby regulating mammalian phospholipid synthesis. Agassandian, M., Chen, B. B., Schuster, C. C., Houtman, J. C.

https://openalex.org/W1993678336,"TLR2 is a pattern recognition receptor that functions in association with TLR1 or TLR6 to mediate innate immune responses to a variety of conserved microbial products. In the present study, the ectodomain of TLR2 was extensively mutated, and the mutants were assessed for their ability to bind and to mediate cellular responses to triacylated lipopeptide Pam(3)CSK(4). This analysis provides evidence that the recently published crystal structure of the TLR2-TLR1-Pam(3)CSK(4) complex represents a functional signal-inducing complex. Furthermore, we report that extended H-bond networks on the surface of TLR2 are critical for signaling in response to Pam(3)CSK(4) and to other di- and tri-acylated TLR2-TLR6 and TLR2-TLR1 ligands. Based on this finding, we suggest a dynamic model for TLR2-mediated recognition of these ligands in which TLR2 fluctuates between a conformation that is more suitable for binding of the fatty acyl moieties of the ligands and a conformation that favors, via a specific orientation of the ligand head group, formation of a signal-inducing ternary complex."

VMAT2 is the target of many psychoactive drugs and is essential for proper neurotransmission and survival. Here we describe a new expression system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that takes advantage of the polyspecificity of VMAT2. Expression of rVMAT2 confers resistance to acriflavine and to the parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by their removal into the yeast vacuole. This expression system allowed identification of a new substrate, acriflavine, and isolation of mutants with modified affinity to tetrabenazine (TBZ), a non-competitive inhibitor of VMAT2 that is used in the treatment of various movement disorders including Tourette syndrome and Huntington chorea.

A protein where both types of mutations were combined (with only three amino acid replacements) lost most of the properties of the neurotransmitter transporter (TBZ-insensitive, no transport of neurotransmitter) but displayed enhanced resistance to the above toxicants. The work described here shows that in the case of rVMAT2, loss of traits acquired in evolution of function (such as serotonin transport and TBZ binding) bring about an improvement in older functions such as resistance to toxic compounds.

Sodium-coupled plasma membrane transporters actively remove the neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft in a step essential for termination of the signal. The release of neurotransmitter by exocytosis is possible because of their storage inside synaptic vesicles in a process that depends on vesicular H+-coupled neurotransporters (VNT) 2The abbreviations used are: VNTvesicular H+-coupled neurotransporterMDMA3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMPP+1-methyl-4-phenylpyridiniumVMATvesicular monoamine transporterTBZtetrabenazineFM 4-64N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylamino-phenyl-hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromideTMtransmembrane.

Three families of proteins responsible for the uptake of transmitter by secretory vesicles have been identified, one that includes the vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) and acetylcholine transporters (VAChT), a second that includes the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and a third that includes the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) (2Eiden L.E.

Neuron. 2007; 55: 835-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). VMAT2 is expressed by monoamine neurons in the central nervous system and selected peripheral endocrine populations. VMAT2 has a higher affinity for most monoamines than VMAT1, but only VMAT2 appears to recognize histamine (5Merickel A. Edwards R.H. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1543-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies using chromaffin granules from the adrenal medulla showed that the uptake of one protonated, and hence charged, cytoplasmic monoamine is coupled to the movement of two H+ in the opposite direction (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The transport cycle results in net efflux of one charge. The H+ electrochemical gradient and the coupled stoichiometry allow for accumulation of monoamines at submolar concentrations in chromaffin granules (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).The VMATs are the target of reserpine, which provided some of the first evidence for the monoamine hypothesis for depression (7Stitzel R.E.

Steiner-Mordoch S. Yelin R. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1227-1231PubMed Google Scholar). The VMATs also protect cells against the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPP+ (10Liu Y. Peter D.

Neurosci. 1997; 20: 125-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) by sequestering the compound in vesicles and away from its primary site of action in mitochondria.Another clinically relevant drug is the non-competitive VMAT2 inhibitor TBZ that is used in the treatment of various movement disorders including Tourette syndrome and Huntington chorea (12Kenney C. Jankovic J. Expert. Rev. Neurother. 2006; 6: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TBZ is a non-competitive inhibitor of transport and substrate binding (13Scherman D. Jaudon P. Henry J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, occupancy of the substrate binding site has little effect on TBZ binding (13Scherman D. Jaudon P. Henry J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Darchen F. Scherman D. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mode of interaction of the two binding sites and how TBZ brings about the inhibition are still unknown. The closely related VMAT1 isoform displays a decreased sensitivity to TBZ (6Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The structural basis for the function of VMAT remains unknown. VMAT belongs to the MFS superfamily of transporters and it displays a weak but distinct homology with bacterial multidrug transporters (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition it became evident from its pharmacology that it is a multispecific transporter, and, when heterologously expressed, it confers resistance to toxic substrates because it removes them from their targets by transport into the vacuolar system (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 15Yelin R. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Here we describe the functional expression of rVMAT2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. rVMAT2 renders the cells resistant to MPP+ and acriflavine, a newly identified substrate, by a process that involves active removal of the drugs into the yeast vacuole. The development of this system allows us harnessing the power of yeast genetics to the study of the mechanism of rVMAT2. Screening of mutants with altered sensitivity to the non-competitive inhibitor TBZ brought about the isolation and characterization of proteins with a significantly modified pharmacological profile. A mutant rVMAT2 was constructed with three mutations obtained in the above screen. This mutant displayed properties of a multidrug transporter: it conferred a very robust resistance to acriflavine, MPP+ and other drugs but it lost the ability to transport neurotransmitter or binding the inhibitor TBZ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Construction of Yeast Expression VectorrVMAT2 cDNA with six histidine residues at the N terminus was cloned in the pAES426 yeast expression plasmid, under the control of the ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter.

At the end of the process, cells were plated on minimal medium at a concentration of 5 × 103-104 cells per plate. Replicas on selective plates containing 60 μm acriflavine with the addition of 1 or 2 μm TBZ were done with velvet. Enrichment trials were done in liquid medium, supplemented with 62.5 μm acriflavine and 5 μm TBZ. Cultures that grew in Erlenmeyer flask were plated on minimal medium without uracil (control for presence of the plasmid), single colonies were re-plated on plates containing 40 μm acriflavine ± 2 μm TBZ. rVMAT2 wild type was used as a control. DNA was purified from suspected colonies, propagated in Escherichia coli, re-purified, and transformed back to the S. cerevisiae ADU1-7 strain for the phenotype assay.DISCUSSIONIn this work we show that expression of rVMAT2 in S. cerevisiae confers a robust resistance to MPP+ and to acriflavine. MPP+ was already known as a substrate of VMATs but acriflavine, a substrate of many multidrug transporters, is identified here for the first time.rVMAT2 is a protein specially suited to study in S. cerevisiae. It displays the pharmacological profile of a multidrug transporter (15Yelin R. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and provides resistance to MPP+ to CHO cells by removal into acidic compartments (10Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 9074-9078Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Previous efforts demonstrated the feasibility of the yeast system when using a bacterial multidrug transporter (21Yelin R. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 949-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but failed to provide a fully functional expression of bVMAT2 and rVMAT1 (22Yelin R. Schuldiner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 426-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The availability of a larger selection of genetically well-defined yeast strains with increased sensitivity to some of the substrates of VMAT led us to a renewed effort to screen for new substrates with a variety of plasmids.The pharmacological properties of the protein expressed in yeast are unaltered as judged by the finding that reserpine, TBZ, and ketanserine, well-known inhibitors of rVMAT2, abolish the resistance. The biochemical characterization of the protein expressed in yeast suggests that its kinetic properties and specificity are indistinguishable from that expressed in mammalian cells (18Adam Y. Edwards R.H. Schuldiner S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and very similar to the native bovine homologue previously studied mainly in chromaffin granules from bovine adrenal medulla (19Stern-Bach Y. Greenberg-Ofrath N. Flechner I. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3961-3966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The localization, mainly in the vacuole of the yeast cell, supports the concept that drug transporters in eukaryotic cells can provide resistance not only by extrusion from the cell to the medium but also by compartmentalization into acidic compartments.The strength of the yeast expression system stems from the ability to perform unbiased directed evolution experimentation based on the powerful phenotype of resistance in a relatively simple, fast growing unicellular organism that allows selection of specific mutants with desired properties. In the work described here we have generated two types of mutants of rVMAT2 that can grow in the presence of acriflavine even in the presence of high concentrations of TBZ. Type I mutants displayed a 50-fold decreased affinity to TBZ. The mutation resulted in replacement of Phe-136 to Leu, a site in TM2 that was not previously identified as involved in TBZ binding. The F136L mutation is an excellent example of the lack of bias in this technique: Phe-136 is conserved in several VNTs even in VMAT1 that displays a lower affinity to TBZ and VAChT that displays a very different substrate profile (supplemental Fig. S2A). Because of this, F136 was not a likely candidate for replacement using site directed mutagenesis. From the findings described here, we conclude that Phe-136 is one of the main, but certainly not the only, determinant of TBZ affinity. Analysis of the various replacements at this position revealed that replacement with hydrophobic amino acids such as Val, Met, Ile, and Leu generate a fully active protein that binds TBZ very poorly. Only a Tyr replacement generated a protein that binds TBZ, suggesting that an aromatic residue at position 136 is needed for efficient binding.The interaction with competitive inhibitors such as reserpine or substrates such as serotonin, acriflavine, MPP+, and histamine is not impaired by the F136L mutation. Moreover, in the case of serotonin and acriflavine the mutant displays a higher apparent affinity. The higher apparent affinity to acriflavine of the F136L protein is reflected also in the more robust resistance conferred by its activity due to removal of the drug to lower concentrations than those achieved by the wild-type protein. The apparent affinity to ketanserine, an inhibitor that was known to interact at the same site as TBZ, is not affected to the same degree, suggesting that some of the binding interactions of both drugs must be different.Type II mutants map at TM11 and maybe less directly involved in TBZ binding because their replacements have only a slightly decreased affinity to TBZ. The mutations resulted in replacement of Ile-425 and Val-428, sites that were not previously identified as involved in TBZ binding or substrate recognition. As the case for the F136L mutation, Ile-425 and Val-428 are conserved in several proteins throughout the vesicular amine transporter family (supplemental Fig. S2B). The mutation I425F displayed a lower Km toward serotonin and conferred a more robust resistance to acriflavine, suggesting a possible role in substrate recognition. When all the mutations were combined, the resulting protein, rVMAT2-triple, displayed a very interesting behavior: while it conferred an even higher resistance to acriflavine and MPP+ it lost practically completely the ability to transport serotonin and to bind TBZ. Moreover, it seems to have acquired novel specificities because it conferred a significant resistance to ethidium and a marginal but noticeable resistance to acridine orange. rVMAT2-triple resembles the properties of authentic multidrug transporters.A structural model of rVMAT2 has been proposed, and, in this model, TM2 and TM11 are contiguous in space (Ref. 23Vardy E. Arkin I.T. Gottschalk K.E. Kaback H.R. Schuldiner S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and Fig. 9). Several residues potentially involved in VMAT function and in TBZ binding have been identified in previous works (24Merickel A. Kaback H.R. Edwards R.H. J. Biol.

Along TM11 we find three of these residues (Fig. 9): Asp-427 was identified in the rVMAT1 isoform (Asp-431 in rVMAT1) as essential for transport. However, mutated proteins with Glu or Ser at the same position can perform partial reactions: they are unimpaired in ligand recognition and coupling of the electrochemical proton gradient to one of the protons transported (26Steiner-Mordoch S. Shirvan A. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13048-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cys-431 has been identified in human VMAT2 as a residue that confers sensitivity to thiol-reactive reagents, but the reaction is prevented by TBZ (27Thiriot D.S. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27304-27315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutations in Tyr-434 reduce the affinity to serotonin and TBZ (28Finn 3rd, J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol.

Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).FIGURE 9Model of rVMAT2 and the cluster involved in TBZ binding. Charged residues facing the cavity and previously shown to play some role in function are highlighted (A). The helical projection of TM2 (B) and TM11 (C) is shown. Highlighted residues have been shown to modify rVMAT2 function or to provide targets for inhibitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phe-136, Ile-425, and Val-428 identified in this work join now the above cluster (Fig. 9), and the finding strongly supports the suggestion that this section of the protein may be involved directly in TBZ binding and serotonin transport. The fact that only proteins with Phe and Tyr at position 136 display high affinity to TBZ led us to speculate that the residue at this position may be directly involved in aromatic interaction with TBZ. The mechanism of inhibition of transport by TBZ has been the subject of a large number of studies. TBZ is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of VMAT-mediated transport (13Scherman D. Jaudon P. Henry J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It also inhibits substrate binding with a similar Ki. On the other hand, substrates inhibit TBZ binding only at concentrations at least hundred times higher than their affinities (13Scherman D. Jaudon P. Henry J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Scherman D. Henry J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). A corollary of this finding is that both sites (substrate and TBZ) can be occupied at the same time, provided the substrate binds first. We speculate that occupancy of the TBZ binding site prevents access to the substrate, probably by the formation of a steric barrier similar to what was suggested for the mode of inhibition of an antidepressant in the bacterial LeuT transporter (31Singh S.K. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 448: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 32Zhou Z. Zhen J. Karpowich N.K. Goetz R.M. Law C.J. Reith M.E. Wang D.N. Science. 2007; 317: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).The fact that Phe-136, Ile-425, and Val-428 are conserved even in homologues that do not bind TBZ stresses the power of the approach described here that allows for an unbiased search of residues involved in one or other aspect of the catalytic cycle. Native vesicular neurotransmitters transporters have been extensively characterized at the biochemical level (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, as with many other mammalian membrane proteins, there is a lack of detailed high-resolution information. In addition, unlike the case of plasma membrane transporters, powerful analytical techniques such as electrophysiology do not seem to be easily applicable to transporters that are expressed in intracellular membranes. These facts prompted us to a renewed effort to develop new techniques for the study of VMAT. The yeast system combined with the approach of directed evolution provides us with a novel powerful tool to study a protein that plays a central role in the process of neurotransmission.A variety of phylogenetic studies suggest that rVMAT2 and related vesicular neurotransporters have evolved from bacterial drug/H+ antiporters that have been implicated in bacterial resistance to antibiotics and other toxic compounds (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 33Vardy E. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7518-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 34Saier Jr., M.H. Paulsen I.T. Semin Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). From the work described here, it seems that in the case of rVMAT2, loss of traits acquired in evolution of function (such as serotonin transport and TBZ binding) bring about an improvement in older functions such as resistance to toxic compounds. A process that has taken millions of years of evolution can be reversed by three mutations. IntroductionNeurotransporters play central roles in the overall process of neurotransmission. Sodium-coupled plasma membrane transporters actively remove the neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft in a step essential for termination of the signal. The release of neurotransmitter by exocytosis is possible because of their storage inside synaptic vesicles in a process that depends on vesicular H+-coupled neurotransporters (VNT) 2The abbreviations used are: VNTvesicular H+-coupled neurotransporterMDMA3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMPP+1-methyl-4-phenylpyridiniumVMATvesicular monoamine transporterTBZtetrabenazineFM 4-64N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylamino-phenyl-hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromideTMtransmembrane. (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Three families of proteins responsible for the uptake of transmitter by secretory vesicles have been identified, one that includes the vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) and acetylcholine transporters (VAChT), a second that includes the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and a third that includes the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) (2Eiden L.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2396-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2450-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2007; 55: 835-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).Two monoamine transporters, VMAT1 and VMAT2, are responsible for the transport of dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, and noradrenaline into the synaptic vesicles of neurons and the dense core vesicles of endocrine cells (2Eiden L.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2396-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2450-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2007; 55: 835-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). VMAT2 is expressed by monoamine neurons in the central nervous system and selected peripheral endocrine populations. VMAT2 has a higher affinity for most monoamines than VMAT1, but only VMAT2 appears to recognize histamine (5Merickel A. Edwards R.H. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1543-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies using chromaffin granules from the adrenal medulla showed that the uptake of one protonated, and hence charged, cytoplasmic monoamine is coupled to the movement of two H+ in the opposite direction (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The transport cycle results in net efflux of one charge. The H+ electrochemical gradient and the coupled stoichiometry allow for accumulation of monoamines at submolar concentrations in chromaffin granules (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).The VMATs are the target of reserpine, which provided some of the first evidence for the monoamine hypothesis for depression (7Stitzel R.E. Pharm. Rev. 1976; 28: 179-208PubMed Google Scholar, 8Freis E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1954; 251: 1006-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and are involved in the function of amphetamines including methamphetamine, which acts primarily on dopamine neurons, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which promotes serotonin release (9Schuldiner S. Steiner-Mordoch S. Yelin R. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1227-1231PubMed Google Scholar). The VMATs also protect cells against the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPP+ (10Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Privé G.G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Edwards R.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 125-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) by sequestering the compound in vesicles and away from its primary site of action in mitochondria.Another clinically relevant drug is the non-competitive VMAT2 inhibitor TBZ that is used in the treatment of various movement disorders including Tourette syndrome and Huntington chorea (12Kenney C. Jankovic J. Expert. Rev. Neurother. 2006; 6: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TBZ is a non-competitive inhibitor of transport and substrate binding (13Scherman D. Jaudon P. Henry J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, occupancy of the substrate binding site has little effect on TBZ binding (13Scherman D. Jaudon P. Henry J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Darchen F. Scherman D. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mode of interaction of the two binding sites and how TBZ brings about the inhibition are still unknown. The closely related VMAT1 isoform displays a decreased sensitivity to TBZ (6Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The structural basis for the function of VMAT remains unknown. VMAT belongs to the MFS superfamily of transporters and it displays a weak but distinct homology with bacterial multidrug transporters (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition it became evident from its pharmacology that it is a multispecific transporter, and, when heterologously expressed, it confers resistance to toxic substrates because it removes them from their targets by transport into the vacuolar system (1Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 15Yelin R. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Here we describe the functional expression of rVMAT2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. rVMAT2 renders the cells resistant to MPP+ and acriflavine, a newly identified substrate, by a process that involves active removal of the drugs into the yeast vacuole. The development of this system allows us harnessing the power of yeast genetics to the study of the mechanism of rVMAT2. Screening of mutants with altered sensitivity to the non-competitive inhibitor TBZ brought about the isolation and characterization of proteins with a significantly modified pharmacological profile. A mutant rVMAT2 was constructed with three mutations obtained in the above screen. This mutant displayed properties of a multidrug transporter: it conferred a very robust resistance to acriflavine, MPP+ and other drugs but it lost the ability to transport neurotransmitter or binding the inhibitor TBZ."
https://openalex.org/W1996526198,"Understanding the evolutionary mechanism that acts at the interfaces of protein-protein complexes is a fundamental issue with high interest for delineating the macromolecular complexes and networks responsible for regulation and complexity in biological systems. To investigate whether the evolution of protein-protein interface acts in a similar way as antibody affinity maturation, we incorporated evolutionary information derived from antibody affinity maturation with common simulation techniques to evaluate prediction success rates of the computational method in affinity improvement in four different systems: antibody-receptor, antibody-peptide, receptor-membrane ligand, and receptor-soluble ligand. It was interesting to find that the same evolutionary information could improve the prediction success rates in all the four protein-protein complexes with an exceptional high accuracy (>57%). One of the most striking findings in our present study is that not only in the antibody-combining site but in other protein-protein interfaces almost all of the affinity-enhancing mutations are located at the germline hotspot sequences (RGYW or WA), indicating that DNA hot spot mechanisms may be widely used in the evolution of protein-protein interfaces. Our data suggest that the evolution of distinct protein-protein interfaces may use the same basic strategy under selection pressure to maintain interactions. Additionally, our data indicate that classical simulation techniques incorporating the evolutionary information derived from in vivo antibody affinity maturation can be utilized as a powerful tool to improve the binding affinity of protein-protein complex with a high accuracy."

To determine the relationship between these proteins and bone marrow adiposity, we evaluated the adipogenic potential of marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from mice with decreased serum IGF-1 due to knockdown of IGF-1 production by the liver or knock-out of the binding proteins. We employed 10-16-week-old, liver-specific IGF-1-deficient, IGFBP-3 knock-out (BP3KO) and acid-labile subunit knock-out (ALSKO) mice. We found that expression of the late adipocyte differentiation marker peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma was increased in marrow isolated from ALSKO mice. When induced with adipogenic media, MSC cultures from ALSKO mice revealed a significantly greater number of differentiated adipocytes compared with controls. MSCs from ALSKO mice also exhibited decreased alkaline-phosphatase positive colony size in cultures that were stimulated with osteoblast differentiation media. These osteoblast-like cells from ALSKO mice failed to induce osteoclastogenesis of control cells in co-culture assays, indicating that impairment of IGF-1 complex formation with ALS in bone marrow alters cell fate, leading to increased adipogenesis."

Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine if Loop 9 on the non-GABA binding site interface of the beta2-subunit may be involved in GABA(A) receptor activation. Specifically, residues Gly(170)-Gln(185) of the beta2-subunit were mutated to alanine, co-expressed with wild-type alpha1- and gamma2S-subunits in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and assayed for their activation by GABA, the intravenous anesthetic propofol and the endogenous neurosteroid pregnanolone using whole cell macroscopic recordings. Three mutants, G170A, V175A, and G177A, produced 2.5-, 6.7-, and 5.6-fold increases in GABA EC(50) whereas one mutant, Q185A, produced a 5.2-fold decrease in GABA EC(50). None of the mutations affected the ability of propofol or pregnanolone to potentiate a submaximal GABA response, but the Q185A mutant exhibited 8.3- and 3.5-fold increases in the percent direct activation by propofol and pregnanolone, respectively. Mutant Q185A receptors also had an increased leak current that was sensitive to picrotoxin, indicating an increased gating efficiency. Further Q185E, Q185L, and Q185W substitutions revealed a strong correlation between the hydropathy of the amino acid at this position and the GABA EC(50). Taken together, these results indicate that beta2 Loop 9 is involved in receptor activation by GABA, propofol, and pregnanolone and that beta2(Q185) participates in hydrophilic interactions that are important for stabilizing the closed state of the GABA(A) receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2010302792,"It has been postulated that inactivated β1-integrins are involved in the disordered growth of hematopoietic tumor cells. We recently found that TNIIIA2, a peptide derived from tenascin-C, strongly activates β1-integrins through binding with syndecan-4.

Because TNIIIA2 requires syndecan-4 as a membrane receptor for activation of β1-integrins, it induced apoptosis preferentially in hematopoietic tumor cells, which expressed both VLA-4 and syndecan-4 as membrane receptors mediating the effects of fibronectin and TNIIIA2, respectively. Therefore, normal peripheral blood cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, which poorly expressed syndecan-4, were almost insusceptible to TNIIIA2-induced apoptosis.

In addition to stromal cells, extracellular matrix proteins in lymphoid tissues, such as fibronectin (FN), 2The abbreviations used are: FNfibronectinAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibodypAbpolyclonal antibodyERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseTNtenascinCAM-DRcell adhesion-mediated drug resistance phenotypeCELLcentral cell-binding domainHepIIheparin-binding domain IIz-VADbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fmkfluoromethyl ketoneFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatesiRNAsmall interfering RNAMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinaseAMLacute myelogenous leukemia. collagen, laminin, tenascin (TN), and proteoglycans have been implicated as essential components of the microenvironment that regulates hematopoiesis. Among these extracellular matrix proteins, FN has been proposed to play the most important role in the survival and proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells through FN receptors VLA-4 and VLA-5 (4.Williams D.A. Rios M. Stephens C. Patel V.P. Nature. 1991; 352: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Like their normal counterparts, transformed hematopoietic progenitor cells remain dependent on signals from the FN for survival and proliferation during their malignant progression (5.Shain K.H.

Previous studies have shown that adhesion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, including tumor cells, to FN/extracellular matrix inhibits their proliferation but supports their survival by preventing apoptosis (8.Hurley R.W. McCarthy J.B. Verfaillie C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9.Molla A. Block M.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 83-90PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, increasing evidence has demonstrated that adhesion of hematopoietic tumor cells to FN via VLA-4 and VLA-5 confers a multidrug resistance phenotype, commonly referred to as the cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance phenotype (CAM-DR) (10.Damiano J.S. Hazlehurst L.A. Dalton W.S. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, there have been also several reports demonstrating the negative effects of cell adhesion on cell survival. Integrin-mediated adhesive interaction with FN was shown to cause apoptosis in myeloid cell lines (11.Sugahara H. Kanakura Y. Furitsu T. Ishihara K. Oritani K. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Ishikawa J.

Blood. 2001; 97: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis were not defined, these studies clearly showed that integrin-mediated adhesion plays a negative role in the survival of hematopoietic progenitor/tumor cells. Thus, it remains controversial as to whether adhesion to FN acts positively or negatively on the survival of hematopoietic progenitor/tumor cells. TN-C is characterized by its regulated expression and by its cell adhesion modulatory function (14.Tsunoda T. Inada H. Kalembeyi I. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Sakakibara M. Okada R. Katsuta K. Sakakura T.

Lestani M. Benedetti A. Montagna L. Pedron S. Scarpa A. Menestrina F. Hirohashi S. Pizzolo G. Semenzato G. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1348-1355PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Ocklind G. Talts J. Fässler R.

Finne P. Leivo I. Markkanen-Leppänen M. Haglund C. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3051-3056PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Leins A. Riva P. Lindstedt R. Davidoff M.S. Mehraein P. Weis S. Cancer. 2003; 98: 2430-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, lymphoid tissues of patients with hematopoietic malignancy have highly increased expression of TN-C. TN-C acts as both an adhesive and an antiadhesive substrate, depending on the cellular context (20.Joshi P. Chung C.Y. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently found (21.Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H. Handa H. Yoshida T. Fukai F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34929-34937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that a 22-mer peptide derived from the TN-C molecule, termed TNIIIA2, has a potent ability to induce conformational change in β1-integrin necessary for its functional activation. The active site of TNIIIA2 appears to be cryptic in the TN-C molecule but is exposed by processing with inflammatory proteinases including matrix metalloproteinase-2. Syndecan-4, a membrane-bound heparan sulfate proteoglycan, serves as a receptor mediating TNIIIA2-induced activation of β1-integrins. Because TNIIIA2 can induce adhesion to FN in hematopoietic tumor cells by activating β1-integrins, this factor is useful for studying the role of adhesion to FN in the survival and growth of hematopoietic progenitor/tumor cells. Here we show that a variety of hematopoietic tumor cell lines undergo apoptosis when forced to adhere via VLA-4 to FN by stimulation with integrin activators including TNIIIA2. Because TNIIIA2 requires syndecan-4 as a membrane receptor for β1-integrin activation, normal peripheral blood cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, which poorly express syndecan-4, are almost insusceptible to TNIIIA2-induced apoptosis. The cryptic functional site TNIIIA2 of the TN-C molecule may play a beneficial role in preventing prolonged survival of hematopoietic tumor cells. Peptides derived from human TN-C (TNIIIA2) (RSTDLPGLKAATHYTITIRGVC) and its inactive control peptide, TNIIIA2mutant (TNIIIA2mut) (RSTDLPGLKAATHYTATARGVC) (21.Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T.

Anti-HLA-ABC (mAb B9.12.1) was purchased from Beckman Coulter. Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines Ramos and Raji, erythroleukemia cell line, K562, myeloid leukemia cell lines, U937 and HL-60, T-lymphoma cell line, Jurkat, and human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, were grown with RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Monocytic differentiation of THP-1 cells was induced by incubation for 24 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml), as described previously (25.Drexler H.G. Otsuka K. Gaedicke G. Minowada J. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6078-6082PubMed Google Scholar). Patient leukemic cells were obtained by iliac bone marrow aspiration and cultured, as described previously (26.Matsunaga T. Fukai F. Miura S.

Leukemia. 2008; 22: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and this was accepted by the institutional review boards of Sapporo Medical University and Tokyo University of Science in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils were prepared from the blood of healthy volunteers. After Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield Proc AS) density gradient centrifugation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils were collected and subjected to the magnetic cell sorting (Miltenvi Biotec) using anti-human CD14 Ab and anti-human CD3 and CD19 Abs, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neutrophil preparation by hypotonic lysis of contaminating erythrocytes was performed as described previously (27.Kaneider N.C. Egger P. Dunzendorfer S. Wiedermann C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (28.Fukai F. Kamiya S. Ohwaki T. Goto S. Akiyama K. Goto T. Katayama T. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2000; 46: 145-152PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (3 × 104) suspended with serum-free medium with or without TNIIIA2 were seeded on a 96-well plate coated with FN (10 μg/ml) or its proteolytic fragment (50 μg/ml) derived from the CELL or HepII (22.Fukai F. Suzuki H. Suzuki K. Tsugita A. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8807-8813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubated for 1 h, and then fixed with formalin. Before washing the plate, the total numbers of cells present in four different areas of the well were counted microscopically at ×100 magnification. After washing away the unadhered cells, the numbers of adhered cells in the same areas of the well were also counted. The data represent the percentages of the number of adhered cells relative to the number of cells seeded into the well. Cells (3 × 104) suspended with serum-free medium were seeded on a 96-well plate coated with FN or its fragment (see above) and incubated with or without TNIIIA2 for the indicated period. The assay was also performed on a plate coated with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), as described previously (30.Raz A. Ben-Ze'ev A. Science. 1983; 221: 1307-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The number of living cells was assessed using a cell counting kit (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan). Absorbance at 450 nm was measured to evaluate the number of viable cells. Apoptotic cells were detected by following two different methods: 1) annexin V detection, in which FITC-labeled annexin V staining of cells was performed using an annexin V detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 2) DNA degradation, in which the cells (5 × 105) were cultured in the presence of TNIIIA2 for 2 days. The cells collected were stained with propidium iodide using a Cycle Test PLUS DAN reagent kit, and the fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry to quantify the sub-G1 cell fraction. The percentage of cells in sub-G1 was calculated using LYSIS II software (Becton Dickinson). The cells were treated under the serum-free conditions used for the cell growth/survival assay. Western blotting was performed as described previously (21.Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H. Handa H. Yoshida T. Fukai F.

The siRNAs were transfected into cells by using Transmessenger (Qiagen), and the cells were used for experiments 50 h after transfection. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Bad expression was verified by immunoblot analysis as described previously (21.Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O.

Ramos cells (1 × 107) were subjected to electroporation, with 10 μg of empty vector or cDNAs encoding constitutively active Akt1 using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 300 V and 960 microfarads (6 h). The culture medium was changed to complete medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 12 h before the cell survival assay. Ramos cells (3 × 106) were collected and suspended with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 3% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm Na2VO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Total cell lysate (1 mg of protein) was incubated with protein A-agarose (Pierce) and anti-Bcl-xL pAb or normal IgG at 4 °C for 6 h. Following centrifugation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then subjected to Western blot analysis. For analysis of integrin subunit expression, cell suspension was incubated with anti-integrin mAb for 30 min and then incubated with each FITC-labeled secondary Ab for 30 min. Alternatively, the activation status of β1-integrins on the cell surface was evaluated using anti-activated β1 integrin mAb, AG89, as described previously (21.Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H. Handa H. Yoshida T. Fukai F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34929-34937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ramos cells exclusively express VLA-4 as FN receptors but are incapable of adhering to FN because of their inactivated VLA-4 (29.Sánchez-Aparicio P. Dominguez-Jiménez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In fact, Ramos cells specifically adhered to the FN only after stimulation with an integrin activator, Mg2+, and β1-integrin-activating mAb TS2/16 (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of Ramos cell adhesion with TS2/16 was slightly enhanced by further addition of a bridging Ab (Fig. 1A). TNIIIA2 also induced adhesion of Ramos cells to FN, in which most Ramos cells (∼90% of total cells) adhered to the FN (Fig. 1A). Ramos cell adhesion to the FN stimulated by TNIIIA2 was blocked by the CS-1 peptide, a VLA-4 antagonist, but not by the RGD peptide, a VLA-5 antagonist (Fig. 1A), indicating that TNIIIA2 induced VLA-4-mediated adhesion of Ramos cells to the FN. TNIIIA2-induced cell adhesion was accompanied by the conformational activation of VLA-4, without changing the expression of VLA-4 (supplemental Fig. S1). We first examined the effect of induced adhesion of Ramos cells to FN in response to integrin activators on their growth. Ramos cells were cultured with or without TNIIIA2 in plates coated with FN. In the absence of TNIIIA2, Ramos cells continued to survive and grow in suspension even under serum-free conditions. In the presence of TNIIIA2, Ramos cells became adhered and maintained their adhesive state for at least 3 days (data not shown). The growth of Ramos cells was not influenced by the addition of TNIIIA2 at a low concentration (12.5 μg/ml), whereas it was inhibited by TNIIIA2 at higher concentrations (>25 μg/ml) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). TNIIIA2-induced inhibition of Ramos cell growth was abrogated by the CS-1 peptide or a β1-integrin-blocking mAb (Fig. 1B). TNIIIA2mut, which showed no proadhesive activity (21.Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H. Handa H. Yoshida T. Fukai F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34929-34937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), also did not inhibit Ramos cell growth (Fig. 1B). TNIIIA2-induced inhibition of Ramos cell growth was not evident when cells were incubated with TNIIIA2 on a nonadhesive poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) substrate (30.Raz A. Ben-Ze'ev A. Science. 1983; 221: 1307-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The addition of Mg2+ (10 mm as MgCl2) to the culture medium (RPMI 1640), which contains 0.4 mm Mg2+ (as MgSO4), also caused inhibition of Ramos cell growth, whereas the addition of 2 mm Mg2+ did not (Fig. 1C). Similarly, TS2/16 significantly inhibited Ramos cell growth, and this growth inhibition was further enhanced by the addition of a bridging Ab (Fig. 1C). After the sustained adhesion, Ramos cells showed a change in nuclear morphology characteristic of apoptotic cells, as observed with Hoechst staining (Fig. 2A). Supporting this observation, TNIIIA2-induced growth inhibition was reversed almost completely by pretreating cells with z-VAD fmk, a general caspase inhibitor, or z-DEVD fmk, a specific inhibitor for caspase-3 (Fig. 2B). Growth inhibition induced by TS2/16 or Mg2+ was also blocked with z-VAD fmk (Fig. 2B), suggesting that adhesion-dependent growth inhibition may be due to caspase-dependent apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the appearance of phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces, detected by binding with annexin V. The cell population that stained with FITC-annexin V antibody became evident as early as 3 h following TNIIIA2-induced adhesion and further increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Additionally, TNIIIA2 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA degradation, and the sub-G1 DNA fraction reached nearly 70% at 75 μg/ml of TNIIIA2 (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that potentiated and sustained adhesion to FN by β1-integrin activators leads Ramos cells to apoptosis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways are involved in cell survival and proliferation. ERK1/2 was detected as the phosphorylated state in Ramos cells in suspension without TNIIIA2 stimulation (Fig. 3A). When Ramos cell adhesion was induced by TNIIIA2 at a lower concentration (12.5 μg/ml), where apoptosis did not occur (Fig. 1B), phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not changed remarkably (data not shown). When Ramos cells were induced to adhere to FN by stimulating with TNIIIA2 (50 μg/ml), a marked reduction of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of MEK1/2 was also reduced by the TNIIIA2 treatment (supplemental Fig. S2A). Likewise, stimulation with TS2/16 in combination with the bridging pAb exhibited a decrease in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (supplemental Fig. S2B). Like ERK1/2, stimulation with TNIIIA2 (50 μg/ml) caused a conspicuous reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3B). The decrease in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in response to TNIIIA2 stimulation was prevented by treating cells with CS-1 peptide (Fig. 3C). When Ramos cells were transfected with the constitutively active form of Akt cDNA (Fig. 3D, panel a), the decrease in Akt phosphorylation after TNIIIA2 stimulation was inhibited (Fig. 3D, panel b). As a result, apoptosis induced by TNIIIA2 was partially prevented by ectopic expression of active Akt (Fig. 3D, panel c). Thus, adhesion-dependent Ramos cell apoptosis induced by TNIIIA2 occurred in parallel with the reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. The proapoptotic function of Bad is regulated by its phosphorylation and is a common crucial effector molecule downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways (31.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar, 32.Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Bad was highly phosphorylated at Ser112 and Ser136 in Ramos cells in suspension without TNIIIA2 stimulation (Fig. 4A). This phosphorylation of Bad was reduced through adhesion of Ramos cells to FN in response to TNIIIA2, whereas pretreatment of cells with CS-1 peptide restored Bad phosphorylation at both sites (Fig. 4A). The Akt and ERK can regulate Bcl-xL activity via phosphorylation of Bad, which dissociates from binding with Bcl-xL, resulting in exertion of anti-apoptotic function (31.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar, 32.Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This was tested by treating Ramos cell lysates with anti-Bcl-xL Ab, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed. When cells were stimulated with TNIIIA2, Bad protein became detectable in the immunoprecipitate with anti-Bcl-xL (Fig. 4B). The importance of Bad protein in TNIIIA2-induced apoptosis was examined by transfecting Ramos cells with Bad siRNA. Transfection with Bad siRNA caused a significant decrease in Bad expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas treatment with control siRNA had no detectable effect (Fig. 4C). Transfection with Bad siRNA, but not with control siRNA, rescued Ramos cells from the TNIIIA2-induced decrease in viable cells (Fig. 4D). Thus, Bad protein played a critical role in TNIIIA2-induced apoptosis in Ramos cells. We examined whether adhesion-dependent apoptosis is inducible also in other types of hematopoietic tumor cells. The human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell line U937 expressed both of the FN receptors VLA-4 and VLA-5 (supplemental Fig. S3A). Most of the U937 cells became adherent after treatment with either Mg2+ or TNIIIA2 through β1-integrin activation, in which both VLA-4 and VLA-5 were associated with the adhesion (Fig. 5A). Like Ramos cells, U937 cells remained alive and proliferative in suspension under serum-free conditions. U937 cell survival/growth was reduced by forced adhesion to FN and induced by stimulation with either Mg2+ or TNIIIA2 but was restored by pretreating cells with z-VAD fmk (Fig. 5B, left panel), thus suggesting the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. This apoptosis was blocked by the addition of CS-1 peptide but not by RGD peptide (Fig. 5B). TS2/16 in combination with the bridging Ab also induced apoptosis in U937 cells (data not shown). Adhesion-dependent apoptosis and its preferential blocking with the CS-1 peptide were similarly observed using another AML cell line, HL-60, and human T-lymphocytic leukemia cell line, Jurkat, which expressed both VLA-4 and VLA-5 (Table 1). These results raised the assumption that adhesion-dependent apoptosis is mediated by VLA-4 but not by VLA-5.TABLE 1Expression of VLA-4, VLA-5, and syndecan-4 and effects on adhesion-dependent apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cell lines, fresh AML cells from patients, and peripheral blood cells from normal adultsCellsExpressionaExpression of VLA-4, VLA-5, and syndecan-4 was analyzed by flow cytometry using corresponding Abs.AdhesionbThe effects of Mg2+ (10 mm) or TNIIIA2 (50 μg/ml) upon cell adhesion to the FN were evaluated by the cell adhesion assay and DNA degradation, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”ApoptosiscThe effects of Mg2+ (10 mm) or TNIIIA2 (50 μg/ml) upon apoptosis were evaluated by the cell adhesion assay and DNA degradation, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”VLA-4VLA-5Syndecan-4Induced by Mg2+Induced by TNIIIA2Induced by Mg2+Induced by TNIIIA2%Cell lines B cellsRamos96.53.292.1++++++++++Rajii94.365.32.3++−+− T cell (Jurkat)92.896.642.4++++++++++ Erythroid (K562)9.397.266.7+++++−− MyeloidU93798.198.287.5++++++++++HL-6099.899.775.3++++++++THP-168.520.330.1+++++++THP-1 (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)10.918.799.2++++−−Fresh AML cells Patient A98.288.848.8+++++++ Patient B97.598.59.5+−++−Peripheral blood cells Neutrophil6.7ND3.2−−−− Monocyte48.6ND2.0++−++− Lymphocyte40.5ND4.4++−+−a Expression of VLA-4, VLA-5, and syndecan-4 was analyzed by flow cytometry using corresponding Abs.b The effects of Mg2+ (10 mm) or TNIIIA2 (50 μg/ml) upon cell adhesion to the FN were evaluated by the cell adhesion assay and DNA degradation, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”c The effects of Mg2+ (10 mm) or TNIIIA2 (50 μg/ml) upon apoptosis were evaluated by the cell adhesion assay and DNA degradation, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab To investigate the role of VLA-4 in adhesion-dependent apoptosis, we ex"

Our discovery that D. santomea males can produce viable hybrids when mated to D. melanogaster females enables us to use the armamentarium of genetic tools in the latter species to study the genetic basis of this interspecific difference in pigmentation. Hybridization tests using D. melanogaster deficiencies that include tan show no evidence that this locus is involved in the lighter pigmentation of D. santomea females; rather, the pigmentation difference appears to involve at least four other loci in the region. Earlier results implicating tan may have been based on a type of transgenic analysis that can give misleading results about the genes involved in an evolutionary change."
