https://openalex.org/W2972695893,"A comprehensive knowledge of the types and ratios of microbes that inhabit the healthy human gut is necessary before any kind of pre-clinical or clinical study can be performed that attempts to alter the microbiome to treat a condition or improve therapy outcome. To address this need we present an innovative scalable comprehensive analysis workflow, a healthy human reference microbiome list and abundance profile (GutFeelingKB), and a novel Fecal Biome Population Report (FecalBiome) with clinical applicability. GutFeelingKB provides a list of 157 organisms (8 phyla, 18 classes, 23 orders, 38 families, 59 genera and 109 species) that forms the baseline biome and therefore can be used as healthy controls for studies related to dysbiosis. This list can be expanded to 863 organisms if closely related proteomes are considered. The incorporation of microbiome science into routine clinical practice necessitates a standard report for comparison of an individual’s microbiome to the growing knowledgebase of “normal” microbiome data. The FecalBiome and the underlying technology of GutFeelingKB address this need. The knowledgebase can be useful to regulatory agencies for the assessment of fecal transplant and other microbiome products, as it contains a list of organisms from healthy individuals. In addition to the list of organisms and their abundances, this study also generated a collection of assembled contiguous sequences (contigs) of metagenomics dark matter. In this study, metagenomic dark matter represents sequences that cannot be mapped to any known sequence but can be assembled into contigs of 10,000 nucleotides or higher. These sequences can be used to create primers to study potential novel organisms. All data is freely available from https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/gfkb and NCBI’s Short Read Archive."

https://openalex.org/W2965731227,"The present study investigates skill transfer from Virtual Reality (VR) sports training to the real world, using the fast-paced sport of table tennis.A key assumption of VR training is that the learned skills and experiences transfer to the real world. Yet, in certain application areas, such as VR sports training, the research testing this assumption is sparse.Real-world table tennis performance was assessed using a mixed-model analysis of variance. The analysis comprised a between-subjects (VR training group vs control group) and a within-subjects (pre- and post-training) factor.Fifty-seven participants (23 females) were either assigned to a VR training group (n = 29) or no-training control group (n = 28). During VR training, participants were immersed in competitive table tennis matches against an artificial intelligence opponent. An expert table tennis coach evaluated participants on real-world table tennis playing before and after the training phase. Blinded regarding participant's group assignment, the expert assessed participants' backhand, forehand and serving on quantitative aspects (e.g. count of rallies without errors) and quality of skill aspects (e.g. technique and consistency).VR training significantly improved participants' real-world table tennis performance compared to a no-training control group in both quantitative (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.08) and quality of skill assessments (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.10).This study adds to a sparse yet expanding literature, demonstrating real-world skill transfer from Virtual Reality in an athletic task."
https://openalex.org/W2972608867,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum is a disease that results in yield loss and mycotoxin contamination in wheat globally. This study assessed the effect of a plant biostimulant prepared from a brown macroalga Ascophyllum nodosum (Liquid Seaweed Extract; LSE) alone and in combination with chitosan in controlling Fusarium. Wheat seedlings drenched with LSE and chitosan in combination showed reduced severity of F. graminearum infection on leaves as evidenced by a significant reduction in necrotic area and fewer number of conidia produced in the necrotic area. Gene expression studies showed that the combination of LSE and chitosan amplified the response of pathogenesis-related genes (TaPR1.1, TaPR2, TaPR3, TaGlu2) in wheat seedlings infected with Fusarium spores above that observed for the individual treatments. The combination treatments were more effective in enhancing the activity of various defense related enzymes such as peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. FHB studies on adult plants showed a reduction of bleached spikes in wheat heads treated with the combination of LSE and chitosan. Mycotoxin content appeared to be correlated with FHB severity. Combination treatments of LSE and chitosan reduced the levels of mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and sambucinol in wheat grains. Systemic disease resistance appears to be induced by LSE and chitosan in response to F. graminearum in wheat by inducing defense genes and enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2972929810,"Many bacteria and some archaea produce the second messenger cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP). c-di-AMP controls the uptake of osmolytes in Firmicutes, including the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, making it essential for growth. c-di-AMP is known to directly regulate several potassium channels involved in osmolyte transport in species such as Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but whether this same mechanism is involved in L. monocytogenes, or even whether similar ion channels were present, was not known. Here, we have identified and characterized the putative L. monocytogenes' potassium transporters KimA, KtrCD, and KdpABC. We demonstrate that Escherichia coli expressing KimA and KtrCD, but not KdpABC, transport potassium into the cell, and both KimA and KtrCD are inhibited by c-di-AMP in vivo For KimA, c-di-AMP-dependent regulation requires the C-terminal domain. In vitro assays demonstrated that the dinucleotide binds to the cytoplasmic regulatory subunit KtrC and to the KdpD sensor kinase of the KdpDE two-component system, which in Staphylococcus aureus regulates the corresponding KdpABC transporter. Finally, we also show that S. aureus contains a homolog of KimA, which mediates potassium transport. Thus, the c-di-AMP-dependent control of systems involved in potassium homeostasis seems to be conserved in phylogenetically related bacteria. Surprisingly, the growth of an L. monocytogenes mutant lacking the c-di-AMP-synthesizing enzyme cdaA is only weakly inhibited by potassium. Thus, the physiological impact of the c-di-AMP-dependent control of potassium uptake seems to be less pronounced in L. monocytogenes than in other Firmicutes."
https://openalex.org/W2972487698,"This study aimed to examine the macrophage phenotype and its relationship to renal function and histological changes in human DN and the effect of TREM-1 on high-glucose-induced macrophage activation. We observed that in renal tissue biopsies, the expression of CD68 and M1 was apparent in the glomeruli and interstitium, while accumulation of M2 and TREM-1 was primarily observed in the interstitium. The numbers of CD68, M1, and M2 macrophages infiltrating in the DN group were increased in a process-dependent manner compared with the control group, and the intensities of the infiltrates were proportional to the rate of subsequent decline in renal function. M1 macrophages were recruited into the kidney at an early stage (I+IIa) of DN. The M1-to-M2 macrophage ratio peaked at this time, whereas M2 macrophages predominated at later time points (III) when the percentage of M1/M2 macrophages was at its lowest level. In an in vitro study, we showed that under high glucose conditions, macrophages began to up-regulate their expression of TREM-1, M1, and marker iNOS and decreased the M2 marker MR. However, the above effects of high-glucose were abolished when TREM-1 expression was inhibited by TREM-1 siRNA. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the M1/M2 activation state and the progress of DN, and TREM-1 played an important role in high-glucose-induced macrophage phenotype transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2972486514,"The difficulty in obtaining as well as maintaining weight loss, together with the impairment of metabolic control in conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, may represent pathological situations of inadequate neural communication between the brain and peripheral organs and tissues. Innervation of adipose tissues by peripheral nerves provides a means of communication between the master metabolic regulator in the brain (chiefly the hypothalamus), and energy-expending and energy-storing cells in the body (primarily adipocytes). Although chemical and surgical denervation studies have clearly demonstrated how crucial adipose tissue neural innervation is for maintaining proper metabolic health, we have uncovered that adipose tissue becomes neuropathic (ie: reduction in neurites) in various conditions of metabolic dysregulation. Here, utilizing both human and mouse adipose tissues, we present evidence of adipose tissue neuropathy, or loss of proper innervation, under pathophysiological conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and aging, all of which are concomitant with insult to the adipose organ as well as metabolic dysfunction. Neuropathy is indicated by loss of nerve fiber protein expression, reduction in synaptic markers, and lower neurotrophic factor expression in adipose tissue. Aging-related adipose neuropathy particularly results in loss of innervation around the tissue vasculature, which cannot be reversed by exercise. Together with indications of neuropathy in muscle and bone, these findings underscore that peripheral neuropathy is not restricted to classic tissues like the skin of distal extremities, and that loss of innervation to adipose may trigger or exacerbate metabolic diseases. In addition, we have demonstrated stimulation of adipose tissue neural plasticity with cold exposure, which may ameliorate adipose neuropathy and be a potential therapeutic option to re-innervate adipose and restore metabolic health."
https://openalex.org/W2972917605,"In this study, the spatial distribution of the transient pressure and the slipstream caused by a 1/10 scaled metro train passing through a tunnel was studied with moving model test. We hereby investigate the mechanism underlying the mitigation of the transient pressure on both the train surface and tunnel wall, as well as that of the slipstream in the tunnel. Experimental results showed that the airshaft at different locations in a tunnel had different pressure relief effects. The most significant pressure amplitude decreased by 36.0% with the airshaft locating in the middle of the tunnel. Meanwhile, the slipstream speed was also relieved from 0.45 to 0.36 after an airshaft. We also assessed and analyzed the impact of train speed on the transient pressures and slipstream. It was found that the increase of the train speed would increase the transient pressure and slipstream speed, but it did not effect their spatial distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2973121903,"Allergic rhinitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the upper respiratory tract, which is associated with high incidence of anxiety symptom. There is evidence that medial prefrontal cortex modulates anxiety-related behaviors and receives projections from olfactory bulb. Since olfactory dysfunction has been reported in allergic rhinitis, we aimed to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and oscillations of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit in an animal model of allergic rhinitis. The number of open arm entries in elevated zero maze was significantly reduced in sensitized rats exposed to intranasal ovalbumin compared to the control group, which was indicating the enhancement of anxiety-like behavior in allergic rhinitis animals. Analysis of local field potentials in olfactory bulb and medial prefrontal cortex during immobility and exploration state showed that anxiety-like behavior induced by allergic rhinitis was in association with increased activity of medial prefrontal cortex and enhancement of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex coupling in delta and theta bands. Moreover, in allergic rhinitis animals, theta strongly coordinates local gamma activity in olfactory bulb and medial prefrontal cortex, which means to have a strong local theta/gamma coupling. We suggested that disruption of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit due to allergic reactions might have a governing role for inducing anxiety-like behavior in the allergic rhinitis experimental model."

https://openalex.org/W2972651895,"SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) is a set of multi-subunits chromatin remodeling complexes, playing important roles in a variety of biological processes. Loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding SWI/SNF subunits have been reported in more than 20% of human cancers. Thus, it was widely considered as a tumor suppressor in the past decade. However, recent studies reported that some genes encoding subunits of SWI/SNF complexes were amplified and play oncogenic roles in human cancers. In present study, we summarized the genetic alteration spectrum of SWI/SNF complexes, and firstly systematically estimated both the copy number variations and point mutations of all 30 genes encoding the subunits in this complex. Additionally, the bioinformatics analyses were performed for two significantly amplified genes, ACTL6A and BRD9, to investigate their oncogenic roles in human cancers. Our findings may lay a foundation for the discovery of potential treatment targets in SWI/SNF complexes of cancers."

In this study, using molecular and synthetic biology approaches, biochemistry, radiolabeling techniques, and NMR and MS analyses, we examined the role of GacB, encoded in the S. pyogenes GAC gene cluster, in the GAC biosynthesis pathway. We demonstrate that GacB is the first characterized α-d-GlcNAc-β-1,4-l-rhamnosyltransferase that synthesizes the committed step in the biosynthesis of the GAC virulence determinant. Importantly, the substitution of S. pyogenes gacB with the homologous gene from Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus), Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (Group C Streptococcus), Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (Group G Streptococcus), or Streptococcus mutans complemented the GAC biosynthesis pathway. These results, combined with those from extensive in silico studies, reveal a common phylogenetic origin of the genes required for this priming step in >40 pathogenic species of the Streptococcus genus, including members from the Lancefield Groups B, C, D, E, G, and H. Importantly, this priming step appears to be unique to streptococcal ABC transporter–dependent RhaPS biosynthesis, whereas the Wzx/Wzy-dependent streptococcal capsular polysaccharide pathways instead require an α-d-Glc-β-1,4-l-rhamnosyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W2972800774,"A comprehensive, accurate, and revisable alpha taxonomy is crucial for biodiversity studies, but is challenging when data from reference specimens are difficult to collect or observe. However, recent technological advances can overcome some of these challenges. To illustrate this, we used modern approaches to tackle a centuries-old taxonomic enigma presented by Fraser’s Clawed Frog, Xenopus fraseri, including whether X. fraseri is different from other species, and if so, where it is situated geographically and phylogenetically. To facilitate these inferences, we used high-resolution techniques to examine morphological variation, and we generated and analyzed complete mitochondrial genome sequences from all Xenopus species, including >150-year-old type specimens. Our results demonstrate that X. fraseri is indeed distinct from other species, firmly place this species within a phylogenetic context, and identify its minimal geographic distribution in northern Ghana and northern Cameroon. These data also permit novel phylogenetic resolution into this intensively studied and biomedically important group. Xenopus fraseri was formerly thought to be a rainforest endemic placed alongside species in the amieti species group; in fact this species occurs in arid habitat on the borderlands of the Sahel, and is the smallest member of the muelleri species group. This study illustrates that the taxonomic enigma of Fraser’s frog was a combined consequence of sparse collection records, interspecies conservation and intraspecific polymorphism in external anatomy, and type specimens with unusual morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2972316504,"Falls among older adults is a common precipitating factor for unintentional injuries and represent a major health problem associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care cost in low-and-middle-income countries. The burden of fall in this population is well established in high-income countries and scant attention is given to this precipitating factor in low-and-middle-income countries, including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with fall among community-dwelling older adults in Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among community-dwelling older adults of Gondar. Multi-stage random sampling technique was used across administrative areas. Six hundred and five households were selected proportionally using systematic random sampling technique. Physical measurement and face to face interview method were employed using a structured questionnaire for data collection. Data were analyzed descriptively and through uni- and multivariate logistic regression model.One hundred and seventy (n = 170, 28.4%; 95% CI 24.7-32.1) community-dwelling older adults reported having experienced fall in the past 12 months. Sex (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.24-2.95), low educational status (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.19-4.74), uncomfortable home environment (OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.34, 3.04), having diagnosed medical condition (OR = 4.659, 95% CI: 1.20-18.02), and use of medication (OR = 5.57, 95% CI: 1.19-26.21) were significantly associated risk factors of self-reported fall in the past 12 months. Most outdoor falls are associated with females and participants aged below 66 years.In conclusion, more than 1/4th of the community-dwelling older adults experienced at least one episode of fall and about 60% of them reported recurrent falls. Identifying risk group and risk factors that could be modified so as to prevent falls in older adults deserves attention. Outdoor falls are usually attributable to modifiable environmental aspects and improvements in outdoor environment needed."
https://openalex.org/W2972992496,"Preventable adverse effects of medicines often pass unnoticed, but lead to real harm.Nurse-led monitoring using the structured Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRe) Profile identifies and addresses adverse effects of mental health medicines.This study investigated the implementation and clinical impact of ADRe, and barriers to and facilitators of sustained utilisation in routine practice.Administration of ADRe was observed for 30 residents prescribed mental health medicines in ten care homes. The study pharmacist reviewed completed ADRes against medication records. Policy context was explored in 30 interviews with service users, nurse managers and strategic leads in Wales.Residents were aged 60-95, and prescribed 1-17 (median 9 [interquartile range (IQR) 7-13]) medicines. ADRe identified a median of 18 [IQR 11.5-23] problems per resident and nurses made 2 [1-2] changes to care per resident. For example: falls were reported for 9 residents, and care was modified for 5; pain was identified in 8 residents, and alleviated for 7; all 6 residents recognised as dyspnoeic were referred to prescribers. Nurses referred 17 of 30 residents to prescribers. Pharmacists recommended review for all 30. Doubts about administering ADRe, sometimes expressed by people who had not yet used it, diminished as it became familiar. ADRe was needed to bridge communication between resident, nurses and prescribers. When barriers of time, complacency, and doctors' non-availability were overcome, reporting with ADRe made prescribers more likely to heed nurses' concerns regarding residents' welfare. Clinical gains were facilitated by one-to-one time, staff-resident relationships, and unification of documentation.To our knowledge, ADRe is the only instrument that brings a full account of patients' problems to medication reviews. This juxtaposition of signs and symptoms against prescriptions facilitates dose adjustments and de-prescribing and leads to: reduced pain and sedation; early identification of problems linked to ADRs, such as falls; and timely medication reviews e.g. for dyspnoea."
https://openalex.org/W2972429320,"Effects of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers on viability and function of cell lines such as NB4 (human acute promyelocytic leukemia), A549 (human lung cancer (adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial tumor)) and MCF-7 (human breast cancer (invasive breast ductal carcinoma)) were investigated. Two types of Aβ oligomers were used in the study. The first type was produced in the presence of oligomerization inhibitor, hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The second type of amyloids was assembled in the absence of the inhibitor. The first type preparation was predominantly populated with dimers and trimers, while the second type contained mostly pentadecamers. These amyloid species exhibited different secondary protein structure with considerable amount of antiparallel β sheet structural elements in HFIP oligomerized Aβ mixtures. The effect of the cell growth inhibition, which was stronger in the case of HFIP Aβ oligomers, was observed for all cell lines. Tests aiming at elucidating the effects of the amyloid species on cell cycles showed little differences between amyloid preparations. This prompts us to conclude that the effect on the cancer cell proliferation rate is less specific to the biological processes developing inside the cells during the proliferation. Therefore, cell growth inhibition may involve interactions with the peripheral parts of the cancer cells, such as a phospholipid membrane, and only in case of the NB4 cells, where accumulation of amyloid species inside the cells was detected, one may imply the opposite. In general, cancer cells were much less susceptible to the damaging effects of amyloid oligomers compared to earlier observations in mixed neuronal cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2972473734,"Plasma chemistry is widely used in diagnostic and research settings in sea turtles. However, plasma discolorations such as hemolysis are often not considered in data interpretation. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the effects of moderate hemolysis on plasma electrolytes, minerals, and proteins using dry chemistry analysis (DCA) and protein electrophoresis from nesting leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) from Florida and to (2) establish blood analyte reference intervals. Twenty-six plasma samples with absence of hemolysis were selected and sub-divided into one non-hemolytic aliquot and an aliquot that was experimentally manipulated to mimic moderate hemolysis. Plasma samples were analyzed for hemoglobin using a handheld photometer; sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and total protein using DCA; and protein electrophoresis. Packed cell volume and hemoglobin were measured in corresponding whole blood samples. Reference intervals were established. All analytes except calcium and pre-albumin were significantly higher and the calcium:phosphorus and albumin:globulin ratios were significantly lower in hemolytic plasma compared to non-hemolytic plasma. Alpha2-globulins and potassium were the analytes most impacted by hemolysis, averaging 3.3- and 2.0-fold higher in hemolyzed samples, respectively, indicating that (1) hemoglobin migrates into the alpha2-globulin region in this species and (2) notable intracellular potassium is released into plasma with hemolysis. Attempted conversion factors for compensation of hemolysis were considered inaccurate for 4 of 16 analytes due to non-significant regression lines. We also report that PCV provides an estimate of hemoglobin (g/L) using the formula: (2.59 × PCV) + 24.59. Given the spurious effects of hemolysis, the degree of this artifact should be reported with biochemistry data, and samples with moderate to severe hemolysis should be excluded from datasets when interpreting electrolyte, mineral, and protein results. This will ensure accurate data interpretation for individual turtles in rehabilitation or research settings and population-level data relevant to conservation-focused projects."
https://openalex.org/W2973169185,"Bacterial chemotaxis receptors form extended hexagonal arrays that integrate and amplify signals to control swimming behavior. Transmembrane signaling begins with a 2-Å ligand-induced displacement of an α helix in the periplasmic and transmembrane domains, but it is unknown how the cytoplasmic domain propagates the signal an additional 200 Å to control the kinase CheA bound to the membrane-distal tip of the receptor. The receptor cytoplasmic domain has previously been shown to be highly dynamic as both a cytoplasmic fragment (CF) and within the intact chemoreceptor; modulation of its dynamics is thought to play a key role in signal propagation. This hydrogen deuterium exchange-MS (HDX-MS) study of functional complexes of CF, CheA, and CheW bound to vesicles in native-like arrays reveals that the CF is well-ordered only in its protein interaction region where it binds CheA and CheW. We observe rapid exchange throughout the rest of the CF, with both uncorrelated (EX2) and correlated (EX1) exchange patterns, suggesting the receptor cytoplasmic domain retains disorder even within functional complexes. HDX rates are increased by inputs that favor the kinase-off state. We propose that chemoreceptors achieve long-range allosteric control of the kinase through a coupled equilibrium: CheA binding in a kinase-on conformation stabilizes the cytoplasmic domain, and signaling inputs that destabilize this domain (ligand binding and demethylation) disfavor CheA binding such that it loses key contacts and reverts to a kinase-off state.

https://openalex.org/W2972527930,"Host plant resistance is the most practical approach to control the Southern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita; RKN), which has emerged as one of the most serious economic pests of Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Previous QTL analyses have identified a resistance locus on chromosome 11 (qMi-C11) affecting galling and another locus on chromosome-14 (qMi-C14) affecting egg production. Although these two QTL regions were fine mapped and candidate genes identified, expression profiling of genes would assist in further narrowing the list of candidate genes in the QTL regions. We applied the comparative transcriptomic approach to compare expression profiles of genes between RKN susceptible and resistance genotypes at an early stage of RKN development that coincides with the establishment of a feeding site and at the late stage of RKN development that coincides with RKN egg production. Sequencing of cDNA libraries produced over 315 million reads of which 240 million reads (76%) were mapped on to the Gossypium hirsutum genome. A total of 3,789 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified which were further grouped into four clusters based on their expression profiles. A large number of DEGs were found to be down regulated in the susceptible genotype at the late stage of RKN development whereas several genes were up regulated in the resistant genotype. Key enriched categories included transcription factor activity, defense response, response to phyto-hormones, cell wall organization, and protein serine/threonine kinase activity. Our results also show that the DEGs in the resistant genotype at qMi-C11 and qMi-C14 loci displayed higher expression of defense response, detoxification and callose deposition genes, than the DEGs in the susceptible genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2972735372,"We investigated the phylogeography of the dugong (Dugong dugon) across its original range using museum material from 14 natural history museum and university collections. The mitochondrial DNA control region was successfully amplified from samples of bone or tooth powder from 162 individuals. These samples range from 1827 to 1996 and span the historical distribution range of the dugong. We were able to successfully amplify overlapping fragments of the D-loop region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) resulting in sequences of a 355 bp fragment for 162 individuals for the final analyses. This included a new sequence (189 bp) from a previously unidentified piece of skin of the extinct Steller’s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), as an outgroup. The resulting dugong sequences match those from previous studies of dugongs from Australia and Indonesia, but revealed several new and divergent mtDNA lineages in the Indian Ocean. One mtDNA lineage includes most specimens from the Western Indian Ocean, with another distinct lineage isolated to nearby Madagascar and Comores. There is little geographic structuring detectable among other populations in the Western Indian Ocean and all populations from that region appear to have historically contained comparatively low levels of genetic diversity. The genetic diversity of several Indian Ocean samples collected after 1950 was lower than that of the samples collected earlier from similar locations, a result coincident with the anecdotal reductions in population size. The new lineages and potential loss of diversity highlight the particular conservation importance and vulnerability of dugong populations in the Western Indian Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2972607317,"CDK2-associated cullin domain 1 (CAC1) is as a novel cell cycle regulator widely expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, its expression and function in drug resistant CRC cells remains elusive. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the biochemical function and relevance of CAC1 in drug resistant CRC cells, and detect the potential mechanism. For this purpose, a total of 83 CRC cases were collected for the immunohistochemical analysis of CAC1 expression. Functional studies (stable transfection, flow cytometry, colony formation, and invasion and migration assays) were performed in SW480, LoVo and their corresponding 5-FU resistant cells. In addition, a nude mice xenograft model was established for further observation in vivo. In the present study, CAC1 protein expression was higher in CRC tissues than that in normal tissues (P<0.05). Furthermore, CAC1 protein expression was higher in SW480/5-FU cells than in SW480 cells. CAC1 knockdown arrested 5-FU resistant cells at the G1/S phase and increased the sensitivity of 5-FU resistant cells to 5-FU by inducing apoptosis. In addition, CAC1 reduced the invasive and migration ability of SW480/5-FU and LoVo/5-FU cells in vitro, and reduced their tumorigenicity and metastatic ability in vivo. Finally, CAC1 knockdown resulted in decreased P-glycoprotein and MRP-1 protein expression. Based on these results, it can be concluded that CAC1 plays an important role in the occurrence and promotion of drug resistance in CRC. Therefore, the knockdown of CAC1 may be considered as a new strategy for the development of CRC drug resistance treatments in the future."

The INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) is a brief neuropsychological screening tool, developed to assess executive dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders.We aimed to examine whether and how MCI patients can be differentiated from cognitively healthy controls (HC) and mild to moderate AD patients based on IFS performance. We also explored how IFS scores are associated with age, years of education, and depressive/anxious symptoms (as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).IFS total scores were compared between 26 HC, 32 MCI and 21 mild to moderate AD patients. The three groups were matched for age and education. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was analyzed and optimal cut-offs were determined.Healthy participants had higher IFS scores than both clinical groups, and MCI patients had higher scores than AD patients. IFS showed high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of MCI (AUC = .89, p < .001) and AD (AUC = .99, p < .001), and for the differentiation between the clinical groups (AUC = .76, p < .001). We provide optimal cut-offs for the identification of MCI and AD and for their differentiation. We also found that, in general, higher education predicted higher IFS scores (no associations with age and depressive/anxious symptoms were observed). Altogether, these findings indicate that evaluating executive functions with the IFS can be valuable for the identification of MCI, a high-risk group for dementia, and for differentiating this condition from healthy aging and AD."
https://openalex.org/W2973167226,"Pulmonary veins (PVs) are the major origin of atrial fibrillation. Recently, we recorded hyperpolarization-activated Cl− current (ICl, h) in rat PV cardiomyocytes. Unlike the well-known chloride channel protein 2 (CLCN2) current, the activation curve of ICl, h was hyperpolarized as the Cl− ion concentration ([Cl−]i) increased. This current could account for spontaneous activity in PV cardiomyocytes linked to atrial fibrillation. In this study, we aimed to identify the channel underlying ICl, h. Using RT-PCR amplification specific for Clcn2 or its homologs, a chloride channel was cloned from rat PV and detected in rat PV cardiomyocytes using immunocytochemistry. The gene sequence and electrophysiological functions of the protein were identical to those previously reported for Clcn2, with protein activity observed as a hyperpolarization-activated current by the patch-clamp method. However, the [Cl−]i dependence of activation was entirely different from the observed ICl, h of PV cardiomyocytes; the activation curve of the Clcn2-transfected cells shifted toward positive potential with increased [Cl−]i, whereas the ICl, h of PV and left ventricular cardiomyocytes showed a leftward shift. Therefore, we used MS to explore the possibility of additional proteins interacting with CLCN2 and identified an individual 71-kDa protein, HSPA8, that was strongly expressed in rat PV cardiomyocytes. With co-expression of HSPA8 in HEK293 and PC12 cells, the CLCN2 current showed voltage-dependent activation and shifted to negative potential with increasing [Cl−]i. Molecular docking simulations further support an interaction between CLCN2 and HSPA8. These findings suggest that CLCN2 in rat heart contains HSPA8 as a unique accessory protein.

https://openalex.org/W2972562346,"Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is important for organogenesis during development. Recent studies have indicated that SHH is also involved in the proliferation and transformation of astrocytes to the reactive phenotype. However, the mechanisms underlying these are unknown. Involvement of SHH signaling in calcium (Ca) signaling has not been extensively studied. Here, we report that SHH and Smoothened agonist (SAG), an activator of the signaling receptor Smoothened (SMO) in the SHH pathway, activate Ca oscillations in cultured murine hippocampal astrocytes. The response was rapid, on a minute time scale, indicating a noncanonical pathway activity. Pertussis toxin blocked the SAG effect, indicating an involvement of a Gi coupled to SMO. Depletion of extracellular ATP by apyrase, an ATP-degrading enzyme, inhibited the SAG-mediated activation of Ca oscillations. These results indicate that SAG increases extracellular ATP levels by activating ATP release from astrocytes, resulting in Ca oscillation activation. We hypothesize that SHH activates SMO-coupled Gi in astrocytes, causing ATP release and activation of Gq/11-coupled P2 receptors on the same cell or surrounding astrocytes. Transcription factor activities are often modulated by Ca patterns; therefore, SHH signaling may trigger changes in astrocytes by activating Ca oscillations. This enhancement of Ca oscillations by SHH signaling may occur in astrocytes in the brain in vivo because we also observed it in hippocampal brain slices. In summary, SHH and SAG enhance Ca oscillations in hippocampal astrocytes, Gi mediates SAG-induced Ca oscillations downstream of SMO, and ATP-permeable channels may promote the ATP release that activates Ca oscillations in astrocytes.

This analysis aimed to assess associations between hand E. coli contamination and child age and determine if observed hand cleanliness can serve as a proxy for E. coli contamination on young children's hands.Trained field workers collected hand rinse samples from children aged 1-14 months in 584 households in rural Bangladesh and assessed the visual cleanliness of child hands (fingernails, finger pads and palms). Samples were analyzed using the IDEXX most probable number (MPN) methodto enumerate E. coli. We assessed if child age (immobile children aged 1-4 months vs. mobile children aged 5-14 months) is associated with log10 E. coli counts on hands using generalized estimating equations (GEE). We estimated the log10 difference in hand E. coli counts associated with the cleanliness of different hand parts using a multivariable GEE model.We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for dirty fingernails, fingerpads, palms and overall hands (the three observed parts combined) against binary E. coli presence on hands.E. coli was detected on 43% of child hands. Children in the mobile age range had 0.17 log10 MPN higher E. coli on hands than those in the immobile age range (Δlog10 = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.32, p = 0.03). Children with visible dirt particles on finger pads had 0.46 log10 MPN higher E. coli on hands than those with clean finger pads (Δlog10 = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.87, p = 0.03). Dirty fingernails indicated binary E. coli presence with 81% sensitivity and 26% specificity while dirty fingerpads and palms indicated E. coli presence with 29% sensitivity and 75-77% specificity. The PPV was 45-48% and NPV 59-65% for all three types of observations.Hand contamination with E. coli was prevalent among young children in rural Bangladesh, with higher levels of contamination among mobile children. Studies should assess if strategies to remove animal feces from the courtyard, provide designated hygienic play spaces for children and deliver targeted messaging to mothers to wipe or wash children's hands after contact with animals and animal feces reduce child hand contamination. Visible hand cleanliness was a poor predictor of E. coli presence on young children's hands so other low-cost field measurements are needed to accurately detect fecal contamination on hands."
https://openalex.org/W2972885325,"To determine the factors associated with lung cancer diagnosis and mortality after detecting a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) in routine clinical practice, in men and in women for both chest radiograph and CT.A 5-year follow-up of a retrospective cohort of of 25,422 (12,594 men, 12,827 women) patients aged ≥35 years referred for chest radiograph or CT in two hospitals in Spain (2010-2011). SPN were detected in 893 (546 men, 347 women) patients. We estimated the cumulative incidence of lung cancer at 5-years, the association of patient and nodule characteristics with SPN malignancy using Poisson logistic regression, stratifying by sex and type of imaging test. We calculated lung cancer specific mortality rate by sex and SPN detection and hazard rates by cox regression.133 (14.9%) out of 893 patients with an SPN and 505 (2.06%) of the 24,529 patients without SPN were diagnosed with lung cancer. Median diameter of SPN in women who developed cancer was larger than in men. Men who had a chest radiograph were more likely to develop a lung cancer if the nodule was in the upper-lobes, which was not the case for women. In patients with an SPN, smoking increased the risk of lung cancer among men (chest radiograph: RR = 11.3, 95%CI 1.5-83.3; CT: RR = 7.5, 95%CI 2.2, 26.0) but smoking was not significantly associated with lung cancer diagnosis or mortality among women with an SPN. The relative risk of lung cancer diagnosis in women with SPN versus those without was much higher compared to men (13.7; 95%CI 9.2, 20.4 versus 6.2; 95%CI 4.9,7.9).The factors associated with SPN malignancy and 5-year lung cancer mortality were different among men and women, especially regarding smoking history and SPN characteristics, where we observed a relatively high rate of lung cancer diagnosis among female non-smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2973133288,"Trees have multi-aspect influence on the microclimate in urbanised areas. Therefore, it is important to investigate the biotic and abiotic factors affecting their health. The aim of the conducted study was to assess the chemical composition of soils and the nutritional status of lime and horse chestnut trees in selected sites and the influence of these factors on the condition and health of these tree species in urbanised areas. The research was conducted on selected trees (n = 643) growing in different parts of the city. The soils and plants were analysed for the content of macro- and microelements, sodium and heavy metals. A canonical variation analysis (CVA)-the canonical variant of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to construct the model. The CVA enabled the creation of 4 CCA models. The research showed that in general, the soil in all the sites of lime and horse chestnut trees was alkalised-at the same time it was characterised by low salinity. Despite the alkaline soil the statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the content of manganese in the lime leaves and the deterioration of their health. In spite of that due to the satisfactory health status and condition of trees in most locations temporary guide values of nutrients were proposed for trees growing in urbanised areas. The following temporary guide values of nutrients were proposed for the horse chestnut trees (% d. m.): N 2.38%-4.71%, P 0.24%-0.46%, K 1.13%-2.31%, Ca 1.05%-2.12%, Mg 0.16%-0.42%, S 0.12%-0.23%; Fe 89.8-198.8, Zn 17.6-33.1, Cu 7.36-19.61 (mg kg-1 d. m.).

https://openalex.org/W2973066563,"Fcp1 is a protein phosphatase that facilitates transcription elongation and termination by dephosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. High-throughput genetic screening and gene expression profiling of fcp1 mutants revealed a novel connection to Cdk8, the Mediator complex kinase subunit, and Skn7, a key transcription factor in the oxidative stress response pathway. Briefly, Skn7 was enriched as a regulator of genes whose mRNA levels were altered in fcp1 and cdk8Δ mutants and was required for the suppression of fcp1 mutant growth defects by loss of CDK8 under oxidative stress conditions. Targeted analysis revealed that mutating FCP1 decreased Skn7 mRNA and protein levels as well as its association with target gene promoters but paradoxically increased the mRNA levels of Skn7-dependent oxidative stress-induced genes (TRX2 and TSA1) under basal and induced conditions. The latter was in part recapitulated via chemical inhibition of transcription in WT cells, suggesting that a combination of transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects underscored the increased mRNA levels of TRX2 and TSA1 observed in the fcp1 mutant. Interestingly, loss of CDK8 robustly normalized the mRNA levels of Skn7-dependent genes in the fcp1 mutant background and also increased Skn7 protein levels by preventing its turnover. As such, our work suggested that loss of CDK8 could overcome transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional alterations in the fcp1 mutant through its regulatory effect on Skn7. Furthermore, our work also implicated FCP1 and CDK8 in the broader response to environmental stressors in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2972782491,"Adjuvant chemotherapy is required for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients after surgical treatment. Gemcitabine and gemcitabine plus cisplatin are considered the appropriate regimen; however, the response spectrum to chemotherapy differs between patients. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the response pattern of individual CCA patients by using an in vitro method, histoculture drug response assay (HDRA), to predict the chemosensitivity of individual patients in a prospective study. Moreover, we also investigate the expression of gemcitabine and cisplatin sensitivity factors in CCA tissues in the same cases. Based on the dose response curve, 1000 and 1500 μg/ml of gemcitabine were used as the testing concentrations. For cisplatin, concentrations of 20 and 25 μg/ml were selected for testing and for the combination regimen, 1000 μg/ml of gemcitabine and 20 μg/ml of cisplatin were chosen. The median %IR of each drug was measured as the cut-off to categorize the response pattern into response and non-response groups. In addition, we compared the effectiveness of the chemotherapy regimens between gemcitabine alone and gemcitabine plus cisplatin. The %IR of the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin was significantly higher than gemcitabine alone. The relationship between the expression level of gemcitabine and cisplatin sensitive factors and the individual response pattern as well as clinicopathological data of CCA patients were analyzed. The results indicated that a low expression of the gemcitabine sensitive factor hENT-1 was significantly associated with the non-response group in vitro (p = 0.002). Moreover, the low expression of hENT-1 was also significantly associated with advanced stages CCA in the patients (p = 0.025). A low expression of MT and ERCC1 was significantly correlated with the response group in the in vitro experiments (p = 0.015 and p = 0.037 for MT and ERCC1, respectively). Therefore, HDRA may serve as an aid to selecting chemotherapy, and the expression of hNET-1, MT and ERCC1 may serve as biomarkers for predicting chemotherapy success."
https://openalex.org/W2972908063,"Vibrational behavior of psyllids was first documented more than six decades ago. Over the years, workers have postulated as to what the exact signal producing mechanisms of psyllids might be but the exact mechanism has remained elusive. The aim of this study is to determine the specific signal producing structures and mechanisms of the psyllids. Here we examine six hypotheses of signal producing mechanisms from both previous and current studies that include: wingbeat, wing-wing friction, wing-thorax friction, wing-leg friction, leg-abdomen friction, and axillary sclerite-thorax friction. Through selective removal of possible signal producing structures and measuring wing beat frequency with high speed videos, six hypotheses were tested. Extensive experiments were implemented on the species Macrohomotoma gladiata Kuwayama, while other species belonging to different families, i.e., Trioza sozanica (Boselli), Mesohomotoma camphorae Kuwayama, Cacopsylla oluanpiensis (Yang), and Cacopsylla tobirae (Miyatake) were also examined to determine the potential prevalence of each signal producing mechanism within the Psylloidea. Further, scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine possible rubbing structures. The result of high speed video recordings showed that wingbeat frequency did not match the dominant frequency of vibrational signals, resulting in the rejection of wingbeat hypothesis. As for the selective removal experiments, the axillary sclerite-thorax friction hypothesis is accepted and wing-thorax friction hypothesis is supported partially, while others are rejected. The SEM showed that the secondary axillary sclerite of the forewing bears many protuberances that would be suitable for stridulation. In conclusion, the signal producing mechanism of psyllids may involve two sets of morphological structures. The first is stridulation between the axillary sclerite of the forewing and the mesothorax. The second is stridulation between the axillary cord and anal area of the forewing."

In this study, we analyzed the non-specific reads obtained during a metabarcoding survey of the bacterial communities associated to three different tissues collected from 13 wild Mediterranean teleost fish species. In total, 30 eukaryotic genera were identified as putative parasites of teleosts, associated to skin mucus, gills mucus and intestine: 2 ascomycetes, 4 arthropods, 2 cnidarians, 7 nematodes, 10 platyhelminthes, 4 apicomplexans, 1 ciliate as well as one order in dinoflagellates (Syndiniales). These results highlighted that (1) the metabarcoding approach was able to uncover a large spectrum of symbiotic organisms associated to the fish species studied, (2) symbionts not yet identified in several teleost species were putatively present, (3) the parasitic diversity differed markedly across host species and (4) in most cases, the distribution of known parasitic genera within tissues is in accordance with the literature. The current work illustrates the large insights that can be gained by making maximum use of data from a metabarcoding approach."
https://openalex.org/W2973134106,"Paneth cells (PCs) are specialized epithelial cells of the small bowel that contain multiple secretory granules filled with antimicrobial peptides and trophic factors, which are essential for the control of the microorganisms growth and maintaining intestinal integrity. Alterations in their function are associated with an imbalance of the normal microbiota, gastrointestinal infections and inflammatory processes, such as Crohn's disease (CD). One of the most common murine models for studying CD is IL-10-/- mouse. IL-10-/- mice when housed in conventional conditions and take contact with commensal microorganisms develop an acute enterocolitis mediated by a Th1 immune response. Even though, alterations in PCs function are related to CD, they had not been characterized yet in this mouse model. Here we show that in specific pathogen free conditions IL-10-/- mice have aberrant granules and a large number of immature PCs at the bottom of the crypt in the ileum of IL-10-/- mice before developing intestinal inflammation, along with a reduced expression of Indian Hedgehog. In addition, IL-10-/- Paneth cells presented a reduced expression of cryptidin-4, and a heterogeneous distribution of lysozyme+ granules. The alterations in the maturation of the PCs at the bottom of the crypt were not modified after the colonization by the conventional microbiota. On the other hand, depletion of microbiota altered the phenotype, but did not normalize PCs. Our results suggest that IL-10 could be necessary for the integrity of PCs. Moreover, our results help to explain why IL-10-/- mice develop enterocolitis in response to microorganisms."

The aim of this study was to investigate and relate the cyto- and genotoxic effects of different types of particles (PP, passenger tire particles vs. TP, truck tire particles) in vitro using the phagocytic cell line RAW 264.7 (mouse leukaemic monocyte macrophage cell line). The viability of RAW 264.7 cells was determined by the 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -5- (3-carboxymethoxyphenyl) -2- (4-sulfophenyl) -2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay following exposure for 4, 24 and 48 hours to different particle concentrations (10 μg / ml, 25 μg / ml, 50 μg / ml, 100 μg / ml). The effects of particles of passenger and truck tires on cell proliferation and genotoxicity were evaluated by means of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay following exposure for 24 hours to different particle concentrations (10 μg / ml, 25 μg / ml, 50 μg / ml, 100 μg / ml). In MTS assay, after 24 hours, it was found that PP induced a 30% decrease in metabolic activity at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, while TP caused reductions of 20% and 10% at concentrations of 10 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively. At 48 hours after the treatments, we observed increased metabolic activity at 50 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml for the PP while only at 50 μg/ml for the TP. The CBMN assay showed a significant increase in the number of micronuclei in the cells incubated with PP in all experimental conditions, while the cells treated with TP showed a meaningful increase only at 10 μg /ml. We utilized the TNF-α ELISA mouse test to detect the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in RAW 264.7 cells. The effect of passenger and truck particles on TNF-α release was evaluated following exposure for 4 and 24 hours. After 4 hours of incubation, the cells treated with PP and TP at 100 μg / ml showed a slight but significant increase in TNF-α release, while there was a significant increase in the release of TNF-α after 24 hours of incubation with both tire samples in the cells treated with 50 and 100 μg / ml PP. The data obtained show a higher cytotoxic, clastogenic/genotoxic and inflammatory effects of passenger compared to the truck tire particles."

MHealth provides a potentially highly effective modality for global public health, however access is poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess equity in access to mHealth in an NCD intervention in Kenya.This is a secondary analysis of a complex NCD intervention targeting slum residents in Kenya. The primary outcomes were: willingness to receive SMS, whether SMS was received, and access to SMS compared to alternative health information modalities. Age, sex, level of education, level of income, type of work, number of hours worked, and home environment were explanatory variables considered. Multivariable regression analyses were used to test for association using likelihood ratio testing.7,618 individual participants were included in the analysis. The median age was 44 years old. Majority (75%, n = 3,691/ 4,927) had only attended up to primary (elementary) school. Majority reported earning ""KShs 7,500 or greater"" (27%, n = 1,276/ 4,736). Age and level of income had evidence of association with willingness to receive SMS, and age, sex and number of hours work with whether SMS was received. SMS was the health information modality with highest odds of being accessed in older age groups (OR 4.70, 8.72 and 28.89, for age brackets 60-69, 70-79 and 80 years or older, respectively), among women (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.19-2.89), and second only to Baraazas (community gatherings) among those with lowest income.Women had the greatest likelihood of receiving SMS. SMS performed equitably well amongst marginalized populations (elderly, women, and low-income) as compared to alternative health information modalities, though sensitization prior to implementation of mHealth interventions may be needed. These findings provide guidance for developing mHealth interventions targeting marginalized populations in these settings."
https://openalex.org/W2973104636,"Red foxes have a highly flexible social system. Despite numerous studies worldwide, our understanding of the pattern and stability of fox social relationships remains limited. We applied social network analysis to camera trap data collected at high-quality foraging patches to examine the social structure of a population of urban red foxes. Foxes encountered a conspecific on 13% of patch visits, and had significant preferred and avoided companionships in all seasons. They also associated in communities that matched territorial space use, confirming that territories can be analysed separately to increase power without excluding too many social partners. Foxes maintained stable, long-term relationships with other territory residents, but the average longevity of relationships varied seasonally, suggesting that social connectivity, particularly between foxes from different social groups, is influenced by their annual life cycle. The probability of re-association after a given time lag was highest in spring and summer, during cub birth and rearing, and lowest in the winter mating season, when mean relationship duration was shorter. 33% of fox relationships lasted for four consecutive seasons and were probably between territory residents. 14% lasted for around 20 days and were probably between residents and visitors from adjacent territories. The majority (53%) lasted less than one day, particularly during dispersal and mating, and were probably between foxes from non-adjacent social groups. Social structure varied between groups; in one group the death of the dominant male caused significant social disruption for two seasons. This is the first application of social network analysis to multiple red fox social groups. However, our analyses were based on interactions at high quality food patches; social connections may differ when foxes are resting, travelling and foraging elsewhere in their territory. Our results will inform management practices, particularly for disease spread and population control."

While there are many such filter methods, there is a need for an objective evaluation of these methods. Such an evaluation is needed to compare them with each other and also to answer whether they are at all useful, or a learning algorithm could do a better job without them. For this purpose, many popular screening methods are partnered in this paper with three regression learners and five classification learners and evaluated on ten real datasets to obtain accuracy criteria such as R-square and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The obtained results are compared through curve plots and comparison tables in order to find out whether screening methods help improve the performance of learning algorithms and how they fare with each other. Our findings revealed that the screening methods were useful in improving the prediction of the best learner on two regression and two classification datasets out of the ten datasets evaluated."

To explore this aspect of social cognition in this population is particularly meaningful, as it may have an influence in their social and interpersonal functioning. The aim of this research was to study interpersonal accuracy (IPA) in remitted BDs, that is, the specific skills that fall under the general term Theory of Mind (ToM). Study participants included 119 remitted individuals with BD (70 BD I and 49 BD II), and they were compared with a group of 39 persons diagnosed with unipolar depression (UD) and 119 control participants. The MiniPONS was used to test the whole spectrum of nonverbal cues as facial expressions, body language and voice. Results indicated a superiority of the control group with statistically significant differences both in the performance in the MiniPONS (number of right answers) and in each of the areas evaluated by this test. BD groups, in recognition of the meaning of gestures in face, body and voice intonation, performed significantly worse than controls. ANCOVA analysis controlling the effect of age shows that control group performed significantly better compared to clinical groups, and there were no differences between UD and BD groups. The results indicate a deficit in IPA and suggest that better comprehension of deficiencies in interpersonal accuracy in BD may help to develop new training programs to improve in these patients the understanding of others, which might have a positive impact in their psychosocial functionality, and thus lead to the objective of functional rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2972846096,"Trichophyton rubrum is a human pathogenic fungus. As a dermatophyte it causes athlete's foot, fungal infection of nails, jock itch and ringworm. The pigmentation of T. rubrum is variable and can range from white or yellow to wine-red. We demonstrate that the pigmentation is strongly influenced by pH. Under alkaline conditions, T. rubrum has a red pigmentation, whereas at acid conditions, T. rubrum has a yellow pigmentation. Moreover, the color change immediately from yellow to red by adding NaOH and reverse immediately from red to yellow by adding HCl. We suggest that the chemical compound Xanthomegnin is responsible for red as well for yellow pigmentation in T. rubrum. To figure out, why T. rubrum has red pigmentation on Trichophyton medium, adjust to alkaline, but not on Synthetic-Complete medium, also adjusted to alkaline, we measure the pH of liquid media, adjusted to pH 3.5, 6 and 8, over a period of four weeks. The pH of both cultivation media changes significantly, with a maximum of five pH levels. Whereas the Trichophyton medium, initially adjusted to pH 8, stays alkaline, the pH of the Synthetic-Complete medium drops to acid conditions. The acidification of the SC medium and the alkalization of the Trichophyton medium explains the different pigment color of the T. rubrum colonies."

Unfortunately, in most cases the technology to be transferred to learning students is complex and requires multi-step approaches. In this respect, simple and straightforward experimental protocols might be of great interest. This study was aimed at presenting a laboratory exercise focusing (a) on a very challenging therapeutic strategy, i.e. microRNA therapeutics, and (b) on the employment of biomolecules of great interest in applied biology and pharmacology, i.e. peptide nucleic acids (PNAs). The aims of the practical laboratory were to determine: (a) the possible PNA-mediated arrest in RT-qPCR, to be eventually used to demonstrate PNA targeting of selected miRNAs; (b) the possible lack of activity on mutated PNA sequences; (c) the effects (if any) on the amplification of other unrelated miRNA sequences. The results which can be obtained support the following conclusions: PNA-mediated arrest in RT-qPCR can be analyzed in a easy way; mutated PNA sequences are completely inactive; the effects of the employed PNAs are specific and no inhibitory effect occurs on other unrelated miRNA sequences. This activity is simple (cell culture, RNA extraction, RT-qPCR are all well-established technologies), fast (starting from isolated and characterized RNA, few hours are just necessary), highly reproducible (therefore easily employed by even untrained students). On the other hand, these laboratory lessons require some facilities, the most critical being the availability of instruments for PCR. While this might be a problem in the case these instruments are not available, we would like to underline that determination of the presence or of a lack of amplified product can be also obtained using standard analytical approaches based on agarose gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W2972986440,"Allatoregulatory neuropeptides are multifunctional proteins that take part in the synthesis and secretion of juvenile hormones. In insects, allatostatins are inhibitors of juvenile hormone biosynthesis in the corpora allata while allatotropins, act as stimulators. By quantitative real-time PCR, we analyzed the gene expression of allatostatin A (PtASTA), allatostatin B (PtASTB), allatostatin C (PtASTC), allatotropin (PtAT) and their receptors (PtASTA-R, PtASTB-R, PtASTC-R, PtAT-R) in various tissues in different age groups of female spiders. In the presented manuscript, the presence of allatostatin A, allatostatin C, and allatotropin are reported in females of the spider P. tepidariorum. The obtained results indicated substantial differences in gene expression levels for allatoregulatory neuropeptides and their receptors in the different tissues. Additionally, the gene expression levels also varied depending on the female age. Strong expression was observed coinciding with sexual maturation in the neuroendocrine and nervous system, and to a lower extent in the digestive tissues and ovaries. Reverse trends were observed for the expression of genes encoding the receptors of these neuropeptides. In conclusion, our study is the first hint that the site of synthesis and secretion is fulfilled by similar structures as observed in other arthropods. In addition, the results of the analysis of spider physiology give evidence that the general functions like regulation of the juvenile hormone synthesis, regulation of the digestive tract and ovaries action, control of vitellogenesis process by the neuropeptides seem to be conserved among arthropods and are the milestone to future functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2973046662,"Social stress and inflammatory processes are strong regulators of one another. Considerable evidence shows that social threats trigger inflammatory responses that increase infection susceptibility in both humans and animals, while infectious disease triggers inflammation that in turn regulates social behaviours. However, no previous study has examined whether young children's popularity and their rate of infectious disease are associated. We investigated the longitudinal bidirectional links between children's popularity status as perceived by peers, and parent reports of a variety of infectious diseases that are common in early childhood (i.e. common cold as well as eye, ear, throat, lung and gastric infections). We used data from the 'Matter of the First Friendship Study' (MOFF), a longitudinal prospective multi-informant study, following 579 Norwegian pre-schoolers (292 girls, median age at baseline = six years) with annual assessments over a period of three years. Social network analysis was used to estimate each child's level of popularity. Cross-lagged autoregressive analyses revealed negative dose-response relations between children's popularity scores and subsequent infection (b = -0.18, CI = -0.29, -0.06, and b = -0.13, CI = -0.23, -0.03). In conclusion, the results suggest that children who are unpopular in early childhood are at increased risk of contracting infection the following year."
https://openalex.org/W2973085137,"ASB20123, a C-type natriuretic peptide/ghrelin chimeric peptide, was designed as a novel peptide and demonstrated full agonistic activity for natriuretic-peptide receptor B and a significantly longer half-life in plasma compared with the native peptide. We researched the toxicological profile of ASB20123, the correlation between the morphological change of the epiphyseal plate and bone and cartilage toxicity, and biomarkers to detect the toxicity. ASB20123 was systemically administered to male and female rats at daily dose levels of 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. In this study, toxicity was observed as changes related to bone and cartilage tissues, and no other toxicological changes were observed in all animals. Next, ASB20123 was administered to 12-month-old rats with a little epiphyseal plate. The toxic changes related to bone and cartilage tissues were not observed in any animal with a closed epiphyseal plate, indicating that the toxic changes were triggered by the growth-accelerating effect on the bone and cartilage. Furthermore, we searched for the biomarker related to the bone and cartilage toxicity using rats treated with ASB20123 at doses of 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, and 5.0 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. A close correlation between necrosis/fibrosis in the epiphysis and metaphysis and thickness of the epiphyseal plate in the femur was confirmed in this study. A decrease in the bone mineral density (BMD) of the femur also was associated with the appearance of bone toxicity. These results indicated that the toxicity of ASB20123 was limited to bone- and cartilage-specific changes, and these changes were triggered by an excessive growth accelerating effect. Furthermore, our data suggested that the thickness of the epiphyseal plate and BMD could be reliable biomarkers to predict bone toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2973163637,"In urban ecosystems, woody vegetation communities and the ecosystem functions and habitat they provide are largely controlled by humans. These communities are assembled during development, landscaping, and maintenance processes according to decisions made by human actors. While vegetation communities on residential land uses are increasingly well studied, these efforts generally have not extended to other land uses, including commercial property. To fill this gap, I surveyed tree and shrub communities on office developments located in Redmond and Bellevue, Washington, USA, and explored whether aggregated neighborhood and parcel scale socio-economic variables or variables describing the outcome of development and landscaping actions better explained variation in vegetation communities. I found that both tree and shrub communities on office developments are heterogenous, with sites characterized by native or ornamental vegetation. The heterogeneity I observed in vegetation communities within one land use suggests that different ecosystem functions, habitat quality, and habitat quantities are provided on office developments. Greater provision of e.g. native conifer habitat is possible using currently existing developments as models. Additionally, the outcome of development and landscaping decisions explained more variation in community composition than the socio-economic factors found significant on residential property. Together with previous research showing that residential property owner attitudes and actions are more important than socio-economic descriptors, my results suggest that individual motivators, including intended audience, may be the primary determinant of urban vegetation communities. Future urban ecology research should consider sampling the vegetation gradient within land uses, better understanding individual motivation for vegetation management, and creating models of the urban ecosystems that account for alternate decision pathways on different land uses."
https://openalex.org/W2972497157,"Familiar face processing involves face specific regions (the core face system) as well as other non-specific areas related to processing of person-related information (the extended face system). The connections between core and extended face system areas must be critical for face recognition. Some studies have explored the connectivity pattern of unfamiliar face responding area, but none have explored those areas related to face familiarity processing in the extended system. To study these connections, diffusion weighted imaging with probabilistic tractography was used to estimate the white-matter pathways between core and extended system regions, which were defined from functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to personally-familiar faces. Strong white matter connections were found between occipitotemporal face areas (OFA/FFA) with superior temporal sulcus and insula suggesting the possible existence of direct anatomical connections from face-specific areas to frontal nodes that could underlay the processing of emotional information associated to familiar faces."
https://openalex.org/W2972556118,"High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) are a distinctive class of communication satellites that provide significantly more throughput per allocated bandwidth than traditional wide-beam communication satellites. They are the proverbial wave of creative disruption in the space industry and are poised to disrupt the communication market in significant ways. The objective of this work is to develop a decision-analytic framework for assessing the value of High-Throughput Satellites and to provide meaningful results of the value of such systems under realistic design, operational, and market conditions. We develop the cost and revenue models of HTS. To build the revenue model, we develop a hybrid data-driven and scenario-based load factor model that combines historical data based on financial records from current HTS operators with extrapolations based on best-, nominal-, and worst-case scenarios. We then integrate the cost and revenue models within a stochastic simulation environment and perform Monte-Carlo analysis of the net present value (NPV) of HTS. One important result is that a medium-sized HTS significantly outperforms a roughly equivalent traditional wide-beam satellite, even under the worst-case loading scenario. Another important result, here identified and quantified, is the tradeoff between the average revenue per user (ARPU) and average loading of the satellite and how it is mediated by the downlink speed provided to consumers. This result can be used in different ways, for example, by helping define the boundaries of what is competitively achievable in terms of ARPU and downlink speed offerings. The implications of these results are that they delineate the pathways to financial failure and the boundaries beyond which an HTS will be value-negative, or alternatively, the asymptotic minimum values for an HTS to be value-positive."
https://openalex.org/W2972582266,"Aerial surveys are often used to monitor wildlife and fish populations, but rarely are the effects on animal behavior documented. For over 30 years, the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge has conducted low-altitude aerial surveys to assess Kodiak brown bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi) space use and demographic composition when bears are seasonally congregated near salmon spawning streams in southwestern Kodiak Island, Alaska. Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are an important bear food and salmon runs are brief, so decreases in time spent fishing for salmon may reduce salmon consumption by bears. The goal of this study was to apply different and complementary field methods to evaluate the response of bears to these aerial surveys. Ground-based counts at one stream indicated 62% of bears departed the 200m-wide survey zone in response to aerial surveys, but bear counts returned to pre-survey abundance after only three hours. Although this effect was brief, survey flights occurred during the hours of peak daily bear activity (morning and evening), so the three-hour disruption appeared to result in a 25% decline in cumulative daily detections by 38 time-lapse cameras deployed along 10 salmon streams. Bear responses varied by sex—male bears were much more likely than female bears (with or without cubs) to depart streams and female bears with GPS collars did not move from streams following surveys. Although bears displaced by aerial surveys may consume fewer salmon, the actual effect on their fitness depends on whether they compensate by foraging at other times or by switching to other nutritious resources. Data from complementary sources allows managers to more robustly understand the impacts of surveys and whether their benefits are justified. Similar assessments should be made on alternative techniques such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and non-invasive sampling to determine whether they supply equivalent data while limiting bear disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2972452007,"Background While drink driving continues to be significantly more common among male drivers, there is evidence from many countries that shows a growing trend of women engaging in this risky behaviour. The aims of the current study were threefold: (i) determine to what extent a sample of women drivers reported engaging in drink driving behaviour by expanding the construct into a range of definitions, (ii) determine if there were significant differences in self-reported engagement in drink driving behaviours in accordance with hazardous drinking behaviour, and (iii) identify which situational or personal factors would increase women drivers’ likelihood to engage in drink driving through presenting a range of scenarios. Method Data were collected using an on-line, purpose-designed survey and promoted to reach women aged 17 years and older, living in Queensland, Australia. In addition to questions relating to demographic characteristics, participants completed items relating to engagement in seven drink driving related behaviours in the previous 12-month period, hazardous drinking as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and likelihood of driving when unsure if over the legal limit for licence type across a range of scenarios manipulating different situational factors. A total of 644 valid responses were received in the two-week period the study was advertised. Results The results demonstrate women’s self-reported engagement in drink driving behaviour ranged from 12.6% (driving when they believed they were over the legal limit) to over 50.0% (driving when unsure if over the legal limit the morning after drinking alcohol) and was significantly more likely among those who reported hazardous levels of alcohol use. Circumstances in which women reported they would drive when unsure if over the legal BAC limit were when they were a few blocks from home, if they subjectively felt they were not too intoxicated, or if they needed their car to get somewhere the next morning. Conclusion Examining drink driving behaviour by way of responses to nuanced definitions provided valuable insight into self-reported engagement in the behaviour and highlights the usefulness of multi-measure dependent variables in order to illuminate a more accurate acknowledgement into both the type (and extent) of drink driving behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2972458539,"Land cover change is a key component of anthropogenic global environmental change, contributing to changes in environmental conditions of habitats. Deforestation is globally the most widespread and anthropogenically driven land cover change leading to conversion from closed forest to open non-forest habitat. This study investigates the relative roles of geographic features, characteristics of species climatic niche and species traits in determining the ability of open-habitat plant species to take advantage of recently opened habitats. We use current occurrence records of 18 herbaceous, predominantly open-habitat species of the genus Acaena (Rosaceae) to determine their prevalence in recently opened habitat. We tested correlation of species prevalence in anthropogenically opened habitat with (i) geographic features of the spatial distribution of open habitat, (ii) characteristics of species climatic niche, and (iii) species traits related to dispersal. While primary open habitat (naturally open) was characterised by cold climates, secondary open habitat (naturally closed but anthropogenically opened) is characterised by warmer and wetter conditions. We found high levels of variation in the species prevalence in secondary open habitat indicating species differences in their ability to colonise newly opened habitat. For the species investigated, geographical features of habitat and climatic niche factors showed generally stronger relationships with species prevalence in secondary open habitat than functional traits. Therefore, for small herbaceous species, geographical features of habitat and environmental factors appear to be more important than species functional traits for facilitating expansion into secondary open habitats. Our results suggested that the land cover change might have triggered the shifts of factors controlling open-habitat plant distributions from the competition with forest trees to current environmental constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2973044348,"Introduction According to the International Labor Organization, Maternity Protection (MP) policies try to harmonize child care and women's paid work, without affecting family health and economic security. Chile Law 20.545 (2011) increased benefits for economically active women and reduced requirements for accessing these benefits. The goals of the reform included: 1) to increase MP coverage; and 2) to reduce inequities in access to the benefits. Method This study uses two data sources. First, using individual data routinely collected from 2000 to 2015, yearly MP coverage access over time was calculated. Second, using national representative household surveys collected before and after the Law (2009 and 2013), coverage and a set of measures of inequality were estimated. To compare changes over time, we used non-experimental, before-after intervention design for independent samples. For each variable, we estimated comparative proportions at 95% confidence interval before and after the intervention. Additionally, we included multivariate and propensity score analysis. Results Between 2000 and 2015, MP coverage grew from 24.4% to 44.8%. Using comparable 2009 and 2013 survey data, we observed the same trend, with 31.6% of estimated MP coverage in 2009, escalating to 39.5% in 2013. We conclude that: 1) after the reform, there was an increase in MP coverage; and, 2) there was no significant reduction of inequities in the distribution of MP benefits. Discussion/Conclusion Few scientific evaluations of MP reforms have been conducted worldwide; even fewer including an equity analysis. This study provides an empirically-based evaluation of MP reform from both a population-level and an equity-focused perspective. We conclude that this reform needs to be complemented with other policies to ensure maternity protection in terms of access and equity in a country with deep socioeconomic stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2972718049,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines, organic cations that are implicated in many cellular processes. The enzyme is regulated at the post-translational level by an unusual system that includes antizymes (AZs) and antizyme inhibitors (AZINs). Most studies on this complex regulatory mechanism have been focused on human and rodent cells, showing that AZINs (AZIN1 and AZIN2) are homologues of ODC but devoid of enzymatic activity. Little is known about Xenopus ODC and its paralogues, in spite of the relevance of Xenopus as a model organism for biomedical research. We have used the information existing in different genomic databases to compare the functional properties of the amphibian ODC1, AZIN1 and AZIN2/ODC2, by means of transient transfection experiments of HEK293T cells. Whereas the properties of xlODC1 and xlAZIN1 were similar to those reported for their mammalian orthologues, the former catalyzing the decarboxylation of L-ornithine preferentially to that of L-lysine, xlAZIN2/xlODC2 showed important differences with respect to human and mouse AZIN2. xlAZIN2 did not behave as an antizyme inhibitor, but it rather acts as an authentic decarboxylase forming cadaverine, due to its higher affinity to L-lysine than to L-ornithine as substrate; so, in accordance with this, it should be named as lysine decarboxylase (LDC) or lysine/ornithine decarboxylase (LODC). In addition, AZ1 stimulated the degradation of xlAZIN2 by the proteasome, but the removal of the 21 amino acid C-terminal tail, with a sequence quite different to that of mouse or human ODC, made the protein resistant to degradation. Collectively, our results indicate that in Xenopus there is only one antizyme inhibitor (xlAZIN1) and two decarboxylases, xlODC1 and xlLDC, with clear preferences for L-ornithine and L-lysine, respectively."
