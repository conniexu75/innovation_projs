Over the past few years, numerous tools have become available for this task. The purpose of the current assessment is twofold: to provide some guidance to users regarding the accuracy of currently available tools in various settings, and to provide a benchmark of data sets for assessing future tools."

https://openalex.org/W2170525977,"Dehalococcoides ethenogenes is the only bacterium known to reductively dechlorinate the groundwater pollutants, tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene, to ethene. Its 1,469,720-base pair chromosome contains large dynamic duplicated regions and integrated elements. Genes encoding 17 putative reductive dehalogenases, nearly all of which were adjacent to genes for transcription regulators, and five hydrogenase complexes were identified. These findings, plus a limited repertoire of other metabolic modes, indicate that D. ethenogenes is highly evolved to utilize halogenated organic compounds and H2. Diversification of reductive dehalogenase functions appears to have been mediated by recent genetic exchange and amplification. Genome analysis provides insights into the organism's complex nutrient requirements and suggests that an ancestor was a nitrogen-fixing autotroph."
https://openalex.org/W1963759286,"Most tumor cells are characterized by increased genomic instability and chromosome segregational defects, often associated with hyperamplification of the centrosome and the formation of multipolar spindles. However, extra centrosomes do not always lead to multipolarity. Here, we describe a process of centrosomal clustering that prevented the formation of multipolar spindles in noncancer cells. Noncancer cells needed to overcome this clustering mechanism to allow multipolar spindles to form at a high frequency. The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein was a critical part of this coalescing machinery, and in some tumor cells overexpression of the spindle protein NuMA interfered with dynein localization, promoting multipolarity."
https://openalex.org/W2064692664,"Many herbivores and omnivores adjust their food selection behavior to regulate the intake of multiple nutrients. Carnivores, however, are generally assumed to optimize the rate of prey capture rather than select prey according to nutrient composition. We showed experimentally that invertebrate predators can forage selectively for protein and lipids to redress specific nutritional imbalances. This selection can take place at different stages of prey handling: The predator may select among foods of different nutritional composition, eat more of a prey if it is rich in nutrients that the predator is deficient in, or extract specific nutrients from a single prey item."
https://openalex.org/W2108120392,"Deep hypersaline anoxic basins in the Mediterranean Sea are a legacy of dissolution of ancient subterranean salt deposits from the Miocene period. Our study revealed that these hypersaline basins are not biogeochemical dead ends, but support in situ sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, and heterotrophic activity. A wide diversity of prokaryotes was observed, including a new, abundant, deeply branching order within the Euryarchaeota. Furthermore, we demonstrated the presence of a unique, metabolically active microbial community in the Discovery basin, which is one of the most extreme terrestrial saline environments known, as it is almost saturated with MgCl2 (5 M)."
https://openalex.org/W2008423294,"Recent studies suggest that excitotoxicity may contribute to neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Activated microglia have been observed around degenerative neurons in these diseases, and they are thought to act as effector cells in the degeneration of neural cells in the central nervous system. Neuritic beading, focal bead-like swellings in the dendrites and axons, is a neuropathological sign in epilepsy, trauma, ischemia, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous reports showed that neuritic beading is induced by various stimuli including glutamate or nitric oxide and is a neuronal response to harmful stimuli. However, the precise physiologic significance of neuritic beading is unclear. We provide evidence that neuritic beading induced by activated microglia is a feature of neuronal cell dysfunction toward neuronal death, and the neurotoxicity of activated microglia is mediated through N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Neuritic beading occurred concordant with a rapid drop in intracellular ATP levels and preceded neuronal death. The actual neurite beads consisted of collapsed cytoskeletal proteins and motor proteins arising from impaired neuronal transport secondary to cellular energy loss. The drop in intracellular ATP levels was because of the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV activity downstream of NMDA receptor signaling. Blockage of NMDA receptors nearly completely abrogated mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Thus, neuritic beading induced by activated microglia occurs through NMDA receptor signaling and represents neuronal cell dysfunction preceding neuronal death. Blockage of NMDA receptors may be an effective therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases.

Central nervous system inflammation including microglial activation likely contributes to the neurotoxicity observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis (1Kreutzberg G.W.

Conversely, microglia may have neuroprotective effects mediated by neurotrophin release, glutamate uptake, and ingesting neurotoxic substances (19Zietlow R. Dunnett S.B. Fawcett J.W. Eur. J.

Therefore, the role of microglia in either the pathogenesis of or protection from neurodegenerative diseases is still entirely unresolved. Focal bead-like swelling in dendrites and axons (neuritic beading) is thought to be a neuropathological sign in ischemia (23Hori N. Carpenter D.O. Exp.

Neuritic beading is also induced by various stimuli such as glutamate, nitric oxide (NO), 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; NOS, nitric-oxide synthetase; PI, propidium iodide; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2; NF, neurofilament; p-NF, phosphorylated neurofilament; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; l-NMMA, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine. hypoxia, oxidative stress, glucose starvation, and hypotonic conditions (32Park J.S.

Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 13: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several previous studies reported that neuritic beading was a reversible response to neurotoxic stimuli independent of neuronal death (32Park J.S. Bateman M.C. Goldberg M.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 1996; 3: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36Ikegaya Y. Kim J.A. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4083-4093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, a recent study demonstrated that dendritic beading correlated with disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis rat spinal cord (39Zhu B. Luo L. Moore G.R. Paty D.W. Cynader M.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1639-1650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that beading paralleled neuronal damage. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying neuritic bead formation are completely unknown. Despite being a well documented phenomenon, the pathological and functional significance of neuritic beading are not known. In this study, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the induction of neuritic beading by activated microglia. We show that neuritic beading induced by activated microglia is a feature of neuronal cell dysfunction preceding neuronal death, and this neurotoxicity is mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling following glutamate binding. Blockade of the NMDA receptor may protect against the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Cell Culture—All reagents except those specifically mentioned were obtained from Sigma. The protocols for animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Nagoya University. Microglia were isolated from primary mixed glial cell cultures from newborn C57/BL6 mice on the 14th day with the “shaking off” method as described previously (40Suzumura A. Mezitis S.G. Gonatas N.K. Silberberg D.H. J. Neuroimmunol. 1987; 15: 263-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The purity of the cultures was 97 to 100% as determined by Fc receptor-specific immunostaining as described previously (40Suzumura A. Mezitis S.G. Gonatas N.K. Silberberg D.H. J. Neuroimmunol. 1987; 15: 263-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 0.2% glucose. Neuron cultures were prepared from C57BL/6 mice at embryonic day 17 using the Nerve-Cell Culture System (Sumitomo Bakelite, Akita, Japan) as described previously (41Ohno K. Tsutsumi R. Matsumoto N. Yamashita H. Amada Y. Shishikura J. Inami H. Yatsugi S. Okada M. Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Mizuno T. Kurotani T. Komatsu Y. Kawanokuchi J. Kato H. Mitsuma N. Suzumura A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 43Banno M. Mizuno T. Kato H. Zhang G. Kawanokuchi J. Wang J. Kuno R. Jin S. Takeuchi H. Suzumura A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 48: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were dissected and freed of meninges. Cortical fragments were dissociated into single cells using dissociation solution, and they were resuspended in Nerve-Cell Culture Medium (serum-free conditioned medium from 48-h rat astrocyte confluent cultures based on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium/F-12 with N2 supplement, Sumitomo Bakelite). Primary neuronal cells were plated on 12-mm polyethyleneimine-coated coverslips (Asahi Techno Glass Corp., Chiba, Japan) in 24-well multidishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. The purity of the cultures was more than 95% as determined by NeuN-specific immunostaining as described previously (42Mizuno T. Kurotani T. Komatsu Y. Kawanokuchi J. Kato H. Mitsuma N. Suzumura A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 43Banno M. Mizuno T. Kato H. Zhang G. Kawanokuchi J. Wang J. Kuno R. Jin S. Takeuchi H. Suzumura A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 48: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To activate microglia, 5 × 104 microglia were plated on 24-well multidishes with Nerve-Cell Culture Medium (Sumitomo Bakelite) containing 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide and 100 ng/ml interferon-γ (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The pan-nitric-oxide synthetase (NOS) inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) at a final concentration of 1 mm was added when the inhibition of microglial inducible NOS was needed. After a 16-h incubation, activated microglia-conditioned medium was applied to each well containing 5 × 104 neurons at 10–13 days in vitro. Assessments were performed at each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) after medium exchange. Neurons were preincubated with the indicated drug for 1 h. Neurons were then incubated with activated microglia-conditioned medium containing each drug. The final concentrations of each drug were as follows: pan-NOS inhibitor, 1 mm l-NMMA; NO and ONOO- scavenger, 50 μm 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA); ONOO- scavenger, 10 μm 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methy-4′-pyridyl)porphinato iron(III) (Calbiochem); NMDA receptor antagonist, 10 μm MK801 (Calbiochem); non-NMDA receptor antagonist, 20 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; neutralizing antibody for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 0.1 mg/ml anti-mouse TNF-α antibody (R&D Systems); pan-caspase inhibitor, 20 mm z-VAD-fmk (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan); Ca2+ chelator, 1 mm EDTA; tubulin polymerization stabilizer, 10 μm Taxol; actin polymerization stabilizer, 10 μm phalloidin. To examine NMDA neurotoxicity, 100 μm NMDA was added to neurons. Assessment of Neuritic Beading—To assess neuritic beading, neurons were observed under a phase-contrast microscope at each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) by a modification of the method previously reported by Park et al. (32Park J.S. Bateman M.C. Goldberg M.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 1996; 3: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). More than 200 neurons in duplicate wells were assessed blindly in three independent trials. The ratio of bead-bearing neurons was calculated as a percentage of total cells. Assessment of Cell Death—Cell death was assessed by the dye-exclusion method with propidium iodide (PI; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (44Takeuchi H. Kobayashi Y. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50966-50972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). At each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) after stimulation, cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml PI-containing medium for 15 min at 37 °C. More than 200 neurons in duplicate wells were assessed blindly in three independent trials under a conventional fluorescent microscope. The ratio of dead cells was calculated as a percentage of PI-positive cells among total cells. To detect apoptosis, we used the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling (TUNEL) assay with the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) as described previously (44Takeuchi H. Kobayashi Y. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50966-50972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TUNEL assay was carried out at each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) according to the manufacturer's protocol. As a positive control, neurons were incubated with 10 nm staurosporin for 24 h. More than 200 neurons in duplicate wells were assessed blindly in three independent trials under a conventional fluorescent microscope. The ratio of apoptotic cells was calculated as a percentage of TUNEL-positive cells among total cells. Assessment of Intracellular ATP Levels—To measure intracellular ATP levels, we used a luminometric assay with ApoSENSOR Cell Viability Assay Kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Assays were carried out at each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) in six independent trials. ATP concentration at each time point was calculated as a percentage of control. Assessment of Mitochondrial Respiration Inhibition—To analyze mitochondrial respiration inhibition, we carried out a mitochondrial respiration recovery assay by modifying the method previously reported by Rego et al. (45Rego A.C. Santos M.S. Oliveira C.R. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 36: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). If complex I is inhibited, mitochondrial respiration recovers following the addition of succinate as a substrate for complex II/III. If complex II/III are inhibited, mitochondrial respiration recovers after the addition of ascorbic acid and TMPD as substrates for complex IV. If complex IV is inhibited, mitochondrial respiration does not recover following the addition of these drugs. Neurons were preincubated for 1 h with each drug, and neurons were then incubated with activated microglia-conditioned medium containing drug. The final concentration of each drug was as follows: 5 mm succinate, 5 mm ascorbic acid, and 0.25 mm TMPD. 10 μm Rotenone was added to inhibit complex I activity. 0.25 μg/ml Antimycin A was added to inhibit complex II/III activity. 0.5 mm NaN3 was added to inhibit complex IV activity. Recovery of mitochondrial respiration was detected by measuring the intracellular ATP levels. Assays were carried out after a 3-h incubation in six independent trials. Each ATP concentration was calculated as a percentage of control. Assessment of Mitochondrial Impairment—To assess mitochondrial membrane potential, we used MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes), a dye whose staining intensity is directly proportional to mitochondrial membrane potential at concentrations lower than 50 nm. At each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h), cells were incubated with 20 nm MitoTracker-containing medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described below under “Immunocytochemistry.” Fluorescent signal intensity was quantified with a confocal laser scanning microscopic system (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). More than 100 cells in duplicate wells were assessed blindly in three independent trials. Relative signal intensity at each time point was expressed as a percentage of control. To assess mitochondrial viability, we used the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay with CellTiter 96 Aqueous One solution assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (44Takeuchi H. Kobayashi Y. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50966-50972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a multiple plate reader. Assays were carried out at each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) in six independent trials. Assessment of NO Generation—To measure NO production, we performed the Griess reaction on the media at each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) as described previously (16Kawanokuchi J. Mizuno T. Kato H. Mitsuma N. Suzumura A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 540 nm was measured in a multiple plate reader. Assays were carried out in six independent trials. Assessment of Glutamate Release—To measure extracellular glutamate concentrations, we used the Glutamate Assay Kit colorimetric assay (Yamasa Corp., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol at each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h). Absorbance at 600 nm was measured in a multiple plate reader. Assays were carried out in six independent trials. Immunocytochemistry—At each time point (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h), neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-neuron specific tubulin βIII isoform (βIII-tubulin) antibody (1:2,000, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) antibody (1: 500, Chemicon International), mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated neurofilament (p-NF) antibody (SMI31, 1:5,000, Sternberger Monoclonus Inc., Lutherville, MD), rabbit polyclonal anti-manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) antibody (1:2,000, Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC, Canada), mouse monoclonal anti-kinesin antibody (1: 1,000, Chemicon International), and mouse monoclonal anti-cytoplasmic dynein antibody (1:100, Chemicon International). They were subsequently stained with secondary antibody-conjugated Alexa-488, -568, or -647 (1:1,000, Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 90 min. Cells were then counterstained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 10 min, and mounted in antifade reagent. Cells were analyzed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). Analysis of Axonal Transport—Axonal transport was analyzed under a time-lapse phase-contrast microscopic system (Axiovert 200M/Cell Observer System, Carl Zeiss). The number of particles (diameter ≥50 nm) moving antegrade and retrograde in axons were counted for each hour (0∼6 h) as described previously (46Hiruma H. Katakura T. Takahashi S. Ichikawa T.

Activated Microglia Induce Neuritic Beading and Subsequent Neuronal Cell Death—Activated microglia conditioned medium rapidly induced numerous beads in most neurites (Figs. 1B and 2A). Beaded neurites were narrow and pale compared with control cells, reflecting neurite damage (Fig. 1B). Activated microglia-conditioned medium also induced neuronal cell death at a later phase (Fig. 2B), but very little apoptotic cell death was detected by TUNEL assay (Fig. 2B). Thus, activated microglia appear to induce necrotic cell death in neurons; this is consistent with previous reports (47Bal-Price A. Brown G.C. J.

During this early period, neurons were likely running an energy deficit to maintain homeostasis. Neuritic beading could be an early feature of neuronal cell dysfunction resulting from energy loss induced by activated microglia. Activated Microglia Inhibit Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Complex IV Activity in Neurons—We carried out mitochondrial respiration recovery assays to determine the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex in neurons that are inhibited by activated microglia (Fig. 2F). Rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, reduced intracellular ATP levels by ∼80% that seen in controls, and this reduction was abrogated by the addition of succinate, a substrate of complex II/III. Antimycin A, a complex II/III inhibitor, reduced intracellular ATP levels by ∼85% compared with controls, and ascorbic acid and TMPD, complex IV substrates, reversed these effects. NaN3, a specific complex IV inhibitor, led to a reduction in intracellular ATP levels of ∼90% compared with controls, and no substrates were able to restore normal ATP levels. As seen with NaN3, no substrates were able to restore intracellular ATP levels or mitochondrial respiration of neurons treated with activated microglia (Fig. 2F, black columns). Thus, activated microglia inhibit neuronal mitochondrial respiration primarily through inhibiting complex IV activity. We also confirmed that NMDA inhibited complex IV activity (Fig. 2F, dotted columns). Neuritic Beads Colocalized with Collapsing Cytoskeletal Proteins—Time course immunocytochemical analysis revealed that neuritic bead formation was accompanied by the gradual collapse of the neuronal network (Fig. 3). Neuritic beads colocalized with tubulin (Fig. 3, A–F and Y), p-NF (Fig. 3, G–L and Y), and MAP2 (Fig. 3, M–R and Y). It was unclear whether neuritic beads colocalized with actin (data not shown). The fluorescent signal arising from these cytoskeletal proteins gradually weakened as the neuronal network was collapsing. Neuritic bead formation is associated with the collapse of cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin, NF, and MAPs. Activated Microglia Affect the Morphology and Distribution of Neuronal Mitochondria—Time course immunocytochemical analysis also revealed that activated microglia-conditioned medium changed the morphology and distribution of mitochondria in"
https://openalex.org/W2056949060,"Fuzeon (also known as T-20 or enfuvirtide), one of the C-peptides derived from the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) region, is the first member of a new class of anti-HIV drugs known as HIV fusion inhibitors. It has been widely believed that T-20 shares the same mechanism of action with C34, another C-peptide. The C34 is known to compete with the CHR of gp41 to form a stable 6-helix bundle (6-HB) with the gp41 N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and prevent the formation of the fusogenic gp41 core between viral gp41 NHR and CHR, thereby inhibiting fusion between viral and target cell membranes. Here we present data to demonstrate that, contrary to this belief, T-20 cannot form stable 6-HB with N-peptides derived from the NHR region, nor can it inhibit the 6-HB formation of the fusogenic core. Instead, it may interact with N-peptides to form unstable or insoluble complexes. Our data suggest that T-20 has a different mechanism of action from C34. The interaction of T-20 with viral NHR region alone may not prevent the formation of the fusion active gp41 core. We also demonstrate that the T-20-mediated anti-HIV activity can be significantly abrogated by peptides derived from the membrane-spanning domain in gp41 and coreceptor binding site in gp120. These new findings imply that T-20 inhibits HIV-1 entry by targeting multiple sites in gp41 and gp120. Further elucidation of the mechanism of action of T-20 will provide new target(s) for development of novel HIV entry inhibitors.

Its surface subunit gp120 is responsible for virus binding to receptor and coreceptors (1Sattentau Q.J. Dalgleish A.G. Weiss R.A. Beverley P.C.

Sattentau Q.J. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 233-289Google Scholar, 6Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Like other type I transmembrane proteins, gp41 consists of cytoplasm (CP), transmembrane (TM), and extracellular domains. The extracellular domain (ectodomain) contains four major functional regions: fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR or HR1), C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR or HR2), and a tryptophan-rich (TR) region. Starting form the early 1990s, several peptides derived from the NHR and CHR regions of gp41, designated N- and C-peptides, respectively (Fig. 1A), were discovered to have the viral fusion inhibition activity. The first N-peptide fusion inhibitor, T-21, was identified by Wild et al. (7Wild C. Oas T. McDanal C. Bolognesi D. Matthews T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10537-10541Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), which blocked HIV-1 fusion at micromolar concentrations. The first C-peptide fusion inhibitor, SJ-2176, was discovered by our group, which inhibited HIV-1 replication at nanomolar levels (8Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 9Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Later, another C-peptide fusion inhibitor, T-20, was identified (10Wild C. Greenwell T. Matthews T. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 11Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) which overlaps SJ-2176 sequence and also has potent anti-HIV activity. Using proteolytic dissection strategies, Lu et al. (12Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 13Lu M. Kim P.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) isolated several pairs of protease-resistant N- and C-peptides from gp41 including N36 and C34, which was later found to form the stable fusogenic core. The peptide C34 is more potent in inhibiting HIV-1 fusion than both SJ-2176 and T-20. Interestingly, C34 overlaps the entire sequence of SJ-2176 with only two additional residues at the N and C termini, respectively. Extensive structural studies on the peptide pair N36 and C34 have revealed the structure of the fusogenic core gp41. The N- and C-peptides, while stay unstructured on their own, have the tendency to form a stable six-stranded α-helix bundle (6-HB) when mixed with a 1:1 molar ratio. The crystal structures of the 6-HB, based on the work of three independent groups, show that three helices from the N-peptides (the N-helices) associate to form the central trimeric coiled-coil and three helices from C-peptide region (the C-helices) pack obliquely in an anti-parallel configuration into the highly conserved hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the central coiled-coil (14Chan D.C.

In each of the grooves, there is a highly conserved hydrophobic deep cavity, formed by the cavity-forming sequence (residues 565–581) in the NHR region (Fig. 1), which is critical for viral fusion and stability of the 6-HB (17Chan D.C.

Virol. 1998; 72: 10213-10217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jiang S. Lin K. Zhang L. Debnath A.K. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the 6-HB the residues at the “e” and “g” positions in the α-helical wheels of the N-helices can interact with those at the “a” and “d” positions in the C-helices during the process of 6-HB formation (5Moore J.P. Jameson B.A. Weiss R.A. Sattentau Q.J. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 233-289Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). Based on the structure of the 6-HB, a model was proposed to elucidate the mechanism of gp41-mediated membrane fusion and the anti-HIV-1 activity of the C-peptides (6Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). After gp120 binds to CD4 and a coreceptor (e.g. CCR5 or CXCR4), gp41 changes its conformation to a prefusion (intermediate) state by inserting its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane. Then the gp41 N- and C-helices associate to form the 6-HB bringing the viral and target cell membranes into close proximity and result in the fusion of HIV-1 with the target cell. It was, then, proposed that C-peptide (e.g. C34) may form a heterogeneous 6-HB with the NHR region of gp41, thus, block the formation of fusion-active core of gp41 and inhibit the fusion between the viral and target cell membranes. The understanding of the action of the fusion inhibitor has opened a new avenue to identify antiviral peptides against other viruses with type I transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, such as simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) (22Blacklow S.C.

Because the major sequence of T-20 is derived from the CHR region and partially overlaps C34 sequence (Fig. 1, A and C), it has been proposed that T-20 acts in the same way as C34 to inhibit viral fusion by blocking the formation of the fusogenic core of gp41 (6Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 33Kilby J.M. Eron J.J. N. Engl. J.

Although partially overlapping with the C34 peptide, T-20 does not contain the cavity binding sequence (residues 628–635) (Fig. 1C), which is important for gp41-mediated membrane fusion and the stability of the gp41 core conformation (17Chan D.C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4945-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). There has been no report on the direct interaction of T-20 with the NHR sequence to form 6-HB. T-20-induced resistant mutations in patients who used T-20 are located not only in gp41, but also in gp120. HIV-1 isolates resistant to T-20 are sensitive to C34-containing peptides, such as T-649 (36Rimsky L.T. Shugars D.C. Matthews T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 986-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the viral sensitivity to T-20 is modulated by coreceptor specificity defined by the V3 loop of gp120 (37Xu Y. Zhang X. Matsuoka M. Hattori T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the mechanism of action of T-20 may be different from that of C34. Here we present data to show that T-20, unlike C34, does not form the stable 6-HB with the N-peptides containing the entire cavity-forming sequence. Instead, it may associate with N-peptides to form unstable or insoluble complexes. In addition, T-20-mediated anti-HIV activity could be abrogated by peptides derived from the membrane-spanning domain in gp41 and the coreceptor binding site in gp120. These suggest that T-20 may target multiple sites in gp41 and gp120, a mechanism of action different from that of C34 and other C-peptides. Further elucidating the mechanism of action of T-20 will provide new target(s) for development of novel HIV entry inhibitors. Peptides—Peptides T-20, C34, T-21, N36, N46, N36-F10, N36-SIM, N36-HA (a hemagglutinin epitope GGGYPYDVPDYAGPG was tagged at the C terminus of N36), T-20-ANAA, T-20-ANAA-octyl, C34-biotin (biotin was conjugated to the N terminus of C34), N36-F, C34-F, and T-20-F (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was added to the N termini of N36, C34 and T-20, respectively) were synthesized by a standard solid-phase FMOC method at the MicroChemistry Laboratory, the New York Blood Center. The peptides were purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified by laser desorption mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). 5-Helix and 5-Helix (D4) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Root (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). HIV-1IIIB chronically infected H9 (H9/HIV-1IIIB) cells, MT-2 cells, and HIV-1 MN Env (15-mer) peptides (a complete set) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, contributed by Drs. Robert Gallo and Douglas Richman, and DAIDS, NIAID, respectively. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (N-PAGE)—N-PAGE was carried out to determine the 6-HB formation between the N- and C-peptides as described previously (38Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, an N-peptide (N36, T-21, or N36-F10) was incubated with a C-peptide (C34, T-20 or T-20 derivatives) (the final concentration of each peptide was 40 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. The sample was mixed with Tris-glycine native sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at a ratio of 1:1 and was then loaded onto a 10 × 1.0-cm precast Tris-glycine gels (18%, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 25 μl/per well. Gel electrophoresis was carried out with 125 V constant voltage at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged with a FluorChem 8800 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Fluorescence Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (FN-PAGE)— FN-PAGE was performed under the same conditions using the same reagents as those for N-PAGE described above except that one of the two peptides was replaced by FITC-conjugated peptide (N36-F, C34-F, or T-20-F) (38Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immediately after electrophoresis, fluorescence bands in the gel were imaged by the FluorChem 8800 Imaging System using a transillumination UV light source with excitation wavelength at 302 nm and a fluorescence filter with emission wavelength at 520 nm. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged again with a FluorChem 8800 Imaging System. Fluorescence-linked Immunosorbent Assay (FLISA)—C34-F was used in FLISA for detection of the 6-HB (39Liu S. Boyer-Chatenet L. Lu H. Jiang S. J. Biomol. Screen. 2003; 8: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mixture of an N-peptide (N36 or N46) and C34-F at final concentration of 1 μm in Dulbecco's PBS was added to the wells of 96-well polystyrene plates precoated with mAb NC-1 (8 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of a peptide competitor. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the plate was washed extensively, followed by addition of 150 μl of PBS. The fluorescence intensity was measured by the Ultra 384 reader (Tecan U.S., Inc., Durham, NC) using fluorescence filters with excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission wavelength at 535 nm. The percentage of inhibition of the 6-HB formation by a competitive peptide was calculated using the equation: % Inhibition of the fluorescent 6-HB formation = [1 – (E – N)/(P – N)] × 100, where E represents fluorescence intensity in the presence of a competitive peptide (unconjugated C34 or T-20), P represents the fluorescence intensity value in the absence of a competitive peptide, while N is the background corresponding to the fluorescent intensity of the wells where only C34-F, but neither N-peptide nor competitor, was added. IC50 (the concentration for 50% inhibition) values were calculated using the computer program Calcusyn (21Jiang S. Lin K. Zhang L. Debnath A.K. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. T. C. Chou (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Fluorescence Polarization—Binding of C34-F or T-20-F to 5-Helix was determined by a fluorescence polarization assay. In brief, C34-F or T-20-F at 25 nm was added to wells of black 96-well microplates (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY), followed by addition of 5-Helix or its mutant 5-Helix (D4) at varying concentrations ranging from 1.56 nm to 200 nm in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine γ globulin (BGG), which minimizes nonspecific interaction and enhances fluorescent signals. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the fluorescence polarization values, expressed in millipolarization units (mP), were measured in Ultra 384 reader (Tecan U.S., Inc.) using filters with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The mP values were calculated using the equation: mP = 1000 × [(IS – ISB) – (IP – IPB)]/[(IS – ISB) + (IP – IPB)], where IS is the parallel emission intensity measurement and IP is the perpendicular emission intensity sample measurement, whereas ISB and IPB are the corresponding measurements of the background signals in buffer. For competition experiment, equimolar C34-F and 5-Helix (25 nm) were incubated in the presence of competitive peptides at the graded concentration. The mP values were measured and the percent inhibition of the 6-HB formation by a competitor was calculated using the following equation: % Inhibition = [1 – (E – N)/(P – N)] × 100. E represents mP value in the presence of a competitive peptide while P represents mP value in the absence of a competitor. N corresponds to the wells where only C34-F, but neither 5-Helix nor competitive peptide, was added. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—An ELISA was performed to compare the relative binding affinities of N36 and N36-SIM with C34 to form 6-HB. Briefly, wells of polystyrene plates were coated with 10 μg/ml of mouse anti-HA mAb (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) and kept overnight at 4 °C, then blocked with 1% nonfat milk. Fifty microliters of N36 or N36-SIM were mixed with 25 μl of C34-biotin (4 μm) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by addition of 25 μl of N36-HA (1 μm). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the mixture was transferred to the coated wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., S. San Francisco, CA), and the substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma) were added sequentially. Absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was determined spectrophotometrically by an ELISA reader (Ultra 384 model, Tecan US, Research Triangle Park, NC). The percent inhibition of N36-HA/C34-biotin 6-HB formation by N36 and N36-SIM, respectively, was calculated as described previously (20Jiang S. Lin K. Lu M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10213-10217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IC50 values were calculated using the computer program Calcusyn (21Jiang S. Lin K. Zhang L. Debnath A.K. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—An N-peptide (N36, N46, T-21, or N36-F10) was incubated with a C-peptide (C34 or T-20) at 37 °C for 30 min (the final concentrations of N-peptides and C-peptides were 10 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2). The isolated N- and C-peptides were also tested. CD spectra of these peptides and peptide mixtures were acquired on Jasco spectropolarimeter (Model J-715, Jasco Inc., Japan) at room temperature using a 5.0-nm bandwidth, 0.1-nm resolution, 0.1-cm path length, 4.0-s response time, and a 50-nm/min scanning speed. The spectra were corrected by the subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent. Thermal denaturation was monitored at 222 nm by applying a thermal gradient of 5 °C/min. The melting curve was smoothed, and the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values was calculated using Jasco software utilities as described previously (40Jones D.K. Badii R. Rosell F.I. Lloyd E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HIV-1-mediated Cell-Cell Fusion—A dye transfer assay was used for detection of HIV-1-mediated cell fusion as described previously (8Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 41Jiang S. Radigan L. Zhang L. Proc. SPIE. 2000; 3926: 212-219Crossref Google Scholar). H9/HIV-1IIIB cells were labeled with a fluorescent reagent, Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, Oregon) and then incubated with MT-2 cells (ratio = 1:10) in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of peptides tested. The fused and unfused Calcein-labeled HIV-1-infected cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with an eyepiece micrometer disc. Four fields per well were counted. The percentage of inhibition of cell fusion by peptides was calculated as described previously (41Jiang S. Radigan L. Zhang L. Proc. SPIE. 2000; 3926: 212-219Crossref Google Scholar), and IC50 values were calculated (42Chou T.C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6007) Google Scholar) using the computer program Calcusyn. Unlike C34, T-20 Does Not Form Stable 6-HB with N36—To investigate the interaction of T-20 and C34 with N36, respectively, the CD spectrum of equimolar mixtures of C34 + N36 and of T-20 + N36 were recorded. In agreement with the results reported by Lu et al. (13Lu M. Kim P.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), C34 and N36 separately did not adapt to any stable conformation, characterized by the CD spectra distinctive of random coils, while the equimolar mixture of the two peptides indicated the formation of a helical complex, characterized by the saddle-shaped negative peak in the far UV region of the CD spectrum and the significant increase of molar ellipticity (θ) at 222 nm (Fig. 2A). This helical bundle is relatively stable in phosphate buffer with a Tm about 66 °C (Fig. 2B). The CD spectrum of T-20 was rather similar to that of C34, indicating mainly random coil conformation. However, the spectrum of the T-20 + N36 mixture (equimolar) was distinctively different from that of C34 + N36. The saddle-shaped negative peak in the far UV region was clearly lacking. The θ222 was just the sum of the spectra of N36 and T-20, indicating no increase in helical content (Fig. 2C). The CD data demonstrated that the addition of T-20 failed to induce any helical structure of N36. The lack of interaction between T-20 and N36 is also consistent with the results of the FN-PAGE experiments (Fig. 3). When the fluorescence-labeled C34 (C34-F) and N36 were mixed with equal molar ratio, two fluorescence bands were revealed (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The lower band with low fluorescence intensity was the free C34-F, and the upper band with high fluorescence intensity corresponded to the 6-HB, confirmed by Western blot using the 6-HB-specific mAb NC-1 and FLISA with the materials eluted from the upper band as described previously (38Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). While in the mixture of fluorescence-labeled T-20 (T-20-F) and N36, the only band observable was that of free T-20-F (Fig. 3A, lane 5) with the same intensity as the band of free T-20-F at the same concentration (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The N-peptide N36 was not observable because it did not have fluorescent label and also because it carries net positive charges. The same experiments were also carried out using fluorescence-labeled N36 (N36-F) and unconjugated C34 or T-20. Again, the 6-HB formed between C34 and N36-F was easily identifiable (Fig. 3C, lane 4), while no band was observed for the mixture of N36-F and T-20 (Fig. 3C, lane 5). The free N36-F (Fig. 3C, lane 1) did not enter the gel because of its net positive charges, which causes it to migrate upward toward the cathode (the negative end), and only appeared as a faint band stacked on the top of the gel. When the same gel was stained by Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3D), the bands of C34, T-20, and the N36-F·C34 complex were observable but not the band of N36-F. These results suggest that T-20, unlike C34, does not interact with N36 to form 6-HB. In the next experiment, the effects of T-20 on the 6-HB formation between N36 and C34-F were investigated using a FLISA established previously (39Liu S. Boyer-Chatenet L. Lu H. Jiang S. J. Biomol. Screen. 2003; 8: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Only the N36·C34-F complex, but not the isolated C34-F or N36, could be captured by the mAb NC-1, which specifically recognized the conformation of the 6-HB (Fig. 4A) (20Jiang S. Lin K. Lu M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10213-10217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, addition of the unconjugated C34 reduced the fluorescent intensity of the C34-F·N36 6-HB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B) because of the competitive replacement of C34-F by the unconjugated C34. In the contrast, the addition of T-20 did not affect the formation of C34-F·N36 6-HB and the T-20 appeared to be unable to compete with C34-F to form the 6-HB with N"
https://openalex.org/W2034030865,"Chromosome alignment on the mitotic spindle is monitored by the spindle checkpoint. We identify Sgo1, a protein involved in meiotic chromosome cohesion, as a spindle checkpoint component. Budding yeast cells with mutations in SGO1 respond normally to microtubule depolymerization but not to lack of tension at the kinetochore, and they have difficulty attaching sister chromatids to opposite poles of the spindle. Sgo1 is thus required for sensing tension between sister chromatids during mitosis, and its degradation when they separate may prevent cell cycle arrest and chromosome loss in anaphase, a time when sister chromatids are no longer under tension."
https://openalex.org/W2006999571,"Molecular dependence of vesicular endocytosis was investigated with capacitance measurements at the calyx of Held terminal in brainstem slices. Intraterminal loading of botulinum toxin E revealed that the rapid capacitance transient implicated as “kiss-and-run” was unrelated to transmitter release. The release-related capacitance change decayed with an endocytotic time constant of 10 to 25 seconds, depending on the magnitude of exocytosis. Presynaptic loading of the nonhydrolyzable guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) analog GTPgS or dynamin-1 proline-rich domain peptide abolished endocytosis. These compounds had no immediate effect on exocytosis, but caused a use-dependent rundown of exocytosis. Thus, the guanosine triphosphatase dynamin-1 is indispensable for vesicle endocytosis at this fast central nervous system (CNS) synapse."

Consequently, muscle has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, obesity, and the blood-lipid profile. Excessive caloric intake is sensed by the brain and induces β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)-mediated adaptive thermogenesis. β-AR null mice develop severe obesity on a high fat diet. However, the target gene(s), target tissues(s), and molecular mechanism involved remain obscure. We observed that 30–60 min of β-AR agonist (isoprenaline) treatment of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells strikingly activated (>100-fold) the expression of the mRNA encoding the nuclear hormone receptor, Nur77. In contrast, the expression of other nuclear receptors that regulate lipid and carbohydrate metabolism was not induced. Stable transfection of Nur77-specific small interfering RNAs (siNur77) into skeletal muscle cells repressed endogenous Nur77 mRNA expression. Moreover, we observed attenuation of gene and protein expression associated with the regulation of energy expenditure and lipid homeostasis, for example AMP-activated protein kinase γ3, UCP3, CD36, adiponectin receptor 2, GLUT4, and caveolin-3. Attenuation of Nur77 expression resulted in decreased lipolysis. Finally, in concordance with the cell culture model, injection and electrotransfer of siNur77 into mouse tibialis cranialis muscle resulted in the repression of UCP3 mRNA expression. This study demonstrates regulatory cross-talk between the nuclear hormone receptor and β-AR signaling pathways. Moreover, it suggests Nur77 modulates the expression of genes that are key regulators of skeletal muscle lipid and energy homeostasis. In conclusion, we speculate that Nur77 agonists would stimulate lipolysis and increase energy expenditure in skeletal muscle and suggest selective activators of Nur77 may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of obesity.

Obesity and fat deposition are primarily controlled by food intake and energy expenditure. Obesity has been linked to the development of heart disease, cancer, and stroke, the top three causes of death in the United States, and has recently been recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the top 10 global health problems. Moreover, obesity leads to metabolic syndrome X, a disorder that includes elevated levels of triglycerides and low density lipoprotein (bad) cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein (good) cholesterol, impaired fasting glucose, and hypertension (2.Rosmond R. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These are cardiovascular risk factors for diseases such as atherosclerosis and type II diabetes. More than 65% of United States adults are overweight, and >30% of adults (greater than 61 million people) are clinically obese (1.Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 2.Rosmond R. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Diet, lifestyle, metabolism, and genetics are the most significant factors in controlling weight. Current obesity therapies perform modestly and are aimed at central appetite suppression and reduced fat absorption. Recent research suggests that therapeutic strategies which control satiety, reduce cellular energy stores, and increase adaptive thermogenesis and lipid catabolism provide new hope in the quest for novel anti-obesity drugs (1.Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 2.Rosmond R. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mechanisms exist that sense dietary excess and trigger increases in energy expenditure in an effort to preserve the fat mass set point. This process is responsive to cold and diet and results in the uncoupling of fuel oxidation from ATP synthesis, with the energy/proton gradient released in the form of heat rather than ATP production and is, thus, termed “adaptive thermogenesis.” Known components of the energy expenditure system include leptin, leptin receptor, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, melanocortin-4 receptor, and the β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs). 1The abbreviations used are: β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CAV3, caveolin 3; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; UCP, uncoupling protein; SNS, sympathetic nervous system; NR, nuclear hormone receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Q-RT-PCR, quantitative real time PCR; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CPT-1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1; LXR, liver X receptor; ERR-1, estrogen-related receptor, alpha; ROR, RAR-related orphan receptor; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter.1The abbreviations used are: β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CAV3, caveolin 3; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; UCP, uncoupling protein; SNS, sympathetic nervous system; NR, nuclear hormone receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Q-RT-PCR, quantitative real time PCR; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CPT-1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1; LXR, liver X receptor; ERR-1, estrogen-related receptor, alpha; ROR, RAR-related orphan receptor; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter. However, many questions remain unanswered, including the hardwiring of the central neural circuits regulating energy balance, the efferent pathways, target tissues, target genes, and intracellular mechanisms involved (Refs. 3.Lowell B.B. Bachman E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29385-29388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and 4.Collins S. Cao W. Robidoux J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and references therein). The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is an important efferent pathway that has been implicated in the control of adaptive thermogenesis. The evidence includes the following. Cold and diet induce increases in SNS activity, epinephrine stimulates energy expenditure, brown fat (a thermogenic target tissue) is heavily innervated by the SNS, and thermogenic activity is dependent on an intact SNS. β-ARs and agonists transmit the thermogenic signals to peripheral tissues and mediate SNS activity (for review, see Refs. 3.Lowell B.B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29385-29388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that highlights the key aspects of adrenergic-induced thermogenesis: diet → brain → SNS → β-ARs → target tissue → thermogenesis. The uncoupling proteins (UCP1–3) allow proton “leakage” across the inner mitochondrial membrane for the purpose of heat generation at the expense of coupled ATP production. The mechanism of adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold exposure has been elucidated and involves UCP1, which is highly expressed in brown fat. Knock-out experiments in rodents have demonstrated that UCP1 and brown fat mediate cold-induced thermogenesis; however, these animals are not obese and are resistant to diet-induced obesity (6.Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Knock-out mouse models of the UCP1 homologs, UCP2 and -3 (which are expressed in white adipose and skeletal muscle), have not provided clarification for a role in maintaining energy expenditure in that their responses to cold and high fat feeding are normal, and they show normal body weight and cold tolerance (for review, see Refs. 3.Lowell B.B.

However, some resolution and understanding of the potential mechanisms controlling diet-induced thermogenesis has come from β-AR-less mice that are obese and completely lack both cold and diet-induced thermogenesis, indicating that β-AR play a role in both responses (5.Bachman E.S. Dhillon H. Zhang C.Y. Cinti S. Bianco A.C. Kobilka B.K. Lowell B.B. Science. 2002; 297: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). However, identification of the target tissues relevant to diet-induced thermogenesis has remained elusive, and the possibilities include skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, and liver, all of which are innervated by the SNS (3.Lowell B.B. Bachman E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29385-29388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5.Bachman E.S. Dhillon H. Zhang C.Y. Cinti S. Bianco A.C. Kobilka B.K. Lowell B.B. Science. 2002; 297: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle is one of the most metabolically demanding major mass peripheral tissues that accounts for 50% of energy expenditure. Moreover, this lean tissue relies heavily on fatty acids as an energy source, accounts for 75% of glucose disposal, and is involved in cholesterol efflux. Consequently, muscle has a significant role in insulin sensitivity and the blood-lipid profile. These facts alone suggest that muscle has an important role in obesity and suggest muscle may have an important role in diet-induced modulation of energy expenditure. The orphan nuclear hormone receptor NR4A subgroup is expressed in skeletal muscle, and intriguingly, NR4A1/Nur77 induction by β-AR agonists has been described in a single report (11.Lim R.W.

Hence, understanding the link between the Nur77 orphan nuclear receptor, the β-adrenergic response, and energy expenditure (adaptive thermogenesis) has important implications for obesity. This study focuses on the molecular regulation of gene expression involved in lipid and energy homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells by orphan nuclear receptors. We hypothesize that Nur77 (NR4A1) is involved in mediating β-AR signaling and that skeletal muscle is a critical target tissue in the regulation of energy expenditure. Our investigation utilizes small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knock-out of Nur77 in skeletal muscle cells to understand the regulatory role of a β-AR agonist-induced nuclear hormone receptor in this major mass peripheral tissue. 30–60 min β-AR agonist treatment of muscle cells strikingly activated (>100-fold) the expression of the mRNA encoding Nur77. In contrast, the expression of the other nuclear receptors was not induced. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that Nur77 is necessary for the expression of a subgroup of genes involved in energy balance and expenditure, including AMPKγ3 and UCP3. This is consistent with the observation that this orphan nuclear receptor is hypersensitive to adrenergic stimulation. Cell Culture—Mouse myogenic C2C12 cells were cultured in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Serum Supreme (BioWhittaker, Edward Keller Pty Ltd., Hallam, Victoria, Australia)) in 6% CO2. Myoblasts were differentiated into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by 5 days of serum withdrawal (i.e. cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum). Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, usually 120 h (5 days) after mitogen withdrawal, unless indicated differently. African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For the β-adrenergic agonist experiments, myotubes were treated with 100 nm isoprenaline hydrochloride (Calbiochem) or the vehicle control, ethanol, for the indicated time intervals. Transient Transfections—Each well of a 24-well plate of COS-1 cells (∼60% confluence) was transfected with a total of ∼0.6 μg of DNA using the liposome-mediated transfection procedure as described previously (13.Lau P. Nixon S.J. Parton R.G. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36828-36840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using a DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate and Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) liposome mixture in 1× HEPES-buffered saline (42 mm HEPES, 275 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, 11 mm dextrose (pH 7.1)). The DNA/DOTAP/Metafectene mixture was added to the cells in 0.6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. 16 h later the culture medium was changed, and after a further 24 h the cells were harvested for the assay of luciferase activity. Values are expressed as relative light units ± S.D. and were derived from a minimum of two independent experiments composed of six replicates. C2C12 Stable Transfection—Myogenic C2C12 cells cultured in growth medium were transfected with pSilencer 2.1-siNur77(DE) by the liposome-mediated procedure. The cells were then grown for another 24 h to allow cell recovery and neomycin resistance expression before G418 selection. After 10–14 days of selection with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) in culture medium, the polyclonal pool (>50 G418-resistant colonies) of stable transfectants were cultured and maintained on 50 or 250 μg/ml G418 medium. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells and tibialis cranialis muscles (after grinding and homogenization of muscle tissue) using TRI-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturer's protocol. This was followed by DNase treatment with 2 units of Turbo DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 1 h followed by heating to 75 °C for 10 min to inactivate the DNase. RNA for quantitative real time PCR was further purified using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantitated using UV spectrophotometry, and complementary DNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA using an oligo(dT)18 primer and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative Real Time (Q-RT)-PCR—Target cDNA levels were analyzed by Q-RT-PCR in 25-μl reactions containing either 1× SYBR green (ABI, Warrington, UK) or Taqman PCR master mix (ABI, Branchburg, NJ), 200 nm each forward and reverse primers or 1× Assay-on-Demand Taqman primers (ABI, Foster City, CA), and the equivalent of 0.3 μl of cDNA. Using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system, PCR was conducted over 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min preceded by an initial 95 °C for 10 min to activate the Amplitaq Gold DNA polymerase. The relative level of expression or fold change and associated errors were calculated using the guidelines described by Bookout and Mangelsdorf (19.Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. NURSA e-Journal. 2003; 1 (1.11082003.1)Google Scholar) on the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas website (NURSA) (www.nursa.org/index.cfm) in accord with the accepted Q-PCR standards for National Institutes of Health-supported NURSA research. Primers—Primers used for Q-RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA populations have been described in detail (13.Lau P. Nixon S.J. Parton R.G. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36828-36840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), with the exception of primers designed for the detection of Nur77 using SYBR green (Nur77-F, TGATGTTCCCGCCTTTGC; Nur77-R, CAATGCGATTCTGCAGCTCTT). Assay-on-demand primer/probe sets for Nur77, AMPKγ1, and AMPKγ3 (Applied Biosystems) were also used for Taqman real time PCR. Plasmids—POMC-tkLUC, pSG5-Nur77, and pSG5 have been described previously (20.Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21.Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Yan G. Ordentlich P. Muscat G.E. J. Biol.

The pairs of oligonucleotides used for cloning the Nur77 siRNA targets into the pSilencer 2.1 and 3.1 vector were as follows: AB region, GATCCCGCTTCCAGCCGTCCCAGCTTTTCAAGAGAAAGCTGGGACGGCTGGAAGTTTTTTGGAAA and AGCTTTTCCAAAAAACTTCCAGCCGTCCCAGCTTTCTCTTGAAAAGCTGGGACGGCTGGAAGCGG; DE region, GATCCCGTCCCTGGCTTCATTGAGCTTTCAAGAGAAGCTCAATGAAGCCAGGGATTTTTTGGAAA and AGCTTTTCCAAAAAATCCCTGGCTTCATTGAGCTTCTCTTGAAAGCTCAATGAAGCCAGGGACGG. These pairs of oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into both the pSilencer 2.1 neo and pSilencer 3.1 neo expression vectors (Ambion, Austin, TX) as per the manufacturer's protocol. In Vivo Electrotransfer into Mice—Plasmid vectors were propagated in ampicillin-selective media. DNA was extracted, purified using endotoxin-free maxi-prep kits (Qiagen Pty Ltd., Doncaster, Victoria, Australia), and re-suspended in sterile 0.9% saline. Anesthesia was induced in mice using 5% halothane in oxygen and maintained with 1–2% halothane in oxygen with administration of 5 mg/kg ketoprofen to provide post-operative analgesia. The hindlimbs of mice were shaved and prepared with a chlorhexidine-ethanol solution, and one tibialis cranialis muscle was injected in oblique fashion transcutaneously along their length with 30 μl of saline containing 0.5 mg/ml of each vector (pEGFP and pSilencer 2.1-siNur77(DE)) using a 29-gauge needle. The injection was immediately followed by the application of a pair of caliper electrodes across the injected leg connected to an ECM-830 electroporator device (BTX, Holliston, MA). Eight 20-ms pulses of 200 V/cm at a frequency of 1 Hz were administered as described previously (22.Mir L.M. Bureau M.F. Gehl J. Rangara R. Rouy D. Caillaud J.M. Delaere P. Branellec D. Schwartz B. Scherman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4262-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The other tibialis cranialis muscle was injected in the same fashion with the appropriate control vectors (pEGFP and pSilencer 2.1 negative) and electroporated using the same procedure. After recovery, animals were monitored daily for body weight and general condition. No adverse effects on the animals were noted during the experiment. One week after electrotransfer mice were killed, and the tibialis cranialis muscles were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C for subsequent analysis. Western Blotting—Cell lysates normalized for protein concentration and resolved on SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes using semidry transfer. The molecular mass of resolved proteins was determined by comparison with Precision Plus markers (Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with anti-CPT1-m (CPT1, muscle) polyclonal antibody (Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc., San Antonio, TX), anti-GLUT4 polyclonal antibody (a gift of Prof. David James, Garvan Institute of Medical Research), and anti-CAV3 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA) followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The horseradish peroxidase conjugate was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce), and immunoreactivity was visualized by autoradiography. Lipolysis Assay—Triglyceride hydrolysis (lipolysis) was assessed in C2C12 cells and the C2C12:siNur77 cells using the adipolysis assay kit (Chemicon Australia Pty Ltd., Boronia, Victoria, Australia) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, C2C12 cells and C2C12-siNur77 cells were differentiated for 5 days, the culture media was removed, and the monolayer was washed twice with wash solution (Hanks' balanced salt solution). 250 μl of incubation solution (Hanks' balanced salt solution + 2% bovine serum albumin) was added to the wells in triplicate, and cells were incubated for 1, 3, and 6 h. At each time point the incubation solution was removed and stored at –20 °C until analyzed. To measure lipolysis, 200 μl of free glycerol assay reagent was added to 25 μl of culture supernatants and glycerol standards and incubated for 15 min, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm. A standard curve constructed from the glycerol standards was used to calculate the concentration of glycerol in the culture supernatants. Nur77 mRNA Is Expressed in Skeletal Muscle Cells and Induced during Myogenesis—To elucidate the functional role of Nur77 in skeletal muscle, we initially investigated the expression of Nur77 mRNA relative to GAPDH in the mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line. Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts can be induced to biochemically and morphologically differentiate into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal in culture over a 48–96-h period (Fig. 1A). We utilized the ABI Taqman Nur77 primer set and also used the GenBank™ sequences of Nur77 to design specific primers for the SYBR green mediated amplification of mouse Nur77 by quantitative real time PCR using total RNA isolated from proliferating and differentiated C2C12 cells. Total RNA was isolated from proliferating myoblasts and post-mitotic myotubes after 5 days (MT5) of serum withdrawal and converted to cDNA, and the expression levels of various genes was then examined by real time PCR. We observed that Nur77 is weakly expressed in proliferating myoblasts; however, the transcript is induced ∼4 fold relative to GAPDH mRNA as the cells exit the cell cycle and fuse to form differentiated multinucleated myotubes that have acquired a muscle-specific phenotype (Fig. 1B). Concomitant with this increase in Nur77 mRNA was the striking induction of the slow (type I, TNNI1) and fast (type II, TNNI2) isoforms of the contractile protein, troponin I, relative to GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 1, D and E). Moreover, we observed the significant induction of myogenin mRNA that encodes the hierarchical bHLH regulator (Fig. 1C). These data confirmed that the cells had terminally differentiated. Furthermore, we observed the induction of the mRNAs encoding UCP3 (Fig. 1F), LPL (Fig. 1G), the GLUT4 transporter (Fig. 1H), the fatty acid translocase, CD36 (Fig. 1I), the type II/glycolytic muscle specific AMPKγ3 (Fig. 1J), and caveolin 3 (CAV3, Fig. 1K). These are examples of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the regulation of energy expenditure and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (as described in Table I). In summary, these data demonstrate that the mRNA transcript encoding Nur77 was expressed in C2C12 cells in a differentiation-dependent manner, concomitant with the acquisition of a contractile and metabolic phenotype.Table IKey target genes in this studyABCA1 and ABCG8ATP binding cassette.

They lack an N-terminal signal sequence and are predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found the N terminus of endogenous Nogo-A exposed on the surface of fibroblasts, DRG neurons, and myoblasts. Surface-expressed Nogo-A was also present on presynaptic terminals of the neuromuscular junction and on DRG neurons in vivo. Surface biotinylations confirmed the presence of all Nogo isoforms on the surface. To search for proteins that interact with Nogo-A and suggest a function for the large intracellular pool of Nogo-A, immunoprecipitations were performed. Surprisingly, the most predominant proteins that interact with Nogo-A are Nogo-B and Nogo-C as seen with radiolabeled lysates and as confirmed by Western blotting in multiple cell lines. Nogo-A, -B, and -C share a 180-amino acid C-terminal domain with two highly conserved hydrophobic stretches that could form a channel or transporter in the ER and/or on the cell surface.

Reticulons are a family of proteins that share a common C-terminal domain and are particularly abundant in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; WT, wild type; mAb, monoclonal antibody; DABCO, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; PFA, paraformaldehyde.

The most recognized reticulon, Nogo-A, is a potent neurite outgrowth inhibitor of high molecular mass (200 kDa) (2.Chen M.S. Huber A.B. van der Haar M.E. Frank M. Schnell L. Spillmann A.A. Christ F.

Weinmann O. Brosamle C. Oertle T. Schwab M.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3553-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Hunt D. Coffin R.S. Prinjha R.K. Campbell G. Anderson P.N. Mol.

Brain Res. 2002; 104: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nogo-B (55 kDa), a splice variant of Nogo-A, is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues; it has been suggested to function in vascular remodeling (8.Acevedo L. Yu J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Miao R.Q. Kim J.E. Fulton D. Tempst P. Strittmatter S.M. Sessa W.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and in apoptosis (9.Li Q. Qi B. Oka K. Shimakage M. Yoshioka N. Inoue H. Hakura A. Kodama K. Stanbridge E.J. Yutsudo M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3929-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but its function is far from clear. An alternate promoter is used for expressing the smallest RTN-4 form, Nogo-C (25 kDa), a protein highly expressed in differentiated muscle fiber, although there is some expression also in brain, in particular in adult Purkinje cells (5.Huber A.B. Weinmann O. Brosamle C. Oertle T. Schwab M.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3553-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Dupuis L. Gonzalez de Aguilar J.L. di Scala F. Rene F. de Tapia M. Pradat P.F.

As with the related RTN-1 to RTN-3, there is no known function for Nogo-C. The C-terminal reticulon domain (about 180 amino acids) for these proteins is evolutionarily conserved and can be found in all eukaryotes (11.Oertle T. Klinger M. Stuermer C.A. Schwab M.E. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal regions are of very different lengths for the different reticulons and show less conservation (12.Di Scala F. Dupuis L. Gaiddon C. De Tapia M. Jokic N. Gonzalez De Aguilar J.L. Raul J.S. Ludes B. Loeffler J.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 385: 125-134Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For instance, the N-terminal regions of the three Nogo proteins can only be found in higher vertebrates. A recent study shows that reticulons can modulate the activity of BACE1 and affect the secretion of amyloid-β peptide (13.He W. Lu Y. Qahwash I. Hu X.Y. Chang A. Yan R. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, solid data are sparse, and any common functional role for the C-terminal region of reticulons has not yet been discovered. All reticulons have two large hydrophobic domains near the C terminus of the protein. In the case of rat Nogo proteins these presumed transmembrane regions are 35 and 36 amino acids each, respectively, long enough to span the membrane twice (2.Chen M.S. Huber A.B. van der Haar M.E. Frank M. Schnell L. Spillmann A.A. Christ F. Schwab M.E. Nature. 2000; 403: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3.GrandPre T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In between the two transmembrane domains, the 66-amino acid loop has been found to bind the Nogo receptor subunit, NgR (14.Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Another important region for the neurite outgrowth inhibitory function is located in the Nogo-A-specific region in the middle of the protein (15.Oertle T. van der Haar M.E. Bandtlow C.E. Robeva A. Burfeind P. Buss A. Huber A.B. Simonen M. Schnell L. Brosamle C. Kaupmann K. Vallon R. Schwab M.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5393-5406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this domain to be inhibitory, it naturally must be displayed outside the oligodendrocyte to bind and activate a receptor on the surface of neurons or fibroblasts. Specific high affinity binding of this domain to brain membranes or to live fibroblasts has been shown (15.Oertle T. van der Haar M.E. Bandtlow C.E. Robeva A. Burfeind P. Buss A. Huber A.B. Simonen M. Schnell L. Brosamle C. Kaupmann K. Vallon R. Schwab M.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5393-5406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the localization and topology of Nogo-A on plasma membranes have not been clear up to now. Other characteristics of reticulons include a di-lysine ER retention/retrieval signal at the extreme C terminus and a lack of a signal sequence at the N terminus. All the studied proteins of this family display a reticular pattern that co-localizes with ER markers, at least for a large part of the protein localization, when tested by indirect immunofluorescence (1.Oertle T.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2403-2416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the second transmembrane domain of Nogo-A was deleted the protein showed a partial cytoplasmic staining; therefore, this region could be critical for insertion into the ER (1.Oertle T. Schwab M.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 187-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Many membrane-bound proteins that do not contain a signal sequence use one of their hydrophobic domains and regions around it for signaling entry into the ER (17.Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, other myelin proteins (MAL and PMP-22) have putative di-lysine ER retention/retrieval signals, yet can be found on the cell surface. Surprisingly, even proteins that are well known ER markers such as calreticulin and calnexin can be found in low amounts on the plasma membrane (18.Okazaki Y. Ohno H. Takase K. Ochiai T. Saito T. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15926-15929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many studies with potassium channels demonstrate that the ER retention signals are masked once the individual subunits form a functional channel, whereby the bulk of the total individual potassium channel subunits remain in the ER with only a very low amount of functional channel expressed on the cell surface (21.Ma D. Jan L.Y. Curr. Opin Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Many other proteins with ER retention/retrieval signals are located on the cell surface; for example, the glutamate receptors AMPA (22.Greger I.H. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and NMDA (23.Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a kainate receptor subunit (24.Ren Z. Riley N.J. Garcia E.P. Sanders J.M. Swanson G.T. Marshall J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6608-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GABAB receptors (25.Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and a subunit of a calcium channel (26.Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Here we show that not only is Nogo-A found on the surface of multiple cell types, but that Nogo-B and Nogo-C can also be detected on the plasma membrane. In addition, all immunofluorescent studies for Nogo-A were performed with antibodies that are specific for the Nogo-A-specific, N-terminal, and middle portion of this large protein, meaning that different cell types have the ability for expressing this region of Nogo-A on the cell surface facing the extracellular space. Immunoprecipitations of cell lysates done with protein radiolabeling demonstrate that in different cell types the predominant proteins that interact specifically with Nogo-A are Nogo-B and Nogo-C. Both Western blotting after immunoprecipitation and size exclusion chromatography confirm the existence of a high molecular mass complex that includes all three Nogo proteins. Antibodies—Most antibodies are described in Ref. 15.Oertle T. van der Haar M.E. Bandtlow C.E. Robeva A. Burfeind P. Buss A. Huber A.B. Simonen M. Schnell L. Brosamle C. Kaupmann K. Vallon R.

These are the former names with the new names: Bianca = Rb1, Laura = Rb173A, Florina = Rb173B. The sheep antibody was made by immunization with two bacterially produced purified peptides from rat Nogo-A, NiGΔ20 (amino acids 544–725), and NiGΔ6 (amino acids 763–975). For the production of AR2, one 15-amino acid peptide, AKIQAKIPGLKRKAE, was chosen from murine Nogo-A sequence according to the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity profile and antigenicity prediction analyses. This peptide was located in the C terminus of the reticular homology domain and did not show potential cross reactivity with other reticulons (data not shown). After synthesis and purification by standard protocols, peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into two specific pathogen-free rabbits. Immunization was boosted with three subsequent injections at 14, 28, and 56 days. Terminal bleeds were affinity purified against the immunizing peptide and stored as frozen aliquots. The polyclonal antisera were found to react specifically with Nogo extracts was confirmed by the elimination of staining in the presence of excess immunizing peptide (data not shown).

In more detail, 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) and gentamicin (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were always split the day before an experiment and kept in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. A description of the brain oligodendrocyte culture is in Ref. 28.van der Haar M.E. Visser H.W. de Vries H. Hoekstra D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. Dissociated DRG neuron cultures were made from the trypsin- and collagenase-treated, triturated DRGs of newborn rats that were plated on poly-l-lysine (PLL) and laminincoated coverslips. The DRG neurons were kept in L15 medium with l-glutamine (Sigma) and supplemented with N1 additives (Sigma), 100 ng/ml NGF (2.5 S NGF, purified from male mouse salivary glands) and gentamicin (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). C2C12 myoblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum, and chicken embryo extract. Immunofluorescent Staining—For surface staining: Cells were either plated onto PLL-coated glass coverslips (3T3 and DRG) or onto chamber slides (C2C12 myoblasts) using the medium described above. The cells were washed once with room temperature PBS, then were placed either on ice (3T3 and C2C12 myoblasts) or between 10 and 14 °C (DRG), and washed once with cold PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (Ca/Mg-PBS). Cold primary antibody, diluted in blocking buffer (either 2% goat serum, 0.2% fish skin gelatin in Ca/Mg-PBS or 10% fetal bovine serum in Ca/Mg-PBS), was added to live cells on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with cold Ca/Mg-PBS. Fixation was done with cold 4% PFA, and the cells were placed at room temperature for 10–30 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS. The secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer was added to the cells for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted on slides with Mowiol (10% Mowiol 4–88 (w/v) (Calbiochem) was dissolved in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5. with 25% glycerol (w/v) and 0.1% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) was added as an anti-bleaching reagent). For intracellular staining: cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, permeablilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5–10 min, washed three times with PBS, and then blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (2% goat serum, 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS). Primary antibody was added for 30 min in blocking buffer. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min in secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Cy3 (1:3000) in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted on slides with Mowiol containing 0.1% DABCO. Images were acquired on a Leica type DM RE microscope using the confocal laser scanning system TCS-SL from Leica. An HCX PL APO 40×/1.25 Ph 3 objective was used. Immunohistochemistry—For the DRGs: an adult rat was injected with NEMBUTAL (Abbott Laboratories), and perfused transcardially with Ringer's solution followed by 4% PFA in 0.1 m phosphate buffer with 5% sucrose. The lumbar DRGs were removed and put in the same fixative for 2 h at 4 °C. After fixation the DRGs were incubated in 0.1 m phosphate buffer with 30% sucrose for 2 days. Embedding was done in Tissue Tek (OCT compound; Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands) that was subsequently frozen in isopentane at –40 °C. 20-μm serial cryostat sections were mounted on Superfrost-Plus slides (Menzel-Glaeser; Germany) and frozen at –20 °C. After washing the slides in PBS, they were left in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h. Then, the slides were incubated with Rb173A antibody (1:1000) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times with PBS and incubated in anti-rabbit Cy3 antibody (1:500) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed three times with PBS and mounted with Mowiol containing 0.1% DABCO. For the diaphragm: an adult rat was decapitated and the diaphragm was immediately and thoroughly washed with PBS and cut in half. One half of the diaphragm was incubated with Rb173A (1:1000) antibody and the other half with β-tubulin (1:500) (Chemicon) in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer) for 5 days at 4 °C. The floating tissue was then washed with PBS at 4 °C for 4 days and subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Alexa546 (1: 300)(Molecular Probes) and anti-bungarotoxin Alexa 488 (1:1000) (Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer for 2 days at 4 °C. The tissue was then washed for 2 days with PBS. Confocal imaging was done with the floating tissue placed between a glass slide and a glass coverslip. The microscope and imaging process was as described in the above section. The day after imaging, the same non-permeabilized half of the diaphragm that had been incubated with anti β-tubulin antibody was then fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4 for 20 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, permeablilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in blocking buffer for 1 h and incubated with anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:500) for 1 h. The tissue was washed with PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa 546 (1:300) in permeabilization blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Confocal imaging was done as described above. Surface Biotinylation—3T3 cells were plated the day before the experiment. Plates were placed on ice and washed five times with cold PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (Ca/Mg-PBS). A solution of cold 0.2 mm Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC biotin (Pierce) in Ca/Mg-PBS was incubated on the cells for 1 h. After washing three times with cold Ca/Mg-PBS the biotin was quenched for 10 min with cold Ca/Mg-PBS containing 20 mm glycine. Cells were lysed in either radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) or RSB-Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were scraped from the plate and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated either with streptavidin gel (Pierce) or with preclearing goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h rotating at 4 °C. The samples incubated with streptavidin gel were then washed five times with cold Ca/Mg-PBS, aspirated with a 27-gauge needle, and SDS loading buffer was added. They were boiled for 5 min before the supernatant was loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The Western blot was probed with Rb1 antibody (1:25,000). The samples incubated with preclearing antibody had protein G beads (Pierce) added, and were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was moved to a new tube and they were precleared again with Sheep IgG (Sigma) and rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for 2 h followed by 2 h of incubation with protein G beads. The supernatant was moved to a new tube and incubated with the antibodies of interest while rotating overnight at 4 °C. Protein G beads were then added for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed one time with RSB-Nonidet P-40 buffer, three times with Buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), two times with Buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and one time with Buffer C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The beads were then aspirated with a 27-gauge needle, SDS loading buffer was added, they were boiled for 5 min, and loaded on a 14% SDS-PAGE. The blot was probed with neutravidin-HRP (1:20,000) (Pierce). 35S-labeling and Immunoprecipitations—With radioactivity: CHO-NogoA and 3T3 cells were plated the day before the experiment. Primary oligodendrocytes were grown in differentiation medium for 5 days prior to the experiment. Cells were washed with warmed medium and incubated on a rocker at 37 °C for 1 or 2 h with a solution containing DME without methionine and cysteine (Invitrogen) and with 450 μCi/ml of Trans35S-LABEL (ICN). All subsequent steps were done on ice or at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed with CHAPS buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min. The cells were scraped, and the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was put into a new tube, and a preclearing goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added. These tubes were rotated for 2 h, then protein G beads were added, and the samples were again rotated for 2 h. This preclearing step was repeated. Subsequently, the antibodies of interest were added, and the samples were rotated overnight. Protein G beads were added to each sample, and the tubes were rotated for 2 h, washed as detailed in the surface biotinylation protocol, aspirated with a 27-gauge needle, incubated with SDS loading buffer and run on a 14% SDS-PAGE. The gel was subsequently dried for 1 h, and then imaged on a Phosphorimager (the gel with CHO samples) or were put on film (the gels with 3T3 and oligodendrocyte samples). Without radioactivity: cells were plated the day before the experiment. The experiment in Fig. 8 did not involve any transfection, but for Figs. 9 and 10 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). The day after transfection cells were washed, incubated with RSB-Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), scraped, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was put into a new tube, the antibodies of interest were added, and the samples were processed as detailed above in the radiolabeled samples.Fig. 9Nogo-B and Nogo-C interact with Nogo-A. Plasmids containing FLAG-tagged Nogo-A and Myc-tagged Nogo-C were transiently transfected into 3T3 cells. After 24 h cells were lysed, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with different antibodies. The control Ab was β-tubulin. Samples were run on 14% SDS-PAGE, Western blotted, and probed with the AR2 antibody that recognizes Nogo-A, -B, and -C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 10Transiently expressed Nogo-A does not co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous mouse Nogo-A. 3T3 cells were transfected with a plasmid that expresses rat Nogo-A containing a C-terminal Myc epitope. The cells were lysed, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Samples were run on an SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted, and probed with 11C7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Size Exclusion Gel Filtration Column—Ten 150-mm plates were transfected with a plasmid containing rat Nogo-C using Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's description. After 24 h, the cells were scraped into cold PBS and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in 5 ml of ice-cold RSB-Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (see above) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. 140 mm NaCl was added to the extract. A Superdex 200 26/60 column was equilibrated with extraction buffer (150 mm NaCl) on an FPLC system from Amersham Biosciences. 5 ml of cell extract was separated with a flow of 1.8 ml/min, and after 40 min the fraction collector started to collect 1.8-ml fractions. 30 μl of fractions 20–45 were run on a 4–12% NuPage gel (Invitrogen) and analysed by Western blotting using the AR2 antibody. Fraction 20 corresponds to 36 ml after sample injection. Antibodies That Recognize Nogo—To study the cellular localization of Nogo-A and to discover proteins that interact with it, different antibodies generated against specific regions of the protein were used for immunofluorescent and immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1A). Two rabbit polyclonal antiserum, a sheep polyclonal antisera, and two mouse mAbs specifically recognize Nogo-A and not the spliced variant Nogo-B or the small protein, Nogo-C, which uses an alternate promoter. The N-terminal 172 amino acids of Nogo-A are identical to the N terminus of Nogo-B, and therefore, one rabbit polyclonal anti-serum, Rb1, recognizes both Nogo-A and Nogo-B. The AR2 antibody, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum with the epitope in the common C-terminal region of the protein is able to recognize all three Nogo proteins. The Western blot shows that all antibodies are specific for the epitopes they should recognize (Fig. 1B). In all lysates investigated there were two Nogo-B bands, one at around the apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa and one that ran slightly lower (see the * in Fig. 1B). The lower band may represent a cleavage product or a modified form of Nogo-B. The predicted molecular mass for rat Nogo-A is 139 kDa and rat Nogo-B is 39 kDa (according to the website: ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). However, on standard SDS-PAGE, Nogo-A migrates at around 200 kDa and Nogo-B around 55 kDa. The slower migration of Nogo-A has been noted before in the literature and was attributed to the high number of charged amino acids (3.GrandPre T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). However, we have found that Nu-PAGE 4–12% gradient gels run with MOPS buffer (Invitrogen) show Nogo-A and Nogo-B running closer to their predicted molecular mass of 140 and 40 kDa, respectively. A difference of protein migration on a standard SDS-PAGE compared with the NuPAGE system has been described for α-synuclein (29.Moussa C.E. Wersinger C. Rusnak M. Tomita Y. Sidhu A. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 371: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a protein, similar to Nogo-A, which has many acidic residues. In all figures with gels or Western blots arrows point to the Nogo proteins, and the figure legends detail the gel type that was used. Nogo-A Is Found on the Surface of Live Cells by Immunofluorescence—Staining of the cell surface of live, cultured cells were done with 3T3 fibroblasts, DRG neurons, and C2C12 myoblasts. All cells were incubated with Nogo-A-specific antibodies either on a metal sheet on ice (for 3T3 fibroblasts and myoblasts) or at 10–14 °C temperatures (for DRG cultures that appeared to come off the coverslip when put directly on the ice-cold metal sheet). Protein internalization is blocked at temperature below 19 °C (30.Sipe D.M. Jesurum A. Murphy R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3469-3474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, our staining method should only show surface-bound antibody, and capping of the antibody should not occur, especially for the case of 3T3 cells and myoblasts that were kept at 0 °C. Either the Nogo-A-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum Rb173A (Fig. 2A) or a combination of the two mouse mAbs, 11C7 and 7B12, (Fig. 2B) resulted in a weak but clear surface staining of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. 3T3 cells are kn"
https://openalex.org/W1985183555,"A key function of activated macrophages is to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα; however, the intracellular pathway and machinery responsible for cytokine trafficking and secretion is largely undefined. Here we show that individual SNARE proteins involved in vesicle docking and fusion are regulated at both gene and protein expression upon stimulation with the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide. Focusing on two intracellular SNARE proteins, Vti1b and syntaxin 6 (Stx6), we show that they are up-regulated in conjunction with increasing cytokine secretion in activated macrophages and that their levels are selectively titrated to accommodate the volume and timing of post-Golgi cytokine trafficking. In macrophages, Vti1b and syntaxin 6 are localized on intracellular membranes and are present on isolated Golgi membranes and on Golgi-derived TNFα vesicles budded in vitro. By immunoprecipitation, we find that Vti1b and syntaxin 6 interact to form a novel intracellular Q-SNARE complex. Functional studies using overexpression of full-length and truncated proteins show that both Vti1b and syntaxin 6 function and have rate-limiting roles in TNFα trafficking and secretion. This study shows how macrophages have uniquely adapted a novel Golgi-associated SNARE complex to accommodate their requirement for increased cytokine secretion.

A primary function of activated macrophages is the rapid and abundant secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TACE, TNFα-converting enzyme; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IFNγ, interferon-γ; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Stx6, syntaxin 6; β-COP, coat protein complex β.1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TACE, TNFα-converting enzyme; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IFNγ, interferon-γ; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Stx6, syntaxin 6; β-COP, coat protein complex β. This secretion is essential to mount a successful inflammatory response but is equally the cause of severe clinical problems in acute and chronic inflammatory disease (1Palladino M.A. Bahjat F.R. Theodorakis E.A. Moldawer L.L. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The bacterial cell wall component LPS activates macrophages, eliciting the rapid synthesis of TNFα as a type II membrane precursor and subsequent proteolytic cleavage for secretion of the active cytokine (2Black R.A.

Investig. 2001; 81: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); thereafter, little is known about the secretory pathway, the specific trafficking machinery or mechanisms that ensure the rapid delivery of cytokine to the cell surface for release. SNAREs are key regulators in all fusion events occurring in the secretory pathway (7Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Vesicle docking and fusion requires a specific R-SNARE on the vesicle to bind to two or three unique receptor target molecules, the Q-SNAREs, on the target membrane to form a trans-complex, thus pulling the membranes in close proximity and overcoming the energy barrier for fusion (8Rothman J.E. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Four different conserved SNARE motifs (Qa, Qb, Qc and R) form an extended four-helix bundle and are sufficient for complex formation. Distinct complexes of SNARE family proteins are required to mediate vesicle docking and fusion on different membranes and at different vesicle trafficking steps (7Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 10Parlati F. Varlamov O. Paz K. McNew J.A. Hurtado D. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5424-5429Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The best characterized of the SNARE complexes functions in the fusion of synaptic vesicles at the plasma membrane. Intracellular SNARE complexes tend to be less well defined for a number of reasons; SNARES can participate in multiple fusion steps throughout the cell and as such can interact with different sets of SNARE partners. Additionally, differences in SNARE complexes and localization can exist between cell types. Syntaxin 6 is a promiscuous SNARE partner, implicated in multiple complexes and associated with functions in both exocytic and endocytic pathways (11Wendler F. Tooze S. Traffic. 2001; 2: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It typically resides on membranes and vesicles in and around the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Vti1b is known in a much more restricted context, that of a single SNARE complex on late endosomes, where it has been implicated in late endosome homotypic fusion and in late endosome-lysosome fusion (12Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Lindsay M.R. Gray S.R.

There is also evidence that it interacts with EpsinR, a protein involved in exocytic trafficking (14Chidambaram S. Mullers N. Wiederhold K. Haucke V. von Mollard G.F. J. Biol.

Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and we have shown that the Q-SNARE complex of syntaxin 4 and SNAP23, along with the sec1/Munc18 family (SM) protein Munc18c, functions at the plasma membrane and is required for TNFα secretion in macrophages (20Pagan J.K.

The majority of the molecules involved in regulating vesicle budding from the Golgi and the transport to and fusion with the target membrane remain to be identified in macrophages. Here we show that a novel Q-SNARE complex, located on similar Golgi-derived vesicles as TNFα, is up-regulated at a rate-limiting step in the secretion of TNFα to maximize cytokine secretion during inflammation. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-mouse TNFα antibodies were purchased from Genzyme, anti-syntaxin 3 antibodies were purchased from Sapphire Biosciences, and anti-β-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Antibodies specific for VAMP2, VAMP8, Stx7, Stx8, and SNAP-23 were purchased from Synaptic Systems, whereas antibodies to Vti1A, Vti1B, Stx6, GS28, γ-adaptin, and GM130 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibodies to Munc-18c were a kind gift from David James (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia). Antibodies to β-COP were a kind gift from Rohan Teasdale (Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Brisbane, Australia).

SNARES (both full-length and truncated) were cloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech, BD Biosciences) to produce an N-terminal GFP-tagged protein. Syntaxin 2 was subcloned from a National Institute of Aging clone (parent clone ID J0828A07).

Macrophages were electroporated, using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad), for transient expression of cDNAs using 2.5 × 107 cells with 10 μg DNA, with a high capacitance setting (280 mV and 950 microfarads). Cells were washed and typically cultured for 24 h. Microarray Analysis—RAW 264.7 macrophages, cultured in the presence of LPS (100 ng/ml) for varying times were extracted for mRNA, and microarray analysis was performed according to the protocol of Ref. 21Rowland J.E.

Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were washed three times with Buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and lysed in Buffer A by passage through a series of successively smaller needles. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was assayed for protein content (Bio-Rad protein assay), subjected to SDS-PAGE separation, and analyzed by immunoblotting (20Pagan J.K.

For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysate was incubated with 5 μg of antibody bound to protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. The beads were then washed five times in excess Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl, and the bound proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunofluorescent staining was performed as previously published (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr.

Golgi Membrane Isolation and in Vitro Vesicle Budding—A stacked Golgi membrane fraction and subsequent budded vesicles were prepared from RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 2 h by density gradient centrifugation based on previously published methods (22Heimann K.

Assays for TNFα Trafficking and Secretion—The trafficking of TNFα from the Golgi complex to the cell surface was measured using an immunofluorescence-based assay described previously (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A commercial enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay kit (BD OptEIA, BD Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to determine levels of secreted TNFα. SNARE Expression Is Quantitatively Linked to Exocytic Trafficking Requirements in Activated Macrophages—In activated macrophages, TNFα secretion is temporal in nature; the pulse of TNFα protein synthesis peaks at 2 h and ceases by 12 (Fig. 1) (5Shurety W. Merino-Trigo A. Brown D. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Identifying components of the trafficking machinery of the cell that are similarly regulated by LPS during this period provides a strategy for identifying proteins involved in the secretory process (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a plasma membrane Q-SNARE complex of syntaxin 4 and SNAP23, along with Munc18c, is up-regulated by LPS and that it functions in TNFα delivery to the cell surface (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Microarrays were now used in a wider screen to search for other LPS-restricted SNARE proteins in activated macrophages (Affymetrix, 430A mouse gene chip; results published at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE1459, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE1459). A characteristic response to LPS by these macrophages was signified by the dramatic induction of inflammatory cytokine genes, including up-regulation of TNFα itself (Fig. 1A). Two SNARE genes of interest were selected from this screen as potential regulators of TNFα trafficking, Stx6 and Vti1b, which showed significant increases in expression at both mRNA and protein levels in response to LPS (Fig. 1A), coinciding with the onset of TNFα synthesis. The data show that Stx6 is regulated at the gene level, whereas the early (2 h) rise in Vti1b protein precedes up-regulation at the gene level, suggesting some additional degree of posttranslational regulation. Murine macrophages primed with IFN-γ followed by activation with LPS make 5-fold more TNFα and secrete >2-fold more TNFα than cells activated with LPS alone (5Shurety W. Merino-Trigo A. Brown D. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Thus, in IFN-γ-primed cells, there is more TNFα synthesized, and it is trafficked to the cell surface faster than in unprimed cells. IFN-γ-primed LPS-activated macrophages were found to produce an increase in Stx6 and Vti1b protein levels (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, in macrophages, Stx6 and Vti1b are regulated by the same signaling pathways as TNFα, and they are both up-regulated to match the need for TNFα trafficking. Stx6 and Vti1B Partially Colocalize at the Golgi and Are Part of the Same SNARE Complex—Antibodies to Stx6 and Vti1b were used to localize the endogenous proteins in macrophages. Stx6 staining was found on the perinuclear Golgi complex, where it colocalized with newly synthesized TNFα and in scattered vesicles (Fig. 2A). Some staining of Vti1b was associated with the Golgi complex, also overlapping with TNFα, whereas additional Vti1b was on endosome-like structures (Fig. 2B). The finding that both Stx6 and Vti1b are associated with the Golgi complex suggests that both may have a possible role in the secretory pathway. We next investigated the biochemical nature of SNARE complexes in activated macrophages involving these two proteins. Typically, a complete trans-SNARE complex consists of three Q-SNARE chains (Qa,b, and c) and one R-SNARE polypeptide chain (24Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation from activated macrophage extracts shows that in these cells, Vti1b is part of at least two distinct SNARE complexes (Fig. 2C). In the first, Vti1b (Qb) is able to complex with its known endosomal SNARE partner proteins Stx7 (Qa), Stx8 (Qc), and VAMP8 (R) (Fig. 2C). In the second, a novel complex, Vti1b, coimmunoprecipitates with Stx6 (Qc) and Stx7 (Qa) (Fig. 2C). A cognate R-SNARE for the Vti1b/Stx6 complex at this stage is unknown. Stx8 and VAMP8 (R) are not involved in this novel complex in macrophages (Fig. 2C). Another SNARE Vti1A (Qb) was also found to be expressed in macrophages, and it complexes with Stx6 (Qc) but not with Vti1b (Qb) as dictated by the stoichiometery of the Qa,b, and c SNARE complex. Similar complexes were also immunoprecipitated from unactivated macrophages (data not shown). Thus, Vti1b and Stx6 are components of a novel SNARE complex. Since immunostaining showed that Vti1b and Stx6 were both present in the Golgi region, this is a possible site for their interaction and function. Stx6 and Vti1B Are Found on Similar Golgi-derived Carriers to TNFα—to test the association of Vti1B and Stx6 with the Golgi complex and secretory pathway in these cells, a biochemical approach was used. We isolated a stacked Golgi fraction from extracts of LPS-treated macrophages. Both Vti1B and Stx6 recovered in Golgi fractions (Fig. 3A). Next, Golgi membranes were incubated in vitro in the presence of cytosol and GTPγs to initiate the budding of membrane carriers. As we have previously shown, this leads to the generation of a variety of Golgi-derived vesicles that can be segregated by sucrose gradient analysis (22Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Wylie F.G. Lock J.G. Jamriska L. Khromykh T. Brown D.L. Stow J.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Vti1B and Stx6 were recovered on remnant Golgi membranes and in the fraction containing total budded vesicles. These vesicles or carrier membranes were further separated on a sucrose gradient. Effective vesicle budding was demonstrated by the de novo membrane binding of the cytosolic coatomer protein β-COP and the presence of γ-adaptin in slightly different fractions (Fig. 3B). Both Vti1B and Stx6 were detected on a subset of membrane carriers budding off the Golgi, both comigrating in the same fractions as TNFα (Fig. 3B). These results show that Vti1B and Stx6 are both associated with carriers containing TNFα that bud from the Golgi complex. Thus, both SNARE proteins are in a position to influence exocytosis. Vti1B and Stx6 Function in the Exocytic Pathway—Since Vti1B and Stx6 are up-regulated in activated macrophages, form a SNARE complex, and are found in similar Golgi-derived carriers to the cargo TNFα, functional studies were performed to test whether Vti1B and Stx6 operate in the exocytic pathway in macrophages. Overexpression of full-length SNARE proteins is known to enhance their function (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of the cytoplasmic portions of these proteins is known to act as competitive inhibitors, blocking trans-SNARE complex formation and thereby inhibiting vesicle docking and fusion. The staining patterns of GFP-tagged full-length Stx6 and Vti1b resembled the endogenous proteins (Figs. 4 and 5). Transfected, LPS-activated cells were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure TNFα secretion into the medium (5Shurety W. Merino-Trigo A. Brown D. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and by immunofluorescence to measure the effect on transport of TNFα from the Golgi complex to the cell surface (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A 1.8-fold increase in TNFα secreted into the medium was recorded from GFP-Vti1b transfected cells (Fig. 4A). This coincided with an increase in TNFα trafficking to the cell surface, measured as increased cell surface staining of TNFα, in cells overexpressing full-length GFP-tagged Vti1b, as compared with surrounding untransfected cells (Fig. 4A). No effect on surface delivery was seen in cells overexpressing GFP alone (data not shown). Conversely, expressing the inhibitory cytoplasmic domain of Vti1b (GFP-Vti1b amino acids 1–234) greatly reduced cell surface delivery of TNFα in the majority of cells (Fig. 4C). Subsequent immunostaining of permeabilized, transfected macrophages revealed that TNFα was still evident at the level of the Golgi complex, indicating that its post-Golgi trafficking, but not its synthesis, had been affected (Fig. 4C). Syntaxin 2 does not play a role in TNFα secretion (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and overexpression of its cytoplasmic domain had no discernable effect on TNFα surface delivery (Fig. 4C) as a negative control. Thus, by several analyses, we demonstrated for the first time a functional role for Vti1b in the exocytic trafficking pathway. Moreover its expression is rate-limiting since increasing the levels of Vti1b enhanced the exocytosis of TNFα. The expression and function of Stx6 was similarly tested. A 1.3-fold increase in TNFα secreted into the medium was recorded in cultures overexpressing GFP-tagged Stx6 as compared with those expressing GFP-alone (Fig. 5A). Overexpression of full-length GFP-Stx6 revealed an increase in TNFα surface staining in transfected cells as compared with surrounding untransfected cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, when the inhibitory cytoplasmic domain of Stx6 (GFP-Stx6 amino acids 1–208) was expressed in activated macrophages, cell surface TNFα was dramatically reduced in the majority of cells as compared with surrounding untransfected cells (Fig. 5C). Thus, by several analyses, we demonstrated that Vti1B and Stx6 function in the post-Golgi secretory trafficking of TNFα to the cell surface in activated macrophages. Moreover its expression is also rate-limiting since increasing the levels of Stx6 at the level of the Golgi enhanced the exocytosis of TNFα.Fig. 5Stx6 functions in TNFα secretion. A, macrophages expressing either GFP-Stx6 or GFP alone were treated with LPS for 2 h; TNFα in the medium was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results of three experiments are shown in the graph along with S.E. TNFα secretion is increased in cells overexpressing GFP-Stx6 as compared with those expressing GFP alone. B, cells transiently expressing GFP-Stx6 were treated with LPS for 2 h in the presence of TACE inhibitor and immunostained to detect surface TNFα, which was then assessed on GFP-labeled cells as compared with surrounding cells. At least 50 transfected cells were analyzed in each of three different experiments. Staining consistently showed increased surface TNFα on GFP-Stx6-expressing cells. C, cells expressing the cytoplasmic domains of Stx2 and Stx6 fused to GFP were treated with LPS in the presence of TACE inhibitor for 2 h and stained for surface TNFα. More than 50 transfected cells were measured in each of three experiments, and the results are shown in the graph along with S.E. Both GFP alone and the cytoplasmic domain of Stx2 had little effect on surface TNFα staining, whereas the Stx6 cytoplasmic domain significantly reduced surface TNFα staining. aa, amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We show here a new site and a novel SNARE complex involved in the quantitative regulation of the secretory pathway in activated macrophages, providing these cells with increased capacity to generate vesicle carriers at the level of the TGN for post-Golgi transport of cytokine. In other hematopoietic cells, SNARE complexes on secretory granules mediate regulated secretion, for instance, the Stx2-SNAP-23 complex on platelet granules (26Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Stx4-SNAP-23 complex on eosinophilic granules (27Logan M.R. Lacy P. Bablitz B. Moqbel R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 109: 299-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In macrophages, cytokines are not stored for release in granules but must be newly made upon cell activation and released in a battery of small vesicular carriers leaving the TGN. Our current data show that key SNAREs at the level of the TGN together with the cell surface SNARE complex (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) are rate-limiting for cytokine secretion. Up-regulating SNAREs at both ends of the secretory pathway is thus a coordinated and essential process to increase vesicular traffic. We have shown that the intracellular Q-SNAREs Stx6 and Vti1b are regulated by the same signaling pathways as TNFα and that they are both up-regulated to match the need for TNFα trafficking. The rapid increase in protein levels implies that these SNAREs may be regulated by posttranslational mechanisms as well as at a transcriptional level, as indeed is TNFα itself (6Shurety W. Pagan J.K. Prins J.B. Stow J.L. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Anderson P. Phillips K. Stoecklin G. Kedersha N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Together with our previous findings (20Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it now appears that multiple SNARE proteins are subject to regulated expression during macrophage activation. Little is known about the regulation of SNARE expression in differentiated cells; one other study in melanocytes suggests that the expression of several SNARE proteins increases during cell differentiation, concomitant with melanosome formation and trafficking (29Wade N. Bryant N.J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19820-19827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Experimental overexpression of each protein increases TNFα surface delivery and secretion, and the timing of expression of the endogenous proteins in IFN-γ-primed macrophages appears to be tightly linked to the timing and amount of TNFα trafficking in activated macrophages. Blocking Vti1b and Stx6 function trapped TNFα in the Golgi complex, suggesting that both are required for a step in post-Golgi exocytosis. This is the first described role for Vti1b in an exocytic pathway. The similar effects obtained by manipulating either Stx6 or Vti1b are consistent with the two proteins functioning as part of the same complex in the secretory pathway. By immunoprecipitation, Stx6 and Vti1b along with Stx7 were found to form a novel Q-SNARE complex. A preliminary association of Stx7 with Stx6 and Vti1b among several other SNARE coimmunoprecipitating proteins in melanocytes has previously been noted (29Wade N. Bryant N.J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19820-19827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both Vti1b and Stx6 colocalize at the level of the Golgi, where they are associated with the same Golgi-derived carriers as those carrying the cargo TNFα. The most direct role foreseen for Vti1b/Stx6 is in the generation of TNFα carriers at the TGN; other possibilities include a role in regulating membrane recycling back to the TGN for carrier formation. Future studies will address these issues. It is widely believed that trafficking proteins such as the SNAREs perform basic housekeeping functions in the cell and as such are constitutively expressed. Here we show that individual SNARE proteins are regulated to perform specialized functions in the cell. Macrophages are unique in their requirements for stimulus-coupled, temporal secretion of cytokines. The changes in the trafficking machinery we see here now help to explain how macrophages accommodate these requirements. Increasing essential SNARE complexes facilitates vesicle fusion required for the transport of cytokine from the Golgi to the cell surface, a process that is critical to the immune response but one with negative outcomes in inflammatory disease (1Palladino M.A. Bahjat F.R. Theodorakis E.A. Moldawer L.L. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). These findings now add a new facet to the emerging knowledge that macrophages have uniquely adapted their trafficking pathways to enable dynamic roles in the immune response. Other recent and notable examples include the use of endoplasmic reticulum by the macrophage to supply additional membrane to the plasma membrane for phagosome production and to allow antigen cross-presentation to occur (30Gagnon E.

https://openalex.org/W2166475106,"Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has gained widespread use as a tool to visualize spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression in vivo. However, it is not generally accepted that GFP can also be used as a quantitative reporter of gene expression. We report that GFP is a reliable reporter of gene expression in individual eukaryotic cells when fluorescence is measured by flow cytometry. Two pieces of evidence support this conclusion: GFP fluorescence increases in direct proportion to the GFP gene copy number delivered to cells by a replication-defective adenovirus vector, Ad.CMV-GFP, and the intensity of GFP fluorescence is directly proportional to GFP mRNA abundance in cells. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the induction of GFP gene expression from two inducible promoters (i.e., the TRE and ICP0 promoters) is readily detected by flow cytometric measurement of GFP fluorescent intensity. Collectively, the results presented herein indicate that GFP fluorescence is a reliable and quantitative reporter of underlying differences in gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1973506787,We provided evidence that competitive inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases in mammalian cells treated with 3-aminobenzamide causes DNA hypermethylation in the genome and anomalous hypermethylation of CpG islands. The molecular mechanism(s) connecting poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation with DNA methylation is still unknown. Here we show that DNMT1 is able to bind long and branched ADP-ribose polymers in a noncovalent way. Binding of poly ADP-ribose on DNMT1 inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity. Co-immunoprecipitation reactions indicate that PARP1 and DNMT1 are associated in vivo and that in this complex PARP1 is present in its ADP-ribosylated isoform. We suggest that this complex is catalytically inefficient in DNA methylation.

Genetic and biochemical experiments show that, when released from the bilayer, Lyz is activated by an intramolecular thiol-disulfide isomerization, which requires a cysteine in its N-terminal SAR (signal-arrest-release) domain. Crystal structures confirm the alternative disulfide linkages in the two forms of Lyz and reveal dramatic conformational differences in the catalytic domain.

Of 15 non-ES cell-specific transcription factor genes, only one had a single pseudogene hit in our screen, emphasizing the apparent selectivity.

The expression level of all four of these genes is down-regulated coincident with ES cell differentiation, and loss of expression leads reciprocally to differentiated cell states. Beyond maintenance of pluripotency, the functional roles of these genes have not been clearly defined, and the prospective identification of other novel ES cell genes will undoubtedly contribute to this endeavor. Notably, Oct4 is detected in adult stem cells such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (7Pochampally R.R. Smith J.R. Ylostalo J. Prockop D.J. Blood. 2004; 103: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and thought to play a role in maintaining the multipotency of these cells also. Recently, 10 pseudogenes of Nanog were reported within the human genome (8Booth H.A. Holland P.W. Genomics. 2004; 84: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), likely a result of retrotransposition events. Characterized by extensive alignment and significant sequence identity with the Nanog mRNA transcript, these pseudogenes were shown to be located on multiple chromosomes. Functional relevance of the pseudogenes of Nanog remains undetermined, although they appear not to be expressed as transcripts in human ES cells (8Booth H.A. Holland P.W. Genomics. 2004; 84: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).In the present study, we identified extensive retrotransposition as a potential signature event of ES cell-specific genes. Of the four known ES cell-specific genes, we found that Nanog, Oct4, and Stella, each possess multiple pseudogenes. Our data suggest that retrotransposition frequency of ES cell-specific genes far exceeds that of non-ES cell-specific genes. Moreover, we propose that this “pseudogene signature” may prove useful in identifying novel ES cell-specific genes in future.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe basic local alignment sequence tool (BLAST) 1The abbreviations used are: BLAST, basic local alignment sequence tool; EST, expressed sequence tag. was used to compare the cDNA of Nanog, Oct4, Stella, and GDF3 with the NCBI human genome data base (9Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar). An E value limit was set to 1 × 10–4 for these searches. BLAST was used to generate a map depicting alignments of the pseudogenes to the parent genes. cDNA sequences of transcription factors, critical to the phenotypes of pancreatic β cells and skeletal muscle cells, were screened against the human genome in a similar BLAST search. The Ensembl genome browser was used to confirm all blast hits and was used to create a map showing the chromosomal locations of the hits for Nanog, Oct4, and Stella.For a given set of pseudogene sequences, a BLASTable data base was created using formatdb. A BLAST search was then run to compare the original gene sequence against the pseudogene, with the default BLAST parameters, except for an E value cutoff of 1 × 10–5. The results of the search were run through an in-house developed tool to transform the results into an image, allowing the user to view the lengths and positions of all high scoring pairs, relative to the query sequence. This tool was built using open source BioJava tools for handling the BLAST data and the Batik toolkit for generating the images.Vista and BLAST were employed to identify sequence alignments between chromosome 12p13 and chromosome 6 of the human genome. Sequence homologies ≥80% and at least 1000 base pairs in length were selected for further analysis. The Celera genome browser was used to identify these sequences. One million base pairs of DNA segment at chromosome 12p13 was investigated. The computer program Repeat-masker was applied on the sequence to mask out the repeat sequences. Then the masked sequence was split into 3000-bp units and BLASTed against the human chromosome 6 to look for homologous segments. The filter criteria was set for homolog search to 200 base pairs, with 95% identity. All segments that matched the criteria were further filtered by NCBI Refseq to remove known genes. Finally, the public human EST data base was searched for evidence of expression, as was the Entrez nucleotides data base.RESULTSFour human ES cell-specific genes have been identified to date, such that their expression is strictly required to maintain the phenotype of ES cells (2Nichols J.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nanog, Oct4, Stella, and GDF3 have been characterized as genes, whose function is known to maintain pluripotency. We observed by BLAST analysis that three of these four genes possess multiple, highly conserved pseudogenes that are dispersed throughout the human genome (Fig. 1). Briefly, mRNA transcript sequences of these genes were individually BLASTed against the NCBI human genome data base, and multiple hits were generated that were identified as pseudogenes for Nanog, Oct4, and Stella. Hits that represented the parent genes contained the expected intron/exon gene organization, but all other sequences were contiguous, such that the conserved alignments reflected the mRNA transcript sequence rather than the genomic sequence. This provided strong evidence that these conserved sequences likely resulted from retrotransposition events. We observed no conserved hits for GDF3 within the limits of experimental stringency. As a control experiment, we searched for pseudogenes using mRNA sequences of a selection of distinct cell type-specific genes. Specifically, we focused on genes that encoded transcription factors critical for the functional development of skeletal muscle or pancreatic islet cells. Of the 15 genes tested, only one generated a single hit (Fig. 1), implying that the extensive occurrence of retrotransposition in ES cells confers a selective advantage.The BLAST program was used to create a map of relative alignment of the pseudogenes for each ES cell-specific gene (Fig. 2). Notably, certain regions of the Nanog transcript were highly conserved among pseudogenes, whereas other regions were less conserved. Specifically, the Nanog coding region, spanning positions 217–1134 of the mRNA transcript (Fig. 2A), was found in 70% of the pseudogenes with sequence identity conserved at ∼90% or greater. In contrast, the 3′-untranslated region of the Nanog mRNA appeared to have undergone significant sequence degradation, although sufficient identity remained to confirm its initial transposition. Pseudogene 8, located on chromosome 15 showed greatest similarity to Nanog, while pseudogenes 3, 6, and 11 displayed the least identity.Fig. 2Pseudogene alignments with parent gene mRNA transcripts.A–C, pseudogene sequence alignments of Nanog (A), Oct4 (B), and Stella (C).

Interestingly, pseudogene 3 was found to be located on chromosome 12p13 of the human genome. This locus is significant as it also harbors the Nanog, Stella, and GDF3 parent genes (Fig. 3 (10Clark A.T. Rodriguez R.T. Bodnar M.S. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar)). The BLAST hit for this Oct4 pseudogene equated with an E value of 0, indicating that the random chance of such a sequence match within the genome is insignificant. Moreover, this pseudogene contained the entire coding region of Oct4 with a sequence identity of 94%. The exact location of this Oct4 pseudogene was traced to a position within an intron of another gene, designated CLECSF6, between exons 3 and 4. CLECSF6 is a member of the C-type lectin/C-type lectin-like domain (CTL/CTLD) superfamily. Astonishingly, Nanog, Stella, GDF3, and Oct4 pseudogene 3 collectively span 445 kb of human genomic sequence, which represents a region of only 1/10,000 of the entire human genome (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Location of ES cell-specific genes on human chromosome 12p13. All of the transcription factors currently known to maintain pluripotency of ES cells can be mapped to the human chromosome 12p13. Oct4 pseudogene 3 maps to the intronic sequence of CLECSF6. Additional genes at this locus are indicated alphabetically. a, APOBEC1; b, CLECSF7; c, SLC2A14; d, SLC2A3; e, FHX; f, C3AR1; g, CLECSF6. The asterisk represents the 387-bp sequence that mapped with chromosome 6 with >90% identity. CLECSF6 is expanded below to show numbered exons (1–6) and the Oct4 pseudogene located within intron 3. This entire sequence spans ∼500 kb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Through analysis of the mouse genome, we also found that an Oct4 pseudogene was located in the same locus as Nanog, Stella, and GDF3 on chromosome 6. Moreover, the relative positional order of these genes was conserved between the mouse and human genomes. By BLASTing the EST data base we found that this mouse pseudogene is likely transcribed, as an exact sequence hit was generated (data not shown). This suggests that the mouse oct4 pseudogene, which colocalizes with Nanog, Stella, and GDF3 is transcriptionally functional.Our search for Stella pseudogenes generated 16 hits with remarkable sequence homology (Fig. 2C). Chromosomes 14 and X contain Stella-like genes with predicted expression. The parent Stella gene on chromosome 12 contains 97% sequence homology with a 1058-bp region on chromosome 14 and 96% homology with a 1068-bp region on chromosome X. Moreover, the GNOMON gene prediction method predicts that this region on chromosome X corresponds to a gene whose cDNA consists of 482 base pairs, and the region on chromosome 14 contains a Stella-like gene whose cDNA consists of 589 base pairs.A preliminary effort to determine whether additional pseudogene-related sequences exist within Ch12p13 was carried out. We blasted a region of one million nucleotides of this locus against the entire length of chromosome 6. Chromosome 6 was selected because it appeared from previous searches to represent a preferred retrotransposition target. Besides the expected hits described previously, this screen yielded a conserved 387-bp region of >90% identity between these two chromosomes (Fig. 3). This same sequence was also shown to display significant homology with another genomic region on chromosome 9 and also mapped to eight publically available ESTs. Within chromosome 12p13, this 387-bp sequence was located proximal to DKFP566B183, a gene of unknown function. Further analysis confirmed that the actual source of the sequence was the gene elongation factor 1α (eEF-1α) on human chromosome 6. Notably, this gene was previously identified to have undergone extensive retrotransposition to form multiple pseudogenes within human, mouse, and pig genomes (11Madsen H.O. Poulsen K. Dahl O. Clark B.F. Hjorth J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1513-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Lund A. Knudsen S.M. Vissing H. Clark B. Tommerup N. Genomics. 1996; 36: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)DISCUSSIONWe report the existence of multiple pseudogenes for three of the four known markers of pluripotency, Nanog, Oct4, and Stella. The evident frequency of germ line-transduced retrotransposition of these genes is extensive, relative to that of non-ES cell-specific genes (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the degree of sequence conservation to the parent genes suggest functional utility and possible evolutionary implications. For example, Nanog pseudogenes 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10 appear to have retained extensive homology within the Nanog coding region but show significant degeneration of sequence identity in peripheral sequences such as the 3′-untranslated region of the parent mRNA sequence. Whether these inconsistencies are related to the age of retrotransposition events, to the susceptibility of the respective loci to sequence degradation, or to advantages in evolutionary selection remains to be defined.A rational explanation for the surprising frequency of ES cell-specific pseodogenes may be drawn from lessons in developmental biology. It is assumed that retrotransposition of a transcript may only result in a bona fide pseudogene if the “event” cell subsequently contributes to the germ line. Note that within this paradigm, the event cell denotes a cell in which a retrotransposition event occurs. Importantly, the probability of contribution to the germ line is greatly enhanced when the event cell is an ES cell (ES-event cell) or a germ lineage cell. As ES cells are known contributors to the germ cell lineage (1Geijsen N. Horoschak M. Kim K. Gribnau J. Eggan K. Daley G.Q. Nature. 2004; 427: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and given that they exist at the earliest developmental stages, the probability of an ES-event cell contributing to the germ line far exceeds that at later stages of development. Notably, within this relatively permissive environment of the blastocyst, the ES-event cell expresses genes including Nanog, Oct4, and Stella at relatively high levels. Therefore, the probability of these genes contributing to a retrotransposition event is relatively high. We propose that our data support this hypothesis such that ES cell-specific genes are more susceptible to retrotransposition and subsequent pseudogene generation than are somatic cell-specific genes. That this disparate distribution of psuedogenes is observed in favor of ES cell-specific genes is suggestive of retrotransposition being the most likely mechanism rather than chromosomal rearrangement. This is because a process of gene duplication by chromosomal rearrangement would likely not be selective for ES cell-specific genes. More importantly, all of the sequences we identified in this study were intron-less with respect to the parent gene, providing convincing evidence that the pseudogenes originated from retrotransposition events.Nanog, Stella, GDF3, and an Oct4 pseudogene all map to a region of 445,088 base pairs on chromosome 12p13. This region represents only 0.01% of the genome, reflecting an impressive concentration of clustered ES cell-specific genes. A potential advantage of such localization can be hypothesized given the simultaneous regulation pattern of these genes. Moreover, a mechanism of epigenetic regulation would be consistent with their common function, to maintain ES cell pluripotency. Recently, it was demonstrated that DNA methylation status is closely linked to the chromatin structure of the Oct4 gene and that this epigenetic mechanism plays a functional role in the developmental stage- and cell type-specific expression of Oct4 (13Hattori N. Nishino K. Ko Y.G. Hattori N. Ohgane J. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17063-17069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Whether the Ch12p13 hotspot for ES cell-specific genes is also epigenetically regulated remains to be determined. We observed that a similar gene localization pattern is found in the mouse genome, whereby Nanog, Stella, GDF3, and an Oct4 pseudogene map to chromosome 6 with the same relative orientation as in human. Notably, the NCBI data base predicts that the mouse Oct4 pseudogene is actively expressed. Given that this equivalent pseudogene appears to exist in the human and mouse genomes, we surmise that the appearance of this pseudogene occurred prior to the evolutionary diversification of mouse and human, and the fact that these inter-species sequences remain conserved to such a degree, suggests functionality and evolutionary relevance.Nanog, Oct4, and Stella were initially identified as ES cell-specific genes by observations that their expression was significantly down-regulated during ES cell differentiation. In fact, restricted expression analysis is currently the primary method to identify genes that are essential for ES cell specificity. We suggest that a novel method for identifying ES cell-specific genes may emerge from our observation that these genes in particular are predisposed to retrotransposition. Specifically, we hypothesize that intra-genome BLASTing may identify regions of sequence homology and, with appropriate filtering mechanisms, aid in the search for novel ES cell-specific factors. In a preliminary study, we identified a ∼400 base pair region on human chromosome 6 with >90% identity to a sequence within chromosome 12p13. Further analysis revealed that this sequence derived from the human eEF-1α, previously identified as the origin of multiple retropseudogenes. In fact, retropseudogenes have been shown to constitute the major part of the human eEF-1α gene family (11Madsen H.O. Poulsen K. Dahl O. Clark B.F. Hjorth J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1513-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was determined that the derivation of eEF-1α retropseudogenes in Xenopus laevis was generated from germ cell-specific expression of the parent gene (14Abdallah B. Hourdry J. Krieg P.A. Denis H. Mazabraud A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9277-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), consistent with our findings and proposed hypothesis.Two recent studies recently exemplified the process of retrotransposition in embryonic cells, based on lineage tracing of retrotransposition events in transgenic mice (15Ostertag E.M. DeBerardinis R.J. Goodier J.L. Zhang Y. Yang N. Gerton G.L. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Prak E.T. Dodson A.W. Farkash E.A. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1832-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Notably, in both cases, retrotransposition occurred at a very early stage in the development of the founder mice and displayed high frequency of chromosome-to-chromosome retrotransposition within the male germ line of these animals. Consistent with our observations in the present study, these data further validate our theory.Finally, it is well established that retrotranscription correlates with genomic evolution (17Devor E.J. Moffat-Wilson K.A. Hum. Biol. 2003; 75: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Creation of new genes with new functions arise predominantly via retrotransposition and chromosomal rearrangements. The implication for retrotransposition of embryonic genes such as Nanog, Oct4, and Stella, in an evolutionary context, is an attractive notion. Further efforts to annotate these retropseudogenes and determine their functional relevance will reveal whether such an evolutionary mechanism is apparent. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent and able to differentiate into all cell types of the body, including germ cells (1Geijsen N. Horoschak M. Kim K. Gribnau J. Eggan K. Daley G.Q. Nature. 2004; 427: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Identifying the molecular determinants by which pluripotency is maintained is a critical persuit that will ultimately result in expediting therapeutic application. To date, four transcription factors have been identified that exhibit essential roles in maintenance of the pluripotent state. These are Oct4 (2Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H.

Among the members of the upregulated gene set was the developmental transcription factor Homeobox C6 (HOXC6). Silencing of HOXC6 expression using small-interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in decreased proliferation rates for both androgen-dependent LnCaP cells and the LnCaP-derived androgen-independent C4-2 cell line. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting for the caspase-cleaved form of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) determined that the decrease in cell numbers was due to increased apoptosis. To validate the specificity of the siRNA-induced apoptosis, LnCaP cells were cotransfected with siRNA specific to the HOXC6 3′UTR and a mammalian expression vector containing the HOXC6 open reading frame, but lacking the 3′UTR. Overexpression of HOXC6 rescued the LnCaP cells from HOXC6 siRNA-induced apoptosis, and increased growth of control GFP siRNA-transfected cells. Expression profiling of HOXC6 siRNA transfections and HOXC6 overexpression identified neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) as potential proapoptotic repression targets of HOXC6. Our data suggest that HOXC6 may be a novel potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer."

In this study, we used directed evolution and selection in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27 to find thermostable variants of a bleomycin-binding protein from the mesophilic bacterium Streptoalloteichus hindustanus. In a single selection round, we identified eight clones bearing five types of double mutated genes that provided T. thermophilus transformants with bleomycin resistance at 77 °C, while the wild-type gene could only do so up to 65 °C. Only six different amino acid positions were altered, three of which were glycine residues. All variant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and analyzed biochemically for thermal stability and functionality at high temperature. A synthetic mutant resistance gene with low GC content was designed that combined four substitutions. The encoded protein showed up to 17 °C increased thermostability and unfolded at 85 °C in the absence of bleomycin, whereas in its presence the protein unfolded at 100 °C. Despite these highly thermophilic properties, this mutant was still able to function normally at mesophilic temperatures in vivo. The mutant protein was co-crystallized with bleomycin, and the structure of the binary complex was determined to a resolution of 1.5 Å. Detailed structural analysis revealed possible molecular mechanisms of thermostabilization and enhanced antibiotic binding, which included the introduction of an intersubunit hydrogen bond network, improved hydrophobic packing of surface indentations, reduction of loop flexibility, and α-helix stabilization.

The potential applicability of the thermostable selection marker is discussed. Despite the vast amount of protein sequences and structures from microorganisms that grow optimally at temperatures above 80 °C, improving the thermal stability of a protein is still a challenging task. This is mainly because the laws governing protein stability are not easily extracted because they are highly variable and complex (1Arnold F.H. Wintrode P.L. Miyazaki K. Gershenson A. Trends Biochem.

It seems generally accepted that the extreme stability of certain natural proteins results from the cumulative effect of small adaptations in protein architecture and amino acid composition.

A. 1998; 95: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) can be applied very successfully when carefully designed on the basis of a high resolution crystal structure. However, in many cases atomic resolution three-dimensional information of a protein is unavailable. Directed evolution approaches, by contrast, do not require any structural information and commonly rely on random mutagenesis and recombination followed by screening or selection schemes (1Arnold F.H. Wintrode P.L. Miyazaki K. Gershenson A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 100-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 6Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Thermostability screens of mutant libraries are usually carried out by applying a thermal challenge at nonpermissive temperatures after which the remaining functionality of the individual clones is tested (7Giver L. Gershenson A. Freskgard P.O. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12809-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 8Palackal N. Brennan Y. Callen W.N. Dupree P. Frey G.

Steer B.A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To explore sufficient sequence space requires the testing of large numbers of mutant clones, which necessitates high throughput approaches such as the use of robotics. Conversely efficient selection procedures allow the testing of a large set of variants while reducing the effort of finding improved ones to a minimum. A convenient selection system for finding protein variants in a library with improved thermostability is based on in vivo screening in a thermophilic expression host. Cloning and selection in thermophilic microorganisms such as Geobacillus stearothermophilus (30-60 °C) or Thermus thermophilus (50-80 °C) mimic natural evolution but are only applicable when the gene of interest encodes a protein that is of biological relevance to growth or survival of the host organism (9Liao H. McKenzie T. Hageman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10Tamakoshi M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The selective pressure can be fine tuned by raising the temperature of growth, enabling only hosts that bear thermoadapted variants to grow on solid media. For instance, a combination of in vitro mutagenesis methods and in vivo selection schemes have led to a highly thermostable kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase gene that is able to function at temperatures up to 79 °C (11Hoseki J. Yano T. Koyama Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Such mutant selection markers have permitted the development of genetic tools that are very useful in the study of gene-function relationships in thermophilic bacteria (12Friedrich A. Prust C. Hartsch T. Henne A. Averhoff B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast to thermophiles (optimum temperature for growth, 60-80 °C), antibiotic-based genetic systems for hyperthermophilic bacteria and Archaea (optimum temperature for growth, >80 °C) are still in their infancy. This is primarily due to the absence of thermostable antibiotics and their corresponding resistance factors because most known antibiotic-producing microorganisms are mesophilic bacteria and fungi. Often the common antibiotics cannot be used because many of them are unstable at high temperatures, or hyperthermophiles are simply insensitive to them (13Noll K.M. Vargas M. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The glycopeptide bleomycin is an exception since it is a highly thermostable molecule and effective against many aerobic microorganisms and eukaryotic cell lines (14Gatignol A. Durand H. Tiraby G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Sugiyama M. Kumagai T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The bleomycin family of antibiotics, including phleomycin and tallysomycin, are DNA- and RNA-cleaving glycopeptides that are produced by the actinomycetes Streptoalloteichus hindustanus and Streptomyces verticillus. As little as a few hundred bleomycin molecules can effectively kill aerobic cells (16Poddevin B. Orlowski S. Belehradek Jr., J. Mir L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: S67-S75Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For this reason, bleomycin is currently clinically used as an antitumor agent against squamous cell carcinomas and malignant lymphomas (17Sikic B.I. Cancer Surv. 1986; 5: 81-91PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance against bleomycin-like antibiotics is conferred by N-acetylation, deamidation, and sequestration of the molecule (15Sugiyama M. Kumagai T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The latter mechanism involves bleomycin-binding proteins (BBPs), 1The abbreviations used are: BBP, bleomycin-binding protein; Shble, BBP from S. hindustanus; BlmA, BBP from S. verticillus; BlmT, BBP from transposon Tn5; BlmS, BBP from plasmid pUB110; HTS, high temperature Shble; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry.1The abbreviations used are: BBP, bleomycin-binding protein; Shble, BBP from S. hindustanus; BlmA, BBP from S. verticillus; BlmT, BBP from transposon Tn5; BlmS, BBP from plasmid pUB110; HTS, high temperature Shble; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry. which have been found only in mesophilic bacteria. Two proteins, Shble and BlmA, provide self-immunity for bleomycin producers S. hindustanus and S. verticillus, respectively (14Gatignol A. Durand H. Tiraby G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Sugiyama M. Thompson C.J. Kumagai T. Suzuki K. Deblaere R. Villarroel R. Davies J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and may be involved the transport and excretion of the molecule (19Dumas P. Bergdoll M. Cagnon C. Masson J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2483-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two genes, blmT and blmS, are located on the Klebsiella pneumoniae transposon Tn5 (20Genilloud O. Garrido M.C. Moreno F. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and on the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB110 (21Semon D. Movva N.R. Smith T.F. el Alama M. Davies J. Plasmid. 1987; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), respectively. All four proteins are highly negatively charged cytoplasmic proteins of around 14 kDa that form homodimers that bind two positively charged antibiotic molecules at a hydrophobic subunit interface cleft (19Dumas P. Bergdoll M. Cagnon C. Masson J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2483-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Maruyama M. Kumagai T. Matoba Y. Hayashida M. Fujii T. Hata Y. Sugiyama M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2311-2320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The small protein size and the wide applicability of the drug have made both shble and blmT popular dominant selection markers in vector systems for lower and higher eukaryotes, bacteria, and halophilic Archaea (15Sugiyama M. Kumagai T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Drocourt D. Calmels T. Reynes J.P. Baron M. Tiraby G.

J. 2000; 346: 251-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether we could thermostabilize Shble and BlmS to allow for their application in aerobic thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. In this study, we performed directed evolution using selection in the thermophilic bacterium T. thermophilus and obtained various mutant proteins that could operate under highly thermophilic growth conditions. Their enhanced performance at high temperature was analyzed biochemically, and possible stabilizing effects were identified. All chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma. Primers were obtained from MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). Polymerase chain reactions were performed with Pfu TURBO (Stratagene) unless stated otherwise. Bleomycin A2 (Bleocin, Calbiochem) was used for all selections. Escherichia coli HB101 (F-hsdS20 (rB-, mB-) ara-14 galK2 lacY1 leuB6 mcrB mtl-1 proA2 recA13 rpsL20 supE44 thi-1 xyl-5 (StrR)) (26Boyer H.W. Rouland-Dussoix R. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2569) Google Scholar) was used for cloning purposes and routinely transformed by electroporation. Generation of a Bleomycin-based Shuttle Vector—Bacillus subtilis 168 8G5 carrying pUB110 was kindly provided by Dr. S. Bron (University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands), and the plasmid was isolated by Qiagen Miniprep according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blmS gene was PCR-amplified with primers BG1407 (sense, 5′-GGAGGTGCATATGAGAATGTTACAGTCTATCCC-3′) and BG1240 (antisense, 5′-CGCGTCTAGATTAGCTTTTTATTTGTTGAAAAAAG-3′) (NdeI and XbaI sites are underlined). Chromosomal DNA of S. hindustanus (ATCC 31158) was prepared according to standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used for PCR amplification of the shble gene with primers BG1410 (sense, 5′-TGAGGCATATGGCCAAGTTGACCAGTGCCG-3′) and BG1411 (antisense, 5′-GATCCTCTAGATTAGTCCTGCTCCTCGGCCACG-3′) (NdeI and XbaI sites are underlined). PCR products were digested and ligated into E. coli-T. thermophilus shuttle vector pMK18 (28de Grado M. Castan P. Berenguer J. Plasmid. 1999; 42: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Biotools, Madrid, Spain) thereby replacing the kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase gene. Ligation mixtures were transformed into E. coli HB101, and transformants were plated on 1.5% LB agar plates supplemented with 3 μg/ml bleomycin. Both blmS and shble provided resistance against the antibiotic, giving rise to the 4434-bp plasmid pWUR111 and the 4404-bp plasmid pWUR112, respectively. Mutant Library Construction—Error-prone PCR was carried out using two different polymerases, namely Taq (Amersham Biosciences) and Mutazyme (Genemorph kit, Stratagene). This approach was chosen to complement the transition and transversion bias of each enzyme to provide a more complete mutational spectrum of the PCR product. For the error-prone amplification, flanking primers BG1412 (sense, 5′-CGACCCTTAAGGAGGTGTGAGGCATATG-3′) and BG1408 (antisense, 5′-CGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGATTA-3′) (NdeI and XbaI sites are underlined) were designed to allow variation throughout the entire coding sequence between the start and stop codon (indicated in boldface). Taq polymerase-based PCRs were performed as described previously (29Shafikhani S. Siegel R.A. Ferrari E. Schellenberger V. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A 50-μl PCR contained 5 ng of pWUR112, 5 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dATP and dGTP, 1 mm dCTP and dTTP, 5 units of polymerase, 3 mm MgCl2, and three concentrations of MnCl2 (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mm). The mixture was thermocycled as follows: 95 °C (4 min); 30 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (45 s), and 72 °C (25 s); and postdwelled for 4 min at 72 °C. Mutazyme PCRs were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and thermocycled as above using an elongation time of 50 s. Randomly mutated PCR products were cloned into vector pMK18 and transformed into E. coli HB101. A total of ∼10,000 Taq- and 10,000 Mutazyme-derived clones were resuspended in 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with antibiotic and grown in 1 liter of medium to early stationary phase. Plasmids were subsequently harvested using a Miniprep plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen). Selection in T. thermophilus—T. thermophilus HB27 was kindly provided by Dr. J. Berenguer (Autonomous University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain). Cells were routinely cultivated at 70 °C in a Ca2+-(3.9 mm) and Mg2+ (1.9 mm)-rich medium (28de Grado M. Castan P. Berenguer J. Plasmid. 1999; 42: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) containing 8 g/liter tryptone, 4 g/liter yeast extract, and 3 g/liter NaCl dissolved in Evian mineral water (pH 7.7, after autoclaving) (Evian-les-Bains, France). Transformation of T. thermophilus was essentially performed by the method of Koyama (30Koyama Y. Hoshino T. Tomizuka N. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 338-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen cell aliquots were resuspended in 25 ml of medium and grown at 150 rpm to an A600 of 0.8. The culture was then diluted 1:1 in preheated medium and incubated for another hour. Next plasmids were added to 0.5 ml of culture, and the mixture was incubated for 2-3 h at 70 °C with occasional shaking before being plated on 3% agar plates (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin or 15 μg/ml bleomycin (Calbiochem) for selection. Colonies appeared within 36 h at 60-70 °C. At temperatures above 70 °C, 1% Gelrite plates (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) were used supplemented with 100 μg/ml kanamycin or 20 μg/ml bleomycin for selection. Colonies were grown overnight in liquid medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin or 5 μg/ml bleomycin. T. thermophilus plasmid DNA was prepared using a plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen) after a preincubation with 2 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 37 °C. Gene Cloning, Overexpression, and Protein Purification—Wild-type and double mutant shble genes were PCR-amplified from their respective pWUR112 plasmids using primers BG1503 (sense, 5′-GATGGCCATGGCCAAGTTGACCAGTGC-3′) and BG1504 (antisense, 5′-GCCGCAAGCTTAGTCCTGCTCCTCGGCC-3′) (NcoI and HindIII sites are underlined). PCR products were cloned into vector pET26b (Novagen) and fused to an Erwinia carotovora pectate lyase (pelB) signal sequence allowing periplasmic protein overexpression in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Periplasmic fractions of 1-liter cultures were prepared by osmotic shock according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Samples were loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/50 column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a 1 m NaCl gradient. Shble-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against a 10 mm NaPi buffer (pH 7.0) supplemented with 50 mm NaCl and subsequently purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Synthetic Gene Construction—A synthetic mutant shble gene based on archaeal codon usage was constructed by oligonucleotide assembly PCR (31Stemmer W.P. Crameri A. Ha K.D. Brennan T.M. Heyneker H.L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). This gene contains the point mutations G18E, D32V, L63Q, and G98V and has a GC content of 40.8% compared with 70.2% of wild-type shble. The synthetic gene was designated HTS (high temperature Shble). The sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AY780486. Assembly PCR mixtures contained 10 oligonucleotides (BG1542-BG1451, Supplemental Table 1) with an overlap of 20 bases. Both flanking primers were 40 bases in length, whereas the eight central primers consisted of 80-90 bases. The assembly PCR mixture contained a 2.5 μm concentration of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.05 units/μl Pfu polymerase. The mixture was thermocycled at 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (60 s) for 40 cycles. The PCR products were purified over a PCR purification column (Qiagen) and diluted 1:1 in fresh PCR mixture containing only both flanking primers BG1542 and BG1551 at 0.1 μm concentration and were thermocycled according to standard procedures. PCR products of the expected size were isolated from an agarose gel using the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with NdeI and BglII, and cloned into vector pET26b. This allowed for efficient cytoplasmic protein overproduction in E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL (Novagen). Positive clones were picked from LB agar plates containing 3 μg/ml bleomycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A 4-liter culture was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubated for another 5 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and sonicated. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation (30 min at 26,500 × g at 4 °C) and applied to a 70-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange column. Proteins were eluted by a 1 m NaCl gradient, and HTS-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated over a YM10 filter (Amicon) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography as described above. DNA Sequencing—Inserts of plasmids used in this study were sequenced by Westburg Genomics (Wageningen, The Netherlands). Protein Quantitation—Protein concentrations were determined by using a Bradford assay (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad). Purified proteins were quantified from A280 measurements using a protein extinction coefficient of 29,000 m-1 cm-1 (33Rondeau J.M. Cagnon C. Moras D. Masson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 645-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). DNA Protection Assay—Protein functionality assays were essentially performed as described elsewhere (14Gatignol A. Durand H. Tiraby G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) using a 10-fold excess molar concentration of protein over bleomycin A2 (Calbiochem). In each assay, 0.2 μg of PstI-linearized plasmid, pUC19, was used. Assays were performed by first incubating DNA and protein shortly at 85 °C after which bleomycin A2, dithiothreitol, and Fe2+ were sequentially added to the reaction mixture. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD experiments were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a PTC-348WI Peltier temperature control system. Far-UV CD measurements were conducted with Suprasil quartz cuvettes (Hellma Benelux, Rijswijk, The Netherlands) with a 1-mm cell length. During all experiments, the sample cell chamber was purged by dry N2 gas at a flow rate of 10 liters/min. In temperature-induced unfolding experiments, the cuvette containing a 1.7 μm concentration of protein sample in degassed 10 mm NaPi (pH 7.0) and 50 mm NaCl was heated from 25 to 95 °C at 0.4 °C/min and subsequently cooled to 25 °C at the same rate. The ellipticity at 205 nm was measured every 0.5 °C with a 2-s response time to monitor the loss of β-sheet and β-turn secondary structure elements. The bandwidth of the measurement was set to 1.0 nm, and the sensitivity was set to 100 millidegrees. Data were corrected for the temperature-dependent ellipticity of a blank without protein. Averaged data of two independent scans were fit according to a two-state model of unfolding, and the apparent temperature unfolding midpoint (Tm) was derived from van't Hoff plots. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence experiments were performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian, Middelburg, The Netherlands) equipped with a four-cuvette Peltier multicell holder and PCB-150 waterbath. All measurements were performed in 3-ml Suprasil quartz cuvettes (Hellma Benelux) with a 1-cm path length. A magnetic stirring bar ensured a homogeneous sample temperature. The temperature of the sample was recorded by a temperature probe inside one of the four samples. Spectra and thermal unfolding curves were recorded of 1.7 μm protein solutions in degassed 10 mm NaPi (pH 7.0) buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaCl. Tryptophans were excited at 295 nm, and fluorescence was recorded from 300 to 550 nm with both the excitation and the emission slits set to 5 nm. During temperature-induced unfolding and refolding studies, fluorescence emission intensities were monitored at 315 nm from 27 to 92 °C at a heating and cooling rate of 0.4 °C/min. Data were corrected for the fluorescence emission of corresponding blank solutions. Data of two independent scans were treated and fit as described above. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—DSC measurements were performed on a Microcal III system (Setaram, Caluire, France). Degassed protein samples of 0.28 mg/ml (20 μm) in 10 mm NaPi (pH 7.0) and 50 mm NaCl in the presence and absence of an 8-fold molar excess of bleomycin A2 were heated from 20 to 120 °C at 0.5 °C/min. Midpoint temperatures of unfolding were determined by curved base-line analysis from two independent scans. Protein Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—The HTS protein was extensively dialyzed against 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, and was subsequently crystallized using the sitting drop method of vapor diffusion at 20 °C and a protein concentration of 3.3 mg/ml in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of bleomycin A2 HCl (Calbiochem). Crystals grew optimally using 2.0 m ammonium sulfate as the precipitant in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6. Data were collected from a single flash frozen native crystal (100 K) to 1.5-Å resolution using a MAR345 imaging plate at the Protein Structure Factory beamline BL14.2 of the Free University of Berlin at the BESSY synchrotron source (Berlin, Germany). All data were reduced with DENZO and SCALEPACK (34Otwinowski A. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). The crystal used for data collection had unit cell parameters of a = 44.0 Å, b = 66.6 Å, and c = 47.2 Å and β = 117.4° and belonged to space group P21 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure of HTS was determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (35Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4135) Google Scholar) and the S. verticillus BlmA dimer (Protein Data Bank code 1JIE) (23Sugiyama M. Kumagai T. Hayashida M. Maruyama M. Matoba Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2311-2320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as the search model. The initial phases were improved using the free atom refinement method together with automatic model tracing in ARP/wARP (36Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Translation, libration, and screw rotation (TLS) parameters were determined, and TLS-restrained refinement was performed using REFMAC (37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13811) Google Scholar). Several rounds of iterative model building and refinement followed, and water molecules were added using ARP/wARP (36Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). The final model (comprising 241 amino acids, 288 water molecules, two bleomycin molecules, and three sulfate ions), refined using data between 30- and 1.5-Å resolution, has an R- and free R-factor of 17.4 and 19.4%, respectively, with good geometry. Residues Met-1, Glu-122, Gln-123, and Asp-124 in chain A and Met-1, Gln-123, and Asp-124 in chain B are not visible in the electron density map and therefore have been excluded from the model. Additionally the side chains of two residues in chain A (Asp-36 and Arg-87), four side chains in chain B (Glu-21, Asp-36, Arg-87, and Glu-122), and the γ-aminopropyldimethylsulfonium moiety of bleomycin have been truncated in the final model. The stereochemical quality of the model and the model fit to the diffraction data were analyzed with the programs PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and SFCHECK (39Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The coordinates and experimental structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1XRK. Figures were prepared with Swiss-PDBviewer version 3.7 SP5 (40Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar) and rendered with POV-Ray version 3.6. Randomly mutated shble genes were introduced in the E. coli-T. thermophilus shuttle vector pMK18 under the control of the promoter of the surface layer protein A (slpA) from T. thermophilus HB8 (41Fernandez-Herrero L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2087688041,"The androgen receptor (AR) dynamically assembles and disassembles multicomponent receptor complexes in order to respond rapidly and reversibly to fluctuations in androgen levels. We are interested in identifying the basal factors that compose the AR aporeceptor and holoreceptor complexes and impact the transcriptional process. Using tandem mass spectroscopy analysis, we identified the trimeric DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex as the major AR-interacting proteins. AR directly interacts with both Ku70 and Ku80 in vivo and in vitro, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and Sf9 cell/baculovirus expression. The interaction was localized to the androgen receptor ligand binding domain and is independent of DNA interactions. Ku interacts with AR in the cytoplasm and nucleus regardless of the presence or absence of androgen. Ku acts as a coactivator of AR activity in a luciferase reporter assay employing both Ku-defective cells and Ku small interfering RNA knock-down in a prostate cancer cell line. DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) also acts as a coactivator of androgen receptor activity in a luciferase reporter assay employing DNA-PKcs defective cells. AR nuclear translocation is not affected in Ku defective cells, implying Ku functionality may be mainly nuclear. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both Ku70 and Ku80 interact with the prostate-specific antigen promoter in an androgen-dependant manner. Finally, in vitro transcription assays demonstrated Ku involvement in transcriptional recycling with androgen dependent promoters. The androgen receptor (AR) dynamically assembles and disassembles multicomponent receptor complexes in order to respond rapidly and reversibly to fluctuations in androgen levels. We are interested in identifying the basal factors that compose the AR aporeceptor and holoreceptor complexes and impact the transcriptional process. Using tandem mass spectroscopy analysis, we identified the trimeric DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex as the major AR-interacting proteins. AR directly interacts with both Ku70 and Ku80 in vivo and in vitro, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and Sf9 cell/baculovirus expression. The interaction was localized to the androgen receptor ligand binding domain and is independent of DNA interactions. Ku interacts with AR in the cytoplasm and nucleus regardless of the presence or absence of androgen. Ku acts as a coactivator of AR activity in a luciferase reporter assay employing both Ku-defective cells and Ku small interfering RNA knock-down in a prostate cancer cell line. DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) also acts as a coactivator of androgen receptor activity in a luciferase reporter assay employing DNA-PKcs defective cells. AR nuclear translocation is not affected in Ku defective cells, implying Ku functionality may be mainly nuclear. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both Ku70 and Ku80 interact with the prostate-specific antigen promoter in an androgen-dependant manner. Finally, in vitro transcription assays demonstrated Ku involvement in transcriptional recycling with androgen dependent promoters. Androgens, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) 1The abbreviations used are: DHT, dihydrotestosterone; AR, androgen receptor; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; PSA, prostate specific antigen; LBD, ligand binding domain; ARE, androgen response element; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ARC, AR carboxyl-terminal fragment.1The abbreviations used are: DHT, dihydrotestosterone; AR, androgen receptor; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; PSA, prostate specific antigen; LBD, ligand binding domain; ARE, androgen response element; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ARC, AR carboxyl-terminal fragment. play a role in a multitude of physiological and developmental responses. Theses responses are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), a 110-kDa member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The structure of the AR is consistent with members of this family, consisting of an amino-terminal activation function (AF-1), the DNA binding domain, the hinge region, a carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD), and a second AF (AF-2) in the LBD. The AR is involved in growth, differentiation, and the progression of prostate cancer (for review, see Ref. 1Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Chang C. Androgens and the Androgen Receptor: Mechanisms, Functions, and Clinical Applications. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston2002Google Scholar). For the AR to rapidly respond to fluctuations in hormone levels, it functions as a member of a multicomponent complex (2Freeman B.C. Yamamoto K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 285-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Simplistically, the aporeceptor complex, primarily residing in the cytoplasm, translocates into the nucleus upon hormone binding. The AR-hormone complex binds the androgen response element (ARE), forming the holoreceptor complex. Both the aporeceptor and holoreceptor complexes act to facilitate, stabilize, and enhance the AR activity. One such complex consists of molecular chaperones that are involved in the stabilization of AR as well as its delivery to the nucleus. It is likely other complexes exist of which we have very little knowledge. A broad family of proteins, which interact with the AR, have previously been identified called coregulators. Coregulators are generally categorized into two classes; coactivators, which enhance the transcriptional activity of AR, and corepressors, which reduce AR transcriptional activity. Several AR coactivators have been identified, including cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (3Fronsdal K. Engedal N. Slagsvold T. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol.

In an attempt to identify novel members of the AR aporeceptor and holoreceptor complexes, we used tandem mass spectroscopy to study proteins associated with AR. As expected, we identified multiple members of the heat shock protein family which have previously been shown to stabilize the unligated receptor in the cytoplasm, and to regulate ligand affinity (11Fang Y.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, we identified all members of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) heterotrimeric complex. DNA-PK is composed of the heterodimeric Ku and the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) (13Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 14Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Ku, the regulatory subunit, consists of proteins with approximate molecular masses of 70 and 80 kDa (Ku70 and Ku80, respectively). DNA-PKcs is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family (15Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), with an approximate molecular mass of 470 kDa. Ku was originally characterized by Mimori et al. (16Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 68: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) as an autoantigen recognized by the sera of patients with polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome and now is often found in patients with other autoimmune diseases. Ku plays a role in a multitude of nuclear processes: that is, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, V(D)J recombination, and transcriptional regulation (for review, see Ref. 17Downs J.A. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Ku is probably best known for its role in nonhomologous DNA-end-joining (NHEJ) repair, a process responsible for repairing a majority of DNA double strand breaks. The importance of Ku is demonstrated by the fact that cells deficient in either Ku are more sensitive to ionizing radiation (18Finnie N. Gottlieb T. Blunt T. Jeggo P. Jackson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 19Errami A. Smider V. Rathmell W. He D. Hendrickson E. Zdzienicka M. Chu G. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 8076-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The critical function of Ku in DNA repair not withstanding, recently there has been an evolving role for Ku in transcription. Initial reports identified Ku as a transcription factor that directly bound to sequence-specific promoter elements (21Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Hache R.J. J.

Gene (Amst.). 2003; 302: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Other reports emerged that Ku was associated with RNA polymerase II sites (24Mo X. Dynan W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8088-8099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and Ku is also directly associated with the RNA polymerase II complex (25Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The entire DNA-PK complex is also involved in transcriptional regulation. DNA-PK has been shown to interact with and/or phosphorylate a number of transcription factors including epidermal growth factor receptor (26Bandyopadhyay D. Mandal M. Adam L. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription is also affected in DNA-PK-deficient SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice (32Sheppard H.M. Liu X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), DNA-PK-defective human glioma cells (33Ai R. Sandoval A. Labhart P. Gene Expr. 2003; 11: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and Ku80-defective XRS-5 cells (33Ai R. Sandoval A. Labhart P. Gene Expr. 2003; 11: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34Chan J.Y. Chen L.K. Chang J.F. Ting H.M. Goy C. Chen J.L. Hwang J.J. Chen F.D. Chen D.J. Ngo F.Q. J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 2001; 42: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ku by itself and as part of the DNA-PK complex appears to be integrally important for transcriptional control. Additionally, Ku has previously been identified as being involved in secondary initiation events (35Woodard R.L. Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Woodard R.L. Lee K.-J. Huang J. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15423-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells deficient for Ku showed greatly reduced transcription, which has been attributed to defective reinitiation. Reinitiation is enhanced by the recycling of promoter and other transcription related proteins more efficiently (37Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Here we identify Ku as a transcriptional recycling coactivator of AR function. We show that 1) AR interacts directly with both Ku70 and Ku80 and indirectly with DNA-PKcs, 2) the interaction of Ku70 and Ku80 with AR is via the AR LBD, 3) both Ku and DNA-PKcs enhance AR activity in transactivation assays, 4) Ku is recruited to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter in an androgen-dependent manner, and 5) Ku enhances the transcriptional activity of AR through recycling of the transcriptional factors. These results define Ku as a recycle coactivator of AR. Reagents and Antibodies—All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise noted. FBS and charcoal dextran-treated FBS were from Omega Scientific. Antibodies to the androgen receptor were from Upstate and Neomarkers. Antibodies to Ku were from Neomarkers, antibodies to DNA-PKcs were from Upstate, and antibodies to tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. siRNA oligos were from Dharmacon. Expression Constructs and Protein Expression—All DNA-PK plasmids were generous gifts of Dr. David J. Chen (University of Texas Southwest Medical Center). AR fragments were constructed by PCR and ligated into pcDNA3.1. Insect cell viruses were generous gifts of Hong-Wu Chen (UC Davis). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the procedures provided by Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Lysis—LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS; for androgen deprivation LNCaP cells were grown in phenol red-free RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum). PC-3(AR) cells were grown in phenol red-free RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum. Androgen stimulation for all cell lines was done in phenol red-free RPMI supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum and 10 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT). XR-V15B-vector (XRV15B) and XR-V15B-Ku86 (XRV15-Ku) cells were grown in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS. CHO V3 and CHO AA8 cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Transient transfection was done using Effectene (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Sf9 cells were grown in SF900-II SFM. Cell were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mV Na3VO4, Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) unless otherwise indicated. For nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation the NE-PER (Pierce) kit was used according to manufacturer's instructions. GST Pull-down Assays—In vitro binding assays were performed by incubating 10 μg of GST fusion protein or an equal amount of GST resin and 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled, in vitro translated proteins produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (for DNase activity), 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol protease inhibitor). Bound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Proteins were visualized on SDS-PAGE by Sypro Ruby stain. Bands of interest were excised and subjected to trypsin digestion, microcapillary high pressure liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem ion trap mass spectrometry, and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry peptide sequence analysis using a reverse phase C18 Magic 2000 HPLC (Michrom) and LCQ Deca mass spectroscopy (Thermo). Protein identification was facilitated by the Sequest software. Dual Luciferase Reporter Assays—All procedures were done according to the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The indicated cells were transiently transfected with pGL3 Basic containing either a 4× repeat of the androgen response element (4XARE), the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, the probasin (PRO) promoter, or the PSA full-length promoter and the pRL SV40 control plasmid. Cells lacking AR were also transfected with pcDNA:HA-AR containing full-length human AR. Cells were lysed using the passive lysis buffer (from the Promega assay kit mentioned above) and analyzed on a 96-well microplate luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were preformed with LNCaP cells treated as described above. Experiments were preformed exactly as described using the PCR primers described in Louie et al. (38Louie M.C. Yang H.Q. Ma A.H. Xu W. Zou J.X. Kung H.J. Chen H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2226-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). siRNA Knockdown—PC-3(AR) cells were transiently transfected with siRNA oligos derived from Belenkov et al. (39Belenkov A.I. Paiement J.-P. Panasci L.C. Monia B.P. Chow T.Y.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5888-5896PubMed Google Scholar) using Oligofectene (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were treated for 72 h to achieve maximum knockdown. In vitro Transcription—Lysates and assay were preformed essentially as described by Woodard et al. (35Woodard R.L. Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from XRV15B and XRV15B+Ku (which lack endogenous AR) and from the same cells transiently transfected with AR. In vitro transcription used 25–50 μg of extract in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 500 ng of the androgen-dependent G-less reporter p(ARR3)LovTATA (40Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), 10 nm DHT, and where indicated 50 pmol of AR. Lysates were preincubated for 30 min before nucleotide addition. Heparin was added 5 min after initiation, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for a total of 45 min. The reactions were stopped, extracted, and precipitated before separation by 6% urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 250 V until the bromphenol blue ran off the bottom. Bands were quantified by phosphorimage analysis (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). DNA-PK Complex Interacts with the Carboxyl-terminal Region of the Androgen Receptor—A great deal of attention has been paid to identifying AR cofactors that modulate its activity in an androgen-dependent manner. Our laboratory has been interested in identifying basal factors that associate with AR in an androgen-independent manner. To facilitate identification of potential members of the multicomponent AR complex, the AR was divided into both amino-terminal (amino acids 1–478) and carboxyl-terminal (ARC, amino acids 479–919) fragments to facilitate bacterial expression of the GST-tagged constructs. The GST-ARC fragment was expressed, partially purified on GST resin, and incubated with nuclear extracts of LNCaP cells (Figs. 1, A and B). LNCaP cells were either deprived of androgen (C) or stimulated with 10 nm DHT (D) to allow for any androgen-stimulated post-translational modifications for 2 h before lysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lysates were treated with DNase I, and complete digestion was confirmed by EtBr staining of extracts (data not shown). Interacting proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Multiple bands in the region of 28–400 kDa were observed. Only the predominant bands were isolated for further identification by microsequence analysis. These proteins were isolated from the SDS-PAGE, and their identities were determined by proteolytic peptide sequencing. Three of the proteins analyzed belong to the DNA-PK complex; the 470-kDa DNA-PK catalytic subunit, the 70-kDa DNA-PK regulatory subunit Ku70, and the 80-kDa regulatory subunit Ku80. Other proteins identified were 100-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, 90-kDa topoisomerase I, and 220-kDa RNA polymerase II polypeptide A, which have also been shown to be associated with hormone receptors (30Ko L. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of ARC and DNA-PK interaction is very high, indicating a higher affinity binding. The presence of multiple peptide fragments of each of the components of the DNA complex in tandem mass spectroscopy analysis gave us confidence in the assignment of these molecules as AR-interacting proteins. These interactions appear to be ligand-independent as the association is detected in both DHT-treated and untreated cell extracts. The in vitro interactions of DNA-PK complex with AR were confirmed by in vivo large scale immunoprecipitation of endogenous AR from LNCaP nuclear extracts followed by tandem mass spectroscopy. Table I shows the major co-immunoprecipitated proteins identified by tandem mass spectroscopy. In the molecular range of 70–120 kDa, the major interacting complexes of the androgen receptor are the heat shock protein complex and the DNA-PK complex.Table IIn vivo AR-interacting proteins Accession numbers are from Swiss-Prot.

Takimoto G.S. Richer J.K. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Ko L. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the involvement of Ku in transcriptional recycling (35Woodard R.L. Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Woodard R.L. Lee K.-J. Huang J. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15423-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To confirm the direct interaction of DNA-PK subunits with AR, GST pull-down assays were employed. GST-ARC was expressed in Escherichia coli and partially purified on GST resin. Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs were expressed and [35S]methionine-labeled in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Due to the large size of DNA-PKcs (∼470 kDa), which rendered the expression in E. coli impossible, DNA-PKcs was expressed in three separate overlapping constructs, the amino-terminal region of DNA-PKcs (N-DNAPK), middle region of DNA-PKcs (M-DNAPK), and carboxyl-terminal region of DNA-PKcs (C-DNAPK) (Fig. 2A) GST-ARC interacted with both Ku70 and Ku80; however, the Ku70 interaction appears to be stronger (Fig. 2B). There appears to be no direct interaction between GST-ARC and any of the fragments of DNA-PKcs. We interpret this to mean that DNA-PKcs association with AR is via Ku70 and Ku80. Importantly, DNase treatment had no affect on the interaction of Ku70 and Ku80 with AR, suggesting the association is not due to contaminating DNA. No interaction was observed when GST resin alone was employed. Once a direct interaction between AR and Ku70 and Ku80 was confirmed, fragments of AR encompassing the DNA binding domain (DBD), ligand binding domain (LBD) and a larger fragment encompassing both the DNA binding domain and the LBD (D+LBD) were constructed (Fig. 1B). The AR fragments along with full-length AR and green fluorescent protein were expressed and [35S]methionine-labeled in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. GST-Ku70 and GST-Ku80 were expressed in E. coli and partially purified on GST resin. Both the AR LBD and D+LBD fragments interacted with both Ku70 and Ku80 (Fig. 2B). The full-length AR had a weaker but noteworthy interaction with Ku70 and Ku80. Inclusion of 10 nm DHT did not enhance interaction with full-length AR. No interaction with GST resin alone was observed. The finding that the AR LBD but not the DNA binding domain is the interacting domain further strengthened the fact that the interaction is not DNA dependent. Ku70 and Ku80 Directly Interact with AR in Vivo—Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous AR and Ku70 from LNCaP cells again confirms the AR-DNA-PK interaction (Fig. 3A). LNCaP cells were deprived of androgen for 3 days then either left unstimulated or stimulated with 10 nm DHT for 2 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were subsequently lysed, fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and immunoprecipitated with anti-AR or anti-Ku70 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot with anti-DNA-Pkcs, anti-AR, anti-Ku80, or anti-Ku70 antibodies. AR interacted strongly with Ku70 in the cytosol in an androgen-independent manner. AR interaction with Ku70 in the nucleus appeared to be enhanced by DHT, likely due to the increase of AR in the nucleus after DHT stimulation. AR interaction with DNA-PKcs appears to be predominately nuclear. This interaction has been confirmed by the colocalization of AR and DNA-PK in LNCaP cells using immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Further confirmation of the interactions was obtained in Sf9 insect cells. Sf9 cells were infected individually and in combination with baculovirus carrying FLAG-AR, His-Ku70, and Ku80 for 36–48 h. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG resin. Distinct interactions were observed between Ku70 and AR and between Ku80 and AR as well as between the Ku homodimer and AR (Fig. 3B). The formation of the AR-Ku complex in Sf9 cells is further confirmed by Sypro-Ruby staining of FLAG-immunoprecipitated AR from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Fig. 3C). Ku Homodimer as Well as DNA-PKcs Are Co-activators of Androgen Receptor Activity—To examine the influence of Ku on AR activity, full-length human AR together with PSA-Luc plasmids were transfected into XR-V15B, a cell line lacking Ku80 and Ku70, or its transfected variant, XR-V15B-Ku, which expresses both Ku70 and Ku80. The Renilla luciferase construct served as an internal transfection efficiency control. After transfection cells were treated with 10 nm DHT, and the luciferase levels were quantified. Ku-containing cells showed a substantial increase in AR activity for the 6.0-kilobase PSA reporter construct (Fig. 4A). Ku also enhanced AR activity for the 4× ARE and mouse mammary tumor virus reporter constructs employed (data not shown). This suggests that Ku enhances AR-mediated transactivation. Because AR plays a major role in prostate cancer, we sought to examine the effect of Ku knock-down on AR activity in the prostate cancer cell line. We chose PC-3(AR), a prostate cancer cell line expressing AR, because of its demonstrated androgen response and the relatively high transfection efficiency. To knock down Ku levels, a siRNA duplex against Ku80 was employed. Treatment of the prostate cancer cell line PC-3(AR) with Ku80 siRNA (39Belenkov A"
https://openalex.org/W2060660431,"Alteration of methylation status has been recognized as a possible epigenetic mechanism of selection during tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer. This type of cancer is characterized by poor prognosis partly due to resistance to conventional drug treatments. We have used microarray technology to investigate the changes in global gene expression observed after treatment of different pancreatic cancer cell lines with the methylase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR). We have observed that this agent is able to inhibit to various degrees the growth of three pancreatic cancer cell lines. In particular, this inhibition was associated with induction of interferon (IFN)-related genes, as observed in other tumour types. Thus, expression of STAT1 seems to play a key role in the cellular response to treatment with the cytosine analogue. Moreover, we found increased p21(WAF1) and gadd45A expression to be associated with the efficacy of the treatment; this induction may correlate with activation of the IFN signalling pathway. Expression of the p16(INK) protein was also linked to the ability of cells to respond to 5-aza-CdR. Finally, genome-wide demethylation induced sensitization that significantly increased response to further treatment with various chemotherapy agents."

An understanding of the mechanism by which this system works at the molecular level has been hampered by the difficulty of identifying VKOR involved in warfarin sensitive reduction of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to reduced vitamin K1H2, the γ-carboxylase cofactor. Identification and cloning of VKORC1, a proposed subunit of a larger VKOR enzyme complex, have provided opportunities for new experimental approaches aimed at understanding the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system. In this work we have engineered stably transfected baby hamster kidney cells containing γ-carboxylase and VKORC1 cDNA constructs, respectively, and stably double transfected cells with the γ-carboxylase and the VKORC1 cDNA constructs in a bicistronic vector. All engineered cells showed increased activities of the enzymes encoded by the cDNAs. However increased activity of the γ-carboxylation system, where VKOR provides the reduced vitamin K1H2 cofactor, was measured only in cells transfected with VKORC1 and the double transfected cells. The results show that VKOR is the rate-limiting step in the γ-carboxylation system and demonstrate successful engineering of cells containing a recombinant vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system with enhanced capacity for γ-carboxyglutamic acid modification. The proposed thioredoxin-like 132CXXC135 redox center in VKORC1 was tested by expressing the VKORC1 mutants Cys132/Ser and Cys135/Ser in BHK cells. Both of the expressed mutant proteins were inactive supporting the existence of a CXXC redox center in VKOR.

Hutson S.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Concomitant with formation of Gla residues, Vit.KH2 is converted to vitamin K 2,3-epoxide (Vit.K>O) (7Wallin R. Hutson S.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The epoxide can be reduced and recycled to the Vit.KH2 cofactor by the warfarin sensitive enzyme vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR) (7Wallin R. Hutson S.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which also is an integral protein of the ER membrane (8Wajih N. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol.

Handbook of Lipid Research. Plenum Press, New York1978: 211-277Google Scholar). The vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system in the ER membrane consists of the vitamin K cycle enzymes plus additional proteins involved in regulation and formation of the Gla modification in vitamin K-dependent proteins (7Wallin R. Hutson S.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purification of γ-carboxylase from the ER membrane and cloning of the enzyme (10Wu S.M. Cheung W.F. Frazier D. Stafford D.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) has resulted in a broad understanding of this membrane enzyme and the mechanism by which the enzyme carries out vitamin K-dependent modification of proteins (11Dowd P. Hershline R. Ham S.W. Naganathan S. Science. 1995; 269: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). On the other hand, very little is known about the enzymology of VKOR and the mechanism by which the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system operates in the ER membrane. This lack of insight into the mechanism of operation of the system stems from the difficulty of obtaining purified preparations of VKOR (12Cain D. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for identification of the protein(s) responsible for VKOR activity. In our attempts to identify protein components of VKOR by photo affinity labeling with azido derivatives of warfarin, we identified a regulatory protein of the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system (12Cain D. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protein was shown to be calumenin, a known ER chaperone belonging to the calcium binding, EF hand motif containing family of proteins (7Wallin R. Hutson S.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Wajih N. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25276-25283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The azido derivative of warfarin did not label the catalytic protein responsible for warfarin sensitive VKOR activity (12Cain D. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently the location of genetic warfarin resistance in man was mapped to the 16p12-q21 region on chromosome 16, and the effected gene was identified (13Fregin A. Rost S. Wolz W. Krebsova A. Muller C.R. Oldenburg J. Blood. 2002; 100: 3229-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rost et al. (14Rost S. Fregin A. Ivaskevicius V. Conzelmann E. Hortnagel K. Pelz H.J. Lappegard K.

Khvorova A. Stafford D.W. Nature. 2004; 427: 493-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that the gene encodes an 18-kDa transmembrane protein that exhibits warfarin sensitive VKOR activity when expressed in cell lines. The protein is believed to be a subunit (VKORC1) of a larger VKOR lipidenzyme complex in the ER membrane that we have shown is destroyed upon purification (12Cain D. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In our efforts to understand how the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system functions at the molecular level, we have generated stably transfected BHK cells containing VKORC1 and γ-carboxylase cDNAs constructs, respectively, and stably double transfected BHK cells with VKORC1 and γ-carboxylase cDNA constructs in a bicistronic vector. The activities of VKOR and γ-carboxylase are shown to be significantly enhanced in all transfected cell lines with the highest activities measured in the double transfected cells. We present evidence that VKOR is the rate-limiting step in an in vitro vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system where VKOR produces the Vit.KH2 cofactor for γ-carboxylase and show that the double transfected cells harbor a recombinant vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system with enhanced capacity for post-translational Gla modification. Furthermore we show by mutagenesis that changing either of the two Cys residues in the proposed CXXC redox center in VKORC1 (16Goodstadt L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 289-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) to Ser residues results in inactivation of VKOR activity. This finding confirms earlier data (17Lee J.J. Fasco M.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that suggest that a Cys containing redox center in VKOR is essential for reduction of Vit.K>O to the Vit.KH2 γ-carboxylase cofactor. Materials—The γ-carboxylase peptide substrate FLEEL was from Sigma. The factor X propeptide ESLFIRREQANNILARVTRA was synthesized by BACHEM, Inc., Torrance, CA. The VKORC1 peptides 1 (KAARARNEDYRAALC) and 2 (SFQKVPEHKVKKPC) were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc., San Antonio, TX, and used for anti-peptide antibody production in rabbits by the same company. Antibodies to recombinant calumenin were raised in rabbits using Freund's adjuvant as approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. All antibodies were affinity purified by our laboratory as described (18Wajih N. Borras T. Xue W. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43052-43060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and stored in 50% glycerol, water at -85 °C. CHAPS, vitamin K1, warfarin, dithiothreitol, Sepharose-protein A, and the protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cells and tissue extracts were from Sigma. Vit.KH2 was prepared as described by Sadowski et al. (19Sadowski J.A. Esmon C.T. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2770-2776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Vit.K>O was prepared as described by Tishler et al. (20Tishler M. Fieser L.F. Wender N.L. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1940; 62: 2866-2871Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). NaH14CO3 (specific activity, 54 mCi·mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Chicago, IL. Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were purchased from Zivic Miller Laboratories, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA. Rats were housed, fed, and used for experiments as approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Liver microsomes were prepared as described by our laboratory (21Wallin R. Hutson S.M. Cain D. Sweatt A. Sane D.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2542-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Extraction of Microsomes—For the removal of microsomal luminal and peripherally bound membrane proteins, microsomes obtained from 4 g of rat liver were suspended in 8 ml of 100 mm Na2CO3, 1.2 m KCl, 0.025% deoxycholate, pH 11.5, with a Potter Elvehjelm glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min (22Wallin R. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Thromb Res. 2003; 108: 221-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of 50 mm Tris base with the same homogenizer and centrifuged a second time at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Pellets (extracted microsomes) were stored at -85 °C until they were used for experiments. Cloning of Rat VKORC1 and Creation of an Expression Vector—Five μg of total RNA from rat liver was used for cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). The following primers were used in PCR for rat VKORC1 (gi:45827740); sense, 5′-TGT CGA CAT GGG CAC CAC CTG GAG-3′; antisense, 5′-ATG AGG TGG GAC CTC AGG GCT TTT TG-3′. The PCR products were purified using Qiagen's PCR purification kit (Valencia, CA) and separated on a 1.2% EtBr-stained agarose gel. The purified PCR product was then ligated into TA cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). Positive clones were identified by EcoRI digestion and sequenced on both the strands using M13 reverse and forward primers. HindIII and XbaI restriction sites were then generated at the 5′ and 3′ ends of rat VKORC1 cDNA to clone the cDNA into the pBUDCE4.1 vector (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cell lines. A Kozak sequence was also generated at the 5′ end of rat VKOR cDNA. The modified cDNA for rat VKORC1 was then cloned into the HindIII and XbaI site of the pBUDCE4.1 vector (Invitrogen) under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. Recombinant plasmid with cDNA for rat VKORC1 was sequenced on both strands to eliminate any PCR errors. The new plasmid with rat wild type VKORC1 cDNA is named pBUDCE4.1-VKORC1. Cloning of Rat γ-Carboxylase and Creation of an Expression Vector— The plasmid pCR 2.1 containing full-length rat γ-carboxylase was a kind gift from Dr. David A Roth, Division of Hemostasis & Thrombosis, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. NotI and XhoI sites were generated at the 5′ and 3′ ends to clone the cDNA into the pBUDCE4.1 mammalian expression vector. A Kozak sequence was also generated at the 5′ end. The modified cDNA for rat γ-carboxylase was then cloned into the NotI and XhoI sites on plasmid pBUDCE4.1 under the control of the EF-1 α-promoter. Recombinant plasmid with cDNA for rat γ-carboxylase was sequenced on both the strands to eliminate any PCR errors. The new plasmid with rat γ-carboxylase cDNA is named pBUDCE4.1-γ-Carb. Construction of Plasmid Containing VKORC1 and γ-Carboxylase cDNAs—Plasmid pBUDCE4.1 is a dual promoter vector capable of expressing two independent recombinant proteins. It has two multiple cloning sites each under the control of two independent promoters, cytomegalovirus and EF-1α. The γ-carboxylase insert was excised from plasmid pBUDCE4.1-γ-Carb using NotI and XhoI restriction digestion. The γ-carboxylase insert was gel-purified and subcloned into NotI and XhoI restriction sites on the plasmid pBUDCE4.1-VKORC1. The resulting plasmid then contained both VKORC1 and γ-carboxylase cDNAs. The new plasmid was named pBUDCE4.1-γ-Carb-VKORC1. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Cys132 and Cys135 of the putative CXXC redox center in VKORC1 (16Goodstadt L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 289-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was mutated to Ser residues using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For the Cys132/Ser mutant protein the following primers were used: sense primer, 5′-C TTT GTC CTG TAT GAT TTC AGC ATT GTT TGC ATC ACC ACC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GGT GGT GAT GCA AAC AAT GCT GAA ATC ATA CAG GAC AAA G-3′. (Bold and italic base was changed.) For the Cys135/Ser mutant protein the following primers were used: sense primer, 5′-G TAT GAT TTC TGC ATT GTT AGC ATC ACC ACC TAT GCC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-T GGC ATA GGT GGT GAT GCT AAC AAT GCA GAA ATC ATA C-3′. (Bold and italic base was changed.) After mutagenesis the modified rat VKOR cDNAs were cloned into the pBUDCE 4.1 vector as described above for cloning of the wild type VKORC1 cDNA into the vector. Stable Cell Lines Expressing Rat VKOR—Plasmid pBUDCE4.1-VKORC1 was used to transfect BHK 21 cells (ATCC number CCL-10) (American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 24 h, cells were passaged at 1:20 dilution into fresh growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum) with Zeocin antibiotic (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) for selective pressure. Medium containing 400 μg/ml Zeocin was changed after every 2–3 days for 6 weeks. After the selection of stable cell lines expressing rat VKORC1, cells were maintained at 200 μg/ml of Zeocin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Frozen stocks were made. Stable Cell Lines Expressing γ-Carboxylase—Plasmid pBUDCE4.1-γ-Carb was used to transfect BHK 21 cells. Cells were transfected and stably transfected clones of cells selected as described above. Frozen stocks were made. Stably Transfected Cells Co-expressing Rat VKORC1 and γ-Carboxylase—Plasmid pBUDCE4.1-γ-Carb-VKORC1 was used to transfect BHK 21 cells. Cells were transfected and stably transfected clones of cells selected as described above. Frozen stocks were made. Stably Transfected Cells Expressing VKORC1 Mutant Proteins— Plasmid pBUDCE4.1 containing the Cys132/Ser and the Cys135/Ser mutations, respectively, were used to transfect BHK 21 cells. Cells were transfected and stably transfected clones of cells selected as described above. Frozen stocks were made. Cellular in Vitro System for Assaying Enzyme Activities Associated with the Vitamin K-dependent γ-Carboxylation System—Cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in a Potter Elvehjelm homogenizer in 250 mm phosphate, 0.5 m KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.75% CHAPS, pH 7.85 (buffer D) containing 10 μl of the Sigma protease inhibitor mixture per ml. Final protein concentration was 2.0 mg/ml. Immunoprecipitation of VKORC1 from Solubilized Extracted Liver Microsomal Membranes—Extracted liver microsomal membranes were suspended in a Potter Elvehjelm homogenizer in 50 mm Hepes, 125 mm KCl, 0.75% CHAPS, pH 7.85 containing 10 μg/ml of the Sigma protease inhibitor mixture. The supernatant was adsorbed with Sepharose-protein A beads before anti-peptide 1 VKORC1 affinity purified antibodies were added. The mixture was rotated over night at 4 °C. An identically prepared sample without the peptide 1 antibodies served as control. Sepharose-protein A particles were again added to the samples, and immune complexes were removed by centrifugation. VKOR activities in the anti-peptide 1 immunoabsorbed, and the control samples were measured. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, Mass Spectrometry, and Western Blotting of Proteins in Extracted Liver Microsomal Membranes—Extracted microsomal membranes were solubilized in 9.5 m urea containing sample buffer for isoelectric focusing as described by O'Farrell (23O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by our laboratory (24Wallin R. Culp E.N. Coleman D.B. Goodman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4095-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation before the sample was applied to the focusing gel. Isoelectric focusing was carried out over night and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension run in 10–15% gradient gels as described (12Cain D. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Selected stained protein spots were excised from the gel and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis for protein identification. The analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility by micro capillary reverse-phase HPLC nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ DECA XP Plus quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and developed with antibodies to peptide 1 and 2 as described (18Wajih N. Borras T. Xue W. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43052-43060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using the ECL plus detection system from Amersham Biosciences. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting of Proteins in Cultured Cells—Cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with the modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer 50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 containing 10 μg/ml of the Sigma protease inhibitor mixture. Cell proteins in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer were mixed with SDS-PAGE running buffer prior to electrophoresis. Western blotting of cell proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was carried out as described above. Enzyme Assays—Warfarin sensitive VKOR activity was measured as described (25Wallin R. Martin L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 1879-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) by estimating the percent conversion of Vit.K>O to vitamin K1. The vitamin and the epoxide was separated on a reversed phase C18 column in 100% methanol and quantified against external standards. γ-Carboxylase activity was assayed as described (22Wallin R. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Thromb Res. 2003; 108: 221-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as 14CO2 incorporation into the synthetic peptide FLEEL. The reaction was either triggered by adding chemically reduced vitamin K1H2 (Vit.KH2) (100 μg/ml) to the assay mixture or triggered by VKOR-produced reduced Vit.KH2 in a reaction mixture containing 40 μm Vit.K>O and 8 mm dithiothreitol. Both assays were carried out as described (22Wallin R. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Thromb Res. 2003; 108: 221-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with saturating FLEEL concentration for the reactions. The factor X propeptide was added to the incubations to give a final concentration of 10 μm. Preparation of Peptide Antibodies against VKORC1—Fig. 1 shows a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot of the predicted amino acid sequence of rat VKORC1. The graph above the horizontal straight line on the plot indicates positions of potential transmembrane domains at a window setting at 19. The plot indicates three potential domains labeled 1, 2, and 3. To obtain antibodies against this hydrophobic protein we selected peptides from two predicted hydrophilic regions of the protein. Their positions in the VKORC1 sequence and their amino acid sequences are shown in the Fig. 1. Peptide 1 covers VKORC1 residues 31–44. Peptide 2 covers the C-terminal sequence 149–161. A Cys residue (italic) was added to the C-terminal of peptide 149–161 for easy conjugation to KLH and solid supports for affinity purification of peptide antibodies. Fig. 2A shows SDS-PAGE of proteins in extracted microsomal membranes and Western blots with the two peptide antibodies. The peptide 1 antibodies (Pep.1.Ab) recognized a 26-kDa protein, whereas the peptide 2 antibodies (Pep.2.Ab) recognized both a 26-kDa protein and a 32-kDa protein. B shows a Coomassie Blue stained two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel of proteins present in extracted microsomal membranes. C shows the protein spots on the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel identified by the peptide 1 and the peptide 2 antibodies, respectively. As shown in C, two major immunoreactive proteins spots, a (26 kDa) and b (32 kDa) were identified with the C-terminal peptide 2 antibodies, whereas the peptide 1 antibodies only recognized the basic 26-kDa protein in spot a. The acidic 32-kDa protein in spot b was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry and identified as membrane-associated progesterone receptor component 1 (gi:6647578) (26Nolte I. Jeckel D. Weiland F.T. Sohn K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A homology search revealed no sequence homology between the receptor and VKORC1. Thus we conclude that the peptide 2 antibodies recognized an epitope on the progesterone receptor that mimicked peptide 2. Based on these findings we focused on the peptide 1 antibodies as specific antibodies for VKORC1 which runs as a 26-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE and not as an 18-kDa protein predicted by its amino acid composition. To confirm that the peptide 1 antibodies recognized VKORC1, we tested the ability of these antibodies to remove VKOR from solubilized extracted microsomal membranes. Immune complexes were trapped with Sepharose-protein A beads. The supernatant remaining after removal of the Sepharose-protein A beads by centrifugation had 55% lower VKOR activity than the control, which was treated identically except that it did not contain the peptide 1 antibodies.

VKOR activities measured in all cell lines were sensitive to warfarin inhibition (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A, γ-carboxylase activity triggered with Vit.K1H2 was not enhanced in cells transfected with the VKORC1 construct (VKOR) over the control (Cont.). On the other hand, Vit.KH2 triggered γ-carboxylase activity was significantly higher in γ-carboxylase transfected (γ-Carb.) and the double transfected cells (VKOR + γ-Carb.). Highest γ-carboxylase activity was measured in the double transfected cells. C shows VKOR activity measured in the same test samples. This activity measured in VKOR transfected (VKOR) and the double transfected cells (VKOR + γ-Carb.) was enhanced significantly over the control. On the other hand VKOR activity measured in the γ-carboxylase transfected (γ-Carb.) cells was not significantly different from the control. The results shown in A and C demonstrate that individual overexpression of VKORC1 and γ-carboxylase in BHK cells does not effect expression of its”partner“(VKOR or γ-carboxylase) in the γ-carboxylation system when judged on enzyme activity measurements. The results shown in B provide information about the γ-carboxylation system in the various stably transfected cell lines. In these experiments, which were carried out with the same samples used for the experiments shown in A and C, VKOR is providing the reduced Vit.KH2 cofactor for γ-carboxylase. In these experiments the double transfected BHK cells (VKOR + γ-Carb.) had the highest activity measured as 14CO2 incorporation into the FLEEL γ-carboxylase substrate. This activity was also enhanced in the VKORC1 transfected cells (VKOR). However, in the γ-carboxylase transfected cells (γ-Carb.) the activity was not significantly different from the control (Cont.). These results indicate that 1) overexpression of γ-carboxylase does not enhance post-translational"
https://openalex.org/W2003489735,"Expression of neurotrophin receptors of the tyrosine kinase receptor (Trk) family is an important prognostic factor in solid tumors including neuroblastoma. High expression of TrkA (NTRK1) is associated with a favorable biology and outcome of neuroblastoma, whereas TrkB (NTRK2) is expressed on aggressive neuroblastomas with unfavorable outcome. To gain new insights into the global gene expression program resulting in these divergent biological phenotypes, we stably expressed either TrkA or TrkB in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Gene expression profiles were obtained from parental cells and transfectants activated by their ligands in a time course over 24 h using oligonucleotide microarrays. Basal activation of Trk receptors in the absence of exogenous ligand was sufficient to induce broad and divergent genetic changes. Global gene regulation following external ligand stimulation was surprisingly similar in SY5Y-TrkA and SY5Y-TrkB cells except for the differential expression of distinct novel target genes. Consistent with their divergent biological phenotype, SY5Y-TrkA cells were characterized by upregulation of proapoptotic genes and angiogenesis inhibitors, whereas SY5Y-TrkB cells demonstrated upregulation of genes involved in invasion or therapy resistance. We suggest that the transcriptional program of neuroblastoma cells is modulated by Trk-receptor expression and basal activation rather than by ligand-induced activation. Fine-tuning of the malignant phenotype may be achieved by additional ligand stimulation with subsequent activation of a few specific genes."

The human ortholog SIRT1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular differentiation, metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, and its enzymatic activity may be regulated by cellular energy. There is a growing number of known SIRT1 substrates that contain ϵ-acetyl lysine but for which no obvious consensus sequence has been defined. In this study, we developed a novel unbiased method to identify deacetylase sequence specificity using oriented peptide libraries containing acetylated lysine. Following incubation with SIRT1, the subset of deacetylated peptides was selectively captured using a photocleavable N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-biotin linker and streptavidin beads and analyzed using mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. These studies revealed that substrate recognition by SIRT1 does not depend on the amino acid sequence proximate to the acetylated lysine. This result brings us one step closer to understanding how SIRT1 and possibly other protein deacetylases chose their substrate. SIR2 is a key regulator of the aging process in many model organisms.

This result brings us one step closer to understanding how SIRT1 and possibly other protein deacetylases chose their substrate. SIR2 is a major regulator of the aging process. SIR2 functions as an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, which removes an acetyl group from the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues and is conserved from bacteria to higher eukaryotes (1Imai S. Armstrong C.M.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SIR2 overexpression dramatically increases life span, whereas deletion of the SIR2 locus causes premature aging of the yeast mother cell (3Kaeberlein M. McVey M.

Two amino acids at the N terminus from the ϵ-Ac-lysine and five amino acids C-terminal to the Ac-lysine of p53 peptide were well visualized in the electron density map, which suggests that they may play a role in the enzyme-substrate interaction (18Avalos J.L.

However, the structure did not improve our understanding of whether the amino acids flanking the ϵ-Ac-lysine residue are important for SIRT1 substrate recognition.No known SIRT1 substrates have been identified using an unbiased substrate search method, and the SIRT1 deacetylation consensus sequence, if one exists, has not been identified to date. In an attempt to determine an optimal deacetylation motif for SIRT1, we developed a novel deacetylase capture assay using unbiased oriented peptide libraries. Peptide library screening has proven to be a powerful method for mapping the consensus motifs recognized and phosphorylated by protein kinases or bound by modular peptide binding domains (19Rodriguez M.

In this paper, we describe the use of an acetyl-lysine-based oriented peptide approach combined with biotin-avidin capture technology to query SIRT1 deacetylated peptides for a common recognition motif. Using this method, we discovered that SIRT1 selection for substrate peptides does not depend on the amino acids proximal to ϵ-Ac-lysine and verified these findings by detailed enzymatic kinetic analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of the SIRT1 Protein—293T cells were transfected with SIRT1-FLAG plasmid (7Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Machado De Oliveira R. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) by JetPEI (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection in Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture-EDTA (Complete; Roche Applied Science). FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated material was washed three times in the extraction buffer. FLAG-SIRT1 was eluted by incubation with FLAG peptide (Sigma) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline.Peptide Library Experiment—200 μg of the peptide library or the SIRtide (Tufts Medical School, Boston, MA) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 4 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm NAD, 2 mm dithiothreitol in the presence or absence of 1 μg of purified mammalian SIRT1. Next, 3 μl of 25 μm of photocleavable biotin derivative (photocleavable (PC)-biotin-NHS) (23Olejnik J. Sonar S. Krzymanska-Olejnik E. Rothschild K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7590-7594Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (AmberGen, Boston, MA), 80 μl of dimethylformamide, and 80 μl of 1 m NaHCO3 were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. To this solution, 500 μl of NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were washed with 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) (three times), 50 mm NH4OAc (pH 7.2) (three times), and 10% ethyl alcohol. Samples were eluted in 1 ml of 10% ethyl alcohol for 15 min by UV exposure (Blak Ray XX-15 UV lamp; Ultraviolet Products, San Gabriel, CA) at a distance of 15 cm (emission peak 365 nm, lamp intensity = 1.1 milliwatt/cm2 at a distance of 31 cm). The samples were dried, resuspended in 40 μl of 7.5% ammonia in H2O, and incubated overnight to remove the Fmoc. 1The abbreviations used are: Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; PC, photocleavable; LC, linker-coupled; PML, promyelocytic leukemia. Samples were dried, resuspended in 10 μlofH2O, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF and Edman degradation (Tufts Medical School, Boston, MA).Library Synthesis—A peptide library containing the sequences Fmoc-MAXXXX-AcK-XXXXXAEEE, where X indicates all amino acids except Lys or Cys, was synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis with N-α-Fmoc-protected amino acids and standard BOP/HOBt coupling chemistry (Tufts Medical School, Boston, MA). Individual peptides were synthesized in a similar manner.Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was performed with the Voyager DE-TOF mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with delayed ion extraction and nitrogen laser (337 nm) and analyzed by GRAMS software. Samples were desalted prior to analysis using ZipTip C18 pipette tips (size P10) (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then 1 μl of sample solution was deposited on a steel target plate followed by 1 μl of matrix solution, air-dried, and spotted. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml (5:4:1, v/v/v, acetonitrile/water/3% trifluoroacetic acid) was used as a matrix.Kinetic Analysis—Briefly, synthesized acetylated peptides were re-suspended in phosphate buffer and stored frozen at –70 °C. Peptide concentration was determined by amino acid analysis (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Deacetylase reactions were carried out in a total volume of 16 μl of assay buffer containing 65 ng of bacterial expressed SIRT1, 150 μm NAD (N-1511; Sigma), 20 μm [carbonyl-14C]NAD (55 mCi/mmol of CFA372; Amersham Biosciences), and serially diluted peptide series (from 0.125 to 125 μm). The reaction was initiated with the addition of enzyme to the substrate mixture. The mixture was incubated for 50 min at 37 °C in a 96-well V-bottom polypropylene plate (catalog no. 615201; Greiner). AA assay buffer contained 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 250 mm sodium acetate, 2.7 potassium acetate, 1 mm magnesium chloride, and 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v).At the completion of the deacetylase reaction, 150 μl of a 50% slurry of boronic acid resin (polyacrylamide immobilized boronic acid resin (catalog no. 20244; Pierce) pre-equilibrated with 0.25 m ammonium acetate (pH 9.0)) was immediately added to each assay well. The suspension was mixed and transferred to a Multiscreen-DV 96-well filter plate (catalog no. MADVN0B10; Millipore Corp.) on a vacuum manifold (catalog no. MAVM096OR; Millipore). Vacuum was applied, and the unbound fraction containing released nicotinamide was collected into a 96-well Wallac Isoplate (catalog no. 1450-514; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 150 μl of liquid scintillation fluid (catalog no. 1200-439; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well, mixed, and counted on a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter using the 14C channel with a 1-min counting time. Raw data were analyzed using nonlinear regression (Y = Vmax*X/(Km + X)) with GraphPad Prism version 4.02, where Vmax is the maximal activity and Km is the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal activity (Michaelis constant). Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least two determinations.RESULTSTo determine the requirements for substrate specificity for SIRT1 and ask whether there is a consensus sequence for its targets, we developed a new acetyl-lysine-oriented peptide library-based strategy for mapping SIRT1 substrate specificity (Fig. 1). A degenerate peptide library corresponding to the sequence Fmoc-MAXXXX-AcK-XXXXXAEEE was synthesized, where AcK indicates acetyl-lysine and X indicates all amino acids except Lys or Cys. Lys was omitted from the degenerate positions, and the N terminus was blocked by Fmoc to ensure that the starting library contained no free amino groups in the absence of SIRT1-driven deacetylation. Cys was omitted to avoid problems with sequencing and oxidation.The degenerate peptide library was incubated with SIRT1 for various periods of time, and the subset of SIRT1-deacetylated peptides was purified away from the acetylated starting material by incubation with (NHS-PC-linker-coupled (LC)-biotin). The NHS group reacts specifically with the free ϵ-amino group of the central lysine residue in the library, which is present only in the deacetylated population (23Olejnik J. Sonar S. Krzymanska-Olejnik E. Rothschild K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7590-7594Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The biotinylated, deacetylated peptides were captured on streptavidin-agarose beads, washed extensively to remove nonbiotinylated (acetylated) peptides. The beads were then irradiated with 365-nm UV light to reverse the NHS cross-link and liberate the deacetylated peptide mixture. The released peptides were incubated with concentrated ammonia to cleave the N-terminal Fmoc protecting group and sequenced in bulk by Edman degradation (Fig. 1).The Met-Ala sequence was designed at the amino terminus of the peptide library to verify that any biotin-streptavidin-captured peptide obtained with this approach came from the substrate library mixture and to help quantify the amount of peptide present. The fixed Ala residue at position 13 in the library provides an estimate of how much peptide loss occurs during sequencing, whereas the poly(Glu) C-terminal tail prevents peptide washout during Edman degradation sequencing.The strategy was initially optimized using an individual SIRT1 peptide Fmoc-MASTGG-AcK-DSTEMAEEE; SIRtide) in which the N-terminal half was derived from the histone H3 peptide amino acid sequence, a known SIRT1 substrate (1Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal was derived from the RCH1 peptide sequence, a SIRT1 substrate that we recently identified (data not shown). This peptide included the same total number of amino acids and the same constant amino acid positions as the degenerate peptide library, whereas its single amino acid sequence greatly facilitated evaluation of the deacetylation reaction products by mass spectrometry (MALDI mass spectrometry). As shown in Fig. 2A, MALDI-TOF analysis of SIRtide revealed a primary parent ion of 1959.89 Da corresponding to the monosodium adduct of SIRtide (calculated mass of 1937 Da minus the sodium) as well as small peaks corresponding to the di- and trisodium forms. These adducts were products of sodium binding to the acidic residues of the peptide. Deacetylation adds a positive charge to the peptide and largely eliminates these adducts. Following SIRT1 deacetylation, we detected a product in the total reaction mixture with a parent ion mass of 1895.56 Da, corresponding to the loss of an acetyl group (and a sodium ion), as expected (Fig. 2B). After incubating the reaction mixture with NHS-PC-LC-biotin, followed by capture on streptavidin-agarose beads and photorelease, the same peak corresponding to the deacetylated product at 1895.56 Da was observed in the MALDI-TOF spectrum (Fig. 2C). In contrast, when the reaction was performed without enzyme, there was no deacetylation product in the MALDI-TOF spectrum of the total reaction products (data not shown), and no NHS-PC-LC-biotin capture/photorelease product was obtained (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2SIRT1 deacetylation of a peptide substrate monitored by NHS-PC-LC-biotin derivatization, streptavidin capture, photocleavage, and mass spectrometry. Shown are MALDI-TOF spectra for the starting SIRtide peptide (calculated M + Na+ = 1959.56) (A), the crude SIRT1 deacetylation reaction (calculated M + H+ = 1895.56) (B), the NHS-PC-LC-biotin-derivatized, streptavidin-captured, photocleaved product (C); and the photocleavage product obtained in the absence of SIRT1 addition (D). *, di- and trisodium adducts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, the degenerate acetyl-lysine-oriented peptide library was incubated with SIRT1 or no enzyme (control). The reaction products were reacted with NHS-PC-LC-biotin, captured, and photoreleased from streptavidin-agarose beads; the N-terminal Fmoc protective group was removed; and the capture products were sequenced by Edman degradation. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3, the recovered peptides displayed a prominent enriched peak of free Lys in Edman sequencing cycle 7, consistent with the expected SIRT1-mediated deacetylation. In contrast, minimal Lys recovery was observed at this position in the control reactions lacking SIRT1 (Fig. 3, top panel). Thus, this peptide library/deacetylation/capture approach was capable of isolating peptides that were deacetylated by SIRT1 as evidenced by both mass spectrometry and Edman degradation.Fig. 3Edman sequence analysis following SIRT1 deacetylation, peptide library derivatization, and capture. The graphs show pmol of each amino acid recovered in cycle number 7, corresponding to the position of the fixed acetyl-lysine in the starting library mixture, for the NHS-PC-LC-biotin-derivatized, streptavidin-captured, photocleaved products obtained from reactions performed in the absence (A) or presence (B) of SIRT1. Enrichment for lysine in this position was only observed in the presence of SIRT1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the optimal SIRT1 deactylation motif, the peptide library was incubated with SIRT1 for 15 h at 37 °C. Approximately 2% of the total peptide mixture was captured and photoreleased from the streptavidin-agarose beads (data not shown). These purified, deacetylated products were then sequenced by Edman degradation. The amount (mol %) of each amino acid in each of the degenerate positions was compared with its amount (mol %) in the starting library mixture in order to determine whether particular amino acids are selected at specific positions flanking the central acetyl-lysine residue. As shown by the resulting selectivity values in Table I (top), the relative abundance of the amino acids in each of the 9 degenerate positions flanking the fixed deacetylated Lys residue appears to be relatively invariant from cycle to cycle. Furthermore, each amino acid shows a similar overall abundance in the deacetylated peptide products to that present in the starting library mixture, as revealed by selectivity ratios close to 1.0. These data strongly argue that SIRT1 does not show any preference for specific amino acids in acetylated peptide substrates. We carried out additional experiments using shorter incubation times in an attempt to select more stringently for the most optimal peptide substrates. These also failed to provide any evidence for peptide motif specificity for SIRT1-mediated deacetylation (Table I, middle and bottom).Table ILack of substrate specificity for SIRT1 using oriented peptide library screeningPositionSIRT1 (15 h) Fmoc-MAXXXX-AcK-XXXXXAEEEAspAsnSerGlyGluHisAlaArgTyrProMetValPheIleLeu-40.811.20.310.91.11.51.20.91.2110.91-30.811.10.40.811.21.21.30.91.211.10.90.9-20.81.11.10.4111.11.31.20.81.211.10.90.9-10.70.91.20.510.91.21.21.20.91.21.1111Ac-K10.81.21.30.8ND1.11.31.41.20.61.21.110.91.320.81.11.21.1ND11.21.31.20.81.21.111130.81.11.11.210.91.11.11.10.91.110.90.80.940.811.21.410.81.111.10.91110.80.950.81.21.21.410.81110.910.910.90.9PositionSIRT1 (30 min) Fmoc-MAXXXX-AcK-XXXXXAEEEAspAsnSerGluHisAlaArgTyrProMetValPheIleLeu-40.90.61.10.90.60.81.30.90.60.91.31.31.71.2-30.90.60.70.50.40.91.10.90.511.51.621.4-20.80.90.80.80.40.8110.511.41.51.81.4-10.50.60.80.90.40.91.11.10.611.41.41.81.4Ac-K10.70.90.90.80.41.21.20.90.80.71.31.31.61.320.710.90.90.51.11.210.80.81.21.11.51.330.6110.80.40.91.210.90.81.31.11.51.440.8110.90.411.10.90.90.81.21.41.41.450.91.310.90.40.91.10.90.70.71.21.31.21.5PositionSIRT1 (10 min) Fmoc-MAXXXX-AcK-XXXXXAEEEAspAsnSerGluHisAlaArgTyrProMetValPheIleLeu-40.90.81.410.60.81.40.90.70.81.30.11.841.3-30.90.810.70.511.110.811.60.12.141.3-20.81.10.910.50.911.10.711.50.12.041.3-10.60.8110.510.91.211.11.50.11.991.4Ac-K10.81.21.110.51.10.910.90.91.30.11.771.520.71.21.110.51.10.91.11.20.91.20.11.571.330.61.31.210.510.91.11.40.91.20.11.441.440.81.21.210.51.10.91.11.10.91.20.11.461.650.81.51.310.40.90.911.20.81.10.11.31.6 Open table in a new tab To directly investigate the lack of substrate specificity suggested by the oriented peptide library experiments, enzymatic analysis of SIRT1 deacetylation was performed using wild-type and mutant peptides corresponding to known SIRT1 substrates p53 (p53tide) and H3/RCH1 (SIRtide). The deacetylation kinetics are shown in Fig. 4. Despite the striking sequence differences, the measured Km values were remarkably similar, with values of 61 μm for p53tide and 50 μm for SIRtide. Similarly, modification of the SIRtide peptide, in which three amino acids on each side of the acetylated Lys were replaced by Ala (SIRtide-ALA6) or the four C-terminal residues of SIRtide were replaced by those from a histone H3 peptide, had little effect on the resulting kinetic parameters for SIRT1-mediated deacetylation (Table II). The Km values for all three substrates were not significantly different, whereas the SIRtide Vmax was 2-fold lower than the SIRtide-ALA6 and H3-like Vmax. In conclusion, by using enzymatic assays, we verified the unexpected peptide library results showing that SIRT1 lacks strong sequence specificity for the amino acid residues proximal to the acetylated Lys.Fig. 4Deacetylation kinetics of SIRT1 for peptide substrates.

First, we developed a novel peptide library-based screen to evaluate deacetylation substrate specificity in an unbiased manner, using chemical modification of free ϵ-amino groups of lysine, followed by biotin-streptavidin affinity capture, photorelease, and sequencing. The results of those experiments clearly showed that there was no preference for specific amino acids within 4 positions N-terminal and 5 positions C-terminal to the acetyl-lysine residue within peptide substrates. In contrast to the lack of sequence specificity we obtained for the SIRT1 protein deactylase, all known protein kinases and phosphopeptide-binding domains show explicit sequence specificity in the region immediately surrounding the phosphorylated residue, and these sequence motifs are easily deduced using peptide library-based screening approaches (19Rodriguez M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22719-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Second, we determined kinetic parameters of SIRT1 deacetylation using wild-type and mutant peptides corresponding to the acetylation sites on several known in vivo SIRT1 substrates. These measurements revealed very similar Km and Vmax values for acetylated peptides with widely divergent sequences flanking the acetyl-lysine site, again suggesting a lack of sequence specificity. It is not known whether the lack of sequence specificity that we observed for SIRT1 is a general feature of all protein deactylases. The peptide library approach that we devised in this study, however, should allow us to investigate in future studies whether consensus recognition sequences exist for other deacetylase enzymes, such as the class I and class II protein deacetylases (24Marks P.A. Miller T. Richon V.M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003; 3: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition, a variation of the amine modification/capture/photocleavage approach described here could be used to investigate the substrate specificity for protein acetyltransferases.Given the relative lack of motif specificity of SIRT1 that we observed on peptide substrates, what factors might account for the substrate specificity of SIRT1 in vivo? One possibility is that bona fide in vivo substrates of SIRT1 contain the acetylated sequence within a defined tertiary fold in the substrate that is lacking in short unstructured peptide substrates. The x-ray structure of the SIRT1 homolog Af2 bound to an acetylated p53 peptide, however, argues against this. In that structure, tight binding of the deacetylase to a small peptide substrate was observed (18Avalos J.L. Celic I. Muhammad S. Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This binding was mediated by insertion of the acetyl lysine residue into a hydrophobic tunnel and a series of hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms of two β-strands in Af2 to backbone atoms in the p53 peptide to form a staggered antiparallel three-stranded β-sheet (18Avalos J.L.

In a pancreatic tumor cell line expressing the endogenous CCK2R, we demonstrated the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway by this receptor and the involvement of this signaling pathway in the proliferative effects of the CCK2R. In addition, we showed in vivo that the targeted CCK2R expression in pancreas of Elas-CCK2 mice leads to the activation of JAK2 and STAT3.

Rosler K.M. Harrison D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1281-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). The mechanism of JAKs activation is well known for the cytokine receptors. Ligand binding induces oligomerization of the receptor subunits, constitutively associated to JAKs, and a transphosphorylation of the tyrosine kinases. Activated JAKs in turn phosphorylate the receptor that recruits the STAT proteins (1Rawlings J.S. Rosler K.M. Harrison D.A. J.

Thus, our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the activation of this signaling pathway by GPCRs remains limited. In particular it is not known whether a link exists between Gq protein and JAK family members. In addition, little is known about the role of the JAK pathway in the physiological or pathophysiological functions of GPCRs. The CCK2 receptor (CCK2R) is a seven-helix membrane-spanning receptor principally coupled to Gq proteins (7Gales C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Dufour M.N. Seva C. Moroder L. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Fourmy D.

Initially, this receptor was implicated in the secretory effects of a digestive peptide hormone, gastrin. However, the CCK2R is now recognized to mediate the mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of gastrin on gastrointestinal and pancreatic cells (8Aly A. Shulkes A. Baldwin G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1704: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). In the transgenic mice Elas-CCK2, CCK2 receptor expression has been targeted in pancreatic acinar cells using transcriptional elements of the elastase-1 gene (9Saillan-Barreau C. Clerc P. Adato M.

At least three six-month-old homozygous Elas-CCK2 mice in a B6SJLF1 background and three corresponding control littermate mice were used. Mice were reared in the routine animal facility of the IFR31 and maintained on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle. All the experiments were performed during the daytime. All procedures were approved by the IFR31 animal facility care committee.Immunohistochemistry—Mice were killed by decapitation, and pancreases were excised, fixed in Bouin's solution, and embedded in paraffin using standard techniques. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (10Clerc P. Leung-Theung-Long S. Wang T.C. Dockray G.J. Bouisson M. Delisle M.B. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Dufresne M.

For proliferation assays, an optimal number of AR4–2J cells (4 × 104 cells) were plated in 35-mm dishes, serum-starved for 24 h, then treated for 48 h with gastrin (10 nm). When indicated, cells were incubated with AG490 (10 μm). Cells were counted by using a Coulter electronic counter.JAK2 Kinase Assay—After gastrin stimulation cells were lysed, and JAK2 was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies (UBI). Kinase assays were performed and analyzed as described previously (20Ferrand A. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Bertrand C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Dufresne M. Seva C. Exp.

Murine JAK2 cDNA subcloned in pRK5 vector (pRK5-JAK2) was provided by Dr. James Ihle (Memphis, TN).Binding Studies and Measurement of Inositol Trisphosphate (IP3) Accumulation—24 h after transfection cells were transferred to 24-well culture plates and seeded at a density of 5,000 cells/well (binding studies) or 150,000 cells/well (IP3 measurement). Binding studies and measurement of IP3 accumulation were performed as described previously (7Gales C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Dufour M.N. Seva C. Moroder L. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Fourmy D.

Nonspecific binding was always less than 10% of total binding. Binding data were determined using the nonlinear least squares curve-fitting computer program LIGAND and GraphPad Prism Program (Software). EC50 were calculated using GraphPad Prism Program Software.Immunofluorescence Staining—COS-7 cells were grown for 24 h on plates containing cover slides. 24 h after transfection cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with methanol, blocked in 1% fetal calf serum-phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-HA antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co., Covance), anti-PY1007–1008 JAK2 antibody (UBI) according to standard immunofluorescence methods.

Among JAK family members, JAK2 is widely described to be involved in cancer, particularly in prostate and breast cancers. JAK2 activation was analyzed by immunohistochemical methods on pancreatic sections from control and Elas-CCK2R mice using antibodies specific for total JAK2 or by detecting the activated form of the protein phosphorylated on tyrosines 1007 and 1008 (PY-JAK2). The tissues derived from Elas-CCK2 mice demonstrated higher levels of JAK2 activation as compared with control mice (Fig. 1A, upper panels). In contrast, total JAK2 protein expression was unchanged in the two mice models (Fig. 1A, lower panels).To confirm and quantify JAK2 activation, Western blotting analyses were performed on lysates of acinar cells isolated from pancreas of control and Elas-CCK2 mice. JAK2 activation in Elas-CCK2 mice was significantly elevated (mean ± S.E.; 1.88-fold ± 0.08; 0.01 < p < 0.05; n = 3) as compared with controls (Fig. 1B). Thus, the expression of the CCK2R in mouse pancreatic acini induces JAK2 activation.CCK2R Expression in the Acini of Elas-CCK2 Mice Induces the Activation of STAT3—Among the STAT family members activated by the JAKs kinases, STAT3 is now recognized as an oncogene (21Bromberg J.

STAT3 activation was analyzed by immunohistochemical methods using antibodies specific for total STAT3 or detecting the activated form of the protein phosphorylated on tyrosine 705 (PY-STAT3). The tissues derived from Elas-CCK2 mice demonstrated higher levels of STAT3 activation as compared with control mice (Fig. 2A, upper panels). In contrast, total STAT3 protein expression was unchanged in the two mice models (Fig. 2A, lower panels).Fig. 2CCK2R expression in the acini of Elas-CCK2 mice induces the activation of STAT3. Immunohistochemistry analysis on paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues or Western blots (IB) on lysates from isolated acinar cells were performed using antibodies specific for total STAT3 (STAT3) or detecting the activated form of the protein, anti-PY705 STAT3 antibodies (PY-STAT3). Representative data from three experiments (three different animals in each group) are shown. A, original magnification ×40.

Thus, the expression of the CCK2R in mouse pancreatic acini induces the activation of the oncogene STAT3.Activation of the JAK2/STAT3 Pathway by the CCK2R in Acinar Tumor Cells—JAK2 is not only involved in cell proliferation or survival but also regulates many processes like inflammation or erythropoiesis (1Rawlings J.S. Rosler K.M. Harrison D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1281-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Thus, treating Elas-CCK2 mice with the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490 over weeks is not possible. Therefore, to address the role of JAK2 upstream of STAT3 activation induced by the CCK2R in acinar cells, we used the AR4–2J cells, the only pancreatic tumor cell line exhibiting an acinar phenotype, established after a chemoinduced tumorigenesis by azaserine. AR4–2J cells were previously shown to express an endogenous CCK2R (22Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. Science. 1994; 265: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).We first confirmed that the CCK2R was able to induce JAK2 activation in AR4–2J cells. Using JAK2 autophosphorylation ability, in vitro tyrosine kinase assays were performed in anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates from cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins. Gastrin (10 nm) significantly activates JAK2 in this cellular model (Fig. 3). We detected a rapid and significant increase in JAK2 phosphorylation at 1 min that was maximal after 1 h of stimulation by the CCK2R agonist (mean ± S.E.; 2.48-fold ±0.04 compared with control; p < 0.001; n = 3).Fig. 3CCK2R activates JAK2 in AR4–2J cells. AR4–2J cells were stimulated with gastrin (10 nm) for the times indicated. JAK2 activity was determined in an immune complex kinase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated (IP) proteins were also analyzed by Western blot (IB) using the anti-JAK2 antibody (JAK2).

Western blotting analysis performed with antibodies specific for the activated forms of STAT3 shows that CCK2R induces a significant activation of STAT3 from 15 to 120 min after gastrin treatment with a maximal activation after 60 min (mean ± S.E.; 3.04-fold ± 0.12 compared with control; p < 0.001; n = 3), whereas the amount of total STAT3 protein remains unchanged (Fig. 4). To determine the involvement of JAK2 in CCK2R-induced STAT3 activation, we then tested the effect of a JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, on STAT3 activation in response to gastrin. The phosphorylation of STAT3 after gastrin stimulation was completely blocked by the JAK2 inhibitor, indicating that CCK2R-induced STAT3 activation is totally JAK2-dependent in this cellular model.Fig. 4CCK2R activates STAT3 in AR4–2J cells. Serum-starved AR4–2J cells were stimulated with gastrin (10 nm) for different times. When indicated cells were pretreated with AG490 (10 μm) for 1 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-STAT3 antibodies and immunoblotted (IB) with the anti-PY-STAT3 antibody.

Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. Science. 1994; 265: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To study the role of JAK2 in the proliferation of acinar tumor cells induced by the CCK2R, we measured AR4–2J proliferation in the presence or absence of the JAK2-specific inhibitor 48 h after gastrin stimulation. CCK2R activation by gastrin induces a significant increase of cell proliferation (mean ± S.E.; 1.575-fold ± 0.18; p < 0.05; n = 3) (Fig. 5). Treatment of the cells with AG490 totally inhibits CCK2R-induced AR4–2J proliferation. This result confirms that JAK2 mediates CCK2R proliferative effects on AR4–2J cells.Fig. 5Role of JAK2 in acinar tumor cells proliferation induced by CCK2R activation.

We first validated this model for CCK2R-induced JAK2 activation. Using JAK2 autophosphorylation ability, in vitro tyrosine kinase assays were performed in anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates from cell lysates. Gastrin significantly activates JAK2 in this transiently transfected cell model. A rapid and significant activation of JAK2 (15 s), still detectable at 3 min, was found in response to gastrin (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis for JAK2 protein expression revealed an equal amount of the protein in transfected cells.Fig. 6Activation of JAK2 by CCK2R in COS-7 cells.A, COS-7 cells transiently transfected or not (NT) with cDNAs coding for the wild type human CCK2R and JAK2 were stimulated with gastrin (10 nm) for the times indicated.

Recently, the NPXXY motif (X represents any amino acid), located at the end of the seventh transmembrane domain, has been shown to be involved in Gq-dependent signaling pathways induced by the rat CCK2R. Mutation of the asparagine of the NPXXY motif of the rat CCK2R into alanine inhibits Gq-dependent pathways such as IP3 production or extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation induced by the receptor (7Gales C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Dufour M.N. Seva C. Moroder L. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Silvente-Poirot S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17321-17327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This motif is conserved within the human CCK2R sequence. We performed the corresponding mutation N386A on the human CCK2R, creating the N386A-CCK2R mutant, and studied its pharmacological characteristics (Table I). We first determined the affinity of the N386A-CCK2R mutant for its ligand by performing binding experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radioligand Scatchard analysis of binding to the WT-CCK2R and N386A-CCK2R mutant revealed that this CCK2R mutant possesses an affinity and a maximal binding capacity similar to the WT-CCK2R (Kd 2.8 ± 0.5 nm and Bmax 8.5 ± 1.5 pmol/106 cells versus Kd 1.8 ± 0.7 nm and Bmax 9.8 ± 4.0 pmol/106 cells, respectively). These data indicate that the mutation of asparagine 386 into alanine neither affects the high affinity binding of CCK2R agonists nor the cell surface receptor expression. However, mutating the asparagine into alanine dramatically down-regulates the total IP3 production (Table I; mean ± S.E.; 83.04% ± 3.943, 0.01 < p < 0.05; n = 4). These data confirm that the N386A-CCK2R mutant highly decreased Gq-dependent signaling. Therefore, we tested its effect on JAK2 activation. Our results (Fig. 7, A and B) show that the N386A-CCK2R mutant cannot mediate JAK2 activation, in contrast to the WT-CCK2R. In addition, we demonstrate that the activation of the downstream effector of JAK2, STAT3, is also blocked when the CCK2R is mutated on the NPXXY motif (Fig. 7C). Thus, we demonstrate here the involvement of the conserved NPXXY motif within the receptor sequence in the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway by the CCK2R and also the putative role of Gq in this mechanism.Table IPharmacological characteristics of the WT-CCK2R and N386A-CCK2R mutant transiently expressed in COS-7 cells Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three to five experiments performed in duplicate.ReceptorKdBmaxIP3 productionnmpmol/106 cells% maximumWT1.8 ± 0.79.8 ± 4.099.03 ± 1.58N386A2.8 ± 0.58.5 ± 1.515.98 ± 1.03 Open table in a new tab Fig. 7Involvement of the NPXXY motif in JAK2 activation by the CCK2R.A, COS-7 cells transiently transfected or not (NT) with cDNAs coding for the wild type human CCK2R (WT) or N386A mutant CCK2R and for JAK2 were stimulated or not with gastrin (10 nm) for 15 s.

https://openalex.org/W2082810201,"The PTEN tumour suppressor is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate (PIP3) and protein substrates. PTEN function is modulated by its carboxy-terminal region, which contains several clustered phosphorylation sites and a PDZ-binding motif (PDZbm). Although PTEN growth suppression effect is well demonstrated, its additional biological roles are less well understood. DAF-18, a Caenorhabditis elegans homologue PTEN, is a component of the insulin/IGF-I signalling pathway that controls entry to the dauer larval stage and adult longevity. To further explore the role of PTEN in the insulin signalling cascade and its possible involvement in the mechanisms of ageing, we undertook a study of PTEN function in C. elegans. We now report that human PTEN can substitute for DAF-18 and restores the dauer and longevity phenotypes in worms devoid of DAF-18. Furthermore, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that dauer and lifespan control depends on PTEN-mediated regulation of PIP3 levels. Finally, we established that phosphorylation sites in the C-terminus of PTEN and its PDZbm are necessary for PTEN control of the insulin/IGF-I pathway. These results demonstrate that PTEN negatively regulates the insulin/IGF pathway in a whole organism and raise the hypothesis that PTEN may be involved in mammalian ageing."

https://openalex.org/W2041329755,"Peptide growth factors contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases by inducing a variety of cellular responses including anti-apoptotic effects. Several of the signaling molecules that are activated by growth factor receptors such as Src family kinases (Src), phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), Ras, and SHP-2 were shown to mediate survival signals. We systematically investigated the relative contribution of each signaling molecule for growth factor-dependent cell survival in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Our approach was the use of mutated plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) β-receptors (βPDGFR) in which the tyrosine residues required for binding of each signaling molecule were individually mutated to phenylalanine. To bypass endogenous PDGFR in VSMC we used chimeric receptors (ChiRs), containing the extracellular domain of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of the wild type (WT) or mutated βPDGFR. Selective activation of the ChiR-WT with M-CSF significantly reduced apoptosis to the same extent as PDGF-BB in non-transfected cells. Deletion of the binding site for PI3K, but not for Src, RasGAP, SHP-2, or PLCγ, completely abolished the anti-apoptotic effect. Consistently, a ChiR mutant that only binds PI3K was fully able to mediate cell survival as efficiently as the ChiR-WT. Furthermore, the PDGF-dependent anti-apoptotic effect in non-transfected cells was completely abolished by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, whereas inhibitors of Src, PLCγ, ERK, or p38 MAP kinase had no effect. The exploration of downstream signaling events revealed that PDGF-BB activates the anti-apoptotic Akt signaling pathway in a PI3K-dependent manner. Moreover, Akt phosphorylates and thus inactivates the pro-apoptotic proteins BAD and Forkhead transcription factors (FKHR, FKHRL1). We conclude that growth factor-dependent cell survival in VSMC is mediated only by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, whereas all other receptor-associated signaling molecules do not play a significant role.

These growth factors exert their biological responses via activation of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Upon ligand binding, receptor tyrosine kinases autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues and subsequently recruit and activate SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as Src family kinases (Src), the GTPase activating protein of Ras (RasGAP), the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ) (2.Heldin C.H.

Each of the above studies investigated only one of the growth factor-activated signal relay enzymes, and most studies used either pharmacological inhibitors, which may lack specificity, or a dominant-negative approach, which may influence cell survival by overexpressed protein levels. Additionally, inhibitors as well as overexpressed dominant-negative proteins suppress the basal activity of the inhibited signaling molecule in unstimulated cells, limiting the significance about their role for ligand-induced cellular responses. Hence, the relative roles of Src, PLCγ, RasGAP, PI3K, and SHP-2 for growth factor-mediated cell survival are not clear from these studies. Therefore, we sought to systematically evaluate the relative contribution of each of the above signaling molecules for growth factor-mediated cell survival in one system. We chose the PDGF β-receptor (βPDGFR), because this receptor tyrosine kinase, which is highly relevant for atherogenesis and tumorigenesis, binds each of the receptor-associated signal relay enzymes at one specific binding site. Our approach was to characterize βPDGFR mutants in which the binding sites for one or more of the receptor-associated signaling enzymes were individually deleted by selective tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions. Importantly, we studied PDGFR signaling in VSMC, which are critically involved in atherogenesis, and in which PDGFR signaling is physiologically relevant, as these cells express endogenous PDGFR and thus respond to PDGF. However, to selectively stimulate PDGFR mutants in PDGFR-expressing cells, it is necessary to bypass endogenous βPDGFR. Therefore, we used chimeric M-CSF receptor (CSF1R)/βPDGFR mutants (ChiR) containing the extracellular domain of the CSF1R, which is not expressed in naive VSMC, and the cytoplasmic domain of the βPDGFR. By these chimeras, βPDGFR signaling is selectively stimulated with M-CSF. The use of this highly efficient system allowed us to selectively activate individual signaling molecules that are recruited to the ligand-stimulated βPDGFR and to compare the ability of the various ChiR mutants to protect VSMC against apoptosis. Cell Culture—VSMC were isolated from rat thoracic aorta (Wistar Kyoto; 6-10 weeks old; Charles River Wega GmbH, Sulzfeld, Germany) by enzymatic dispersion as described (21.Chamley-Campbell J.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, retroviral supernatants were added to VSMC. Positive infectants were selected with 0.8 mg/ml G418. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Quiescent VSMC were left resting or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB or M-CSF for times indicated in the presence or absence of inhibitors as indicated. Cells were washed twice with HS (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and then lysed in EB (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged (20 min, 12,000 × g), and the supernatants were subjected to immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipitation. The βPDGFR and the ChiRs were precipitated with a polyclonal βPDGFR antibody (97A) recognizing the kinase insert (amino acids 698-797) of the human βPDGFR. βPDGFR immunoprecipitations representing ∼3 × 106 cells were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon and subjected to Western blot analysis. To monitor the association of signaling molecules with the activated βPDGFR, receptor immunoprecipitations from resting or M-CSF-stimulated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using antisera against the extracellular domain of the human CSF1R (anti-CSF1R), PLCγ, RasGAP, p85, and SHP-2. To monitor the association between Src and the ChiRs, Src was immunoprecipitated from resting or M-CSF-stimulated cells using the Src-2 antibody, and immunoprecipitates representing ∼3 × 106 cells were subjected to anti-CSF1R or anti-Src Western blot analysis. BAD was precipitated with a monoclonal BAD antibody. Immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose, spun through an EB sucrose gradient, and then washed three times with EB. Bound proteins were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. BAD immunoprecipitations representing ∼2 × 107 cells were resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using a polyclonal BAD antibody or a phosphospecific (Ser-136) BAD antibody. To monitor the expression levels of ChiR mutants in VSMC and the phosphorylation state of downstream signaling molecules, whole cell lysates representing ∼3 × 106 cells were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed with anti-CSF1R, and antibodies were raised against RasGAP (lysate control), BAD and phosphorylated Akt, GSK3β, BAD, FKHR, and FKHRL1. The results presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. Induction and Detection of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was induced by either UV irradiation (254 nm, 70 mJ/cm2) or H2O2 (100 μm). A cell death detection ELISA (Roche Diagnostics) was used to measure cell death by the detection of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes). Cells (5,000 cells/well) were plated into 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. To assess the anti-apoptotic effect of PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) or M-CSF (50 ng/ml), the cells were UV light-irradiated and subsequently cultured for 8 h in the absence or presence of ligand. Alternatively, the cells were incubated for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing H2O2 in the presence or absence of PDGF-BB or M-CSF. The cell lysates were collected, and apoptosis was measured using the cell death detection ELISA. Materials—PDGF-BB and M-CSF were purchased from Promo Cell (Heidelberg, Germany). The polyclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of the human CSF1R was from Upstate Biotechnology. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (PY20) and Upstate Biotechnology (4G10). The antibody against SHP-2 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (dPTP1D), and the PLCγ antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. The antibodies against the βPDGFR (97A), RasGAP (69.3), and the p85 subunit of PI3K were kind gifts from Andrius Kazlauskas and Alex Toker (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The Src-2 antibody used for immunoprecipitation of Src was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and recognizes the Src family members Src, Yes, and Fyn. For Western blot analysis of Src, a mouse monoclonal antibody, 327 (Oncogene Science Inc.), was used. The polyclonal phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-FKHR (Thr-24)/FKHRL1 (Thr-32), phospho-Bad (Ser-136), Akt, and BAD antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies. The monoclonal BAD antibody was from BD Biosciences. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was evaluated by non-parametric analysis. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Characterization of Chimeric CSF1R/βPDGFR Mutants—To systematically evaluate the role of each of the βPDGFR signaling molecules (Src, PI3K, RasGAP, SHP-2, and PLCγ) for growth factor-mediated cell survival in a single cell type, we created a series of ChiR in which the tyrosine residues required for the association of each of the above signaling enzymes were individually mutated to phenylalanine (subtraction mutants) (Fig. 1A). A second set of ChiRs (add-back mutants) was based on the F5 receptor, in which the 5 tyrosine phosphorylation sites responsible for binding of PI3K, RasGAP, SHP-2, and PLCγ were mutated. This panel of receptors included mutants that have the tyrosine residue(s) required for binding of one of the associated proteins restored (Fig. 1B). In this panel, the Src-binding sites were left intact, as their mutation in the juxtamembrane region was shown to attenuate the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the full-length βPDGFR (25.Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All ChiR were stably expressed in VSMC. Additionally, an “F6” receptor was expressed, which carries an additional mutation at position 716 of F5. This tyrosine is reported to bind the Grb2 adaptor protein (29.Arvidsson A.K. Rupp E. Nanberg E. Downward J. Ronnstrand L. Wennstrom S. Schlessinger J. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is involved in mediating Ras activation via binding of SOS. Finally, we generated a kinase-inactive receptor, referred to as R634, which carried a lysine to arginine mutation at position R634 within the kinase domain and served as a negative control. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, A and D, all ChiR were expressed at equal levels.Fig. 2A and B, expression levels, tyrosine phosphorylation, and binding characteristics of the subtraction panel of ChiR mutants. A, expression levels. Resting VSMC expressing the various constructs were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against the extracellular domain of the M-CSF receptor (CSF1R) (top panel) or RasGAP as a lysate control (bottom panel). B, M-CSF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and association with signaling molecules. Quiescent VSMC expressing either the ChiR-WT or the various phosphorylation site mutants were left resting (-) or stimulated with M-CSF (+) for 5 min. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with an antiserum recognizing the βPDGFR. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoblotting with anti-CSF1R revealed that there were similar amounts of ChiR present in all of the samples. The receptor blot was stripped and reprobed with a mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antisera. Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates was also performed using antisera against p85, RasGAP, PLCγ, and SHP-2 to detect co-immunoprecipitation of these signaling molecules with the activated ChiR. C, M-CSF-dependent association of ChiR-WT, F79/81, and R634 with Src. The R634 receptor has lysine at position 634 replaced with arginine and has no detectable in vitro kinase activity and was used as a negative control. Cells were stimulated and lysed and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum that recognizes multiple Src family members. Immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-CSF1R to detect coimmunoprecipitation of the ChiR mutants (upper panel) or with anti-Src to determine the amount of Src in each of the samples (lower panel). D and E, expression levels, tyrosine phosphorylation, and binding characteristics of the add-back panel of ChiR mutants. The analysis was done as described under A and B. D, expression levels. E, M-CSF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and association with signaling molecules. The results presented are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the ligand-induced autophosphorylation of the receptor and M-CSF-dependent binding of signaling molecules, ChiRs were immunoprecipitated from resting or M-CSF-stimulated cells, and the samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against the extracellular domain of the CSF1R and against each of the signal relay enzymes. In addition, the receptor blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, B and E, M-CSF increased the phosphotyrosine content of all of the receptors, with the exception of the kinase-inactive mutant (R634). The level of receptor autophosphorylation was not substantially decreased, even in mutants missing up to five or six phosphorylation sites. This may reflect the presence of additional phosphorylation sites, or the ability of the receptor to autophosphorylate at cryptic sites. A similar phenomenon is observed with mutants of the αPDGFR (28.Rosenkranz S. DeMali K.A. Gelderloos J.A. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28335-28343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ChiR-WT co-immunoprecipitated with Src, the p85 subunit of PI3K, RasGAP, SHP-2, and PLCγ in a M-CSF-dependent manner. No ChiR expression or binding of receptor-associated proteins was detected in receptor immunoprecipitations from M-CSF-stimulated non-transfected VSMC. The mutation of tyrosine 1021 largely reduced the binding of PLCγ, the F40/51 mutant failed to associate with PI3K (p85), and the F771, F1009, and F79/81 mutants did not bind RasGAP, SHP-2, and Src upon M-CSF stimulation, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). Fig. 2E demonstrates the binding characteristics of the add-back panel of ChiRs. Restoration of the PLCγ, RasGAP, and PI3K-binding sites at tyrosines 1021, 771, and 740/51 rescued the M-CSF-dependent association with PLCγ, RasGAP, and p85, respectively, whereas none of the other signal relay enzymes associated with these receptors. All add-back mutants associated with trace amounts of p85. Surprisingly, SHP-2 bound to the activated F5 receptor and to all add-back mutants, with the exception of the F6 and Y40/51 receptors. This suggests that SHP-2 is able to associate with at least one additional binding site besides tyrosine 1009 and, furthermore, that either binding or activation of PI3K prevents SHP-2 binding to this or these additional site(s). Rönnstrand et al. (30.Ronnstrand L. Arvidsson A.K. Kallin A. Rorsman C. Hellman U. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have reported that SHP-2 is also capable to bind to phosphorylated tyrosine 763, which is relatively close to the PI3K-binding site. This suggests that PI3K binding may sterically hinder the association of SHP-2 with phosphorylated tyrosine 763. R634, which served as a negative control in the biological assays, was not autophosphorylated, and failed to recruit βPDGFR-associated signaling molecules upon M-CSF stimulation. These data demonstrate that the ChiR mutant system works sufficiently in VSMC and enabled us to reliably investigate anti-apoptotic βPDGFR signaling. M-CSF Mimics PDGF-dependent Cell Survival in ChiR-WT-expressing VSMC—To confirm that the activated ChiR-WT mimics PDGF-BB-dependent survival responses we compared the apoptosis rate of PDGF-stimulated non-transfected VSMC with that of M-CSF-treated ChiR-WT-expressing VSMC upon UV irradiation or H2O2 treatment. Irradiation and H2O2 treatment led to a 2.13 ± 0.54 and 5.31 ± 1.12-fold increase in cell death, respectively (Fig. 3A). The supplementation of culture medium with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB significantly decreased irradiation- and H2O2-induced cell death by 48 ± 14 and 41 ± 21%, respectively (both p < 0.05). Consistently, irradiation or treatment of ChiR-WT-expressing VSMC with H2O2 caused a 1.59 ± 0.17 and 2.51 ± 0.27-fold increase in apoptotic cell death, respectively, compared with non-treated cells. Co-incubation with M-CSF (50 ng/ml) significantly reduced the rate of irradiation- or H2O2-induced apoptosis by 42 ± 12 and 40 ± 11%, respectively (both p < 0.05), whereas it had no effect on cell survival in non-transfected VSMC (not shown). Hence, stimulation of βPDGFR signaling by M-CSF in ChiR-WT-expressing VSMC was sufficient to mediate PDGF-induced responses to the same extent as PDGF-BB in non-transfected cells. Systematic Evaluation of βPDGFR-mediated Anti-apoptotic Signaling in VSMC—To investigate the role of each of the signaling molecules for βPDGFR-induced protection from apoptosis, we compared this response in VSMC expressing either ChiR-WT or the various mutant receptors. We induced apoptosis by UV irradiation of quiescent cells. An analysis of the subtraction panel revealed that deletion of the binding site for PI3K (F40/51), but not for Src, RasGAP, SHP-2, or PLCγ, completely suppressed the anti-apoptotic effect (Fig. 3B). Consistently, binding and activation of only PI3K without activation of RasGAP, SHP-2, and PLCγ via the Y40/51 receptor was sufficient to mediate the complete M-CSF-induced anti-apoptotic effect. In contrast, all other add-back mutants were unable to mediate a significant anti-apoptotic effect (Fig. 3C). To exclude the possibility that our findings were limited to one specific inducer of apoptosis, we repeated our experiments when apoptosis was induced by H2O2. Similar to the above studies, a lack of PI3K binding (F40/51) completely abolished the anti-apoptotic effect mediated by the ChiR-WT, whereas restoration of the PI3K-binding site to the F5 receptor (Y40/51) fully salvaged this cellular response (Fig. 3D). Inhibition of Signaling Molecules by Pharmacological Inhibitors in Non-transfected Cells—A potential caveat of utilizing receptor mutants is the possibility that, in addition to the known binding partners of phosphotyrosines, other unknown signaling molecules may also interact with these sites. To confirm the results, which we obtained by the use of ChiR mutants, in a second approach, we repeated all measurements in PDGF-stimulated non-transfected VSMC in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors. Consistently, inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin completely suppressed the anti-apoptotic effect of PDGF-BB after UV irradiation, indicating that this signaling enzyme is involved in anti-apoptotic signaling, whereas inhibition of Src kinases (using SU6656), MEK1 (PD98059), and p38 MAPK (SB203580) had no effect on PDGF-dependent antiapoptotic signaling (Fig. 4). Interestingly, inhibition of PLCγ by U-73122 also suppressed PDGF-mediated cell survival after UV irradiation but not when apoptosis was induced by H2O2. However, U-73122 appeared to affect cell survival by itself when used in higher concentrations (not shown). In summary, our data clearly demonstrate that anti-apoptotic signaling by the βPDGFR is mediated by only one of the receptor-associated signaling mol"
https://openalex.org/W2021690297,"Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play roles in inflammatory tissue injury, we asked whether MMP secretion by gastric epithelial cells may contribute to gastric injury in response to signals involved in Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammation and/or cyclooxygenase inhibition. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated gastric cell MMP-1 secretion, indicating that MMP-1 secretion occurs in inflammatory as well as non-inflammatory situations. MMP-1 secretion required activation of the MAPK Erk and subsequent protein synthesis but was down-regulated by the alternate MAPK, p38. In contrast, secretion of MMP-13 was stimulated by TNF-α/IL-1β but not EGF and was Erk-independent and mediated by p38. MMP-13 secretion was more rapid (peak, 6 h) than MMP-1 (peak ≥30 h) and only partly depended on protein synthesis, suggesting initial release of a pre-existing MMP-13 pool. Therefore, MMP-1 and MMP-13 secretion are differentially regulated by MAPKs. MMP-1 secretion was regulated by E prostaglandins (PGEs) in an Erk-dependent manner. PGEs enhanced Erk activation and MMP-1 secretion in response to EGF but inhibited Erk and MMP-1 when TNF-α and IL-1β were the stimuli, indicating that the effects of PGEs on gastric cell responses are context-dependent. These data show that secretion of MMPs is differentially regulated by MAPKs and suggest mechanisms through which H. pylori infection and/or cyclooxygenase inhibition may induce epithelial cell signaling to contribute to gastric ulcerogenesis. Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play roles in inflammatory tissue injury, we asked whether MMP secretion by gastric epithelial cells may contribute to gastric injury in response to signals involved in Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammation and/or cyclooxygenase inhibition.

Two major risk factors for gastritis and PUD are gastric colonization with Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (3Langman M.J. Fundam. Clin.

Thus, H. pylori colonization may influence gastric cells to promote inflammation (5Blaser M.J. Atherton J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) and damage the gastric mucosa. In contrast, NSAID-induced PUD is accompanied by relatively little inflammation (28El-Zimaity H.M. Genta R.M. Graham D.Y. Hum. Pathol. 1996; 27: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NSAIDs are presumed to damage the gastric mucosa by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and depleting E prostaglandins (PGEs). PGEs regulate gastric blood flow and production of bicarbonate and mucus; thus, down-regulated PGE synthesis may impair barrier function of the gastric mucosa (29Johansson C. Bergstrom S. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1982; 77: 21-46PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, replenishment of PGEs using the synthetic PGE analog misoprostal reduces the gastrotoxicity of NSAIDs (30Chan F.K. Sung J.J. Gastrointest. Endosc. Clin. N. Am. 1997; 7: 671-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that prostaglandins directly regulate gastric cell function has not been rigorously examined, despite complex effects on signal transduction exerted by PGEs in many cell types (20Pillinger M.H.

This model suggests that autodestruction of stromal tissue in response to inflammatory stimuli may be mediated by MMP production and regulated by MAPKs and prostaglandins. In the present study, we examined gastric epithelial cell responses to signals relevant to exposure to H. pylori and to NSAIDs. We asked whether cytokine stimulation of gastric epithelial cells regulates MMP secretion and whether such regulation is MAPK- and/or prostaglandin-dependent. Our observations suggest a model in which gastric ulceration is propagated by the transduction of exogenous pro-inflammatory signals into the gastric cells themselves and by a gastric cell response that may result in autologous destruction of gastric tissue.

AGS cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. MMP-1 and MMP-13 activity kits were from R and D Systems. Cell Culture and Cell Treatment—AGS human cells derived from a gastric epithelial tumor (41Georgescu H.I. Mendelow D. Evans C.H. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1988; 24: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were cultured in 6-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells grown to near confluence were serum-starved for 24 h (0% fetal bovine serum) before stimulation and/or other treatment. Unless otherwise specified, the following concentrations of reagents were used: IL-1β, TNF-α, and epidermal growth factor (EGF), 20 ng/ml each; PGE1, PGE2, UO126, SB203580, and SB202190, 10 μm each; PD98059, 50 μm; and cycloheximide, 10 μg/ml. Erk and p38 Phosphorylation and Activation—Erk activation was defined as the degree of phosphorylation of the activating tyrosine and threonines on Erk 1 and 2, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Erk antiserum. Similarly, p38 activation was defined as p38 phosphorylation usng anti-phospho-p38 antiserum. AGS cells were serum-starved for 24 h, followed by experimental treatment. Lysates were prepared as described, protein levels were measured, and equivalent amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting for the phosphorylated, active forms of Erk (20Pillinger M.H.

Immunoblots imaged by chemiluminescence and autoradiography were quantitated by densitometry. Duplicate samples were immunoblotted for total Erk1/2 or p38, and Erk and p38 activation was reported as phosphorylated/total protein. Because the actual units of quantitation were arbitrary, results were normalized to either the unstimulated or maximally stimulated condition, as appropriate. MMP Secretion—MMP secretion was determined as described previously (20Pillinger M.H. Rosenthal P.B. Tolani S.N. Apsel B. Dinsell V. Greenberg J. Chan E.S. Gomez P.F. Abramson S.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, after AGS cells were grown to near confluence and serum-starved for 24 h, supernatants were removed and replaced with fresh medium. After a 30–60-min period for equilibration, the cells were stimulated, and the supernatants were recovered and concentrated in Centricon™ centrifugal filter devices (Mr cutoff, 30,000) for 35 min at 5000 × g at 4 °C. Aliquots of the concentrated supernatants were supplemented with Laemmli buffer and assayed for MMP-1 and MMP-13 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate anti-MMP antisera (1:200 dilution) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Visualization and quantitation were as described for Erk. Measurement of secretion of active MMP-1 and MMP-13 was performed using commercially available kits, according to the manufacturer's instructions. MMP-1 and MMP-13 Secretion Stimulated by TNF-α, IL-1β, and EGF—We first examined whether AGS cell stimulation could induce MMP-1 secretion. TNF-α, IL-1β, or both (18 h) induced MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 1, A, top panel, and B). Because TNF-α/IL-1β together induced more MMP-1 secretion than either alone (TNF-α/IL-1β versus TNF-α, p = 0.03; TNF-α/IL-1β versus IL-1β, p = 0.05) and because both cytokines are implicated in gastrointestinal ulcerogenesis (7Lanas A.

Barchowsky A. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), most subsequent experiments were performed using TNF-α/IL-1β together. Significant TNF-α/IL-1β stimulation of MMP-1 secretion was first observed after 12 h, and MMP-1 continued to accumulate for at least 30 h (Fig. 1C). EGF also stimulated MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 1A, top panel, and B). MMP-1 secretion in response to EGF was also delayed (>12 h after stimulation), and MMP-1 continued to accumulate for 24 h (Fig. 1C). These data confirm that AGS cell MMP-1 secretion is responsive to both inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Moreover, MMP-1 secreted in response to both EGF and TNF-α/IL-1β was enzymatically active (Fig. 1D). TNF-α/IL-1β also significantly stimulated secretion of enzymatically active MMP-13 (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, B, and D). TNF-α, but not IL-1β alone, also increased MMP-13 secretion. MMP-13 secretion occurred in response to TNF-α/IL-1β as early as 1 h after stimulation and reached steady-state levels more rapidly (≤6 h) than MMP-1 (Fig. 1C). In contrast to MMP-1, EGF did not stimulate MMP-13 secretion (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, and B). Therefore, AGS cell MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression, secretion, and activity are differentially regulated in a stimulus-specific manner. Role of Protein Synthesis in MMP-1 and MMP-13 Secretion— The differing kinetics of MMP-1 and MMP-13 secretion suggested that these MMPs might differ with regard to a requirement for protein synthesis. To evaluate this possibility, we tested the effects of cycloheximide (CHX), which inhibits protein synthesis by affecting binding and activity of transfer RNA (44Obrig T.G. Culp W.J. McKeehan W.L. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHX almost completely inhibited MMP-1 secretion in response to both EGF (Fig. 2A) and TNF-α/IL-1β (Fig. 2B), confirming the dependence of MMP-1 secretion on protein synthesis. In contrast, MMP-13 secretion after 1 h was almost entirely insensitive to CHX treatment (Fig. 2C), and MMP-13 secretion after 18 h was only partly inhibited (Fig. 2B), suggesting initial release of pre-formed MMP-13, followed by later secretion of newly synthesized protein. These data provide further evidence that secretion of MMP-1 and MMP-13 is differentially regulated. Erk Regulates MMP-1 but not MMP-13 Expression by Gastric Epithelial Cells—Because EGF, a canonical activator of Erk (45Selva E. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2250-2254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimulated MMP-1 secretion from AGS cells, we next asked whether Erk regulates MMP-1. EGF stimulation of AGS cells induced rapid but transient activation of Erk (peak at 15–30 min), with return to baseline by 4 h. TNF-α/IL-1β also stimulated transient Erk activation, with similar kinetics (Fig. 3A–C). Thus, in both cytokine- and EGF-stimulated AGS cells, Erk activation and return to baseline activity precede MMP-1 secretion. Consistent with the effects of cytokines on MMP-1 secretion, TNF-α/IL-1β stimulated greater Erk activation than either cytokine alone. To determine whether Erk activation is required for MMP-1 expression, we tested the effects of UO126 (46Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of MEK, the proximal activator of Erk (47Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8205-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). UO126 inhibited both EGF- and TNF-α/IL-1β-stimulated Erk activation, as well as MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 4A and B). PD98059, another specific MEK inhibitor (48Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), also inhibited both Erk activation and MMP-1 secretion in response to EGF or TNF-α/IL-1β (data not shown). Taken together, these studies confirm that Erk activation mediates MMP-1 secretion from AGS cells in response to either EGF or TNF-α/IL-1β. TNF-α/IL-1β-stimulation of MMP-13 secretion after 18 h was not significantly inhibited by UO126 (Fig. 4B) or PD98059 (data not shown). MMP-13 secretion after 1 h of TNF-α/IL-1β stimulation was also not inhibited by UO126 (data not shown). Thus, Erk activity appears not to regulate either the protein synthesis-dependent or synthesis-independent components of MMP-13 secretion. This observation is consistent with the failure of EGF to stimulate MMP-13 secretion. Erk Activation Is an Early Event in MMP-1 Secretion—The observation that Erk activation returned to baseline hours before detectable MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 3C) suggested that Erk activation is an early step leading to MMP-1 secretion. To test this hypothesis, we exposed AGS cells to UO126 before or after EGF or TNF-α/IL-1β stimulation. Incubation of AGS cells with UO126 prior to stimulation resulted in expected inhibition of MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 5), but adding UO126 90 min after EGF or TNF-α/IL-1β stimulation resulted in little or no inhibition of MMP-1 secretion. Thus, Erk activation initiates a process leading to MMP-1 secretion, but continual Erk activity is not required. p38 Activity Inhibits MMP-1 Secretion via Inhibition of Erk—Because p38 activity typically promotes inflammatory phenotypes (49Kumar S. Boehm J. Lee J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 50Herlaar E. Brown Z. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that p38 would positively regulate MMP secretion and, conversely, that its inhibition would abrogate secretion. We first confirmed that TNF-α/IL-1β transiently stimulated p38 phosphoactivation in AGS cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast, EGF only marginally stimulated p38 in these experiments. Unexpectedly, the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (51Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar) enhanced MMP-1 secretion in AGS cells stimulated with either EGF or TNF-α/IL-1β (Fig. 4, A and B). SB202190, another selective p38 inhibitor (52Manthey C.L. Wang S.W. Kinney S.D. Yao Z. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), had similar effects (data not shown). SB203580 (Fig. 4, A and B), as well as SB202190 (data not shown), also enhanced Erk activation in response to either EGF or TNF-α/IL-1β. Thus, the effects of p38 inhibition on MMP-1 secretion and Erk activation were concordant. The observations that SB203580 alone stimulated Erk activation and MMP-1 secretion and that both of these processes were inhibited by UO126 (Fig. 4D) indicate that p38 tonically inhibits Erk activity and MMP-1 secretion, regardless of cell stimulation status, and that its inhibitory action on MMP-1 is mediated, at least in part, via Erk inhibition. In contrast to the enhancing effects of p38 inhibitors on Erk and MMP-1, both SB203580 (Fig. 4B) and SB202190 (data not shown) inhibited both p38 phosphoactivation and MMP-13 secretion in AGS cells stimulated with TNF-α/IL-1β. These studies show that p38 provides a positive signal for MMP-13 secretion, further evidence that MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression is differentially regulated by MAPKs in AGS cells. The observation that SB203580 failed to inhibit the early, CHX-independent phase of MMP-13 secretion (Fig. 4C) indicates that p38 regulates the later, protein synthesis-dependent phase of MMP-13 secretion. PGEs Regulate Erk Activation and MMP-1 but not MMP-13 Secretion in Gastric Cells—Because PGEs inhibit both Erk and MMP-1 responses in other cell types (15DiBattista J.A. Pelletier J.P. Zafarullah M.

Rapuano B.E. Bockman R.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 21-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether they would affect AGS cells. Preincubation of AGS cells with PGE1 or PGE2 enhanced both Erk activation and MMP-1 secretion in response to EGF (Fig. 6A). In contrast, PGE1 and PGE2 inhibited Erk activation and MMP-1 secretion in cells stimulated with TNF-α/IL-1-β (Fig. 6B). In the absence of other stimuli, PGE1 and PGE2 independently stimulated both Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 6C) and MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 6D), and PGE-stimulated MMP-1 secretion was inhibited by UO126. In total, these studies demonstrate that PGEs exert stimulus-specific effects on Erk and MMP-1 in AGS cells and that the capacity of PGEs to independently induce MMP-1 secretion depends upon their ability to activate Erk. In contrast, neither PGE1 nor PGE2 significantly inhibited TNF-α/IL-1-β-stimulated MMP-13 secretion, consistent with the observation that MMP-13 secretion is Erk-independent (inhibition of TNF-α/IL-1-β-stimulated MMP-13 secretion: PGE1, 27 ± 24%, p = 0.19; PGE2, 29 ± 22%, p = 0.15). The pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease is not well understood. We considered whether MMP secretion from host cells might contribute to gastric tissue stromal destruction because MMPs have analogous roles in other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (19Martel-Pelletier J.

https://openalex.org/W2059928769,"The degradation and sorting of cytoplasmic and cell-surface proteins are crucial steps in the control of cellular functions. We previously identified three mammalian Vps (vacuolar protein sorting) proteins, Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) and signal transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) 1 and -2, which are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon cytokine/growth factor stimulation. Hrs and the STAMs each contain a ubiquitin-interacting motif and through formation of a complex are involved in the vesicle transport of early endosomes. To explore the mechanism and cellular function of this complex in mammalian cells, we established an Hrs-defective fibroblastoid cell line (hrs-/-); embryos with this genotype died in utero. In the hrs-/- cells only trace amounts of STAM1 and STAM2 were detected. Introduction of wild-type Hrs or an Hrs mutant with an intact STAM binding domain (Hrs-dFYVE) fully restored STAM1 and STAM2 expression, whereas mutants with no STAM binding ability (Hrs-dC2, Hrs-dM) failed to express the STAMs. This regulated control of STAM expression by Hrs was independent of transcription. Interestingly, STAM1 degradation was mediated by proteasomes and was partially dependent on the ubiquitin-interacting motif of STAM1. Revertant Hrs expression in hrs-/- cells not only led to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, including intracytoplasmic vesicles, but also restored STAM1 levels in early endosomes and eliminated the enlarged endosome phenotype caused by the absence of Hrs. These results suggest that Hrs is a master molecule that controls in part the degradation of STAM1 and the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.

Membrane traffic is a dynamic process that is responsible for the maintenance of cellular metabolism, stress response, down-regulation of cell-surface molecules, and signal transduction. Cell-surface molecules, including growth factor receptors that bind to specific ligands or macromolecules, are internalized from the cell surface into membrane compartments called endosomes. Although some cargos are pinched off in recycling endosomes to be sent back to the cell surface, other receptors and molecules are pinched off into endosomes that form multivesicular bodies (MVB). 1The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular bodies; Vps, vacuolar protein sorting; Hrs, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate; STAM1 and STAM2, signal transducing adaptor molecule 1 and 2; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; VHS, Vps27-Hrs-STAM; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; RT, reverse transcription; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblastoid; HA, hemagglutinin; E3, ubiquitin ligase; Ub, ubiquitin.1The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular bodies; Vps, vacuolar protein sorting; Hrs, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate; STAM1 and STAM2, signal transducing adaptor molecule 1 and 2; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; VHS, Vps27-Hrs-STAM; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; RT, reverse transcription; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblastoid; HA, hemagglutinin; E3, ubiquitin ligase; Ub, ubiquitin. As the maturation step proceeds, early endosomes become acidic to form late endosomes, which then fuse with acidic compartments called lysosomes, which contain many acidic proteases. Although it has not been clear how receptors that have captured their ligands are recognized and sequestered into the endocytic vesicles, a growing body of evidence suggests the involvement of monoubiquitin modification and implicates the intracytoplasmic region of the receptors (1Raiborg C. Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar).The identification of vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) mutants has permitted genetic analyses in yeast to identify the proteins that make up the core machinery for MVB formation. The functional loss of Vps proteins results in deformed MVBs with unusually enlarged vesicles, called “class E” compartments, and defective vesicular trafficking. At present, 17 Vps genes are known; they are genetically categorized into four kinds of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), ESCRT-0, I, II, and III. One of the ESCRT proteins involved in MVB formation is yeast Vps27. Vps27, along with Hse1, acts in an ESCRT-0 complex upstream of ESCRT-I to assist in protein sorting (2Bilodeau P.S. Urbanowski J.L.

Hrs also contains an N-terminal VHS (Vps27-Hrs-STAM) domain and a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM).

Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an accumulation of ligand-activated epidermal growth factor receptors within early endosomes is observed in cells overexpressing Hrs, suggesting the involvement of Hrs in ubiquitinated protein sorting (11Raiborg C.

The STAMs have a unique structure, including a VHS, a UIM, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and an ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) (3Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N.

We and others reported that the ITAMs of STAM1 and STAM2 associate with Hrs through its second coiled-coil (CC2) domain (4Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Like its binding partner, STAM2 binds directly to ubiquitins (19Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12513-12521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Both Hrs and the STAMs bind Eps15, and therefore, all these molecules seem to participate in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into the MVB pathway (19Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12513-12521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).To further characterize the function of the mammalian STAM-Hrs complexes in MVB formation and/or protein sorting, we established Hrs-deficient fibroblastoid cell lines. The results of introducing wild-type or a mutant Hrs into these cells suggested a novel function for Hrs in regulating the fate of ubiquitinated proteins. We demonstrate here that Hrs controls the STAM protein stability. Our demonstration of the STAM relationship with ubiquitinated proteins provides insight into how their UIM domain functions in protein sorting.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTargeted Disruption of hrs in Vivo—Genomic clones of the mouse hrs gene were isolated from a λFixIImouse 129/Sv genomic library (Stratagene). A targeting construct for hrs was designed to replace a 0.6-kilobase (HindIII-HindIII) genomic fragment encompassing exon 6, flanked by 3.2-kilobase (XbaI-XbaI) and 3.0-kilobase (EcoRI-XbaI) genomic sequences (Fig. 1A). A pGK-neo cassette flanked by a pair of loxP sequences and a diphtheria toxin A-chain (DT) gene cassette without a polyadenylation site were inserted into the construct to allow further positive/negative selection. The construct was linearized and transferred into 129/Sv-derived J1 ES cells by electroporation, and G418-resistant colonies were picked (20Nakai S. Kawano H. Yudate T. Nishi M. Kuno J. Nagata A.

The occurrence of homologous recombination events for the hrs allele was examined by Southern hybridization using a 1.8-kilobase hrs genomic fragment (XbaI-BamHI) as the probe (Fig. 1B). The targeted hrs loxP-flanked (floxP) ES clone was confirmed to have a normal number of chromosomes and was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. The blastocysts were then transferred into foster mothers to obtain chimeric mice. By crossing the chimeras with C57BL/6 mice we obtained F1 heterozygous mice carrying the floxP allele. The genotypes were confirmed by both genomic PCR and Southern blot analyses (data not shown). The F1 heterozygous mice were intercrossed, but the genotyping of more than 100 offspring showed that no viable hrsfloxP/floxP mice were produced. To identify hrsfloxP/floxP embryos in utero, the genotypes of living embryos were determined using yolk sac DNA (23Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide primers were used: Hrs-1650F (primer A), 5′-GAGTGAGGAGGCGGTGTTCCCTAAACCTTG-3′; Hrs-1953R (primer B), 5′-AACATATACTGCTGGCAAAGCATCCATACA-3′; Hrs-CKO1787R (primer C), 5′-TATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATGTCGA-3′. PCR was carried out by initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The wild-type and mutant alleles gave rise to PCR-amplified fragments of 330 and 160 bp, respectively (Fig. 1C).Establishment of hrs-deficient and hrs-mutant Embryonic Fibroblastoid Cell Lines—Primary fibroblastoid cells derived from E9.5 hrsfloxP/floxP mouse embryos were obtained through timed-breeding experiments, as described previously (24Tanaka N. Kamanaka M. Enslen H. Dong C. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were stably immortalized by transfecting them with pEF321-T, an SV40 large T-antigen expression plasmid. Deletion of the floxP fragment was performed by transient transfection with pCXN2-Cre, a Cre-recombinase expression construct. The presence in cells of the hrs deletion (hrsΔ/δ) was verified by PCR. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: neo2760F (primer D), 5′-CTTGGGTGGAGAGGCTATTC-3′; neo3030R (primer E), 5′-AGGTGAGATGACAGGAGATC-3′; Hrs-1650F (primer A), 5′-GAGTGAGGAGGCGGTGTTCCCTAAACCTTG-3′; Hrs-CKO4108R (primer F), 5′-ATCACATTTCCCTCCCCAGTGCTTTCAAAC-3′. Limiting dilution and subsequent cloning were used to establish HRSd, an immortalized fibroblastoid cell line carrying the hrsδ/δ genotype (Fig. 1E). HRSw, HRSdC2, HRSdFYVE, and HRSdM were HRSd sublines stably transformed with expression vectors for wild-type Hrs and for the dC2, dFYVE, and dM Hrs mutants, respectively. The expression of the wildtype or mutated Hrs proteins in these clones was confirmed by Western blotting.Reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR—RT-PCR was carried out with the total RNA derived from HRSd and MEFw cells. The total RNA was prepared with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to first-strand synthesis using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed with a series of 3-fold-diluted templates to amplify the hrs and β-actin cDNAs. The primer set for hrs was designed to amplify a coding region within the N-terminal VHS domain. The primers used were as follows: Hrs-Exon 1 sense, 5′-TTCGAGCGTCTCCTAGACAAAGC-3′; Hrs-Exon 3 antisense, 5′-CATATTTTGCTTGTGTGTCCCCC-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-CCACTGCCACATCCTCTTC-3′; β-actin antisense: 5′-CATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGAC-3′Plasmids—pCXN2-Hrs, pCXN2-STAM1-V5, and pCXN2-STAM2-V5 were expression plasmids for wild-type Hrs, STAM1, and STAM2, respectively.

FLAG-tagged ubiquitin, p3XFLAG-Ub, was generated by PCR-based cloning of human ubiquitin into the p3XFLAG-CMV-10 vector (Sigma).Cell Culture—HRSd and HRSd sublines transfected with wild-type Hrs or Hrs mutants were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics under 7% CO2 in a humidified incubator. To transfect the cells with plasmid DNAs, FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Where indicated lactacystin (Kyowa Medex) and E-64-d (Peptide Institute, Inc.) were added to the cell culture to a final concentration of 10 and 100 μm, respectively.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (4Asao H.

In brief, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were precleared of cellular debris by centrifugation (10,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C and were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight.

The immunoprecipitates were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After being blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were probed with the indicated primary antibodies. After another wash, the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling). Signals were visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences), and digital images were collected by a Lumi-Imager F1 (Roche Applied Science). For degradation assays, the cells were cultured in the presence of 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (Wako) for the period indicated, and the cell lysates from these cultures were analyzed by Western blotting.Northern Blots—Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (29Yamada M.

Twenty micrograms of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The separated RNAs were then transferred onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 x SSC. After UV-cross-linking, the membranes were subjected to prehybridization and hybridization in a solution containing 0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS at 65 °C. A probe prepared by radiolabeling with [α-32P]dCTP using a Random Prime-DNA labeling kit (Takara Shuzo Co.) was added, and hybridization was carried out overnight. Membranes were then extensively washed with a washing buffer (2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS) at 65 °C, and the signals were visualized with a Bio-Image Analyzer, FLA-2000 (Fuji Film).

DsRed1-Eps15 was then introduced as described above. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and then blocked for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. For immunostaining, the fixed samples were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies, washed 3 times, and further probed with the secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, -mouse, and -goat IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488, Alexa 594, and Alexa 350, respectively (Molecular Probes)). The microscopic images were examined using the Leica DMIRBE microscope system with a PL FLUOTAR 100×/1.30–0.60 oil immersion objective.Metabolic Labeling of Cellular Proteins—For pulse-chase experiments, HRSd and 293T cells that had been transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE™ 6 were radiolabeled with the Pro-mix L-[35S] in Vitro Cell Labeling Mix at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml (Amersham Biosciences) in Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum that had been predialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. At the end of the pulse-labeling period, the cells were washed and chased for the indicated times in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with methionine and cysteine. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the lysates made from them were subjected to further immunoprecipitation assays. Radioactivity was visualized and analyzed using Science Lab 2001 Image Gauge Version 4.0 software (Fuji Film).RESULTSEstablishment of hrs-deficient Cell Lines by Gene Targeting—The hrs knock-out mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype, as described previously (26Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell.

To analyze the biological significance of Hrs in vivo, we sought to generate conditional hrs gene-targeted mice. The targeting construct was designed to delete exon 6 of the hrs genomic sequence (Fig. 1A). Exon 6 (E6) codes for amino acids 139–156, and therefore, the resultant hrs gene-targeted allele was expected to code for an Hrs protein with a minimal N-terminal portion that lacked part of the VHS domain (amino acids 1–138). After a positive-negative selection screen, several recombinant ES clones were selected and injected into blastocysts. The chimeric mice obtained were crossed with each other to obtain heterozygous mice (hrs+/floxP). The genotype was confirmed both by Southern blot and genomic PCR analyses (Fig. 1, B and C). Although the heterozygous mice were viable and fertile, when they were intercrossed we did not obtain viable hrsfloxP/floxP offspring. Indeed, our timed breeding experiments revealed that the hrsfloxP/floxP embryos were not viable after E10.5 (data not shown). We concluded that the conditional hrsfloxP allele was nonfunctional. Although we were unable to establish cell lines from our original hrs gene knock-out mice (26Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L.

We successfully prepared MEFs from E9.5 embryos, and among randomly prepared MEF cells only the hrsfloxP/floxP MEFs failed to survive after a few passages; in comparison, wild-type MEFs survived for many passages. We immortalized the hrs+/+ and hrsfloxP/floxP MEFs using the SV40 large T antigen. We obtained an immortalized cell line carrying the hrsfloxP/floxP genotype and a control hrs+/+ cell line, MEFw. Next, the hrs gene and the neomycin resistance gene (neor) were fully inactivated by deleting the gene segment encoding exon 6. By introducing the transient expression of Cre recombinase into the cells carrying the hrsfloxP/floxP genotype, we obtained a cell line, HRSd, with the hrsδ/δ genotype. Deletion of the region flanked by the two loxP sequences was confirmed by genomic PCR (Fig. 1D). Although the δ allele could potentially have produced an N-terminal 138-amino acid fragment, the defective expression of"

We have investigated the potential immunomodulatory properties of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by examining the molecular mechanism by which the eicosanoid suppresses T-cell-derived interleukin-17 (IL-17)-induced TNF-α mRNA expression and protein synthesis in human macrophages and rheumatoid arthritis-affected synovial fibroblasts. Initial studies confirmed that PGE2 induces egr-1 mRNA expression and protein synthesis by restricted SAPK2/p38 MAPK-dependent activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) dimer transactivation of the egr-1 promoter as judged by studies using wild-type (WT) and deletion mutant egr-1 promoter constructs, Northern and Western blotting, and standard and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift analyses. Using human leukemic monocytic THP-1 cells stably transfected with WT and dominant-negative mutant expression constructs of Egr-1, cotransfected or not with a WT pTNF-615SVOCAT construct, we observed that PGE2 inhibition of IL-17-stimulated TNF-α mRNA expression and promoter activity was dependent on Egr-1 expression, as mutants of Egr-1, alone or in combination, markedly abrogated any inhibitory effect of PGE2. Standard and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, signaling “decoy” overexpression studies, and pTNF-615SVOCAT promoter assays using WT and mutant promoter constructs revealed that IL-17-up-regulated promoter activity was largely dependent on ATF-2/c-Jun transactivation. PGE2 suppression of IL-17-induced ATF-2/c-Jun transactivation and DNA binding was dependent on Egr-1-mediated inhibition of induced c-Jun expression. We suggest that egr-1 is an immediate-early PGE2 target gene that may be a key regulatory factor in mediating eicosanoid control of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses.

Inflammation and the inflammatory response represent a highly orchestrated cascade of events designed to maintain a state of homeostasis in the host following pathogenic invasion and/or tissue injury. The response involves the concerted and exquisitely timed interactions of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and lipid-derived mediators with inflammatory cells like macrophages, neutrophils, activated endothelial cells and fibroblasts, T- and β-lymphocytes, and mast cells (1Luster A.D.

Borgeat P. Fitzpatrick F.A. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Inc., New York1991: 297-325Google Scholar). Upon cellular activation, type IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum or outer nuclear membrane and releases arachidonic acid from the membrane lipids of most cell types (7Smith W.L.

A co-localized, monotopic, integral membrane protein, prostaglandin H2 synthase (also referred to as cyclooxygenase (COX), with two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2), catalyzes the first committed, rate-limiting step by converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2. The latter intermediate is rapidly metabolized by cell- and tissue-specific synthases to one of several prostanoids (e.g. PGE2 by prostaglandin E synthase) (9Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Garavito M. Annu.

The PGE2 signal is transduced at the cell surface by specific cognate receptors (designated EP receptors, subtypes EP1–EP4) that are characterized by an extracellular N-terminal domain, seven membrane-spanning regions containing a variable cytoplasmic loop, and a cytoplasmic C terminus. Ligand binding takes place in the membrane-spanning domains, and G-protein coupling occurs through the intracellular loops and C terminus (11Narumiya S. Fitzgerald G.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 12Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 13Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In general, EP2 and EP4 signal through Gs coupling, resulting in increases in cAMP levels and activated protein kinase A within seconds to minutes. The EP1 and some EP3 receptor subtypes associate with Gq and mediate increases in intracellular calcium, whereas Gi proteins reduce levels of cellular cAMP (EP3) (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A.

Investig. 2001; 108: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). For example, the C terminus of EP receptors also harbors serine/threonine residues (anywhere from 1 to 9) that, when phosphorylated by activated protein kinase A, induce receptor desensitization and signal attenuation (reviewed in Ref. 13Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In a variety of target cell types, PGE2 modulates transcription of immediate-early genes such as junB, junD, fosB, fra-1, and c-fos, although the mechanistic details are completely undefined (14He Q.W.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Signaling cascades mediating mitogenic activity such as the Ras/Raf-1/ERK cascade are inhibited by PGE2 secondary to phosphorylation and inactivation of Raf-1 kinase by protein kinase A (20Marinissen M.J.

In addition, the p38 MAPK cascade is a primary target through which PGE2 signaling via EP4 is manifested in human synovial fibroblasts and macrophages (21Faour W.H. He Y. de Ladurantaye M. He Q.W.

Also known as zif268, egr-1/krox-24 was originally identified as a growth response gene in fibroblasts and B-cells (25Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

In this study, we investigated in detail the regulatory mechanisms controlling PGE2-dependent induction of the egr-1 gene in human monocytes/macrophages and rheumatoid arthritis-transformed synovial cells. Our results indicate that PGE2 induces Egr-1 expression through stimulation of the MLK2/MKK3/p38 MAPK cascade with ATF-2 transactivation of the egr-1 promoter. Furthermore, using dominant-negative mutants in stably transfected cells lines, we show that PGE2 suppresses T-cell cytokine-induced TNF-α gene expression and synthesis in human macrophages (and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-affected synovial fibroblasts) largely through Egr-1-dependent TNF-α promoter suppression. The data suggest that PGE2/Egr-1 disrupts essential components of the TNF-α promoter transactivation complex, viz. the suppression of ATF-2/c-Jun heterodimer DNA binding through inhibition of c-Jun expression. Chemicals—Sodium fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, actinomycin D, puromycin, dithiothreitol, sodium orthovanadate, and bovine serum albumin were products of Sigma.

SDS, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, ammonium persulfate, and protein reagent were from Bio-Rad. Tris base, EDTA, MgCl2, CaCl2, chloroform, Me2SO, anhydrous ethanol (95%), methanol (99%), formaldehyde, and formamide were obtained from Fisher. Recombinant human interleukin-17 (rhIL-17) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, phosphate-free and phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, RPMI 1640 medium, TRIzol reagent, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and an antibiotic mixture (10,000 units of penicillin (base) and 10,000 μg of streptomycin (base)) were products of Invitrogen. Cell Culture—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy donors by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (32Jovanovic D.V. Di Battista J.A. Martel-Pelletier J. Jolicoeur F.C. He Y. Zhang M.K. Mineau F. Pelletier J.-P. J.

NIH-3T3 and HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as described above for RASFs. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—Cellular proteins (50–100 μg) extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, μg/ml leupeptin, μg/ml pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF) or in hot SDS-PAGE loading buffer from control and treated cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8–12% gels (16 × 20 cm, final concentration of acrylamide) under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Following blocking with 5% BLOTTO for 2 h at room temperature and washing, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in Tween/Tris-buffered saline containing 0.25% BLOTTO. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) was subsequently incubated with membranes for 1 h at room temperature and washed extensively for 30–40 min with Tween/Tris-buffered saline, followed by a final rinsing with Tris-buffered saline at room temperature. Following incubation with ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences), membranes were prepared for autoradiography, exposed to Kodak X-Omat film, and subjected to digital imaging system (Alpha G-Imager 2000, Canberra Packard Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for semiquantitative measurements as described previously (33Faour W.H. He Q.W. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26897-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Anti-Egr-1, anti-Sp-1, and anti-TNF-α polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Total (independent of phosphorylation state) and anti-phospho-Elk-1 (Ser383), anti-phospho-ATF-2 (Thr69/71), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63/73), and anti-phospho-CREB-1 (Ser133) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Waverly, MA). Isolation of RNA and Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA (1 × 106 cells = 10–20 μg of RNA) was isolated using TRIzol reagent as described previously (33Faour W.H. He Q.W. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26897-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Generally, 5–20 μg of total RNA were resolved on formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred electro-phoretically (30 V overnight at 4 °C) to Hybond-N™ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5× Tris acetate/EDTA (pH 7). After pre-hybridization for 24 h, hybridizations were carried out at 50–55 °C for 24–36 h, followed by high stringency washing at 68 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The following probes, which were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by random priming, were used for hybridization. Human TNF-α cDNA (1.3 kb), initially cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pFC54.t-1 (American Type Culture Collection), was released by digestion. Human egr-1/krox-24 cDNA, initially cloned into the EcoRI sites of the pMexNeoI vector (an Egr-1 expression vector; provided by Dr. D. Skup, Department of Biochemistry, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada), contains 300 bp of 5′-noncoding region and 580 bp of 3′-noncoding region of egr-1. Both the c-jun and junB probes were 2.6- and 1.9-kb cDNA fragments inserted into pGEM2 (American Type Culture Collection). A 780-bp PstI/XbaI fragment from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (1.2 kb; American Type Culture Collection) initially cloned into the PstI site of the pBR322 vector served as a control for RNA loading, as GAPDH is constitutively expressed in the cells used in these experiments. All blots were subjected to a digital imaging system (Alpha G-Imager 2000) for semiquantitative measurements, and changes in TNF-α or egr-1 mRNA expression were always considered as the ratio of GAPDH mRNA. Extraction of Nuclear Proteins and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Confluent control and treated cells (3–5 × 106 cells/well) in 4-well cluster plates were carefully scraped into 1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by brief centrifugation. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (33Faour W.H. He Q.W. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26897-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing wild-type (WT) and mutant sequences were obtained from Invitrogen); annealed in 100 nm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 10 min; cooled for 1–2 h at room temperature; and finally end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). The sense sequences of the oligonucleotides tested were as follows: consensus Egr-1/Krox-24, 5′-GGA TCC AGC GGG GGC GAG CGG GGG CGA-3′; consensus mutant Egr-1/Krox-24, 5′-GGA TCC AGC GGG TAC GAG CGG GTA CGA-3′; Egr-1/Krox-24 (TNF-α), 5′-GGA TCG CCC CCC GCC CCC GCG CGA-3′; mutant Egr-1/Krox-24 (TNF-α), 5′-GGA TCG CCC TAC GCC CTA GCG CGA-3′; ATF/CREB-like (egr-1, -131 bp), 5′-GGG GGC TTC ACG TCA CTC CGG GT-3′; mutant ATF/CREB-like (egr-1), 5′-GGG GGC TGAAGC TAG CTC CGG GT-3′; ATF-2/c-Jun-like (TNF-α), 5′-GAT TCA ATG AGC TCA CGG CTG TG-3′; and mutant ATF-2/c-Jun-like (TNF-α), 5′-GAT TCA AAG ACA TCA CGG CTG TG-3′. Binding buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2,4% glycerol, and 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). Binding reactions were conducted with 15 μg of nuclear extract and 100,000 cpm 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe at 22 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 10 μl. For supershift analysis, 2 μg of affinity-purified anti-total/phospho-CREB-1 (1:1), antitotal/phospho-ATF-2 (1:1), anti-total/phospho-c-Jun (1:1), anti-Egr-1, or anti-Sp-1 polyclonal antiserum were incubated for 10 min with the nuclear extracts prior to the addition of the radioactive probe. Binding complexes were resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 6% gels in a Tris borate buffer system, after which the gels were fixed, dried, and prepared for autoradiography. Constructs, Transfections, and Reporter Assays—The PGK-puro vector, WT Egr-1/Krox-24, and dominant-negative mutants (WT minus the zinc finger region and the zinc finger region only) were a kind gift from Dr. D. Skup, and the construction of the plasmids has been described previously (28Lanoix J. Mullick A. He Y. Bravo R. Skup D. Oncogene. 1999; 17: 2496-2504Google Scholar). Briefly, human egr-1/krox-24 cDNA was removed from the pMexNeoKrox-24 vector and inserted into the EcoRI site of the PGK-puro vector (puromycin for selection), which utilizes the PGK promoter to drive transcription, and thus generated the pPGK-Egr-1/Krox-24 expression plasmid. The PGK-ΔEgr-1/Krox-24 construct was prepared by digesting pPGK-Egr-1/Krox-24 with XmnI and religating, thus removing amino acids 271–364, corresponding to an essential part of the zinc finger region. The PGK-zfEgr-1/Krox-24 construct was obtained by preparing oligonucleotides corresponding to amino acids 210–216 and 325–332 with the 5′-nucleotide having the sequence 5′-GGG ATG-3′ to provide a site for translational initiation, an EcoRI site, and a BamHI site. The 3′-oligonucleotide has an EcoRI and XbaI site. The oligonucleotides were used to amplify the zinc finger region from pMex-NeoKrox-24, and the resulting fragment was then cloned into BamHI/XbaI-digested PGK vector. Sequencing confirmed that the insert was correct and in-frame (28Lanoix J. Mullick A. He Y. Bravo R. Skup D. Oncogene. 1999; 17: 2496-2504Google Scholar). Promoter constructs containing 1395 bp of the egr-1/krox-24 promoter region along with -925, -636, -459, -252, and -77 deletion mutants were kindly provided by Dr. D. Skup, whereas the pTNF-615CAT construct was a gift from Dr. I. Kramer (Christian-Albrechts Universitat, Kiel, Germany). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Transformer™ mutagenesis kit (Clontech) and involved modifying the ATF/c-Jun site at bp -99 and -100 (CA → TC) and the Egr-1 site at bp -175 and -176 (CC → GG) of the pTNF-615CAT promoter fragment (-615 to +34) and the ATF/CRE site at bp -131 and -132 (CA → TC) of the egr-1 promoter (kindly provided by Dr. D. Skup). cis-Reporter plasmids containing the luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic reporter element (TATA box) fused to tandem AP-1-, ATF/CRE-, SRE-, and NF-AT-binding elements were purchased from Stratagene. Constructs containing the transactivation domains of transcription factors (e.g. ATF-2 and c-Jun) fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (e.g. pFA-ATF-2) were used in decoy experiments as described previously (33Faour W.H. He Q.W. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26897-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, activated pMEK3 (MKK3/6) and pPKA-CAT expression plasmids (Stratagene, Upstate) were overexpressed to determine the role in egr-1 promoter activity. Transient transfection experiments were conducted in 4-, 6-, or 12-well cluster plates as described previously (33Faour W.H. He Q.W. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26897-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for adherent cell cultures. Transfections were conducted using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) for 6 h according to the manufacturers' protocol with cells at ∼30–40% confluence. Cells were re-exposed to culture medium and 1% FCS for 2 h prior to the addition of the biological effectors. Transfection efficiencies were controlled in all experiments by cotransfection with 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-gal (Stratagene), a β-galactosidase reporter vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. For stable transfections, selection was carried out with 2 μg/ml puromycin (PGK-puro vector), and experiments were conducted in the presence of a maintenance level of 0.2 μg/ml puromycin. THP-1 cells (10-μg total plasmid concentration, 107 cells/0.5 ml in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FCS, and antibiotics) were transfected by electroporation (Gene-Pulser II, Bio-Rad) using a 7-s pulse at 300 V and 960 microfarads. Where appropriate, transfectants were selected with puromycin as described previously (23Di Battista J.A. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.-P. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 395-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Lanoix J. Mullick A. He Y. Bravo R. Skup D. Oncogene. 1999; 17: 2496-2504Google Scholar). The TNF-α and egr-1 promoter activities were assessed by measuring CAT protein using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science) or by measuring CAT activity using [14C]chloramphenicol and thin-layer chromatography, followed by enhanced autoradiography (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Luciferase values, expressed as enhanced relative light units, were measured in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G, Stuttgart, Germany) and normalized to the level of β-galactosidase activity (absorbance at 420 nm after a 24-h incubation with o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside and conversion to o-nitrophenol) and cellular protein (bicinchoninic acid procedure, Pierce).

https://openalex.org/W1974768178,"The Drosophila ninaG mutant is characterized by low levels of Rh1 rhodopsin, because of the inability to transport this rhodopsin from the endoplasmic reticulum to the rhabdomere. ninaG mutants do not affect the biogenesis of the minor opsins Rh4 and Rh6. A genetic analysis placed the ninaG gene within the 86E4-86E6 chromosomal region. A sequence analysis of the 15 open reading frames within this region from the ninaGP330 mutant allele identified a stop codon in the CG6728 gene. Germ-line transformation of the CG6728 genomic region rescued the ninaG mutant phenotypes, confirming that CG6728 corresponds to the ninaG gene. The NinaG protein belongs to the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family of flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding enzymes catalyzing hydroxylation and oxidation of a variety of small organic molecules. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of retinoids was used to gain insight into the in vivo role of the NinaG oxidoreductase. The results show that when Rh1 is expressed as the major rhodopsin, ninaG flies fail to accumulate 3-hydroxyretinal. Further, in transgenic flies expressing Rh4 as the major rhodopsin, 3-hydroxyretinal is the major retinoid in ninaG+, but a different retinoid profile is observed in ninaGP330. These results indicate that the ninaG oxidoreductase acts in the biochemical pathway responsible for conversion of retinal to the rhodopsin chromophore, 3-hydroxyretinal. The Drosophila ninaG mutant is characterized by low levels of Rh1 rhodopsin, because of the inability to transport this rhodopsin from the endoplasmic reticulum to the rhabdomere. ninaG mutants do not affect the biogenesis of the minor opsins Rh4 and Rh6. A genetic analysis placed the ninaG gene within the 86E4-86E6 chromosomal region. A sequence analysis of the 15 open reading frames within this region from the ninaGP330 mutant allele identified a stop codon in the CG6728 gene. Germ-line transformation of the CG6728 genomic region rescued the ninaG mutant phenotypes, confirming that CG6728 corresponds to the ninaG gene. The NinaG protein belongs to the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family of flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding enzymes catalyzing hydroxylation and oxidation of a variety of small organic molecules.

Vitamin A provides the retinal chromophores that mediate the sensing of light quanta by visual pigments. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that cannot be synthesized de novo by most animals. Rather vitamin A is obtained from the diet, either as preformed vitamin A such as retinol from animal sources, or as provitamin A carotenoids from plant sources. These dietary forms must be both transported to the retina and chemically modified to play a key role in visual transduction (1Blomhoff R. Green M.H. Berg T. Norum K.R. Science. 1990; 250: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 2Yeum K.J. Russell R.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 483-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Drosophila nina mutations have provided some insights into processing of vitamin A for use in vision. Eight Drosophila nina genes are known (3Pak W.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2340-2357PubMed Google Scholar). These nina mutants, named for the “neither inactivation nor afterpotential” electroretinogram defect, all possess low rhodopsin levels responsible for this phenotype. Vitamin A-deprived flies also show the same electroretinogram defects and low rhodopsin levels (4Harris W.A. Ready D.F. Lipson E.D. Hudspeth A.J. Stark W.S. Nature. 1977; 266: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Ozaki K. Nagatani H. Ozaki M. Tokunaga F. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1113-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), establishing the importance of vitamin A availability in the production of rhodopsin. The ninaB and ninaD mutants are also known to lower rhodopsin levels by disrupting vitamin A availability. The ninaD gene encodes a scavenger receptor (6Kiefer C. Sumser E. Wernet M.F. Von Lintig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10581-10586Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) required for efficient use of carotenoids, such as β-carotene, from the diet. The ninaB encodes an oxygenase enzyme (7von Lintig J. Dreher A. Kiefer C. Wernet M.F. Vogt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1130-1135PubMed Google Scholar) responsible for cleaving β-carotene to generate retinal. Both of these gene products act outside of the retina to carry out their roles in vitamin A metabolism (8Gu G. Yang J. Mitchell K.A. O'Tousa J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18608-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Five different retinoids are known to serve as visual pigment chromophores within the animal kingdom. These are retinal, (3,4)-didehydroretinal, (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal, (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal, and (3R)-4-hydroxyretinal. Although the 3R enantiomer of 3-hydroxyretinal is found among many insect orders, the 3S enantiomer is found only among the Cyclorrhapha suborder of Diptera (9Seki T. Vogt T.F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1998; 119: 53-64Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that includes Drosophila (10Seki T. Isono K. Ito M. Katsuta Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The biochemical pathways responsible for production of this retinoid and the other modified chromophores from retinal or other vitamin A precursors have not been characterized. Here we describe the molecular characterization and phenotypic analysis of ninaG. The ninaG gene encodes a member of the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) 1The abbreviations used are: GMC, glucose-methanol-choline; PDA, prolonged depolarizing afterpotential; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: GMC, glucose-methanol-choline; PDA, prolonged depolarizing afterpotential; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; GFP, green fluorescent protein. family of oxidoreductases (11Lamark T. Kaasen I. Eshoo M.W. Falkenberg P. McDougall J. Strom A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1049-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The biochemical substrates of most of these enzymes are not known, but some of the enzymes are dehydrogenases and oxidases carrying out redox reactions on a wide variety of organic metabolites. We show that NinaG is required for the biogenesis of the Drosophila rhodopsin chromophore, (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal. This study provides the first molecular description of an enzyme active in modification of retinal to an alternative visual pigment chromophore. ninaG Mutant Analysis—The ethylmethane sulfonate-induced ninaGP330 strain was obtained from W. L. Pak, Purdue University (3Pak W.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2340-2357PubMed Google Scholar). ninaG1 was identified following an ethylmethane sulfonate screen done in the O'Tousa laboratory and ninaG2 was identified within an existing laboratory stock. Deficiency chromosomes were obtained from the Drosophila Stock Center, Bloomington, Indiana and W. Engels, University of Wisconsin. Drosophila strains were maintained at room temperature and usually reared on standard cornmeal-molasses medium. Pseudopupil and protein blots assessment of rhodopsin content was carried out as described in Hsu et al. (12Hsu C.D. Adams S.M. O'Tousa J.E. Vision Res. 2002; 42: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Electroretinogram and electron microscopic analyses were performed as described previously (13Washburn T. O'Tousa J.E. Genetics. 1992; 130: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in both cases using 2-day-old flies maintained in 12-h light/12-h dark light cycle. Rhodopsin cellular location was visualized using transgenic flies carrying pRh1:Rh1-GFP, constructed using the Rh1-GFP coding sequence described by Pichaud and Desplan (14Pichaud F. Desplan C. Development. 2001; 128: 815-826PubMed Google Scholar) and the Rh1 promoter region. 2K. Hibbard and J. E. O'Tousa, unpublished data. Ommatidia of newly eclosed Drosophila carrying this element in appropriate genetic backgrounds were prepared by modification of described protocols (15Hardie R.C. Voss D. Pongs O. Laughlin S.B. Neuron. 1991; 6: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Hardie R.C. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3079-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dispersed ommatidia were immersed in a drop of chilled phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, on a glass slide. To-Pro-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) was added to visualize nuclei, anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes) was added in equal volume, and the GFP fluorescence was then imaged with Bio-Rad MRC 1024 Scanning Confocal microscope. Vitamin A-free medium was prepared as described by Nichols and Pak (17Nichols R. Pak W.L. Drosoph. Inf. Serv. 1985; 61: 195Google Scholar). To generate flies deficient in vitamin A, a life cycle (from egg to adult) was completed on this medium. Replenishment with all-trans-retinal (Sigma) was done by placing adult flies on a supplemented medium for 3 days prepared by adding 10 μl of a 10 mm solution/ml of vitamin A-free medium. For Rh1 RNA analysis, adult flies were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and vortexed to separate the heads from the bodies. Total RNA was isolated from different fly strains using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 15 μg of total RNA was subjected to 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. 18 and 28 S ribosomal RNA standards were visualized on the same gel with ethidium bromide staining to evaluate RNA integrity and as loading controls. The gel was blotted onto Hybond-XL nylon transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using the manufacturer's instructions, probed with Rh1 cDNA, random-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiographed to visualize Rh1 RNA levels. FRT/FLP (flippase recombinase/flippase recombinase target) genetic mosaics were constructed and analyzed as described previously (8Gu G. Yang J. Mitchell K.A. O'Tousa J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18608-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ninaG Molecular Analysis—For sequence analysis of the 15 genes in the ninaG region, 1 μl of genomic DNA, prepared using the single fly DNA prep protocol (18Gloor G.B. Preston C.R. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Nassif N.A. Phillis R.W. Benz W.K. Robertson H.M. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1993; 135: 81-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used in PCR with Platinum Taq DNA High Fidelity proofreading polymerase (Invitrogen) and unique oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify a 1-kb segment from the region. The PCR products were cloned into pCR4 TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). Plasmids containing the correct inserts were bidirectionally sequenced using T3 and T7 sequencing primers and Big Dye Terminator v.3 on ABI Prism® 3700 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For transgenic rescue of ninaG, a 3.8-kb KpnI-StuI fragment from BAC013PO8 containing 1.1 kb of the ninaG (CG6728) promoter region, the entire open reading frame, and 0.7 kb of the 3′-untranslated region was cloned into the P element vector pCaSpeR4 (19Thummel C.S. Boulet A.M. Lipshitz H.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and transformed into the ninaGP330 mutant using standard procedures (20Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila a Practical Approach. IRL Press Limited, Oxford, England1986: 175-196Google Scholar). Retinal Extraction and HPLC/MS Analysis—Methodology for retinal extraction was developed from the published protocol of Suzuki et al. (21Suzuki T. Fujita Y. Noda Y. Miyata S. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 700-800 Drosophila were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the heads were separated from bodies by vigorous shaking, homogenized in 100 μl of 6 m formaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and incubated at 30 °C for 2 min. 0.5 ml of dichloromethane was then added, the homogenate was vortexed, and further incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. 1 ml of n-hexane was added, mixed, and spun at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The upper organic layer was collected, the aqueous phase was extracted again with dichloromethane and n-hexane, and the pooled organic layers were evaporated to dryness under vacuum. Samples were resuspended in 50 μl of the initial HPLC mobile phase, and then filtered through a 0.22 μm PTFE filter (Nalgene) prior to HPLC analysis. A Waters 2690 HPLC system equipped with a 996 photodiode array detector and interfaced with a Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters) was used for liquid chromatography/UV-visible/MS experiments. Absorbance spectra were monitored from 200 to 800 nm, and mass spectra were acquired over the mass range 150-800 at a scan rate of 2 s. A 10-μl sample was injected onto a 4.6 × 20-mm, 3-μm particle size Atlantis dC18 guard column and a 4.6 × 150-mm, 3-μm particle size Atlantis dC18 analytical column (Waters). The mobile phase gradient consisted of 80:20 (v/v) acetonitrile:water for 3 min, a 12-min linear gradient to 100% acetonitrile, and 5 min of 100% acetonitrile delivered at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The HPLC eluent was split 50:50 prior to injection into the electrospray ion source of the mass spectrometer, and formic acid (0.1%) was added to all mobile phase solvents as a means of increasing ionization efficiency for MS. The ninaG Mutant Phenotype—A collection of vision-defective mutants called nina, for “neither inactivation nor afterpotential” were identified on the basis of their electroretinogram phenotype (22Stephenson R.S. O'Tousa J. Scavarda N.J. Randall L.L. Pak W.L. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1983; 36: 477-501PubMed Google Scholar). In wild type, a bright blue stimulus induces a depolarized state that persists after termination of the stimulus (Fig. 1A, top trace). This is referred to as the prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA). The lack of the PDA response in nina mutants, such as shown for ninaGP330 in Fig. 1A, bottom trace, is because of low levels of Rh1 rhodopsin within the R1-6 photoreceptors (3Pak W.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2340-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 23O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M.L. Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The ninaG mutant possesses very low levels of Rh1 rhodopsin when assayed in protein blots (Fig. 1B, upper panel). The requirement for ninaG in production of other rhodopsins was tested by protein blots against the R7 opsin Rh4 and the R8 opsin Rh6. Fig. 1B, middle panels, show that Rh4 and Rh6 opsin production does not require ninaG activity. Similar results were seen for two other ninaG alleles. Thus, ninaG function is only required for efficient biogenesis of a subset of Drosophila visual pigments. To investigate whether maturation of other transmembrane proteins is affected in ninaG mutants, Trp and RdgB protein levels were examined. Trp is a calcium channel that co-localizes with rhodopsin in the rhabdomeres (24Niemeyer B.A. Suzuki E. Scott K. Jalink K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 651-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). RdgB is a membrane protein that is localized to the photoreceptor subrhabdomeric cisternae (25Vihtelic T.S. Goebl M. Milligan S. O'Tousa J.E. Hyde D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Neither Trp nor RdgB protein levels are affected in ninaG mutants (Fig. 1B, lower panels). Northern analysis was used to determine whether ninaG was required for expression of Rh1 mRNA. Similar levels of ninaE transcript of 1.5 kb representing the Rh1 opsin mRNA was detectable by Northern analysis in wild type, ninaGP330, ninaG1, and ninaG2 heads (Fig. 1C). Heads from the eya (eyes absent) mutant, lacking the compound eyes, were used as the negative control. These results show that ninaG mutants do not affect Rh1 mRNA levels, establishing that ninaG acts in translational or posttranslational control of rhodopsin production. Defective Rh1 Transport in ninaG Mutants—To investigate the effect of the ninaG mutation on the localization of Rh1 rhodopsin in the photoreceptor cells, we created flies containing rhodopsin-GFP (Rh1-GFP) transgene driven by the Drosophila Rh1 promoter. The location of Rh1-GFP was visualized in whole mounts of isolated ommatidia, the unit cluster of the R1-8 photoreceptor cells. In the ninaG+ background, the Rh1-GFP localizes predominantly to the rhabdomeres of R1-6 cells (Fig. 2A, labeled R). In ninaG mutants, Rh1-GFP localized exclusively to the cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 2B, labeled C), failing to decorate the rhabdomeres (R). The redistribution of Rh1-GFP seen in ninaG mutants is similar to that observed in vitamin A-deprived flies (data not shown). At the ultrastructural level, ninaGP330 (Fig. 2D) shows a reduction in the size of the R1-6 rhabdomeres (Fig. 2, C and D, one rhabdomere is labeled R) when compared with wild type (Fig. 2C). We also observed proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum in the cell bodies (Fig. 2D, ER), and similar results were observed in ninaG2 (data not shown). The ninaGP330 mutant shows these defects at all ages examined, with no other significant changes, including retinal degeneration, observed up to 20 days of age (data not shown). The Retina Is the Site of ninaG Activity—To test whether NinaG activity is required within photoreceptors, we created genetic mosaics in which only the eye tissue was mutant for ninaG. Fig. 3 shows the rhodopsin content in ninaG mosaics and an appropriate set of control genotypes. In the ninaG mosaic (Fig. 3, far right), the retinal tissue is mutant for ninaG, but the rest of the animal is ninaG+. These mosaic flies show low levels of rhodopsin, showing that NinaG activity is required within photoreceptors or other cell types of the retina for normal rhodopsin expression. Identification of the ninaG Gene—We determined the cytological position of ninaG as a first step toward identifying and characterizing the ninaG gene. Flies heterozygous for ninaG and each of a set of deficiencies spanning much of the right arm of the third chromosome were examined for rhodopsin content using the presence/absence of the deep dark pseudopupil (26Franceschini N. Snyder A.W. Menzel R. Photoreceptor Optics. Springer-Verlag, New York, NY1975: 98-125Crossref Google Scholar). The presence of this structure in white-eyed flies is indicative of high rhodopsin levels. Df(3R)M-Kx1/ninaG and Df(3R)T-32/ninaG and Df(3R)T-61/ninaG flies showed no dark deep pseudopupil suggestive of low rhodopsin levels. Reduced rhodopsin levels in these three genotypes were confirmed by Western analysis (data not shown). This analysis placed the map location of ninaG within region 86E3-87A9 on the right arm of the third chromosome. To further refine this map position, P-element-induced deletions within the 86E region (27Kusano K. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Engels W.R. Science. 2001; 291: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were tested for complementation with ninaG mutants. Df(3R)thoR1, Df(3R)pros235, and Df(3R)pros640, but not Df(3R)T7, failed to complement the low rhodopsin phenotype of ninaG (Fig. 1B, upper panel). These results placed ninaG into a small region bracketed proximally by the pros gene and distally by the tho gene. P-element alleles of pros (P[PZ]pros10419) and tho (P[PZ] tho1) complemented ninaG. Therefore, ninaG is likely to lie in the region between pros and tho. This is a genomic region of 79,639 bp containing 15 annotated genes. To identify the gene responsible for the ninaG mutant, we sequenced the coding regions of the 15 identified genes within the 86E5-86E8-E11 cytological region from ninaGP330. 36 different PCRs generated products of ∼1-kb length to examine all genes. The coding sequences within these PCR products were compared with the Drosophila genome sequence (28Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W.

The gene designated CG6728 showed a notable alteration in the ninaGP330 mutant allele, a C to T change at nucleotide 241. This resulted in a nonsense codon, altering a CAG (Gln) codon to a TAG (STOP) codon. No other mutations resulting in nonsense mutations were identified, although three other genes contained single nucleotide changes resulting in amino acid substitutions. As a result of the sequence analysis, CG6728 emerged as the best candidate for the ninaG gene. Fig. 4A shows a diagram of the gene structure, identifying the site of the mutation found in ninaGP330. We used a 3.8-kb genomic KpnI-StuI fragment that contained this open reading frame and 1.1 kb of upstream sequences to construct transgenic flies. Fig. 4B shows that this CG6728 genomic fragment rescues the low rhodopsin phenotype of ninaGP330 mutants. Further, electroretinogram analysis showed that the CG6728 transgene restores the PDA response in ninaG mutants (Fig. 4C). These results establish that CG6728 is the ninaG gene. NinaG Is a Member of GMC Oxidoreductase Enzyme Family—Comparison of the NinaG protein sequence with GenBank™ protein databases indicated that NinaG is a member of the GMC oxidoreductase family. This is a diverse family of flavin adenine dinucleotide flavoproteins. There are 15 identified Drosophila genes in this family. Only one, glucose dehydrogenase (30Schiff N.M. Feng Y. Quine J.A. Krasney P.A. Cavener D.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 1029-1049PubMed Google Scholar), codes for a characterized enzyme. Fig. 5A shows the neighbor-joining gene tree (31Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) of the Drosophila GMC oxidoreductase family members and characterized GMC oxidoreductase enzymes from other organisms. The analysis shows high divergence within this family in general and the NinaG protein in particular. Such results preclude any inference of substrate specificity or enzymatic action from this type of analysis. Sequence analysis showed that the amino-terminal region of NinaG contains a signal recognition sequence (Fig. 5B). This amino-terminal domain is predicted to contain a signal peptide in NinaG protein with cleavage between residues 26 and 27 (32von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar). The other members of the family lack any predicted signal sequence. Other features of the NinaG protein structure are as expected for the GMC oxidoreductase family, including the ADP-binding domain described as the βαβ fold (33Wierenga R.K. Drenth J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) within the amino-terminal region. NinaG Acts in Chromophore Production—The identification of NinaG as a member of the GMC oxidoreductase family suggests that the NinaG is an enzyme responsible for a redox reaction on small organic molecules. Given that the Rh1 accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum observed in ninaG mutants is similar to other genotypes, and vitamin A-free diets deficient in rhodopsin chromophore availability, we hypothesized that the NinaG enzyme acts in the production of 3-hydroxyretinal, the Rh1 chromophore. To investigate this possibility, HPLC was used to profile the retinal extracts from ninaG+ and ninaG mutant heads. A similar number of heads were used for preparation of these extracts, and the results reported here were reproduced in independently prepared samples. Fig. 6 displays representative chromatograms of these extracts at two wavelengths, 324 and 374 nm. These chromatograms have been scaled to the same y axis to allow direct comparison of the samples. Significant differences were observed among three peaks eluting at 3.5, 3.8, and 4.1 min, whereas the remaining chromatographic profiles of all samples were similar. To prove that all observed components are because of retinoid species, wild type flies were reared on a vitamin A-free diet. Extracts from such flies showed no chromatographic peaks in the region of interest at the wavelengths listed above. Furthermore, feeding retinal back to these adult flies restored the chromatographic profile observed for wild type flies reared on normal medium (data not shown). Fig. 6A shows that wild type flies possess a major retinoid species with a retention time of 4.1 min, with a secondary species indicated by the peak at 3.8 min. The ninaG flies extract yielded significantly smaller peaks at 4.1 and 3.8 min, indicating that they possess lower levels of both of these species. The λmax of both the 4.1- and 3.8-min peaks was 374 nm, and the electrospray mass spectrum (data not shown) of each peak showed an ion at m/z 301.5 for [M+H]+ of 3-hydroxyretinal. These peaks were assigned as 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal (4.1 min) and all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal (3.8 min), in accordance with earlier work showing these are the predominant retinoids extracted from Drosophila heads (10Seki T.

Extracts from wild type flies raised in the dark and provided with all-trans-retinal as the only retinoid source yielded a large increase in the 3.8-min peak at the expense of the 4.1-min peak (data not shown). This result is in agreement with the isomer assignments of the chromatographic peaks, because flies require light to convert 3-hydroxyretinal from the all-trans to the 11-cis isomer (34Isono K. Tanimura T. Oda Y. Tsukahara Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fig. 6B shows the chromatograms at 324 nm for wild type and ninaG extracts. The predominant retinoid elutes at 3.5 min and has a λmax of 324 nm. Interestingly, the electrospray mass spectrum of the corresponding chromatographic peak showed an ion at m/z 285.5 (data not shown), which is the expected m/z value for [M+H]+ of retinal. The HPLC/UV-visible/MS results of the all-trans-retinal standard yielded a chromatographic peak at 13.2 min with a λmax of 374 nm and m/z 285.5 (data not shown). Although the presence of an ion at m/z 285.5 suggests that the 3.5-min peak is an isomer of retinal, the major change in λmax (324 versus 374 nm) and retention time (3.5 versus 13.2 min) relative to the all-trans-retinal standard does not support this assignment. If the majority of the 3-hydroxyretinal extracted from wild type is complexed to Rh1 rhodopsin, the absence of 3-hydroxyretinal in the ninaG mutant background might be a secondary effect of ninaG action reducing Rh1 rhodopsin protein production. To discount this possibility, the profile of retinoids in flies expressing Rh4 in place of Rh1 (refe"
https://openalex.org/W2023006281,"Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) is an unfolded protein that contains well characterized actin-binding sites within the phosphorylation site domain (PSD), yet paradoxically, we now find that intact MARCKS does not bind to actin. Intact MARCKS also does not bind as well to calmodulin as does the PSD alone. Myristoylation at the N terminus alters how calmodulin binds to MARCKS, implying that, despite its unfolded state, the distant N terminus influences binding events at the PSD. We show that the free PSD binds with site specificity to MARCKS, suggesting that long-range intramolecular interactions within MARCKS are also possible. Because of the unusual primary sequence of MARCKS with an overall isoelectric point of 4.2 yet a very basic PSD (overall charge of +13), we speculated that ionic interactions between oppositely charged domains of MARCKS were responsible for long-range interactions within MARCKS that sterically influence binding events at the PSD and that explain the observed differences between properties of the PSD and MARCKS. Consistent with this hypothesis, chemical modifications of MARCKS that neutralize negatively charged residues outside of the PSD allow the PSD to bind to actin and increase the affinity of MARCKS for calmodulin. Similarly, both myristoylation of MARCKS and cleavage of MARCKS by calpain are shown to increase the availability of the PSD so as to activate its actin-binding activity. Because abundant evidence supports the conclusion that MARCKS is an important protein in regulating actin dynamics, our data imply that post-translational modifications of MARCKS are necessary and sufficient to regulate actin-binding activity.

Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) 1The abbreviations used are: MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; PSD, phosphorylation site domain; Rh-PSD, rhodamine-labeled phosphorylation site domain; CaM, calmodulin; MIANS, 2-(4-maleimidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; PSD, phosphorylation site domain; Rh-PSD, rhodamine-labeled phosphorylation site domain; CaM, calmodulin; MIANS, 2-(4-maleimidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is a well characterized, charge-polarized, natively unfolded molecule (1Wang J.

J. 2002; 362: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Sundaram M. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with a centrally located active site known as the phosphorylation site domain (PSD). Consistent with the paradigm for natively unfolded proteins, MARCKS is thought to interact with several ligands so as to integrate information from various signal transduction pathways to produce an output signal that regulates cell motile and contractile function. Numerous studies of the MARCKS protein have utilized a peptide with a sequence that corresponds to the PSD peptide as a substitute for studying interactions between the intact protein and its multiple ligands (3Sundaram M. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Rauch M.E. Ferguson C.G. Prestwich G.D. Cafiso D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14068-14076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although this approach intuitively appears to be logical, given the unfolded state of the native protein, the substitution of the PSD peptide for the intact protein has never been rigorously justified. In fact, there are several reported experiments that imply that the PSD peptide behaves differently from intact MARCKS. The non-phosphorylated PSD peptide is known to have extended structure, to nucleate polymerization, and to cross-link F-actin filaments (5Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 6Bubb M.R. Lenox R.H. Edison A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20873-20879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), presumably because of two binding sites with a site-specific Kd of ∼0.5 μm for F-actin (8Yarmola E.G. Edison A.R. Lenox R.H. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22351-22358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the PSD of MARCKS and its homolog MARCKS-related protein have both been shown to bind to actin with similar affinity, intact recombinant MARCKS-related protein, with or without myristoylation, exhibits a lower affinity for actin (much greater than 1 μm) and does not cross-link F-actin or induce G-actin polymerization (9Wohnsland F. Steinmetz M.O. Aebi U. Vergères G. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although full-length MARCKS has been shown to bind and bundle F-actin (4Rauch M.E. Ferguson C.G. Prestwich G.D. Cafiso D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14068-14076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Müller U. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the published data are only semi-quantitative. Comparison of the available data also suggests that intact MARCKS binds to vesicles containing acidic phospholipids with 104-fold lower affinity than does the PSD peptide alone (11Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang X. Aderem A. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28214-28219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent interactions between the PSD peptide and the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin have been extensively characterized, and a crystallographic structure is available that reveals that the phenylalanine residues of the PSD are buried in a hydrophobic tunnel of calmodulin and that the highly charged termini of the peptide interact with patches of opposite charge on the surface of calmodulin (12Yamauchi E. Nakatsu T. Matsubara M. Kato H. Taniguchi H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Once again, the PSD peptide is said to interact with higher affinity than the intact protein (Kd = 3.8 versus 12.7 nm, respectively, in 0.1 m KCl) with this ligand (13Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Hayashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48898-48902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been speculated that myristoylation of MARCKS adds a second, low affinity, calmodulin-binding site to MARCKS without evidence of cooperativity (13Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Hayashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48898-48902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Importantly, the addition of a second non-cooperative binding site cannot explain the long-known result that myristoylated MARCKS binds to calmodulin with higher affinity than does non-myristoylated MARCKS (14Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6878-6881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) unless both binding sites can interact with a single calmodulin molecule simultaneously or myristoylation itself changes the accessibility of the PSD to bind to calmodulin. Independent binding would change the stoichiometry of the interaction to two calmodulin molecules/MARCKS, but could not significantly increase the apparent affinity unless the calmodulin ligand was multivalent (oligomerized or attached to a bead). A recent crystallographic structure of a myristoylated peptide bound to calmodulin (15Matsubara M. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Taniguchi H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with the myristoyl group in the same hydrophobic tunnel and interacting with many of the same residues as the phenylalanines of the PSD peptide, suggests that both the N-terminal myristoyl- and PSD-binding sites could not simultaneously interact with calmodulin without significant steric effects. However, the hydrophobic tunnel through calmodulin has been shown to be quite flexible, and there are no experimental data to rule out the possibility that calmodulin could adjust to accommodate both putative binding regions. Of note, myristoylation of MARCKS is likely a dynamically regulated post-translational event (16Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Non-myristoylated MARCKS has been isolated from bovine brain (14Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6878-6881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a demyristoylase activity has been characterized (13Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Hayashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48898-48902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), thus making the acronym somewhat of a misnomer. For the purposes of this study, except in instances in which there may be some confusion, we refer to MARCKS as the non-myristoylated protein, for which, because of its natively unfolded structure, there is reason to believe that the native protein is equivalent to the recombinant protein. Many in vivo studies have implicated MARCKS in an actin-regulating function (18Song J.C. Hrnjez B.J. Farokhzad O.C. Matthews J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1239-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but the evidence is indirect and could in all cases be explained by invoking schemes in which MARCKS alters events that in turn regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. However, in several specific examples, MARCKS colocalizes with F-actin, and dissociation from actin is temporally associated with alterations in actin dynamics (22Iioka H. Ueno N. Kinoshita N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Lu D. Yang H. Lenox R.H. Raizada M.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), or MARCKS localization is altered after treatment that disrupts actin filaments (18Song J.C. Hrnjez B.J. Farokhzad O.C. Matthews J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1239-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Iioka H. Ueno N. Kinoshita N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Such data are most readily interpreted as direct effects of MARCKS on actin. One target of MARCKS, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, has been implicated in controlling the actin cytoskeleton by binding to many other actin-regulating proteins such as neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (24Sechi A.S. Wehland J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3685-3695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting one possible indirect mechanism of actin control by MARCKS. MARCKS may sequester phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the plasma membrane by reversible PSD binding (25Wang J. Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Murray D. Golebiewska U. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34401-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that published estimates of the intracellular MARCKS concentration (12 μm) (26Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are based on the yield of a bovine forebrain preparation, but the original data are probably more consistent with an intracellular concentration of 1.2 μm (27Albert K.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7046-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, although there may not be sufficient MARCKS to globally regulate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate metabolism, local pools of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate could potentially be regulated by MARCKS. If the PSD of MARCKS is incompletely accessible to its many ligands in the intact protein, then two questions emerge that are addressed in this study. 1) How can a natively unfolded protein maintain the PSD in a buried unavailable position? 2) Do mechanisms exist to alter the availability of the PSD? Here, we test a novel structural hypothesis related to the unusual charge distribution in the primary sequence of MARCKS and attribute physical significance to post-translational modifications that are now shown to regulate the actin-binding functions of MARCKS. Materials—Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from frozen muscle (Pel-Freeze Biologicals, Rogers, AR) in 5.0 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% sodium azide (pH 7.8) (28Kang F. Laine R.O. Bubb M.R. Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and pyrenyl-actin (actin labeled at Cys374 with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide)) was prepared with 0.5–0.95 mol of label/mol of protein using the method of Kouyama and Mihashi (29Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized by solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry at the University of Florida (8Yarmola E.G. Edison A.R. Lenox R.H. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22351-22358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The PSD peptide has the sequence KKKKKRFSFKKSFKLSGFSFKKSKK. The modified rhodamine-labeled PSD peptide (Rh-PSD) (8Yarmola E.G. Edison A.R. Lenox R.H. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22351-22358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was N-terminally modified through an amide link with 5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester and C-terminally labeled with Oregon Green 488 succinimidyl ester (5-isomer). Calpain I purified from porcine erythrocytes was obtained from Calbiochem. Calmodulin (CaM) isolated from bovine brain was purchased from Sigma. CaM-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Wheat germ CaM (Mr 16,800) fluorescently labeled with 2-(4-maleimidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS) at Cys27 (MIANS-CaM) was a gift from Dr. J. M. Chalovich (East Carolina University). Preparation of MARCKS and Myristoylated MARCKS—Murine full-length MARCKS DNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number M60474) was inserted into the pMW172 vector (30Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. Cells (300 ml) were grown overnight in LB medium and used to inoculate 2 liters of culture. After 3 h, protein expression was further induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (100 μm) for 1 h. Cultures were spun down and frozen at –80 °C. Frozen cultures were resuspended in buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 μm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.6 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (pH 7.9). Resuspended cells were sonicated, heated to 85 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE column, and fractions were collected with a 100–400 mm KCl gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). Fractions containing MARCKS (as shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using goat anti-MARCKS polyclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal synthetic peptide (Serotec Inc., Raleigh, NC)) were combined and concentrated on a hydroxylapatite column and further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl 300 HR. Concentration was determined by UV absorption at 258 nm (ϵM = 1100 at 258 nm) or by amino acid analysis. MARCKS typically eluted as a monomer at 40–70 μm and was stored at –80 °C in the column buffer, which contained 5 mm Tris-HCl, 5.0 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl (pH 7.9) (MARCKS buffer). For myristoylated MARCKS, E. coli strain BL21 was transformed with both the pBB131NMT plasmid (a gift from Dr. J. I. Gordon, Washington University), which contains the gene for yeast N-myristoyltransferase (31Duronio R.J. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the pMW172-MARCKS plasmid described above and selected in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin and ampicillin. A frozen stock of transformed colonies was used to inoculate 200 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and ampicillin. The overnight culture (2 liters) was grown to log phase; 400 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression; and the culture was grown for an additional 3 h. Myristoylated MARCKS was purified according to the protocol for MARCKS described above. Myristoylated MARCKS runs at ∼83 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (a slightly higher apparent molecular mass than that of MARCKS). It was characterized by mass spectroscopy with a peak at 29,874 Da compared with 29,664 Da for non-myristoylated MARCKS, and these correspond to the predicted masses based on the sequence. To test for the propensity of MARCKS to aggregate, gel-filtered monomeric MARCKS was concentrated to 300 μm in an Microcon filtration device (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and then diluted to 100, 18, or 3 μm in MARCKS buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 15 min through a 20% sucrose cushion either 1 or 12 h after dilution. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with loading volumes inversely proportional to the protein concentration. Assays of Actin-binding Function—Binding of MARCKS, covalently modified MARCKS, myristoylated MARCKS, or calpain-digested MARCKS to F-actin was detected by a high speed centrifugation assay. Mg2+-F-actin was prepared by converting Ca2+-G-actin to Mg2+-G-actin by the addition of 0.125 mm EGTA and 0.05 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature and then polymerizing by the addition of MgCl2 to a 2.0 mm final concentration. MARCKS (0–10 μm) was added to Mg2+-F-actin (0–40 μm) in a total volume of 100 μl and equilibrated for varying times (20 min to 24 h). F-actin was pelleted at 140,000 × g in a tabletop ultracentrifuge for 1 h. Supernatants (60 μl) were removed, and pellets were washed gently three times to remove trapped unbound protein. Supernatants and pellets were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE or by fluorescence spectrometry to determine bound (pellet) or free (supernatant) MARCKS. For SDS-PAGE of covalently cross-linked MARCKS, 12% polyacrylamide gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby protein stain (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) after the samples were concentrated in a filtration device. Actin filament cross-linking or bundling was assessed by a low speed pelleting assay. Filament aggregates of either ordered bundles or isotropic networks of cross-linked filaments sediment at low centrifugal forces. Proteins or peptides were added to Mg2+-F-actin (7 μm final concentration) to a final volume of 80 μl. After a 10-min incubation, samples were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 20 min to pellet actin filament aggregates and any associated proteins. Supernatants (30 μl) were removed and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The presence of bundling or cross-linking is indicated by the depletion of actin from the supernatant. The effects of MARCKS on the time course of actin filament polymerization were measured by the fluorescence change associated with the polymerization of pyrenyl-actin (29Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Ca2+-G-actin (3 μm, 4% pyrenyl-actin) was converted to Mg2+-actin as described above, and polymerization was initiated by adjustment to 50 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2. (Experiments without KCl are specifically indicated below.) Seeded polymerization assays employed cross-linked oligomeric F-actin seeds (32Bubb M.R. Govindasamy L. Yarmola E.G. Vorobiev S.M. Almo S.C. Somasundaram T. Chapman M.S. Agbandje-McKenna M. McKenna R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20999-21006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and 4% pyrenyl-labeled Mg2+-actin monomer (0.5 μm). The assay was shown to be linear in response to seed concentration and actin monomer concentration with variation from these conditions. Polymerization in the presence or absence of MARCKS was measured using pyrene fluorescence, and the initial polymerization rates were determined using time course data that could be fit with a line without systematic deviation. The time course of actin filament depolymerization was assayed by dilution of 10% pyrenyl-labeled F-actin (10 μm) polymerized with 2 mm MgCl2 to 0.1 μm in the same buffer containing 0 or 2.0 μm MARCKS. Calmodulin Binding Assays—Binding of the Rh-PSD peptide or MARCKS to CaM-Sepharose beads was determined in a pull-down assay as described previously (33Chuang T.T. Paolucci L. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28691-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of CaM-Sepharose suspended beads (total CaM concentration of 0–2 μm) were pipetted into 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing fixed amounts of Rh-PSD (0.6 or 0.06 μm) in 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) to a final volume of 400 μl. Tubes were centrifuged at 7840 × g for 1 min to pellet the CaM·Rh-PSD bead complex, and the amount of free Rh-PSD was quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy using excitation at 522 nm and emission at 575 nm. The concentration of available CaM on the Sepharose beads was calibrated based on data obtained at 0.6 μm Rh-PSD instead of using the manufacturer's estimate, which was ∼20% higher than the value we obtained (see “Results” for details). For full-length recombinant MARCKS, the amount of MARCKS in the supernatant was quantified by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. Because the fluorescence of the Rh-PSD peptide increased by a factor of 2.3 upon binding to CaM, the increment in fluorescence could also be used to measure the fraction of bound Rh-PSD at varying concentrations of CaM in solution. Also, the fluorescence anisotropy of the Rh-PSD peptide changed upon binding to CaM, providing another quantitative assay for binding, which is discussed more completely below. Finally, wheat germ MIANS-CaM, labeled specifically with a fluorophore at its single cysteine residue at position 27, has been used successfully to generate a binding isotherm for calmodulin-binding proteins based on a large increment in fluorescence intensity (34Kasturi R. Vasulka C. Johnson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7958-7964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Saturation of MIANS-CaM by recombinant MARCKS, but not by the PSD peptide, yielded a significant increase in fluorescence intensity with excitation at 322 nm and emission at 438 nm. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Data were collected on a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer. The Rh-PSD was excited with vertically polarized light at 546 nm. The horizontal (Ih) and vertical (Iv) components of the emitted light were detected distal to a long-pass filter with a nominal cutoff of 570 nm (catalog no. 03 FCG 089; Melles Griot, Rochester, NY) for ∼20 s for each component. The total intensity of the Rh-PSD peptide fluorescence (Iv + 2GIh) was found to change proportionally upon MARCKS or CaM binding. The ratio (R) of the fluorescence of the bound species divided by that of the free species was calculated. The fluorescence anisotropy (r) was calculated using r = (Iv – GIh)/(Iv + 2GIh) (8Yarmola E.G. Edison A.R. Lenox R.H. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22351-22358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The G factor was determined for each experiment with the peptide in solution excited with horizontally polarized light and averaged over ∼10 measurements. The experiments were performed using 0.3-ml samples in glass cuvettes. For competition assays, the direct binding assay was used to estimate an amount of MARCKS that bound approximately two-thirds of the Rh-PSD peptide, and the anisotropy was measured at these concentrations of MARCKS and the Rh-PSD with varying concentrations of the competing unlabeled PSD. The fitting procedure for the fluorescence anisotropy data included correction for the fact that the total fluorescence intensity changed upon binding of the PSD to CaM (see Fig. 2, B and C) or MARCKS (see Fig. 4). Because bound MARCKS or CaM changed the fluorescence intensity of the Rh-PSD, the observed anisotropy (r) was a nonlinear function of the fraction of PSD that bound to MARCKS or CaM: r = (rf + (R·rb – rf)·b)/(1 + (R – 1)·b), where rf is the anisotropy of the free PSD, rb is the anisotropy of the PSD bound to MARCKS or CaM, b is the fraction of PSD bound to MARCKS or CaM, and the ratio R is defined above.Fig. 4Intramolecular interactions between the Rh-PSD and MARCKS.A, when MARCKS was added to the Rh-PSD (44 nm) in 50 mm KCl, 0.6 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), the fluorescence of the Rh-PSD (not shown) decreased with increasing MARCKS concentrations, and at saturation, the fractional decrease was calculated as 0.53. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured in the same samples, with an observed increase in anisotropy consistent with a direct interaction between MARCKS and the smaller fluorescent ligand. Inset, the unlabeled PSD peptide was able to displace the Rh-PSD (44 nm) from MARCKS (1 μm), consistent with site-specific binding and a 1:1 stoichiometry of MARCKS to PSD or Rh-PSD. When saturating amounts of unlabeled PSD peptide were included in the mixture of MARCKS and the Rh-PSD, the anisotropy of the Rh-PSD decreased to a level near that expected for the free Rh-PSD (compare inset with origin of the main panel), and the level of fluorescence increased, also to base-line levels (not shown). A simultaneous fit to all of the data shown using the assumption that the intramolecular PSD of MARCKS competed equivalently with the intermolecular labeled and unlabeled PSD peptides for a single binding site on MARCKS gives a Kd in the range of 10 nm (solid lines), with good fits obtainable for any Kd ≤ 40 nm. Data consistent with site-specific binding were also obtained in the presence of increasing amounts of polylysine (▴). The apparent Kd for polylysine is ≤14 nm. When one polylysine occupies that site, Rh-PSD is excluded. B, shown are the results from SDS-PAGE of untreated MARCKS (lanes 1 and 4), EDC-cross-linked MARCKS (lanes 2 and 5), and EDC-cross-linked MARCKS with the rhodamine-labeled N-terminal PSD peptide (lanes 3 and 6) visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (lanes 1–3) or by indirect UV fluorescence of the rhodamine label (lanes 4–6). C, purified recombinant MARCKS (lanes 1, 4, 6, and 8) and two RAW 264.7 whole cell extracts (one in lanes 2, 5, 7, and 9 and the other in lanes 3 and 10) were stained with Coomassie Blue (lanes 1–3) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and Western-blotted for MARCKS (lanes 4–7) or for a gel overlay using the rhodamine-labeled N-terminal PSD peptide as a probe (lanes 8–10). The two Western blots are of identical samples transferred on different days and reveal that the major immunoreactive band in the cell extracts has slightly lower electrophoretic mobility compared with recombinant MARCKS. The gel overlay was imaged by indirect fluorescence, and the digital fluorescence image was electronically inverted.

We examined expression of PINX1 by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in 73 cases of GC, and 45 of these cases were further studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by PCR with microsatellite marker D8S277. Reduced expression (tumor vs normal ratio<0.5) of PINX1 was detected in 50 (68.5%) of 73 cases of GC. GC tissues with reduced expression of PINX1 showed significantly higher telomerase activities as measured by telomeric repeat amplification protocol than those with normal expression of PINX1 (P=0.031). LOH of PINX1 locus was detected in 15 (33.3%) of 45 cases of GC and was correlated significantly with reduced expression of PINX1 (P=0.031). Expression of PINX1 in a GC cell line, MKN-74, was induced by treatment with trichostatin A (TSA) or nicotinamide (NAM). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay of MKN-74 cells revealed that acetylation of histone H4 in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of PINX1 was enhanced by treatment with TSA or NAM, whereas acetylation of histone H3 was not changed by TSA or NAM. In addition, TSA or NAM treatment led to inhibition of telomerase activity in MKN-74 cells. These results indicate that LOH of PINX1 locus and hypoacetylation of histone H4 in the 5' UTR of PINX1 are associated with reduced expression of PINX1 in GC."

Similar to other helminth parasites, O. volvulus is capable of evading the host's immune responses by a variety of defense mechanisms, including the detoxification activities of the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Additionally, in response to drug treatment, helminth GSTs are highly up-regulated, making them tempting targets both for chemotherapy and for vaccine development. We analyzed the three-dimensional x-ray structure of the major cytosolic GST from O. volvulus (Ov-GST2) in complex with its natural substrate glutathione and its competitive inhibitor S-hexylglutathione at 1.5 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively. From the perspective of the biochemical classification, the Ov-GST2 seems to be related to π-class GSTs. However, in comparison to other π-class GSTs, in particular to the host's counterpart, the Ov-GST2 reveals significant and unusual differences in the sequence and overall structure. Major differences can be found in helix α-2, an important region for substrate recognition. Moreover, the binding site for the electrophilic co-substrate is spatially increased and more solvent-accessible. These structural alterations are responsible for different substrate specificities and will form the basis of parasite-specific structure-based drug design investigations.

These structural alterations are responsible for different substrate specificities and will form the basis of parasite-specific structure-based drug design investigations. Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. It is often called river blindness because of its most extreme manifestation and because the blackflies that transmit the disease breed in fast flowing waters. It is the world's second leading infectious cause of blindness. About 18 million people are infected with O. volvulus in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and Central and South America. Moreover, roughly 50 million individuals are at risk of acquiring the parasite. Onchocerciasis causes chronic suffering and severe disability. Furthermore, it significantly impedes the socio-economic development in affected communities (www.who.int/tdr/index.html). Chemotherapeutic approaches to control parasite transmission and to treat onchocerciasis rely on drugs that only kill microfilariae and infectious larvae but not the adult parasites. So far this necessitates the continuous use of these microfilaricides until the adult worms die. Therefore, the development of drugs that also effectively kill the adult worms would greatly support the control and treatment of O. volvulus infections (1.Molyneux D.H. Bradley M. Hoerauf A. Kyelem D. Taylor M.J. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 516-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the potential development of drug-resistant strains of the nematode also demands the identification of alternative drug candidates to control the disease (2.Sangster N. Parasitology. 1996; 113: S201-S216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). O. volvulus, similar to other parasitic organisms, is capable of surviving in an immunologically competent host by employing a variety of immune evasion strategies and defense mechanisms, including the detoxification and the repair mechanisms of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSH, reduced glutathione; r.m.s., root mean square.1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSH, reduced glutathione; r.m.s., root mean square.; EC 2.5.1.18). GSTs are an ancient and diverse superfamily of multifunctional proteins represented by a number of species-independent gene classes. They play prominent roles in detoxification metabolism by catalyzing the nucleophilic addition of reduced glutathione (GSH) to numerous endobiotic and xenobiotic electrophilic substrates, usually promoting their inactivation, degradation, and excretion (3.Coles B.F. Kadlubar F.F. Biofactors. 2003; 17: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). GSTs participate in the complex network of catalytic functions that protect tissue against oxidative damage by detoxifying hydroperoxides of phospholipids, fatty acids, and DNA before they become engaged in free radical propagation reactions that can ultimately lead to the destruction of intracellular macromolecules (4.Hayes J.D. Strange R.C. Pharmacology. 2000; 61: 154-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a potential modulating activity, mediated through protein interactions, on oxidative stress responsive cascades has been proposed (5.Kilili K.G. Atanassova N. Vardanyan A. Clatot N. Al-Sabarna K. Kanellopoulos P.N. Makris A.M. Kampranis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24540-24551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Several additional functions attributed to GSTs include the binding, transport, and storage of hydrophobic ligands (6.Ralat L.A. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50204-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the isomerization of maleylacetoacetate, and the regulation of stress kinases and apoptosis (7.Wilce M.C.

The importance of GSTs as a promising therapeutic target is underlined by their significant role in a variety of clinically relevant processes, such as susceptibility to disease and drug resistance (10.Townsend D.M. Tew K.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7369-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In a parasitic context, it is especially important to consider their function in the regulation of oxidative stress response, in drug resistance, and possibly in the modulation of the host immune defense mechanisms. In previous studies, we have characterized three different GSTs from O. volvulus (Ov-GST1–3) that demonstrate different physiological functions within the parasite. The extracellular glycosylated Ov-GST1 is located directly at the parasite-host interface and has GSH-dependent prostaglandin D synthase activity. It therefore has the potential to participate in the modulation of immune cell functions by contributing to the production of parasite-derived prostanoids. On the basis of gene structure, amino acid sequence, and immunological and kinetic properties, it was possible to place the Ov-GST1 in close vicinity to the σ-class (11.Sommer A. Nimtz M.

Walter R.D. Liebau E. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3603-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Ov-GST3 belongs to the ω-class and represents a highly stress-responsive GST that is up-regulated in response to oxidative stress, presumably providing a defense against immune-initiated peroxidation of parasite membranes (13.Brophy P.M. Campbell A.M. van Eldik A.J. Teesdale-Spittle P.H. Liebau E. Wang M.F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Ov-GST2 is the major cytosolic GST in O. volvulus, in which the intracellular amount estimated constitutes about 0.1% of the total protein content in adult filarial worms. The general distribution of the highly abundant enzyme in all tissues and life stages of the parasite indicates its essential function. We propose that one of the biological functions of the Ov-GST2 is to neutralize, via GSH conjugation, glutathione peroxidase activity, or passive binding, the cytotoxic lipid peroxidation products arising from immune-initiated attack on parasitic membranes (14.Liebau E. Wildenburg G. Brophy P.M. Walter R.D. Henkle-Duhrsen K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15.Wildenburg G. Liebau E. Henkle-Duhrsen K. Exp.

Homology modeling and sequence alignment predicted the Ov-GST2 to be topologically related to the mammalian π-class GSTs, and it was suspected that the hydrophobic substrate-binding site of the parasitic enzyme is more solvent-accessible than the typical π-class enzyme of the host (13.Brophy P.M.

Heterologous expression of the Ov-GST2 in Escherichia coli, purification, and crystallization were performed as described previously (27.Hoppner J. Perbandt M. Betzel C. Walter R.D. Liebau E. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1496-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were collected with synchrotron radiation at the consortium beamline X13 (Hamburger Synchrotron Laboratory/Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron). The programs DENZO and SCALE-PACK (28.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (37878) Google Scholar) were used for data analysis and reduction. Further calculations were performed applying the CCP4 program suite (29.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19570) Google Scholar). For crystals of the Ov-GST2·GSH complex, the space group was assigned to be P21 with cell dimensions of a = 51.6, b = 82.3, c = 56.7 Å, and β = 95.9°. The asymmetric unit contains one dimer, resulting in a Matthew's coefficient of 2.49 Å3/Da (30.Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the Ov-GST2·GSH complex was determined by molecular replacement, using the program package AMoRe (31.Navazza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5025) Google Scholar). A π-class GST dimer from human placenta (Protein Data Bank entry code 1AQW) was used as a search model. All data within the resolution range of 10–4 Å were used for the calculations, revealing the position of the dimer in the asymmetric unit. A rigid body refinement of the initial model reduced the R-factor from 45.2 to 39.7% for all data in the resolution range of 20–3 Å The structure of the Ov-GST2·S-hexylglutathione complex was also solved by molecular replacement later on using the refined structure of the Ov-GST2 as a search model. Two dimers were positioned in the asymmetric unit. All non-conserved residues in the search model were replaced by alanines. Insertions and deletions were not included in the first refinement cycle. Both complex structures were refined using similar protocols. The refinement was performed by program REFMAC5 (32.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), and the progress was monitored by the continuous decrease of the free R-value (33.Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the asymmetric unit contained two GST monomers, use was made of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints for all non-hydrogen atoms throughout the course of refinement. The CCP4 program suite (29.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19570) Google Scholar) and the program TURBO-FRODO (34.Roussell A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) were used for calculations and model building, respectively. The ligands were identified by difference Fourier techniques in all G-sites of the molecules in the asymmetric unit. Solvent molecules were automatically added at the end of the refinement process using the program wARP (35.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) and checked for chemically reasonable positions where difference density exceeded 3σ. The quality of the final models was verified using the program PROCHECK (36.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornten J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). A summary of the refinement statistics is shown in Table I. The structures of Ov-GST2 in complex with the physiological substrate GSH and the competitive inhibitor S-hexylglutathione were determined independently to characterize the substrate binding site (G-site) and the electrophilic binding site (H-site) of the enzyme. Both complexes have been crystallized under identical conditions, and the space group was assigned to be P21. Interestingly, although crystals of Ov-GST2 in complex with GSH reveal one dimer/asymmetric unit, crystals of Ov-GST2 in complex with S-hexylglutathione reveal two dimers/asymmetric unit. The structure of the Ov-GST2·GSH complex was refined to a resolution of 1.5 Å (r = 15.0%, Rfree = 17.6%) and of the Ov-GST2·S-hexylglutathione complex to 1.8 Å (r = 19.9%, Rfree = 22.3%). No significant changes in the tertiary structure of both complexes were observed. The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of the Cα atoms is within the range of deviations calculated between each monomer of one structure. The superimposed monomers merely show a r.m.s. deviation in the range of 0.3–0.4 Å for all Cα atoms. The G-site seems to be relatively rigid, and the overall structure is not notably affected by different ligands. The bound ligands do not affect the crystal packing, as they are not involved in any crystal contacts. Similar effects are also observed for the human π-class (19.Prade L. Huber R. Manoharan T.H. Fahl W.E. Reuter W. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1287-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and α-class (37.Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G.

The high resolution obtained facilitates the determination of solvent molecules with high accuracy. Both structures are well ordered, and the final models include all residues of the enzyme. The positions of the ligands are clearly defined by the electron density. The statistics of the model quality are summarized in Table I. The overall fold of Ov-GST2 shows that it is clearly related to π-class GSTs with secondary elements given in Figs. 1 and 2. The monomers consist of two domains linked by a loop between the helices α-3 and α-4. Domain 1 (residues 1–74) is built from a four-stranded mixed β-sheet that is surrounded by 3 α-helices (βαβαββα motif). Domain 2 (residues 82–208) is largely α-helical. The typical α-class extra helix α-9, the most important structural feature to distinguish between α- and π-class enzymes, is not present in this structure.Fig. 2Ribbon diagram of Ov-GST2. The Ov-GST2 monomer emphasizing the secondary structural elements. Helices are colored light blue, β-strands are green, and the 310 helices are dark blue. The S-hexylglutathione molecule bound to the active site is shown in ball-and-stick representation. The program RIBBONS (67.Carson M. J. Mol. Graph. 1987; 5: 103-106Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar) was used to produce the figure. N, N terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are two residues that adopt cis-conformation. One is a characteristic proline residue (Pro51), found to be highly conserved in all GSTs, which is located in the loop that connects α-2 to β-3. The other residue, Leu50, is a G-site residue that has two hydrogen bonds to GSH and S-hexylgutathione and also adopts a cis-configuration in both complexes. In their biologically active form, cytosolic GSTs are dimers, and Ov-GST2 conforms to that rule. The dimeric structure is stable, with molecular recognition at the subunit interface being class-specific. Intersubunit contacts are mediated by hydrophobic contacts as well as by hydrogen bonds. Intersubunit hydrogen bonds and salt links between the monomers within 3.5 Å are: Phe47A–Lys127B, Arg68A–Asp88B, Arg72A–Glu81B, and Arg72A–Thr85B. All contacts are related by local symmetry. Particularly, the side-chain of residue Arg68 (helix α-3) serves as a hydrophilic anchor and forms two hydrogen bridges to the side-chain of residue Asp88 (helix α-4) from the other subunit of the homodimer. This arginine-mediated intersubunit contact is very specific for α- and π-class enzymes (38.Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 72-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a classical π-class enzyme, Tyr49 acts as a hydrophobic “key.” However, for Ov-GST2, Phe47 (corresponds to Tyr49 in the human π-GST) (Fig. 1) acts as the hydrophobic key extending from the loop preceding β-3, which fits into the hydrophobic “lock” provided by the residues Gly93, Leu131, Lys127, and Phe128 of the other subunit. This lock is located between helices α-4 and α-5. Comparison of the Ov-GST2 structure with the human π-class enzyme yields an overall r.m.s. value on Cα atoms of 1.5 Å (Fig. 3a), which is significantly higher than expected for members within the same class (<0.7 Å). With regard to sequence identity, this result is consistent with the low level of only 42% versus an expected sequence identity of >75%. In comparison with that, the human, pig, and mouse π-class GSTs can be superpositioned with r.m.s. values of 0.5–0.6 Å. The most significant differences observed between the human π-class enzyme and the Ov-GST2 occur in the regions of residues 29–42, 124–146, and 192–201 (Fig. 3). Region 29–42 includes strand β-2 and helix α-2, with a two-residue insertion (40.Lo Bello M. Oakley A.J. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Nuccetelli M. Mazzarese G. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ricci G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6207-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 41.Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) in the human enzyme (Fig. 1) leading to a bent helical structure. It is highly remarkable that this region also involves a G-site residue, Phe38, which is replaced by Trp in the human, mouse, and pig enzyme. The largest deviation, however, is placed at the end of helix α-8 (residues 192–201). The sequence is not conserved, and the human enzyme reveals a distorted helix instead of a regular helix in Ov-GST2 in this region (Fig. 3). The G-site part of the active site is formed by helix α-2, by residues connecting helix α-2 and strand β-3, and by a segment connecting strand β-4 to helix α-3. The overall geometry is similar but not identical to that of the human π-class GST. The H-site is formed by the loop connecting strand β-1 and helix α-1, by the C-terminal part of helix α-4, and by residues of the C terminus following helix α-8. Residues in contact with GSH and the GSH part of S-hexylglutathione are Tyr7, Phe8, Leu13, Phe38, Gln49, Leu50, Ser63, Arg95, and Asp96 (from the other monomer) as summerized in Table II.Table IIIntermolecular contacts between Ov-GST2 and S-hexylglutathioneHydrogen bondsDonorAcceptorDistanceGTX X 1 N1ASP B 96 OD12.93ARG A 95 NH2GTX X 1 O113.16SER A 63 OGGTX X 1 O112.59SER A 63 NGTX X 1 O122.89GTX X 1 N2LEU A 50 O2.78LEU A 50 NGTX X 1 O22.87GTX X 1 O32GLN A 49 OE12.97TYR A 7 OHGTX X 1 SG23.11Hydrophobic interactionsAtom 1Atom 2DistanceGTX X 1 C4SGLYT A 204 CA3.78GTX X 1 C3PHE A 38 CE23.86GTX X 1 SG2LEU A 13 CD13.63GTX X 1 C1LEU A 13 CD13.75GTX X 1 CB1LEU A 13 CD13.67GTX X 1 CG1LEU A 13 CD13.73GTX X 1 CD1LEU A 13 CD13.87GTX X 1 C4SILE A 10 CD13.79GTX X 1 C2PHE A 8 CE13.85 Open table in a new tab In Ov-GST2, the α-carbonyl group of the γ-glutamyl moiety is aligned by two hydrogen bonds of Ser63 and one hydrogen bond of Arg95 (Fig. 4), which is a remarkable difference to the situation found in the human π-class GST. Here, Gln64 takes over the task of Arg95. The α-amino group interacts with Asp96 from the other monomer, and the backbone of the γ-glutamyl moiety is stabilized by van der Waals contacts to Leu13. In the human counterpart, Leu13 is exchanged by Arg (Figs. 1 and 5). This exchange is the most drastic change, influencing the active site geometry and resulting in a reduction of the volume of the H-site binding pocket (Fig. 5). The backbone of the Cys moiety of GSH forms two hydrogen bonds with Leu50, a residue in cis-conformation. The Gly moiety is bound by Gln49, the backbone being further stabilized by van der Waals contacts to Phe8 and Phe38. The third amino acid exchange in the G-site is Phe38 against Trp in the human enzyme. In Ov-GST2, Phe38 is only involved in van der Waals contacts, whereas in the human enzyme Trp forms a hydrogen bond to the Gly moiety. When comparing the Ov-GST2·GSH complex with the Ov-GST2·S-hexylglutathione complex, there are no differences in the positions of residues participating in the G-site (Fig. 4). A similar positioning of the sulfur atom has been observed in π-class enzymes from pig (38.Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 72-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), mouse (17.Garcia-Saez I. Parraga A. Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Coll M. J. Mol.

It is generally accepted that GSH predominantly reacts as the anionic thiolate and that, in the π-class, a network of hydrogen bonds may be responsible for the activation of the GSH sulfur. Already, it has been shown for the human π-class enzyme that Tyr7 stays in the identical position in both the apo- and the GSH-complexed structures (21.Oakley A.J. Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Ricci G. Rossjohn J. Villar H.O. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This observation supports the proposal that Tyr7 will not be ionized in the reaction mechanism (39.Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). This situation is also observed for the Ov-GST2 structure with Tyr7 in hydrogen bonding distance to the sulfur atom of GSH and to the amide nitrogen of Leu13.Fig. 5Surface presentation of the active site from the human placenta π-class GST with bound S-hexylglutathione shown as sticks (a) and the corresponding region of the O. volvulus GST2 (b). Here most of the H-site residues are exchanged, leading to a more solvent-accessible H-site. The program GRASP (61.Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar) was used to prepare the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The entrance of the H-site can be described as a pocket with side walls formed by Phe8 and Tyr108. The bottom is formed by Lys35, Ile10, and Gly204 and the deep end by Leu13, Thr102, and Val99 (Fig. 5b). The S-hexyl-moiety of S-hexylglutathione is sandwiched between the aromatic rings of Phe8 and Tyr108 and is kept in place by Ile10 and Gly204. Phe8, Ile10, and Gly204 are in van der Waals contacts within the range of 3.7–3.8 Å (Figs. 4 and 5). Tyr108 has been shown to enhance Michael additions of GSH to electrophilic substrates (21.Oakley A.J. Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Ricci G. Rossjohn J. Villar H.O. Parker M.W. J. Mol.

In free-living protozoa, lysozyme-like proteins are involved in the digestion of phagocytosed bacteria. Here, we purified a protein with lysozyme activity from Dictyostelium amoebae, which constitutes the founding member, a novel class of lysozymes. By tagging the protein with green fluorescent protein or the Myc epitope, a new type of lysozyme-containing vesicle was identified that was devoid of other known lysosomal enzymes. The most highly expressed isoform, encoded by the alyA gene, was knocked out by homologous recombination. The mutant cells had greatly reduced enzymatic activity and grew inefficiently when bacteria were the sole food source. Over time the mutant gained the ability to internalize bacteria more efficiently, so that the defect in digestion was compensated by increased uptake of food particles.

The lysosome is the most potent degradative organelle within the eukaryotic cell. It contains hydrolytic enzymes that fulfill essential functions. In humans many mutations affecting its constituents lead to the diseased state, often with dramatic consequences. Mutations of this sort fall into two classes. The first class affects proteins involved in trafficking to and from the lysosome and/or regulating its integrity by modulating fusion and fission events. Among these proteins are Rabs, proteins belonging to a family that act as molecular timers (1Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrow K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) controlling virtually every trafficking step in the cell (2Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and the LYST proteins, which when mutated cause enlarged lysosomes manifested as Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (3Barbosa M.D.F.S. Ngyuyen Q.A. Tchernev V.T. Ashley J.A. Detter J.C. Blaydes S.M. Brandt S.J. Chotai D. Hodgman C. Solari R.E. Lovett M. Kingsmore S.F. Nature. 1996; 382: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The second class of mutations affects lysosomal enzymes with metabolic roles. These enzymes degrade macromolecules that the cell wants to dispose of, producing small metabolites that are useful building blocks or provide energy if completely degraded in the cytosol and mitochondria. Tragically, many of the lysosomal enzymes are exoenzymes, i.e. they digest macromolecules from their ends. If one of these enzymes is lacking, degradation proceeds up to the residue that cannot be removed, and as a consequence, all steps that ensue will be blocked. This leads to the accumulation of partially degraded intermediates within the lysosomes culminating either in the formation of toxic compounds or blowing up the volume of the lysosome until it sterically interferes with vital cellular activities. Depending on the cell type that is most seriously harmed, be it neurons, muscle, or leukocytes, patients will suffer from mental retardation, cardiac failure, or immunodeficiency (4Winchester B. Vellodi A. Young E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Walkley S.U. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2001; 14: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, free-living amoebae are unlikely to develop lysosomal storage diseases because their endocytic pathway differs from that of mammalian cells. In mammalian cells, the lysosome is a dead-end of vesicular trafficking. In most cell types, it accumulates non-degradable material and retains it for the lifetime of the cell and organism. In amoebae, endocytosed cargo transits through the cell. Any material that cannot be degraded because specific enzymes are lacking is released from the cell by exocytosis after an hour. Despite these differences, amoebae such as Dictyostelium can serve as bona fide model systems to study lysosomal function in vivo. Interference with Rabs (6Buczynski G. Bush J. Zhang L.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 737-744PubMed Google Scholar) produces phenotypes in Dictyostelium that are comparable with those observed in mammalian cells, indicating that many lysosomal constituents are functionally conserved in evolution. On the other hand, a deficiency of cathepsin D leads to profound defects in mice (10Saftig P. Hetman M. Schmahl W. Weber K. Heine L. Mossmann H. Koster A. Hess B. Evers M. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3599-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and sheep (11Tyynela J. Sohar I. Sleat D.E. Gin R.M. Donnelly R.J. Baumann M. Haltia M. Lobel P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2786-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) but is tolerated well in Dictyostelium (12Journet A. Chapel A. Jehan S. Adessi C. Freeze H. Klein G. Garin J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3833-3843PubMed Google Scholar). More recently mice have been generated that specifically lack the M isoform of lysozyme, which constitutes the most prominent bacteriolytic activity in the airways (13Markart P. Korfhagen T.R. Weaver T.E. Akinbi H.T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 169: 454-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although homozygous mutants increase the level of expression of the lysozyme P isoform to compensate for their deficiency, they remain much more sensitive to infections of the lung (14Markart P. Faust N. Graf T. Na C.L. Weaver T.E. Akinbi H.T. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lysozymes are not only found in animals but are also present in numerous phylogenetically diverse organisms such as plants, fungi, bacteria, and bacteriophages (15Jollès P. Jollès J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 63: 165-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Several different classes of theses enzymes have been described revealing that structurally diverse proteins fulfill the function of degrading the peptidoglycan of bacteria by splitting a 1,4-linkage between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine (16Bachali S. Jager M. Hassanin A. Schoentgen F. Jollès P. Fiala-Medioni A. Deutsch J.S. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 652-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that Dictyostelium has been regarded as a good model for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying phagocytosis of cells from higher organisms, e.g. mammalian defensive cells, nothing is known about the molecular armament that it uses to efficiently eliminate the enormous number of bacteria phagocytosed for nutrition. We have isolated a protein with lysozyme activity from Dictyostelium amoebae. The protein is the first antimicrobial polypeptide characterized in this protozoan organism at the molecular level, and it appears to be a member of a previously unrecognized lysozyme family. The enzyme is stored in a unique organelle, and disruption of its gene had a dramatic effect on the phenotype. Purification of Lysozyme—The AX2 strain of Dictyostelium discoideum was cultured at 22 °C axenically (17Watts D.J. Ashworth J.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Amoebae in late-logarithmic phase were harvested, sedimented at 320 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and washed 2 times in Sörensen's 17 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.0. Freshly harvested and washed amoebae (2,5 × 109 cells) were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing in 5 volumes of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, supplemented with complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequent purification steps were carried out at 10 °C, and samples were kept on ice. The 150,000 × g supernatant was applied to a chromatography column (Econo column 2.5 × 20 cm, Bio-Rad) manually filled with a Bio-Gel matrix (Bio-Gel A-0.5m; Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Adsorbed protein was eluted by washing the column with the same buffer (350 ml) and with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (200 ml). Finally, the column was washed with 500 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (200 ml). Fractions with lysozyme activity were pooled and loaded on a Resource S cation exchange column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Adsorbed protein was eluted by first washing the column with the same buffer (5 ml), then by use of a gradient from 0 to 300 mm NaCl (25 ml) and finally by a wash with 1 m NaCl. Each fraction was tested for lysozyme activity. Protein Analysis—Protein concentration was determined using the microbicinchoninic acid reagent assay (Pierce) and hen egg lysozyme as standard (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Tricine 1The abbreviations used are: Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Aly, amoeba lysozyme; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Schägger and von Jagow (19Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). For N-terminal sequencing proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide, subjected to Tricine SDS-PAGE and subsequent semidry electroblotting using a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott; Applied Biosystems), and analyzed using a gas-phase protein sequencer (model 437A; Applied Biosystems). For the detection of glycosylation proteins were analyzed after blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane using a glycan detection assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). For mass spectrometric analysis, samples were dialyzed against 5% acetic acid and mixed with the same volume of saturated trans-sinapinic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as UV-absorbing matrix. About 10 μlofthe samples were spotted on a stainless steel probe tip and dried at room temperature. Measurements were performed using a Bruker Relex MALDI-TOF. Ions were formed by laser desorption at 337 nm using an N2 laser. Spectra were recorded with an acceleration voltage of 35 kV in the linear mode. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with bovine serum albumin and carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes (both from Sigma) as external standards. Enzyme Assays—Lysozyme activity was measured as described previously (20Jacobs T. Leippe M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In all assays hen egg lysozyme (Sigma) served as a control. To monitor lysozyme activity during purification, column fractions were analyzed using the lysoplate technique (21Osserman E.F. Lawlor D.P. J. Exp. Med. 1966; 124: 921-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). For quantitative measurements of lysozyme activity, cell wall degradation of lyophilized Micrococcus luteus (Sigma) was determined turbidimetrically essentially according to Shugar (22Shugar D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1952; 8: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Degradation of cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Sigma) was tested in the same assay. To determine the effect of pH and ionic strength on lysozyme activity, the turbimetric assay was adjusted according to Dobson et al. (23Dobson D.E. Prager E.M. Wilson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11607-11616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various buffers were prepared as specified by Miller and Golder (24Miller G.L. Golder R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1950; 29: 420-423PubMed Google Scholar). They covered a pH range from 3.5 to 7.5, their ionic strength varying between 0.005 and 0.2. The occurrence of reducing N-acetyl amino sugars was tested as described by Reissig et al. (25Reissig J.L. Storminger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chitinolytic activity was assayed using chitin glycol (Sigma) as a substrate (26Yamada H. Imoto T. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 92: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Activity against viable bacteria was determined in a microdilution susceptibility assay as published previously (27Andrä J. Berninghausen O. Wülfken J. Leippe M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Gene Disruption—The sequence encoding AlyA was amplified from AX2 genomic DNA using primers bearing an EcoRI recognition sequence in front of the start codon (5′-CCGGAATTCAAAATGAGAATTGCTTTCTTTTTACTTGTTTTAGCCG-3′) and a BglII site after the last codon specifying an amino acid (5′-GGAAGATCTTTCGAGATCAAAACCATTACAGGTCTTTTCAGC-3′), cleaved with the corresponding enzymes, and ligated into the same sites of pIC19H. After deleting a SalI site in the polylinker of this plasmid, which is also recognized by HincII, the lysozyme sequence was cut at its remaining HincII site, and a blunted cassette conferring blasticidin resistance, isolated via BamHI and HindIII digestion from plasmid pUCBsrDel-Bam (28Adachi H. Hasebe T. Yoshinaga K. Ohta T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was inserted. The resulting vector was cleaved with SmaI and NruI situated in the polylinker region to release the plasmid backbone required for replication and selection in Escherichia coli. The remaining linear 2.5-kilobase fragment containing 560 bp of lysozyme homologous sequences upstream and 550 bp downstream of the resistance cassette was transfected into Dictyostelium AX2 cells by electroporation, and the resulting clones were isolated by limited dilution into multiwell plates. To identify clones that carry a disrupted lysozyme gene, we performed PCR on preparations of genomic DNA (29Nellen W. Datta S. Reymond C. Sivertsen A. Mann S. Crowley T. Firtel R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 18: 67-100Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar) using primers (5′-GTGGTGCTCTCTATTTCACAGC-3′ and 5′-CTTGTTCAACCCACATGGCTGG-3′) that flank 85 bp of the coding sequence containing two introns of different lengths which distinguish between the genes encoding lysozyme isoforms. Expression of Lysozyme and Tagged Variants—To rescue possible defects in a lysozyme mutant, EcoRI and HindIII enzymes were used to cut out lysozyme from pIC19H, and the gene was inserted into the expression vector pDEX-RH (30Faix J. Dittrich W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) cut with the same restriction enzymes. To allow for detection of the transgene, a Myc epitope sequence cloned in pIC20R (31Drengk A. Fritsch J. Schmauch C. Rühling H. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1814-1819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was cut out using SmaI and AccI enzymes, blunted by filling in the two-base overhang, and ligated into the HincII site within the lysozyme sequence of the pDEX-RH expression construct. To monitor the distribution of lysozyme, a GFP fusion was constructed. The lysozyme coding sequence from the ATG up to the cleavage site of the prodomain was amplified by PCR using a cDNA library in phage λ (courtesy of Peter Devreotes) as a template. The product was digested at the EcoRI and BglII cleavage sites that flanked the PCR primers 5′-CCGGAATTCAAAATGAGAATTGCTTTCTTTTTACTTGTTTTAGCCG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGATCTTGTAACAGTTGCTGTGATAAGGAAATGATCAC-3′ and inserted into pDd-A15-gfp (32Gerisch G. Albrecht R. Heizer C. Hodgkinson S. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1280-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) as modified by (33Hanakam F. Albrecht R. Eckerskorn C. Matzner M. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2935-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), so that GFP replaces the C-terminal prodomain of lysozyme. Endocytosis and Cell Growth—The uptake of particles and fluid phase was measured as described previously (34Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 35Hacker U. Albrecht R. Maniak M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the capacity of cells to degrade bacteria in vivo, we used the assay established by Maselli et al. (36Maselli A. Laevsky G. Knecht D.A. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that we used E. coli expressing the green fluorescent protein (37Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) to measure the decrease in intracellular fluorescence after phagocytosis. To assay the growth properties of cells on bacterial lawns, we used M. luteus, Klebsiella aerogenes, and E. coli as substrates. These bacterial species were pre-grown on SM plates, harvested in Sörensen's phosphate buffer (as above), and mixed with about 80 cells of the appropriate Dictyostelium strain, and plaque diameter was measured after 5 days of growth on SM agar plates. In this assay no dramatic growth differences were observed between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Immunofluorescence and Antibodies—mAb 221-342-5 recognizes a sulfated mannose determinant residing on many lysosomal enzymes (38Neuhaus E.M. Horstmann H. Almers W. Maniak M. Soldati T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). mAb AD 7.5 binds to an N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate modification of another class of lysosomal enzymes (39Souza G.M. Metha D.P. Lammertz M. Rodriuez-Paris J. Wu R. Cardelli J.A. Freeze H.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar).

Monoclonal antibodies were detected using TRITC-coupled polyclonal secondary antibodies purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Images were taken from single confocal planes using a Leica TCS-SP laser-scanning microscope. Data Base Searches and Accession Numbers—A computer-assisted homology search was performed using the Internet BLAST and FASTA searches in the nucleic acid data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Dictyostelium protein data base (dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/blast.pl), resulting in sequence information for alyA (AAM08434), alyB (AAM08432), alyC (AAO051440), alyD (DDB0217279 and DDB016810), DdLysC1, DdLysC2, and DdLysC3 (lysozymes of D. discoideum similar to c-type lysozymes; U66523, DDB0189256, DDB0205537, respectively). Dictyostelium genes coding for DdLys T41 and DdLysT42 (lysozymes of D. discoideum similar to T4 phage-type lysozymes; DDB0217501 and DDB0167824, respectively) and DdLysEh1 and DdLysEh2 (lysozymes of D. discoideum similar to Entamoeba histolytica; DDB0167552 and DDB0219864, respectively) were also identified in the Dictyostelium genome. The amino acid sequences of lysozymes of diverse organisms used in the phylogenetic analysis were retrieved from the Protein Entrez data base of NCBI and listed below with their respective abbreviations in Fig. 7 (source organism; accession numbers): LysC (Gallus gallus c-type lysozyme; 2CDS_A), LysT4 (enterobacteria phage T4-type lysozyme; 1LYD), LysG (goose-type lysozyme; LZGSG).

Protein alignments were performed using the software ClustalX (42Heringa J. Comput.

Purification of a Novel Lysozyme and Identification of the alyA Gene—We purified a protein with lysozyme activity from axenically cultured Dictyostelium amoebae, exploiting its adsorption to a Bio-Gel matrix. The main part of active material found in acid extracts of amoebae was only weakly retained by the column. It was eluted as a single protein peak with the starting buffer. Final purification was achieved by cation exchange chromatography and yielded homogeneous material with a molecular mass of ∼12 kDa as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The purified protein degraded M. luteus cell walls optimally at low ionic strength between pH values ranging from 4.5 to 6 (Fig. 1B). A colorimetric test for detecting reducing ends of N-acetyl amino sugars within a preparation of degraded cell walls was positive and comparable to hen egg lysozyme. Because the protein did not exert chitinase activity in the detection system used (data not shown), these results together support a true N-acetylmuraminidase (lysozyme) activity of the protein. Purified lysozyme was relatively stable; at pH 5.5, 10-min incubations at 50 °C did not reduce the activity, but in contrast to hen egg white lysozyme, its activity decreased to half when the enzyme was incubated at 60 °C for 10 min. The enzyme displayed antibacterial activity against viable bacteria; the protein inhibited the growth of the Gram-positives Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium at 2.5 μg/ml. The growth of E. coli, representing Gram-negatives, was not inhibited at 10 μg/ml. Neither viable S. aureus nor cell walls of this bacterium were affected by the enzyme at this concentration (data not shown). The purified lysozyme was subjected to N-terminal sequencing, yielding a single amino acid sequence up to residue 25 (YSCPKPCYGNMCCSTSPNNQYYLTD). This sequence was back-translated into nucleic acid sequence and used to search a cDNA data base (44Morio T. Urushihara H. Saito T. Ugawa Y. Mizuno H. Yoshida M. Yoshino R. Mitra B.N. Pi M. Sato T. Takemoto K. Yasukawa H. Williams J. Maeda M. Takeuchi I. Ochiai H. Tanaka Y. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone, SSF469, was retrieved, the deduced amino acid sequence of which perfectly matched the experimentally determined amino acid sequence of lysozyme. Using this clone we could identify the corresponding gene on chromosome 2 in the data base from the Dictyostelium genome project (45Glöckner G. Eichinger L. Szafranski K. Pachebat J.A. Bankier A.T. Dear P.H. Lehmann R. Baumgart C. Parra G. Abril J.F. Guigo R. Kumpf K. Tunggal B. Cox E. Quail M.A. Platzer M. Rosenthal A. Noegel A.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and named it alyA (for amoeba lysozyme). The information on genomic structure and amino acid sequence is summarized in Fig. 2. The N-terminal tyrosine residue of the mature enzyme is preceded by a stretch of 19 mostly hydrophobic amino acid residues that may serve as a signal peptide necessary for the transport of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. MALDI-TOF analysis of the purified AlyA protein yielded a molecular mass of 12.652 kDa. This value confirms the molecular mass estimated from SDS-PAGE and is in good agreement with a mature peptide of 119 residues that would have a calculated molecular mass of 12.633 kDa provided that the 12 cysteine residues participate in disulfide bonding. No glycosylation of the purified protein was experimentally evident as judged by a glycan detection assay. The only putative N-glycosylation site in the primary translation product is at Asn149, beyond the C terminus of the mature protein. Neither the mature protein nor its precursor molecule reveal significant similarity to any protein of other organisms reported so far, in particular not to other bacteriolytic enzymes. Phenotypic Instability of aly Knockouts—To analyze the in vivo function of this novel protein, we disrupted the alyA gene. Therefore, we electroporated Dictyostelium cells in the presence of a linear DNA fragment in which genomic regions of alyA flanked a cassette conferring blasticidin resistance to transformed cells. As soon as clones appeared on the primary Petri dish, we re-cloned them by limited dilution in liquid growth medium. In the first attempt to isolate a mutant lacking alyA, we screened about 100 clones by PCR analysis of genomic DNA and obtained a single mutant cell line. Cell homogenates from this clone 74 had a lysozyme activity that was reduced to about 50% of wild-type levels. When plated on a bacterial lawn, the mutant initially formed plaques where the food bacteria were consumed that grew only to half the size measured for the wild-type strain. This phenotype, however, was not stable. Plating experiments repeated over the course of 2 weeks revealed that the diameter of plaques increased in the alyA mutant until no difference was seen to wild-type cells. In contrast, the enzyme activity remained low. Because of this phenotypic instability, we repeated the transformation to obtain another mutant. In the second attempt, one mutant was found among about 150 clones analyzed. The following analysis focuses on this clone, 138. PCR analysis using a primer pair that binds to both alyA and alyB genes (see below) revealed both genes in genomic DNA from wild-type cells, whereas only a product corresponding to alyB was detected in the mutant (Fig. 3A). The mutant carried the blasticidine resistance cassette precisely within the alyA locus (Fig. 3B). As seen previously in strain 74, the knock-out mutant alyA138 had a total lysozyme activity corresponding to about 40% of wild-type cells and maintained this level over more than 2 months (Fig. 3C). When the plaque diameters of the alyA138 strain were measured and compared with wild-type values, they were found to increase from 60% to 90% within about 10 days, steadily rising to 150% after 40 days and finally stabilizing at a constant value corresponding to 180% of wild-type cells (Fig. 3D). Despite these changes, repeated PCR analyses did not reveal any alteration at the alyA locus (data not shown). All of the subsequent experiments were performed using cells from this stage. To test whether the increased plaque size was due to an AlyA-independent increase in the capacity to degrade bacteria, we fed the cells with GFP-expressing bacteria and measured the disappearance of their fluorescence signal. Unexpectedly, the alyA138 mutant performed as efficiently as wild-type cells (Fig. 4A), although it was still reduced in lysozyme activity. To find out whether the increased plaque size was caused by an increased efficiency of phagocytosis, we measured the internalization of an indigestible particle, fluorescently labeled yeast. Indeed, the rate of particle uptake by alyA138 mutant cells was almost 2-fold higher than the rate of wild-type phagocytosis (Fig. 4B), providing a reasonable explanation for the increased plaque diameter. Because the rate of fluid-phase uptake was unaltered (Fig. 4C), the phenotype observed in the alyA138 mutant is not caused by a general change in the endocytic properties of these cells. Rescue of Phenotypic Defects—In the case of unstable phenotypes, it is particularly important to check whether the re-expression of the product corresponding to the disrupted gene restores the phenotype to the wild-type-like character. To this end we inserted the entire coding region of alyA including the introns into an expression vector and produced stably transformed cell lines in the alyA138 mutant background. RT-PCR analysis of various clones generally revealed a more intense ban"
https://openalex.org/W2052894910,"The mechanism of inhibition of yeast mitochondrial F1-ATPase by its natural regulatory peptide, IF1, was investigated by correlating the rate of inhibition by IF1 with the nucleotide occupancy of the catalytic sites. Nucleotide occupancy of the catalytic sites was probed by fluorescence quenching of a tryptophan, which was engineered in the catalytic site (β-Y345W). Fluorescence quenching of a β-Trp345 indicates that the binding of MgADP to F1 can be described as 3 binding sites with dissociation constants of Kd1 = 10 ± 2 nm, Kd2 = 0.22 ± 0.03 μm, and Kd3 = 16.3 ± 0.2 μm. In addition, the ATPase activity of the β-Trp345 enzyme followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a corresponding Km of 55 μm. Values for the Kd for MgATP were estimated and indicate that the Km (55 μm) for ATP hydrolysis corresponds to filling the third catalytic site on F1. IF1 binds very slowly to F1-ATPase depleted of nucleotides and under unisite conditions. The rate of inhibition by IF1 increased with increasing concentration of MgATP to about 50 μm, but decreased thereafter. The rate of inhibition was half-maximal at 5 μm MgATP, which is 10-fold lower than the Km for ATPase. The variations of the rate of IF1 binding are related to changes in the conformation of the IF1 binding site during the catalytic reaction cycle of ATP hydrolysis. A model is proposed that suggests that IF1 binds rapidly, but loosely to F1 with two or three catalytic sites filled, and is then locked in the enzyme during catalytic hydrolysis of ATP.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). ATP synthases catalyze the phosphorylation of ADP forming ATP. The ATP synthase consists of two subcomplexes: F0 and F1.F0 is an integral membrane protein complex minimally composed of a1b1c10 and it acts as a proton-driven turbine (2Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The extrinsic F1 moiety is composed of five different subunits with the stoichiometry α3β3γδϵ. F1 contains three catalytic and three non-catalytic nucleotide-binding sites, located at α/β interfaces (3Wise J.G. Hicke B.J. Boyer P.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). F1 and F0 are connected by a central stalk composed of the γ, δ, and ϵ subunits. In the mitochondrion, movement of protons from the cytosol to the matrix drives the F0 turbine, which rotates the central stalk. There is a second or peripheral stalk, which holds together the static parts of the machine including the core F1 unit. Rotation of the central stalk in F1 sequentially modifies the interactions of the γ-subunit with each of the catalytic sites thereby altering the nucleotide affinity of each of the three catalytic sites. Thus, F1 has 3 catalytic sites each with different catalytic properties including their affinity for nucleotides. F1 couples ATP hydrolysis to the rotation of the γ subunit in the opposite direction of that observed during ATP synthesis (5Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 6Itoh H. Takahashi A. Adachi K. Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 2004; 427: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Single-molecule studies indicated that hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with 120° rotation of the γ-subunit within the core of the ATPase. This 120° step was subdivided into two substeps of 80–90°, which is related to the binding of ATP and 30–40°, which is related to the hydrolysis of ATP or the release of Pi (7Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 8Nishizaka T. Oiwa K. Noji H. Kimura S. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Despite these and other studies, there are still debates on key features of the catalytic cycle. For instance, some reports conclude that a significant rate of ATP hydrolysis only occurs when each of the catalytic sites is filled with nucleotide (trisite catalysis) (6Itoh H. Takahashi A. Adachi K. Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 2004; 427: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 8Nishizaka T. Oiwa K. Noji H. Kimura S. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others suggest that maximal ATP hydrolysis and synthesis occurs with just 2 nucleotide binding sites filled (bisite catalysis) (7Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 10Milgrom Y.M. Murataliev M.B. Boyer P.D. Biochem.

Also, a detailed understanding of the cooperative aspects of the catalytic mechanism is still lacking. The mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase is regulated in the mitochondrion. The enzyme is inhibited by the absence of protonmotive force and the presence of ATP, and it is activated by the presence of a protomotive force. This regulation occurs by an inhibitory peptide, IF1, which is thought to avoid futile ATP hydrolysis (reviewed in Ref. 12Schwerzmann K. Pedersen P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). IF1 exists in animal (13Pullmann M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), plant (14Norling B. Tourikas C. Hamasur B. Glaser E. Eur. J.

(Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) mitochondria. IF1 is a small peptide, with well conserved sequence: 84 residues in animals and 63 residues in yeast. IF1 binds to the F1 sector of the ATP synthase and also to mitochondrial F1 freed from the ATP synthase. Generation of a protonmotive force across the mitochondrial membrane releases IF1 from the ATP synthase (12Schwerzmann K. Pedersen P.L. Arch. Biochem.

Biomembr. 2002; 34: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal of bovine IF1-F1 complex was solved and it showed IF1 bound at the α/β catalytic interface with weak interactions with the γ subunit (30Cabezón E. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The crystal structure is a “snap-shot” in the dynamic mechanism of the binding and inhibition by IF1. ATP hydrolysis is necessary for IF1 binding (31Klein G. Satre M. Vignais P. FEBS Lett. 1977; 84: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and there is a complex relationship between ATP concentration and rate of IF1 binding to isolated bovine F1-ATPase (32Milgrom Y.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). IF1 binding rate increased at submicromolar ATP concentrations, reaching a maximum at concentrations of MgATP from 20 to 100 μm, but this rate dramatically decreased when MgATP concentrations reached 1–100 mm. Assuming bisite mode of ATP hydrolysis, it was proposed that IF1 could only bind F1 molecules containing one loosely bound ADP molecule and one ATP molecule. The decrease in the rate of IF1 binding at the higher MgATP concentration was suggested to be because of the transition from bisite to trisite catalysis (32Milgrom Y.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, these proposals remained speculative, because of the absence of measurement of nucleotide occupancy of the catalytic sites. In Escherichia coli F1-ATPase, nucleotide binding in the catalytic pocket could be probed by the fluorescence quenching of a tryptophan replacing a tyrosine in the active site of the enzyme, β-Y331W (9Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding replacement has been made in the yeast F1-ATPase, β-Y345W, and this enzyme has been used to measure the relationship of nucleotide site occupancy with ATPase activity and the rate of IF1 binding and inhibition. The results from this study provide three unique dissociation constants for MgADP binding and indicate that trisite catalysis is the predominant mode of ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, IF1 binds to F1 at a similar and high rate when it has two or three nucleotide-filled catalytic sites. However, IF1 binds to F1 very slowly if it is nucleotide depleted or if just a single catalytic site is filled with nucleotide. A model is proposed where the rate of IF1 binding to F1 is controlled by changes in the conformation of the IF1 binding site on F1, which depends on the catalytic state of the enzyme. Once bound, IF1 is rapidly locked in place by the hydrolysis of ATP. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells (Euroscarf BY4741-ΔATP2 MAT a, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met 15Δ0, ura3Δ0, atp2::G418R) were transformed with the plasmid pRS344SB (ATP2-Y345W) (33Shen H.

Transformed cells were selected on a strictly respiratory medium containing 1% yeast extract, 1% Bactopeptone, and 3% glycerol (28 °C). Transformed cells and WT cells (Euroscarf BY4741 MAT a, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met 15Δ0, ura3Δ0) were grown at 28 °C in a large volume of strictly respiratory medium. Purification of Nucleotide-depleted F1-ATPase—Yeast F1-ATPase was purified using a prior method (35Falson P. Di Pietro A. Gautheron D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7151-7159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Chloroform extraction and precipitation with 70% saturated SO4(NH4)2 were followed by gel exclusion chromatography using Sephadex G-25 (15 ml column) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm EDTA, and 100 mm Tris-SO4, pH 7.5 (TEG). The active fractions were eluted with TEG and directly submitted to high performance liquid chromatography using a TSK Spherogel SW4000 (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) column (0.75 × 30 cm) at an elution rate of 0.3 ml/min with TEG. The fractions containing F1 were pooled and dialyzed for 2 h at room temperature against 20 mm Tris-SO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (TE). The sample was precipitated with 70% saturated SO4(NH4)2, centrifuged, and dissolved in a minimal volume of TE containing 70% saturated SO4(NH4)2. The nucleotide (ATP and ADP) content of the enzyme was estimated, after denaturation, to less than 0.01 mol/mol using a luciferase assay (36Senior A.E. Lee R.S. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem.

The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured at pH 8.4, 30 °C, in the presence of 4 mm MgATP and 40 mm potassium bicarbonate. The turnover number for ATP hydrolysis was 440 s–1 for the wild type F1-ATPase and 360 s–1 for β-Y345W F1-ATPase, based on a molecular mass of 372 kDa. Overexpression and Purification of IF1—The gene encoding IF1 (INH1) gene was amplified by PCR from genomic yeast DNA kindly provided by Dr. Jean Velours (Bordeaux, France).

IF1 was overexpressed in LB medium after incubation with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (after the A at 600 nm of the cell culture reached 0.6) for 3 h at 37 °C. The expressed IF1 had a N-terminal (His)6-tagged extension and an enterokinase-mediated proteolytic cleavage site. For purification of IF1, bacteria were incubated with lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature and briefly sonicated on ice and in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml RNase, and 10 μg/ml DNase. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min (10 °C) and the supernatant was incubated, under gentle stirring, with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (3 ml, Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) prepared in binding buffer (BB) (10 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, and 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8). The resin was poured into a 0.9-cm diameter column and the column was washed sequentially with 10 and 4 volumes of the BB containing imidazole at 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. IF1 was eluted by gravity with 2 volumes of BB containing 250 mm imidazole. The fractions containing IF1 were pooled and dialyzed for 7 h at 4 °C against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. The His6 tag was removed by digestion with enterokinase (12.5 units/ml) overnight at 18 °C and enzymatic cleavage was stopped by heating the sample at 90 °C for 10 min. The sample was centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge for 10 min at 10 °C, and the supernatant was eluted on a 0.9-cm diameter column containing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (2 ml) using the BB containing 10 mm imidazole. IF1 that did not bind to the column was collected, precipitated on ice with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and collected with benchtop centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in water at a final protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml and stored at –80 °C. IF1 appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE. Because of the presence of the N-terminal enterokinase cleavage site, the first three amino acids of the recombinant and processed enzyme were Ala-Met-Ala, as compared with the natural IF1, which starts with Ser. However, the inhibitory activity of the recombinant IF1, as measured by the kon rate constant of formation of the IF1-MF1 complex in the presence of 1 mm MgATP, was the same as the natural IF1 from yeast or a chemically synthesized product made by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) (37Venard R. Brèthes D. Giraud M.-F. Vaillier J. Velours J. Haraux F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7626-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein Titration—Protein concentration was determined using micro-BCA titration kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence experiments were carried out in a SFM25 fluorimeter (Kontron Instruments, Saint-Quentin-enYvelines, France) with excitation at 295 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) and emission at 350 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). The cuvette, stirred and thermostatted at 25 °C, was filled with buffer containing 50 mm MES, 20 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5 (2 ml). After measuring the background signal, the fluorescence of the purified F1-ATPase (final concentration: 5–30 nm) was measured. MgATP, MgADP, or MgAMP-PNP (final concentration: 20 nm to 8 mm) was added after 30 s with rapid mixing as a small and constant volume of concentrated (5 μm to 1 m) solution. The steady state fluorescence level was reached within 1 min. The F1-ATPase retained full enzymatic activity for more than 2 min under these conditions. Fluorescence values were corrected for the fluorescence of nucleotides, the dilution effects, and the internal filter effect of the nucleotides. The inner filter effect was estimated from the nucleotide-induced decrease of fluorescence of chloroplast F1-ATPase or wild type yeast F1-ATPase. A unique correction curve was obtained for each of the nucleotides used (ADP, ATP, and AMP-PNP), for all F1 species and for different F1-ATPase concentrations. ATP Hydrolysis Measurement and Kinetic Analysis—Continuous monitoring of ATP hydrolysis coupled to NADH oxidation was carried out spectrophotometrically as described (37Venard R. Brèthes D. Giraud M.-F. Vaillier J. Velours J. Haraux F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7626-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction was in a stirred and thermostatted cuvette (25 °C) containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.4 mm NADH and MgATP at from 0.5 μm to 20 mm. The ATPase reaction was initiated by adding F1-ATPase at the indicated final concentration (1–10 nm) and measured as a decrease in absorbance of NADH at 340 nm. When a constant rate of ATP hydrolysis was reached, IF1 (75 nm) was injected and ATPase activity decayed. The spectrophotometric recording was analyzed as in Ref. 37Venard R. Brèthes D. Giraud M.-F. Vaillier J. Velours J. Haraux F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7626-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, using the equation, y(t)=V⋅t+[(V0−V)/kapp](1−e−kappt)+y0 (Eq. 1) where y0 and y(t) are A340 at zero time and t time after IF1 addition, respectively, V0 the initial rate of A340 change (at zero time), V the final rate of A340 change (at infinite time), and kapp the apparent deactivation rate constant. ATP hydrolysis in the absence of the regenerating system was measured in a small vessel, stirred, and thermostatted at 25 °C, containing the ATPase reaction medium devoid of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and NADH. The ATPase reaction was stopped by addition of IF1 (5 μm). An aliquot (80 μl) was taken and added to the spectrophotometric cuvette containing the complete reaction medium (1 ml) supplemented with 1 μm IF1. The level of ADP was determined from the absorbance decrease at 340 nm, with corrections for any dilution effects, and for the low level of ADP and pyruvate initially present in the reaction medium. Data Analysis—Fluorescence and kinetic data were fitted to nonlinear theoretical models by iteration, using Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Parameters were defined as variables and their values were taken after the target cell, containing the average quadratic variation between the theoretical curve and the experimental data, converged to its minimum value. Chemicals and Reagents—All reagents were of analytical grade. Nucleotides were obtained from Roche (Basel, Switzerland). Yeast extract and Bactopeptone were from Difco (Detroit, MI). DNA amplification by PCR was performed using Red Taq Polymerase from Sigma. Plasmid purification used the Agarose DNA Extraction Kit from Roche (Basel, Switzerland). Calf intestinal phosphatase used for the dephosphorylation of pET 30a(+) was from Amersham Biosciences. DNA ligation was carried out using the Fast-Link DNA Ligation Kit from Epicenter Technologies (Madison, WI). DNA was prepared using the kit obtained from Qiagen (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Nucleotide Affinity for Each of the Three Catalytic Sites—The F1-ATPase has three catalytic sites, which have been demonstrated to have different affinities for adenine nucleotides (9Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We measured nucleotide affinity for each of the catalytic sites to relate catalytic site occupancy with the rate of IF1 binding to F1. Catalytic site occupancy was measured by the fluorescence quenching of a tryptophan residue that replaced β-Tyr345, which is at the active site of the yeast F1-ATPase. This method is analogous to that used by Senior's laboratory (9Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to probe nucleotide binding to catalytic sites of the E. coli F1-ATPase and is validated by the crystal structure of yeast mitochondrial F1-ATPase, which shows aromatic stacking of β-Tyr345 and the purine ring of the adenine nucleotide (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). Fig. 1a shows the fluorescence response of a nucleotide-depleted preparation of β-Y345W F1-ATPase to addition of nucleotide. The addition of MgAMP-PNP (1 μm) does not affect wild type F1-ATPase fluorescence (curve 1) but decreases the fluorescence of β-Y345W F1-ATPase (curve 2). Curves 3–5 show kinetics of binding MgADP, at three different nucleotide concentrations, to nucleotide-depleted β-Y345W F1-ATPase as measured by the fluorescence quenching. The level of fluorescence quenching as a function of MgADP concentration is plotted and shown in Fig. 1b. Examination of the plot suggests two successive phases of fluorescence decrease of unequal magnitude (about in 2:1 ratio), followed by a plateau representing 50% of the initial fluorescence. This baseline fluorescence is likely because of the remaining 7 tryptophan and 80 tyrosine residues. The first phase of fluorescence decrease can be considered as resulting of two overlapping phases, corresponding to filling the first 2 catalytic sites and the last phase corresponded to filling the third catalytic site. The data were fitted to a model involving the successive filling of three sites of decreasing affinity for MgADP, each site contributing to 16.6% of the total fluorescence. The best fit gave Kd values for the three catalytic sites as: Kd1 = 0.010 ± 0.002 μm, Kd2 = 0.22 ± 0.03 μm, and Kd3 = 16.3 ± 0.2 μm. The mathematical model used (see “Appendix”) takes into account that at the lowest MgADP concentrations used, a significant fraction of nucleotide is bound to the enzyme. The results indicate that catalytic sites of the yeast F1-ATPase bind MgADP with three unique dissociation constants. Occupancy of ATP at the Catalytic Sites—Whereas the nucleotide occupancy of the F1-ATPase with MgADP is important, it is MgATP, not MgADP, which is required for the binding of IF1 to F1 (31Klein G. Satre M. Vignais P. FEBS Lett. 1977; 84: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Milgrom Y.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As such, it is important to measure the Kd values for MgATP. However, this is not a trivial measurement because MgATP is rapidly hydrolyzed by the F1-ATPase. Furthermore, at MgATP concentrations from 10 to 500 μm, steady state ATP hydrolysis is only reached after several minutes (data not shown), probably because of the so-called “hysteretic inhibition” (38Baubichon H. Godinot C. Di Pietro A. Gautheron D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) followed by the release of inhibitory ADP from catalytic sites (39Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two problems make it difficult to relate the level of the fluorescence quenching to the binding of MgATP or MgADP. Use of a nonhydrolyzable analogue MgAMP-PNP is not the preferred option because steady state nucleotide occupancy during continuous ATP hydrolysis differs from occupancy of the static enzyme by nonhydrolyzable nucleotide (9Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas quantitative data could not be easily obtained for binding of MgATP, a semiquantitive analysis could be done. In a first step of this analysis, the number of sites that were occupied during ATP hydrolysis at 1 mm MgATP was measured. At this concentration, the ATPase activity is near maximal (see below) and occurs without lag. Kinetics of β-Y345W F1-ATPase fluorescence quenching with addition of 1 mm MgATP was studied, with focus on the first seconds thereby minimizing the contribution of binding of ADP formed during hydrolysis. To improve the signal/noise ratio, data from 10 experiments were averaged. The results, converted in degree of catalytic sites occupancy, are shown in Fig. 2a. Under these conditions, the three catalytic sites are nearly completely (>90%) occupied after 2 s with addition of MgATP. Because greater than 90% of the third catalytic sites are rapidly filled with 1 mm MgATP, the apparent Kd of MgATP for the third site must be lower than 100 μm. A number of control experiments were done to determine whether there was significant binding of MgADP under these conditions. The fluorescence quenching with binding of MgADP at 1 mm (Fig. 2b) indicates that MgADP binds somewhat slower to the lowest affinity catalytic site and is complete only after 5–10 s. Thus, if MgADP is present, it binds with a lower rate than that of MgATP. Fig. 2c shows the time course of ADP production by F1-ATPase at the F1 and nucleotide concentrations used for the fluorescence experiment in the presence and absence of the ATP regenerating system. With an ATP regenerating system, the progression curve is linear, whereas without a regenerating system, ADP production proceeds as the same rate for at least 10 s. The two curves start to diverge between t = 15 s and t = 20 s after starting the reaction, because of MgATP decrease and/or to MgADP rebinding. These experiments show that under these conditions, the binding of MgADP does not make a significant contribution to fluorescence quenching of β-Trp345. The affinity of the enzyme for MgATP was also measured by determination of the Km for ATP hydrolysis. Fig. 3 shows a plot of the rate of ATP hydrolysis versus the MgATP concentration. The data fit simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a corresponding Km of 55 μm and a Vmax of 300 s–1. The Km value indicates the concentration of MgATP where 50% of the catalytically active sites are filled. Based on the results of Figs. 2 and 3, it is concluded that the Km represents the Kd of"
https://openalex.org/W1998345734,"The formation of multiprotein complexes is l’ordre du jour in regulatory pathways. In this issue of Oncogene, Reale et al. report the formation of a particularly sophisticated complex of two important regulatory enzymes, DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase-1) and PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1). The former evolved with a specific sequence motif binding the enzymatic product of the latter. The product, poly(ADP-ribose), bonds the two partners into a heterodimeric complex and, as a consequence, the catalytic function of DNMT1 is silenced. Thus, PARP-1 becomes a conditional negative regulator of DNMT1. In a larger perspective, Reale et al. highlight the potential role of PARP-1 as a co-regulator of DNA methylation leading to epigenetic reprogramming of cancer cells."

It is a non-covalent complex of an enediyne ring chromophore and its carrier protein isolated from Streptomyces carzinostaticus (2Ishida N. Miyazaki M. Kumagai K. Rikimaru M. J. Antibiot.

Science. 1993; 261: 1319-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is easily inactivated by light, heat, and molecular oxygen because of its labile structure. Despite its intrinsic instability in the free state, the chromophore in the complex is stable even in vivo. It is thought that holo-NCS penetrates into the target cell carrying the chromophore and promptly releases it at the cell nucleus to kill the cell. Therefore, the holo-NCS family has attracted much attention in clinical use as well as for use in targeting drug delivery systems (6Maeda H. Konno T. Maeda H. Edo K. Ishida N.

Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Based on the previous NMR and x-ray studies for holo-NCS, several mechanisms of the chromophore stabilization have been proposed. These mechanisms were dominated by hydrophobic interactions with the binding pocket. However, the mechanism of releasing and binding of the chromophore remains unclear, even though the process has attracted much attention and has been investigated by a variety of methods (8Sudhahar G.C.P.

In the previous NMR structure ensemble, the loop structures have particularly poor convergence and this was assumed to be caused by structural flexibilities, which were thought to be responsible for the chromophore-releasing mechanism (15Takashima H. Amiya S. Kobayashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Takashima H. Kobayashi Y. Maeda H. Edo K. Ishida N.

However, there was no clarification between conformational ambiguity and the internal motion, which should be investigated by relaxation data in NMR. 13C NMR relaxation studies were achieved for apo-NCS by Izadi-Pruneyre et al. (24Izadi-Pruneyre N. Quiniou E. Blouquit Y. Perez J. Minard P. Desmadril M. Mispelter J. Adjadj E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2228-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Mispelter et al. (25Mispelter J. Lefevre C. Adjadj E. Quiniou E. Favaudon V. J. Biomol.

Here, we performed holo-NCS structural analysis with a combination of 13C NMR methine relaxation experiments at natural abundance to investigate the internal motion of the loop and the chromophore-releasing mechanism. 15N, 13C Uniform Label and Purification of Holo-NCS—To obtain stable isotope-labeled holo-NCS, S. carzinostaticus was grown in Waxman medium (0.05% meat extract, 0.05% peptone, 0.03% NaCl, and 0.1% d-glucose) containing algae 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled amino acid mixtures (Chlorella Industry Co., Ltd). After a 72-h incubation, the cell-free culture medium was collected using filter paper. Ammonium sulfate then was added (650 g/liter), and the resulting precipitant was collected by ultracentrifugation (9000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Proteins were further purified using DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) and gel filtration (Sephadex G-50 and G-25, Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column (Pharmacia). Anti-microbial activity was examined using a pulp disc agar diffusion assay against the Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 strain. The 15N and 13C HMQC spectrum indicated uniform labeling of the protein moiety, which was verified by multidimensional NMR experiments, but the chromophore was not uniformly labeled. This is probably caused by the difference of metabolic pathways between the chromophore and natural amino acids. The purified holo-NCS was dissolved in H2O with D2O (9:1, v/v) at a concentration of 2.5 mm, pH 5.0, with no buffer to be subjected to NMR measurements. Because the chromophore is light-sensitive, all of the experiments were carried out in dark conditions. NMR Measurements and Resonance Assignments—NMR experiments were carried out at 30 °C on Bruker AMX 600 and Varian Unity 750 spectrometers equipped with shielded gradient triple resonance probes. Sequence-specific 1H, 15N, and 13C NMR assignments for holo-NCS were obtained with heteronuclear three-dimensional HNCA, 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HMQC and 13C-edited three-dimensional HMQC spectra following the standard strategy for proteins (27Wuthrich K.

All of the 1H and 15N resonances, with the exception of NϵH2 protons of Gln27 and Gln94 and NδH2 of Asn48, were unambiguously assigned. All of the spectra were processed and analyzed with the program NMR-Pipe and Pipp (31Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar). NOE distance constraints were collected from the two three-dimensional NOESY-HMQC spectra (Table I). Only the well defined NOE cross-peaks were selected to eliminate misinterpretation of distance constraints. Because of non-uniform labeling of the chromophore, inter-molecular NOEs between the chromophore and the protein moiety elucidated by 1H homonuclear NOESY spectrum were used for structure calculations. 1H homonuclear NOESY spectra in D2O solution were used to complement saturated peaks by H2O resonance irradiation. In addition, 40 hydrogen bond constraints, derived from the β-sheet diagram and exchange rate in D2O, as well as dihedral angle constraints (35 residues) and two disulfide bond constraints have been used for the calculations. Resonance assignments and constraint data have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession number BMRB-5969). Because of a technical problem, we lost the enriched sample after the structure determination and thus measured the relaxation data with a native protein at high concentration as described later. We confirmed that there is no concentration dependence for 13C and 1H chemical shift in the range of 2.5–8 mm by 13C and 1H-HSQC NMR spectra.Table INMR constraints and structural statisticsNo. of restraints for structure calculationIntraresidue NOEs252Sequential NOEs352Medium and long range NOEs397Intermolecular NOEs of the complexaIntermolecular NOEs between the chromophore and the protein moiety80Disulfide bond constraints40Torsion angle constraints35r.m.s. deviation from experimental restrainsDistances (Å)0.057 ± 0.002Torsion angles (°)0.72 ± 0.05r.m.s. deviation from idealized covalent geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0188 ± 0.0002Bond angles (°)1.18 ± 0.02Improper torsion angles (°)1.21 ± 0.03Ramachandran diagram (% residues)Most favored regions64.1Additional allowed regions31.5Generous allowed regions3.3Disallowed regions1.1Coordinate precision (r.m.s. deviation)bPairwise average r.m.s. deviation for the 60 conformers after super-position for best fit of N, Cα, and C′ atomsAll backbone atoms (Å)0.39 ± 0.08All heavy atoms (Å)cInclude all heavy atoms of the chromophore0.83 ± 0.09a Intermolecular NOEs between the chromophore and the protein moietyb Pairwise average r.m.s. deviation for the 60 conformers after super-position for best fit of N, Cα, and C′ atomsc Include all heavy atoms of the chromophore Open table in a new tab NMR Data Handling and Structure Calculations—NOE intensities measured by 15N-edited NOESY-HMQC were corrected according to spin degeneracy and were converted to approximate inter-proton distances in inverse proportion to distance (r), 1/r3 and 1/r6, with proper normalization constants and a ±0.5 Å margin of error. The normalization constants were determined individually for intra-residue NOEs, inter-residue NOEs, and inter-amide proton NOEs with information from the preidentified β-sheet inter-strands cross-peaks (15Takashima H. Amiya S. Kobayashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The upper limit of distance measured by NOE was approximated as 5 Å. NOE intensities measured by 13C-edited NOESY-HMQC were treated in the same manner by normalization against intra-residual methylene protons or inter-residue CαH-CαH cross-peaks. The NOE intensities of 1H homonuclear NOESY were classified as strong, medium, and weak, corresponding to inter-proton distances of 1.8–2.7, 2.5–4.0, and 3.4–5.4 Å, respectively. Pseudo-atom corrections were made with XPLOR with the exception of phenyl ring protons of tyrosine and phenylalanine. These protons were corrected manually with a 2.1-Å pseudo-atom compensation. Hydrogen bond constraints were set to 2.0 ± 0.20 Å for HN-O and 3.0 ± 0.30 Å for N-O distances. The NMR experimental data were subjected to restraint molecular dynamics calculations using XPLOR-NIH, version 2.0.6 (32Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Res. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) on the distributed computing of 17 Linux personal computers controlled by SUN GRID engine, version 5.3p2. The calculations were started by generating initial structures from random array and followed by 80 ps of simulated annealing at a high initial temperature, 5000 K. The total number of initial structures was 16,000, and 60 final structures with lowest energies of target function were selected to elucidate root mean square (r.m.s) deviations. 13C NMR Methine Relaxation Experiments—Native holo-NCS, provided by POLA Chemical Industries Inc., was dissolved in D2O without buffer, pH 5.0, and degassed. The protein concentration was 8 mm. Heteronuclear 1H-13C experiments were carried out at 30 °C on a Varian Unity 600 spectrometer equipped with a pulsed field gradient triple resonance probe. T1, T2, and 13C{1H} NOE experiments were measured using HSQC-type pulse sequences (33Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 34Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Res. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar, 35Peng J.W. Thanabal V. Wagner G. J. Magn. Res. 1991; 95: 421-427Google Scholar) with spectral widths of 8000 and 4000 Hz in the 1H and 13C dimensions, respectively. The 1H carrier was placed on the residual water resonance (4.8 ppm at 30 °C), and the 13C carrier was set at 54.4 ppm. All of the spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode by using hypercomplex quadrature detection in the ω1 dimension. The T1 relaxation decay was sampled at nine time points (20, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700, 900, and 1100 ms). The T2 decay was sampled at six time points (8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 44 ms). The T2 relaxation was measured by using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill-type sequence. The 13C{1H} steady-state NOE values were derived from two series of spectra recorded with and without 3.5 s of saturation of the methine protons, respectively. The delay times between scans were approximately four times the nonselective T1 value for methine proton. All of the spectra were processed and analyzed with the program NMR-Pipe (31Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar). Longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) and transverse relaxation rate (R2) were obtained by non-linear least squares fitting of a two-parameter monoexponential function through the peak intensities for T1 and T2 experiments, respectively. All of the methine resonances, with the exception of Leu13, Cys93, and Asp99, had well separated cross-peaks in a 13C-and 1H-HSQC plane (Fig. 2). Residues Cys47 and Trp83 have very weak cross-peaks, probably due to line broadening by short T2 or chemical exchange, and could not elucidate the relaxation parameters. Among the 98 residues that have backbone methine carbons, R1 and R2 values from 93 residues were obtained. In the NOE experiment, the values of additional residues could not be derived due to the remaining water signal. The measured relaxation parameters, R1, R2, and 13C{1H} NOE, were processed by a model-free analysis using an isotropic-rotational diffusion tensor to determine order parameters (Sfast2, Sslow2, and τe) fitted by extended Lipari-Szabo formalism (25Mispelter J. Lefevre C. Adjadj E. Quiniou E. Favaudon V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Crossref Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The parameters were calculated by a program Modelfree (38Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 39Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar) and refined by a Monte-Carlo simulation. The overall correlation time τc was determined from the relaxation data by the program (τc = 6.3 ns). The order parameters Sfast2 and Sslow2 describe the relative amplitude of internal motions. Sslow2 reflects a relatively slow internal motion (picosecond to nanosecond time scale), and Sfast2 reflects a relatively fast local internal motion (picosecond time scale). The effective correlation time τe is related both to amplitude and rate of the internal dynamics. The effective correlation time for fast motion τefast term was ignored from the fitting because of the usual assumption for Cα methine. We calculated the order parameters with axial-symmetric, isotropic, and full anisotropic diffusion tensors, and there was no significant difference among the values. Thus, the simple isotropic tensor was employed. Residues 31, 32, 37, 51, 53, 58, 72, 77, and 110 have Sslow2 values equal 1.0 and could not be fitted by the extended model-free analysis. Among 98 backbone methine carbons, the order parameters from 63 residues were obtained. Refined Three-dimensional Structure for Holo-NCS—In general NMR studies, the loop regions often show poor convergences to be often assumed as high internal motions in solution. Some of them are correlated with dynamic structure and function, such as the hinge region, by NMR relaxation studies (40Yoshida T. Oka S. Uchiyama S. Nakano H. Kawasaki T. Ohkubo T. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4101-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but there are others waiting for structural clarification. Holo-NCS is a typical example. To solve the convergence problem by elimination of a structural determination ambiguity, we developed a comprehensive conformational space search method for the NMR data-derived structure calculation with distributed computing technique (41Takashima H. Mimura N. Ohkubo T. Yoshida T. Tamaoki H. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4504-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The method was first applied for a bioactive peptide, endothelin-1, to determine the structure of its pharmacophore region, which had been assumed to be flexible in solution (41Takashima H. Mimura N. Ohkubo T. Yoshida T. Tamaoki H. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4504-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We revealed a well defined structure for the region and experimentally proved the peptide folding (42Takashima H. Tamaoki H. Teno N. Nishi Y. Uchiyama S. Fukui K. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13932-13936Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, we applied the same method to holo-NCS with the multinuclear NMR data and found that almost all of the loops as well as β-sheets have a well defined conformation (Fig. 1 and Table I). The good convergence suggests a rigid structure and low mobility for holo-NCS loop regions, which are inconsistent with the previous NMR structures. Internal Motion for Holo-NCS—The NMR spin relaxation parameters describe the internal motions and molecular mobility for protein (24Izadi-Pruneyre N. Quiniou E. Blouquit Y. Perez J. Minard P. Desmadril M. Mispelter J. Adjadj E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2228-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 43Palmer A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 44Kay L.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The measured R1, R2, and 13C{1H} NOE values are presented in Fig. 3. The distribution of the values indicated no immediate correlation with the secondary structure elements. The residues, the side chains of which are exposed to solvent, have a relatively large R1 (small R2) value, and the residues, the side chains of which are inside the protein, have a relatively small R1 (large R2) value, causing a characteristic oscillation in the R1 and R2 values. Alternatively, 13C{1H} NOE has uniform values with the except for the N and C termini (average between Pro3 and Phe111 is 1.14 ± 0.09). The results of model-free analyses are shown in Fig. 4. The mean value of the order parameters Sfast2and Sslow2 elucidated, with the exception of the N and C termini, was 0.95 ± 0.05 and 0.93 ± 0.05, respectively. These values indicate that the holo-NCS protein moiety has a rigid structure, which agrees with the result of apo-NCS 13C NMR relaxation studies (24Izadi-Pruneyre N. Quiniou E. Blouquit Y. Perez J. Minard P. Desmadril M. Mispelter J. Adjadj E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2228-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Mispelter J. Lefevre C. Adjadj E. Quiniou E. Favaudon V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and thermal stability studies investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (45Valerio-Lepiniec M. Nicaise M. Adjadj E. Minard P. Desmadril M. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 46Nicaise M. Valerio-Lepiniec M. Izadi-Pruneyre N. Adjadj E. Minard P. Desmadril M. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Sfast2 values suggest slightly high localized internal motion on a picosecond time scale for Pro9, Thr30, Thr42, Thr81, Thr85, and Thr89. However, it is unclear whether the slight differences reflect the backbone internal motion or solvent-exposed threonine Cβ methine. In Sslow2, slightly high regional motions on a nanosecond time scale are only observed for β-strands A and H and loop 98–107. The uniform values of the order parameters indicate that the holo-NCS backbone has nearly equal internal motion for the loop regions and the β-barrel. This agrees well with the good convergence of the refined solution structure. A methine carbon of the chromophore aminosugar, C14, also has a cross-peak in the protein moiety methine region (Figs. 1D and 2). The relaxation parameters, R1, R2 and NOE, for the aminosugar methine carbon are 0.87 ± 0.09, 19.6 ± 2.6, and 1.18 ± 0.05 s-1, respectively. The values indicate that the aminosugar has the same fixed motion as the protein backbone, whereas the hydrophilic moiety is located on the protein surface and is assumed to have flexibility in solution as a mimic of glycoprotein. In fact, the moiety is closely folded by the loops in the solution structure as mentioned later. The other moieties of the chromophore also have similar relaxation parameters. The chromophore (Mr 659) would have nearly equal R1 and R2 values in free motion. In the complex, only methoxy carbon of the naphthoate moiety has a relatively large R1 (2.05 s-1), which is still in the range of the value of the protein side chain. These values indicate that the chromophore has similar mobility with the protein scaffold and agree with the good convergence of the chromophore in the refined solution structure (Fig. 1C). The aminosugar C14 methine relaxation data were also processed by the same extended model-free analyses as a mimic of the protein backbone methine. The values were well fitted by the same overall correlation time (τc) with the protein moiety, i.e. the order parameters Sfast22 = 0.86, Sslow2 =0.80, and τe = 2.9 ps. These results indicate similar amplitude and rate of the internal motions with the protein scaffold. Structure Comparison between Holo- and Apo-NCS—It is known that the backbone 13C chemical shift is sensitively influenced by the backbone topology, which sufficiently indicates conformational differences in general proteins (47Potts B.C.M. Chazin W.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 48Sternberg U. Witter R. Ulrich A.S. Webb G.A. Annual Reports on NMR Spectroscopy. 52. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam2004: 53-104Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the chemical shift difference plotted against residues between holo- and apo-NCS (25Mispelter J. Lefevre C. Adjadj E. Quiniou E. Favaudon V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 49Lefevre C. Adjadj E. Quiniou E. Mispelter J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The data indicate that there are regions that have large chemical shift differences but also regions that have quite similar structure (regions from Ala1 to Tyr32 and from Thr56 to Phe76. The regions with large differences are the chromophore binding site and its neighborhood. These differences could originate from the chromophore interaction, but the residues that have no direct interaction with the chromophore also have large chemical shift differences.

To determine whether the 3614–3643 region is a regulatory site/interaction domain within RyR in muscle fibers, we have investigated the effect of a synthetic peptide corresponding to this region (R3614–3643) on Ca2+ sparks in frog skeletal muscle fibers. R3614–3643 (0.2–3.0 μm) promoted the occurrence of Ca2+ sparks in a highly cooperative dose-dependent manner, with a half-maximal activation at 0.47 μm and a maximal increase in frequency of ∼5-fold. A peptide with a single amino acid substitution within R3614–3643 (L3624D) retained the ability to bind Ca2+-free calmodulin but did not increase Ca2+ spark frequency, suggesting that R3614–3643 does not modulate Ca2+ sparks by removal of endogenous calmodulin. Our data support a model in which the calmodulin binding domain of RyR1 modulates channel activity by at least two mechanisms: direct binding of calmodulin as well as interactions with other regions of RyR.

Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR) is a homotetramer with a subunit molecular mass of ∼560 kDa. In mammalian tissue three isoforms have been identified, skeletal muscle (RyR1), cardiac muscle (RyR2), and brain (RyR3) ryanodine receptors. All three isoforms are structurally and functionally related. The majority of the protein (∼4/5) resides on the myoplasmic side of the SR where binding sites for endogenous modulators (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+, FK506-binding protein, and calmodulin) are located (for review see Ref. 1Meissner G. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d2072-d2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, much attention has been focused on elucidating the role of calmodulin (CaM) in regulation of RyR function. CaM is a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein that plays an important role in Ca2+ signaling in many cell types by modulating the activity of numerous proteins, including ion channels. Each RyR1 subunit binds one molecule of CaM or four CaM molecules per RyR1 homotetramer, regardless of the cytosolic [Ca2+] (2Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In SR vesicle preparations CaM displays Ca2+ dependence in its functional effects on RyR1; at nanomolar [Ca2+] Ca2+-free CaM activates RyR1, whereas at millimolar [Ca2+] Ca2+-CaM inhibits RyR1 (3Rodney G.G.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-dependent bi-functional regulation of RyR1 function was found to require Ca2+ binding to CaM (3Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in particular at the two C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites (3Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12430-12435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the interaction of CaM with RyR1 has led to the localization of a single binding site for Ca2+-free CaM or Ca2+-CaM binding to a region between amino acids 3614 and 3643 (2Moore C.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which is within the large cytoplasmic domain of the channel. Alkylation and tryptic cleavage studies identified cysteine 3635, which lies within the 3614–3643 region, as being important for inter-subunit cross-linking (7Moore C.P. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that the CaM binding region also lies at an inter-subunit contact site within RyR1. More recently, Zhang et al. (8Zhang H. Zhang J.Z. Danila C.I. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8348-8355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have shown that Cys3635 forms an inter-subunit disulfide bond with a cysteine residue between 2000 and 2401 while the N-terminal lobe of CaM interacts with a region around amino acids 1975 and 1999 of RyR1, suggesting that CaM not only binds at a site of inter-subunit contact but may also span the two subunits. These previous studies have been conducted on isolated SR vesicles and/or purified RyR1 channels, which removes the channel from the complex environment of the triad. In attempts to gain further understanding of the role of CaM in regulating SR Ca2+ release in a more fully constituted setting we have recently reported on the effect of CaM on spontaneous Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized frog skeletal muscle (9Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ca2+ sparks are local, discrete elevations in myoplasmic [Ca2+] due to the opening of RyR (10Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Science. 1993; 262: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 11Klein M.G. Cheng H. Santana L.F. Jiang Y.H. Lederer W.J. Schneider M.F. Nature. 1996; 379: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The measurement of Ca2+ sparks provides a convenient tool to assess the function and regulation of RyR in a more physiological setting within a living muscle cell. We found that exogenously applied CaM localized to the triad and caused a highly cooperative dose-dependent increase in Ca2+ spark frequency. Two possible mechanisms for these effects are that CaM promotes activation of RyR1 either by disrupting an inter-subunit interaction that stabilizes the closed state and/or by coordinating the movement of all four subunits within an RyR1 tetramer to the open state. If the CaM binding region of RyR1 (amino acids 3614–3643) is indeed an inter-subunit interaction site then addition of an exogenous peptide corresponding to this sequence might disrupt a native interaction between RyR subunits and also possibly interfere with the interaction of CaM at this contact site, either of which might result in an alteration of RyR activity. Therefore, we tested the effects of a synthetic peptide corresponding to 3614–3643 of RyR1 (R3614–3643) on spontaneous Ca2+ sparks. We found that R3614–3643 increases Ca2+ spark occurrence in permeabilized frog skeletal muscle fibers in a highly cooperative dose-dependent manner. The maximum increase in Ca2+ spark frequency produced by R3614–3643 was about half that produced by exogenous recombinant CaM. A single amino acid mutation within R3614–3643 (L3624D) abolished the activating effect of the peptide. Both R3614–3643 and L3624D bind CaM with similar affinity. Thus, the spark-activating effect of R3614–3643 cannot be attributed to “stripping” endogenous CaM from the fiber. Interestingly, the maximum increase in Ca2+ spark frequency produced by exogenous recombinant CaM was the same in the presence or absence of R3614–3643, even though R3614–3643 binds to CaM. Our results support a model in which the CaM binding region of RyR1 is a site of inter-domain or inter-subunit contact within RyR that stabilizes the closed state of the channel. Addition of either exogenous R3614–3643 or exogenous CaM disrupts the native interaction, thereby destabilizing the closed state of the channel, with CaM having a stronger destabilizing effect than R3614–3643. Some of these data have been presented in abstract form (12Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. FASEB J. 2004; 18: A1289Google Scholar, 13Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 223aGoogle Scholar). Synthesis and Purification of Peptides and Recombinant Calmodulin—Peptides were synthesized in the core facility at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD).

The ileofibularis muscle was removed and pinned in a dissecting chamber containing Ringer's solution (in mm): 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.0. Small fiber segments (3–5 mm) were manually dissected in a relaxing solution containing (in mm): 120 potassium glutamate, 2 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 5 Trizma (Tris base) maleate, pH 7.0. Cut fibers were mounted under stretching in a custom built experimental chamber (14Lacampagne A. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Solution equilibration into the myoplasm was realized by chemical permeabilization of fibers in a relaxing solution containing 0.01% saponin for 30–40 s. Immediately following the permeabilization procedure, the fiber was bathed in internal solution containing (in mm) 80 potassium glutamate, 5.5 MgCl2, 5 Na2ATP, 20 Tris maleate, 0.1 EGTA, 20 Na2-creatine phosphate, 5 glucose, 3 dithiothreitol, 0.05 Fluo-3 (pentapotassium salt) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), pH 7.0. To avoid osmotic swelling observed with chemical permeabilization of fibers the internal solution was supplemented with 8% (41,000 Da) dextran (15Tsuchiya T. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Ward C.W. Lacampagne A. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 1998; 72: A269Google Scholar). Free [Ca2+] was estimated to be 0.1 μm using MaxChelator (17Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides and/or CaM were added to the internal solution from stock solutions. A complete change of the bathing solution occurred upon the addition of peptides and/or CaM, and fibers were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min prior to data collection. To control for buffer changes time-matched “sham” fibers were also examined. Ca2+Spark Measurements—Experimental protocols and data analysis were as previously described by our group (9Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibers were imaged for spontaneous Ca2+ release events on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope (60×, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective) coupled to a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal system (488 nm excitation). The confocal system was operated in linescan x-t mode (1024-ms acquisition time, 2 ms per line, 768 pixels per line, and 0.18 μm per pixel). Line scan images were processed to identify and store potential spark locations by an automated computer detection routine using a relative threshold algorithm as described by Cheng et al. (18Cheng H. Song L.S. Shirokova N. Gonzalez A. Lakatta E.G. Rios E. Stern M.D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 606-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and analyzed as previously described (9Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For each selected event, the peak amplitude (ΔF/F), 100% rise time, temporal half-duration (full duration at half-max, FDHM), and spatial half-width (full width at half-max, FWHM) were determined from the temporal and spatial fits. Events with a ΔF/F < 0.4 were excluded from data analysis post-hoc. The frequency of events per sarcomere was calculated from the number of sparks per image divided by the number of sarcomeres along the line and by the image duration (1.024 s). To account for the variability in the starting Ca2+ spark frequency among fibers, each data point was normalized to the average Ca2+ spark frequency for the same group of fibers prior to the addition of exogenous protein. For the dose-dependent effect of R3614–3643 the data were fit to Equation 1, f=fmin(R−1)(xn/(Kn+xn))+fmin(Eq. 1) where f is the event frequency normalized to the average event frequency in the same group of fibers prior to R3614–3643 application, R is the fractional maximal increase in spark frequency (fmax/fmin), n is the Hill coefficient, and K is the concentration of R3614–3643 that elicits 50% of the increase in frequency (EC50). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of R3614–3643 or L3624D upon binding CaM was monitored using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments). CaM and either R3614–3643 or L3624D were added to final concentrations of 2 and 1 μm, respectively. Tryptophan excitation was set at 295 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 400 nm. Final fluorescence data were obtained by subtracting CaM and buffer effects from those of the CaM plus peptide and then normalized to the fluorescence for R3614–3643 or L3624D alone. Because CaM contains no tryptophan residues, the observed fluorescence is attributed to the single tryptophan residue in either R3614–3643 or L3624D. To assess the relative affinity of R3614–3643 and L3624D for CaM the fluorescence emission spectra of Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled CaM (Alexa488-CaM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were collected by exciting at 485 nm and recording between 500 and 600 nm. Increasing amounts of either R3614–3643 or L3624D (0.25–200 nm) were titrated against 1 nm Alexa488-CaM in a buffer containing 80 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm Tris maleate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Final fluorescence data were obtained by subtracting peptide and buffer effects from those of the Alexa488-CaM plus peptide and correcting for minor dilution during titration. A variant of the Hill model (Equation 2) was used to resolve the change in Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated CaM fluorescence as a function of peptide concentration ([P]), returning the Hill coefficient (n) and peptide concentration yielding half-maximal binding ([P]½). Nonlinear regression was performed using PRISM version 3.03 software (GraphPad). F518([P])=FCaM+(FCaM⋅P2−FCaM)×[([P]/[P]1/2)n1+([P]/[P]1/2)n](Eq. 2) To estimate the fractional concentrations of each CaM species ([CaM]free, [CaM·P], and [CaM·P2]) for given concentrations of total calmodulin ([CaM]total) and peptide ([P]total), it was necessary to first estimate the macroscopic association constants (K1 and K2) describing each stage of CaM·P2 assembly. For a positively cooperative model, this is impossible without knowing the intrinsic fluorescence of the intermediate (CaM·P) species. However, inserting an approximation of this value into Equation 3 allowed estimation of K1 and K2 from regression of F518versus [P] plots, assuming [CaM]total << 1/K1 or 1/K2. F518([P])=FCaM+FCaM⋅PK1[P]+FCaM⋅P2K1K2[P]21+K1[P]+K1K2[P]2(Eq. 3) Using values of K1 and K2 estimated using Equation 3, equilibrium concentrations of all reaction species were resolved for any combination of [P]total and [CaM]total by the system of equations in Equations 4, 5, 6, 7. [P]total=[P]free+[CaM⋅P]+2[CaM⋅P2](Eq. 4) [CaM]total=[CaM]free+[CaM⋅P]+[CaM⋅P2](Eq. 5) [CaM⋅P]=K1[CaM]free[CaM]free(Eq. 6) [CaM⋅P2]=K1K2[CaM]free[P]free2(Eq. 7) All real solutions of ([P]free and [CaM]free) (>0 and >0) for this system of equations were determined for given values of [P]total, [CaM]total, K1, and K2 using Mathematica version 4.1 (Wolfram Research). Calculated values of [P]free and [CaM]free were then used to derive [CaM·P] and [CaM·P2] using Equations 6 and 7, which were then expressed as fractional concentrations of [CaM]total. Data Analysis—Unless otherwise stated, results are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis for comparison of means was performed using analysis of variance with a significance level of p < 0.05. The spatial and temporal properties of Ca2+ sparks (amplitude, rise time, FDHM, and FWHM) were not normally distributed; therefore a non-parametric analysis of variance was performed (Dunn's post hoc analysis). All statistical analysis was performed with SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific), and non-linear curve fitting was performed in SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific), unless otherwise noted. R3614–3643 Increases the Frequency of Occurrence of Spontaneous Ca2+Sparks—A sequence alignment of the CaM binding sequence (3614–3643) from rabbit RyR1 with that of RyRα and RyRβ from frog shows that this region is highly conserved (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we assessed the effects of a synthetic peptide representing amino acids 3614–3643 of the rabbit RyR1 sequence on RyR function in frog skeletal muscle. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks provides a measurement of the activation state of the RyR channels that give rise to the Ca2+ spark (19Schneider M.F. Ward C.W. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1212-d1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schneider M.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Application of R3614–3643 resulted in an increase in the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks, indicating an increase in the rate of activation of RyR. Representative ΔF/F linescan images from control conditions and after application of R3614–3643 (3.0 μm) are shown in Fig. 1B. The concentration dependence of the activation of Ca2+ sparks is shown in Fig. 1C. Addition of R3614–3643 (0.2–3.0 μm) resulted in a highly cooperative, dose-dependent increase in Ca2+ spark frequency. Fitting the data to Equation 1 resulted in a fractional maximal increase (R) of 5.3 ± 1.4, with a half-maximal activation (EC50) of 0.47 ± 0.02 μm and a Hill coefficient (n) of 8.2. The spatial and temporal properties of Ca2+ sparks reflect the underlying channel kinetics and resulting Ca2+ flux, which underlie the Ca2+ spark. To assess whether R3614–3643 alters the kinetics of the Ca2+ release event we measured the spatial and temporal properties of the Ca2+ sparks initiated by R3614–3643. The effect of R3614–3643 (3 μm) on the spatial and temporal properties of Ca2+ sparks is shown in Fig. 2. Ensemble averages and surface plots of identified Ca2+ spark events for Sham and 3 μm R3614–3643 are shown in Fig. 2A. Despite an approximate 5-fold increase in Ca2+ spark frequency only small differences in the spatial and temporal properties were observed (Fig. 2B). Median values of the population distribution for 3 μm R3614–3643 showed a small but statistically significant increase for FWHM and FDHM, no differences were observed for amplitude or rise time. A Single Amino Acid Substitution Abolishes the Activating Effect of R3614–3643—Given that the 3614–3643 region of RyR lies at an inter-subunit contact site (7Moore C.P. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Zhang H. Zhang J.Z. Danila C.I. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8348-8355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and is also a binding site for CaM (21Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. William B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the increase in the rate of activation of RyR observed with R3614–3643 could be due to the peptide binding to either the inter-subunit contact site on RyR and/or binding to native CaM. In an effort to distinguish these possibilities we made the synthetic peptide R3614–3643 with a single amino acid mutation, L3624D. This mutation, when made in full-length RyR1, resulted in the loss of both CaM binding and functional regulation of RyR1 by CaM in SR vesicle preparations (6Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Application of L3624D (2 μm and 10 μm) did not result in an increase in the frequency of occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks (Fig. 3). When added in combination with R3614–3643, excess L3624D (10 μm) attenuated the activation of Ca2+ sparks observed with R3614–3643 (2 μm, Fig. 3), suggesting competition for a similar binding site. R3614–3643 and L3624D Bind CaM with Similar Affinity—It is conceivable that the observed increase in Ca2+ spark frequency produced by R3614–3643 might be due to either: 1) a direct effect of R3614–3643 on RyR, 2) an indirect effect produced by R3614–3643 binding endogenous CaM and thereby removing CaM from the fiber, or 3) a combination of the two effects. In efforts to distinguish these mechanisms we assessed the binding of CaM to R3614–3643 and L3624D. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of R3614–3643 and L3624D was monitored under saturation binding conditions (Fig. 4). CaM (2 μm) binding to R3614–3643 (1 μm) resulted in an increase and a 10 nm blue shift in the peak intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of R3614–3643 (Fig. 4A). Upon binding CaM (2 μm), the peak intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of L3624D (1 μm) also increased in a similar fashion to that for R3614–3643; however, there was little to no shift in the wavelength at which the peak tryptophan fluorescence occurred (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that CaM is able to bind both R3614–3643 and L3624D, but the lack of blue shift observed in the CaM-L3624D interaction suggests that there is some difference in the mechanism or structural consequence of the interaction of CaM with these two peptides. We next assessed the relative affinity of both R3614–3643 and L3624D to bind CaM. Both R3614–3643 and L3624D (0.25–200 nm) quenched the fluorescence of Alexa488-CaM in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). A plot of the fluorescence intensity at 518 nm as a function of the concentration of peptide added (Fig. 5C) shows that each peptide virtually fully quenched the Alex488-CaM fluorescence. The concentration of R3614–3643 for a half-maximal quenching of Alexa488-CaM fluorescence is 22 ± 2 nm, with a Hill coefficient of 1.6 ± 0.2. The concentration of L3624D needed for half-maximal quenching of Alexa488-CaM fluorescence is 33 ± 2 nm, with a Hill coefficient of 1.5 ± 0.1. The apparent affinity and Hill coefficients of R3614–3643 and L3624D for CaM are on the same order of magnitude as previously reported for R3614–3643 (21Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. William B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Also, the apparent affinity of CaM for either R3614–3643 or L3624D is similar to the affinity of CaM for RyR1 (21Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. William B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To ensure that the quenching of the Alexa488-CaM fluorescence was not due to nonspecific effects of the peptides we monitored the fluorescence of Alexa488-CaM in the presence of insulin β chain (3.5 kDa), which has a molecular mass comparable to R3614–3643 and L3624D (3.7 kDa). Insulin β chain (150 nm) resulted in less than a 5% quenching of the Alexa488-CaM fluorescence (data not shown). Our finding that the L3624D mutant does not increase the occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks cannot be attributed to a loss in CaM binding to the mutated peptide, suggesting that this single amino acid mutation does not abolish the spark-activating effect by disrupting the ability R3614–3643 to bind CaM. Instead the mutation likely disrupts the association of the R3614–3643 peptide with its complimentary contact site within RyR. Therefore, removal of endogenous CaM from RyR by R3614–3643 is unlikely to contribute to the increase in Ca2+ spark frequency. The Effects of R3614–3643 and Recombinant CaM on Ca2+Sparks Are Not Additive—We have previously shown that recombinant CaM increased the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks in frog skeletal muscle fibers (9Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We next set out to determine whether the increase in Ca2+ spark frequency observed with either R3614–3643 alone (Fig. 1) or CaM alone (see Fig. 7 of Ref. 9Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are additive. If R3614–3643 and CaM were activating RyR by different independent mechanisms, we might expect to observe some degree of additive effect upon the application of both ligands. However, in light of the fact that these two ligands bind each other in a cooperative manner (see Fig. 5C) it is also conceivable that the combination of R3614–3643 and CaM might have no effect on RyR channel activation. Addition of R3614–3643, at either 2 or 4 μm, in combination with recombinant wild type CaM (2 μm) resulted in an increase in Ca2+ spark frequency that was not different from CaM (2 μm) alone (Fig. 6A). One possible explanation of this finding might be that in the presence of bound exogenous CaM, R3614–3643 cannot bind to RyR. To test this possibility we made use of the dominant negative CaM ((N+3)CaM). Previous studies have demonstrated that (N+3)CaM binds to isolated RyR1 with ∼5-fold higher affinity than wild type CaM, binds R3614–3643 similar to wild type CaM, prevents the localization of fluorescently labeled wild type CaM (Alexa488-CaM) in permeabilized muscle fibers, and prevents the increase in spark frequency due to exogenous wild type CaM in permeabilized muscle fibers, but it does not itself increase the activation rate of RyR (9Rodney G.G.

Fig. 6B shows that in the presence of (N+3)CaM (2 μm), R3614–3643 (2 μm) still increased Ca2+ spark frequency to a level that is not different from R3614–3643 alone.Fig. 6R3614–3643 does not alter the CaM effect on Ca2+ spark frequency. Frequency was determined as the mean number of events identified in each fiber and normalized to the mean frequency of that group of fibers prior to the addition of either CaM plus R3614–3643 (A) or (N+3)CaM plus R3614–3643 (B). Ligand combinations were mixed prior to application to the muscle fiber. Data for R3614–3643 are the same as that presented in Fig. 1C.

Because we do not know the intrinsic fluorescence of the intermediate (CaM·P) species, we performed simulations assuming 20, 50, and 80% quenching efficiency for the CaM·P species (Table I). At 2 μm of each ligand, CaM and R3614–3643, the [CaM]free was predicted to be at most 820 nm. This value is below the EC50 value (1.1 μm) we have previously reported for the CaM-dependent increase in Ca2+ spark frequency (9Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and thus would not have resulted in the Ca2+ spark frequency observed in Fig. 6A.

https://openalex.org/W2038299688,"Molecular hardwiring of the cell cycle to the apoptotic machinery is a critical tumor suppressor mechanism for eliminating hyperproliferative cells. Deregulation of the Rb-E2F repressor complex by genetic deletion or functional inhibition of Rb triggers apoptosis through both the intrinsic (caspase-9 mediated) and extrinsic (caspase-8 mediated) death pathways. Induction of the intrinsic pathway has been studied extensively and involves release of free E2F and direct transcriptional activation of E2F-responsive apoptotic genes such as ARF, APAF1, and CASP9. In contrast, the mechanisms leading to activation of the extrinsic pathway are less well understood. There is growing evidence that Rb-E2F perturbation induces the extrinsic pathway, at least in part, through derepression (as opposed to transactivation) of apoptotic genes. Here, we explore this possibility using cells in which Rb-E2F complexes are displaced from promoters without stimulating E2F transactivation. This derepression of Rb-E2F-regulated genes leads to apoptosis through inactivation of focal adhesion kinase and activation of caspase-8.

Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a critical role in development, tissue homeostasis, and tumor suppression (1Ranger A.M. Malynn B.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Highly efficient and redundant “hardwiring” between the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways normally ensures the elimination of hyperproliferative cells (2Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). One of the most important links between cell cycle and apoptosis is the Rb-E2F complex, which triggers cell death by multiple mechanisms when it becomes deregulated by oncogenic mutations (3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma protein, Rb, interacts with the E2F family of transcription factors (referred to here collectively as E2F) and can inhibit their ability to activate genes by at least two mechanisms (4Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2545-2562Crossref Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Rb directly binds and masks the E2F transactivation (5Helin K. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This mechanism may be important for regulating genes that require the influence of E2F transactivation for efficient expression. In addition, Rb can actively repress regulatory elements when recruited to promoters by E2F (6Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). This mechanism may be important for regulating constitutively repressed apoptotic genes that are expressed only when the Rb-E2F repressor complex is inactivated (7Young A.P. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both mechanisms appear to be operative in the Rb-E2F-mediated apoptotic response. Several lines of evidence suggest that loss of Rb leads to an accumulation of free E2F1, transactivation of E2F-responsive apoptotic genes, and induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (8Almasan A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 14Guo Z. Yikang S. Yoshida H. Mak T.W. Zacksenhaus E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8395-8400PubMed Google Scholar). This apoptosis is partly rescued in mice lacking E2F1, which transactivates genes in the intrinsic pathway (15Tsai K.Y. Hu Y. Macleod K.F. Crowley D. Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 293-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that some (but not all) apoptosis resulting from Rb loss is because of E2F1 transactivation and intrinsic pathway mechanisms. Recently, there has been increasing recognition that a portion of the apoptosis resulting from Rb-E2F deregulation does not depend on the transactivation function of E2F and may involve the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Hsieh and co-workers (16Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) showed through the use of E2F1 mutants that transactivation was dispensable but DNA binding was required for the apoptotic function of E2F1 (16Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Phillips and co-workers (17Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Bates S. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) showed that an E2F mutant lacking the transactivation domain could induce apoptosis that was independent of the intrinsic pathway protein p53 and involved elements of the extrinsic pathway such as TRAF2 (17Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Bates S. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have shown that, contrary to previous concepts, Rb-E2F complexes occupy many promoters throughout the cell cycle (18Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rb-E2F complexes constitutively occupy the promoters of many apoptotic genes, including extrinsic pathway components FAS and tumor necrosis factor-α (7Young A.P. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that loss of Rb can cause apoptosis through derepression of basally inhibited extrinsic apoptotic pathway genes. However, no mechanism has provided a molecular explanation for how Rb-E2F is coupled to the extrinsic pathway. We have used a cell system in which a dominant-negative mutant of E2F1 (dnE2F) that contains the DNA binding domain but lacks the transactivation domain is inducibly activated by a tamoxifen-estrogen receptor system in U2OS-derived EH1 cells (19McConnell B.B. Gregory F.J. Stott F.J. Hara E. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of this dnE2F mutant has been shown to displace E2Fs and Rb-E2F complexes from promoters containing E2F sites and to specifically disrupt the functions of Rb that are mediated through its interaction with E2F family members, such as active transcriptional repression and G1 cell cycle arrest (20Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, microarray gene expression experiments in this cell system confirmed that dnE2F derepressed many known E2F-responsive genes such as CCNA2 and CCNE2 (21Young A.P. Nagarajan R. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7209-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Of particular interest for this study, the dnE2F mutant rapidly induces apoptosis through an Rb-E2F-dependent mechanism (7Young A.P. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A major advantage of this system is that it appears to simultaneously displace all E2F family members and pocket protein-E2F complexes from promoters with similar efficiency (which would be impractical by inhibition or genetic deletion of all individual E2Fs and pocket proteins). Furthermore, the confounding factor of E2F transactivation is eliminated. We show that dnE2F-induced apoptosis is mediated largely through caspase-8, a component of the extrinsic pathway, and involves dephosphorylation and inactivation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Our findings provide a novel mechanism to explain the link between Rb-E2F deregulation and extrinsic pathway (caspase 8-mediated) apoptosis. Cell Cultures—ER-dnE2F cells (gift of D. Dean) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 μg/ml zeocin, 150 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 300 μg/ml G418. Treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (Sigma) resulted in activation of the dnE2F, and treatment with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm, Sigma) resulted in activation of p16Ink4a, as described previously (21Young A.P. Nagarajan R. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7209-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). E2F1-DP1 inducible Rat2 cells (gift of B. Shan and W. H. Lee), originally derived from immortalized rat embryo fibroblast (REF) cells, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg of G418, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Withdrawal of tetracycline resulted in overexpression of E2F1 and DP1, as described previously (22Shan B. Farmer A.A. Lee W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar). Rat embryo fibroblasts (BioWhittaker) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell permeable inhibitors of caspases-8 and -9 were obtained from BD Pharmingen. The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor bis(N,N-dimethylhydroxamido)hydroxooxovanadate (DHMV), which inhibits PTP1B and other members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family (23Cuncic C. Desmarais S.

Biochem. 2000; 80: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was obtained from Calbiochem. Plasmids and Antibodies—Plasmids included: CD2-FAK (FAK fused to CD2 for membrane tethering, gift of G. Whitney) (25Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GFP-FAK, GFP-FRNK, GFP-FAT (gifts of D. Illic), GFP-PTP1B (gift of J. Balsamo), and GFP-C1 (Clontech). Transfections were performed using effectene (Qiagen). Antibodies were used that detect caspases-3, -8, and -9, and cleaved caspase-8, AKT-phospho-Ser473, and PTEN (Cell Signaling), FAK (Upstate), and FAK-phospho-Tyr397, -Tyr407, -Tyr576, and -Tyr861 (BIOSOURCE). Immunoblots and immunofluorescence assays were performed as described previously (26Ma D. Zhou P. Harbour J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Caspase Activity Assays—Caspase activity was measured by adding specific substrates for caspases-3, -8, and -9 to cell lysates and measuring enzymatic cleavage with a colorimetric assay (Biovision) at 405 nm on a plate reader according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow Cytometry—As described previously (26Ma D. Zhou P. Harbour J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), cells were fixed overnight in cold 70% ethanol, stained with a solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 2 mg/ml RNase A in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed for DNA content on a FACS Caliber (BD Biosciences). Viability Assays—Viability assays were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega) as described previously (26Ma D. Zhou P. Harbour J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, we used 105 cells, and 20 μl of MTS and phenazine methosulfate solutions per well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, and absorbance was measured at 496 nm on a plate reader. Polymerase Chain Reaction—For real-time PCR, total RNA was collected using RNeasy (Qiagen), cDNA was generated using SuperScript First Strand Synthesis (Invitrogen), and amplification was performed using Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions in a Bio-Rad iCycler. LUX Fluorogenic primers were as follows: GAPDH forward, 5′-Fam-GACGTATGCTGGCGCTGAGTAACG; GAPDH reverse, 3′-GTGGCAGGAGGCATTGCTGAT; PTPN11 forward, 5′-Fam-GAACTGACCACCAACGTCGTATTTCAG; PTPN11 reverse, 3′-GCGCACTGGTGATGACAAAG; PTP1B forward, 5′-Fam-GACGAGACTCAGTGCATGGTCCTCG; PTP1B reverse, 3′-GGCATCGAAAGCATGAGTCAA; PTEN forward, 5′-Fam-CACGACCATGAACTTGTCTTCCCGTCG; and PTEN reverse, 3′-TGGTCTGCCAGCTAAAGGTGAA. The ΔCT values were generated by ICycler software, and the logarithms of the sample gene ΔCT values were normalized to that of GAPDH (control). Displacement of Rb-E2F Complexes from Promoters Induces Apoptosis—To analyze how loss of transcriptional repression by Rb-E2F complexes leads to apoptosis, we used U2OS cells that conditionally express an ER-fused dnE2F that retains the DNA binding domain but lacks the transactivation domain (21Young A.P. Nagarajan R. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7209-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Activation of dnE2F in these cells displaces endogenous Rb-E2F complexes from promoters, allowing expression of repressed genes (7Young A.P. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Young A.P. Nagarajan R. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7209-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This cell model and several others using similar dnE2F mutants have been shown to induce apoptosis (16Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 27Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Consistent with prior studies, we found that activation of dnE2F resulted in prompt onset of apoptosis, as measured by flow cytometric accumulation of cells with <2 n DNA content, with most cell death occurring within 48 h (Fig. 1A). Activation of Caspase-8 —To explore the molecular mechanisms regulating this apoptosis, we started by examining caspases-8 and -9, which are the principal initiator caspases of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, respectively, as well as caspase-3, a major downstream executioner of the death program (1Ranger A.M. Malynn B.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). At multiple time points after activation of ER-dnE2F, caspase activity was monitored by colorimetric assay, and cleavage of procaspases to their active forms was monitored with immunoblots. Surprisingly, caspase-8 activity began to increase within 6 h and peaked at 12 h, whereas caspase-9 activity remained unchanged (Fig. 1B). Similarly, cleavage of caspase-8 was detectable as early as 6 h, whereas caspase-9 cleavage was only detected later at 48 h (Fig. 1C). As expected, caspase-3, which acts downstream of both caspase-8 and caspase-9, was activated somewhat later than caspase-8 (Fig. 1, B and C). To further analyze the roles of caspase-8 and -9, we attempted to block the apoptosis using cell-permeable inhibitors of each caspase. We confirmed that the inhibitory peptides were specific by testing them with recombinant caspases in vitro (data not shown). By flow cytometric analysis of cells with <2 n DNA content, inhibition of caspase-8 rescued almost half of the apoptosis at 24 h, whereas inhibition of caspase-9 rescued only about 5% of the apoptosis (Fig. 2A). We repeated these experiments using colorimetric detection of viable cells. As with flow cytometry, the caspase-8 inhibitory peptide rescued about half of the apoptosis at 24 h (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, however, the caspase-9 inhibitor also rescued about half of the apoptosis, and there was an additive effect with almost complete rescue when both inhibitors were used. Taken together, these results suggest that the apoptosis induced by displacement of Rb-E2F repressor complexes is mediated largely through caspase-8, which has been associated primarily with the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The fact that caspase-9 appeared to play some role suggests either that it is activated secondarily as apoptosis proceeds or that some of the apoptosis in this system is in fact mediated through the intrinsic pathway. Inactivation of FAK—Recently, it was shown that loss of FAK leads to caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in both anchorage-dependent and -independent cell systems (28Xu L.H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30597-30604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To explore whether FAK may play a role in the apoptosis in our system, we first examined the protein levels of FAK at multiple time points after activation of dnE2F. As evidenced by immunoblot analysis, the overall protein levels of FAK did not change over 72 h after dnE2F activation (Fig. 3A). We then examined the phosphorylation status of FAK using phosphorylation site-specific FAK antibodies. FAK activity is regulated by phosphorylation, predominantly on tyrosine residues. Tyr397 is a major autophosphorylation site that is required for FAK activity such as binding to Src kinases and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, whereas Tyr861 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases and regulates the interaction of FAK with integrins (29Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of dnE2F and onset of apoptosis were associated with dephosphorylation of FAK at both Tyr397 and Tyr861 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, two other tyrosine residues, Tyr407 and Tyr576, remained phosphorylated throughout the time course. To investigate whether loss of FAK activity could induce caspase-8-mediated apoptosis in these cells, we expressed FRNK, a dominant-negative form of FAK lacking the kinase domain, and inspected cells for activation of caspase-8 by immunofluorescence, as described previously (30Joshi S.G. Sahni S.K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Indeed, expression of FRNK was associated with rounding of cells and the appearance of activated (cleaved) caspase-8 by 24 h (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the morphologic changes and activation of caspase-8 were not observed in cells expressing an empty control vector or wild type FAK. To determine whether overexpression of wild type FAK in the activated ER-dnE2F cells could rescue apoptosis, we expressed CD2-FAK, a chimeric protein containing the CD2 transmembrane domain and fused to the FAK protein, which anchors FAK to the cell membrane and causes it to be constitutively active (25Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Activated cells expressing CD2-FAK exhibited significantly less apoptosis (as measured by flow cytometric DNA content) than control cells expressing an empty vector, with over half of the apoptosis rescued at 48 h (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, expression of CD2-FAK in cells treated with camptothecin, which activates both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways (32Hentze H. Latta M. Kunstle G. Dhakshinamoorthy S. Ng P.Y. Porter A.G. Wendel A. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), preferentially blocked the activation of caspase-8 compared with caspase-9 (Fig. 3D). Given the novelty of these findings, we wished to reproduce them in an independent cell system. For these experiments, we expressed in wild type REFs two proteins that have been shown to inhibit FAK through a dominant-negative mechanism: FRNK (lacking the N-terminal catalytic domain of FAK) (33Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and FAT (the focal adhesion targeting domain of FAK that localizes the protein to focal adhesions) (34Mortier E. Cornelissen F. van Hove C. Dillen L. Richardson A. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Expression of either of these dominant-negative FAK proteins induced apoptosis with a time course similar to the ER-dnE2F cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, a caspase-8 inhibitor, but not a caspase-9 inhibitor, efficiently rescued FRNK-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B), indicating that FRNK is relatively specific for activating the extrinsic death pathway. We then examined FAK protein status in REF-derived cells that rapidly undergo apoptosis upon induction of full-length E2F1 and DP1 by a tetracycline-regulated system (22Shan B. Farmer A.A. Lee W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these cells overexpress full-length E2F1, which induces apoptosis through transactivation and derepression (displacement of Rb-E2F complexes) of E2F-responsive apoptotic genes (7Young A.P. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this system overall FAK protein levels diminished rapidly upon induction of the cells (Fig. 4C). This loss of FAK was not accompanied by the appearance of FAK degradation products, suggesting that the reduced protein expression was because of down-regulation. Similar to the previous experiments, CD2-FAK efficiently rescued this apoptosis (Fig. 4D). As expected, both caspase-8 and caspase-9 are activated in this system, but the greater amplitude of caspase-8 activation suggests that the extrinsic pathway is a major mechanism of apoptosis (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these experiments support the existence of a novel link between FAK, caspase-8, and Rb-E2F-associated apoptosis. Role of PTP1B—To explore potential mechanisms for the dephosphorylation of FAK in the ER-dnE2F cells, we investigated whether one or more tyrosine phosphatases may be upregulated by displacement of Rb-E2F complexes from promoters. Several phosphatases have been shown to promote FAK dephosphorylation, including PTEN, PTP1B, and PTPN11 (35Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 36Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Tsuda M. Matozaki T. Fukunaga K. Fujioka Y. Imamoto A. Noguchi T. Takada T. Yamao T. Takeda H. Ochi F. Yamamoto T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13223-13229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because PTEN is a well characterized tumor suppressor, we examined this gene first. Following activation of the ER-dnE2F cells, PTEN protein levels did not change appreciably, and the phosphorylation status of AKT-Ser473, a downstream target of PTEN signaling, also remained unchanged (Supplemental Materials Fig. S1), suggesting that PTEN does not play a role in dnE2F-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this finding, PTEN mRNA levels (as measured by real-time PCR) did not change upon activation of the ER-dnE2F cells (Fig. 5A). Likewise, PTPN11 mRNA levels remained unchanged in the activated dnE2F cells. In contrast, PTPB1B mRNA levels increased by ∼20-fold by real-time PCR at 24 h (Fig. 5A). A tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor that strongly inhibits PTP1B (DHMV) efficiently blocked ER-dnE2F-induced apoptosis, with almost 100% rescue at 50 μm concentration (Fig. 5B). Because DHMV is not specific to PTP1B but also inhibits other members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family (23Cuncic C. Desmarais S. Detich N. Tracey A.S. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), (24Tracey A.S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 80: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we depleted cells of PTP1B using RNA interference, which impaired the cleavage of caspase-8 in activated ER-dnE2F cells (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, ectopic expression of PTP1B in parental EH1 cells efficiently induced cleavage of caspase-8 by immunoblot and immunofluorescence (Fig. 5, D–F). Intriguingly, the upstream regulatory region of PTP1B contains likely E2F binding sites using E2Fsite Scan software (38Kel A.E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Farnham P.J. Bartley S.M. Wingender E. Zhang M.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that this gene may be directly repressed by Rb-E2F and up-regulated as a consequence of Rb-E2F disruption. Herein, we provide evidence for a novel mechanism linking Rb-E2F to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through inactivation of FAK and activation of caspase-8. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence suggesting that loss of Rb induces apoptosis through multiple mechanisms involving both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Role of FAK Inhibition in Intrinsic and Extrinsic Death Pathways—We provide several lines of evidence indicating that inactivation of FAK plays an important role in Rb-E2F-associated apoptosis. First, we show that displacement of Rb-E2F complexes from promoters results in apoptosis that is mediated largely through caspase-8-dependent mechanisms. Second, we show that this apoptosis is associated with dephosphorylation of FAK and can be blocked by constitutive activation of FAK. FAK inhibits caspase-8/extrinsic pathway apoptosis (28Xu L.H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30597-30604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) through mechanisms that are still incompletely understood. FAK binds the receptor-interacting protein, which is a serine/threonine kinase that contains a death domain and is a major component of the death receptor complex (39Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Receptor-interacting protein interacts with the death domains of cell surface receptors of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and death domain adaptor proteins, whereby it provides proapoptotic signals that are suppressed by its interaction with FAK, which appears to directly interfere with the interaction between receptor-interacting protein and the death receptor complex (40Kurenova E. Xu L.H. Yang X. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Hanks S.K. Liu Z.G. Cance W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). FAK is located at sites of focal adhesions, where it binds and phosphorylates many proteins including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, members of the Src kinase family, Shc, and p130Cas (29Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), and it is possible that these FAK-associated proteins may mediate effects on caspase-8 as well (41Wang H.Q. Quan T. He T. Franke T.F. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45737-45745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found that pro-caspase-8 contains potential FAK phosphorylation motifs, and that FAK may directly phosphorylate and inactivate caspase-8. 2J. H. Lieman, L. A. Worley, and J. W. Harbour, unpublished results. Hence, FAK may serve as a point of regulation for multiple death and survival signals (42Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is frequently deregulated in cancer (43Agochiya M. Brunton V.G. Owens D.W. Parkinson E.K. Paraskeva C. Keith W.N. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5646-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 44Cance W.G. Harris J.E. Iacocca M.V. Roche E. Yang X. Chang J. Simkins S. Xu L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2417-2423PubMed Google Scholar). In ER-dnE2F cells, where caspase-8-mediated apoptosis is induced by derepression of Rb-E2F inhibited genes, FAK is inactivated by dephosphorylation. As a potential explanation for this dephosphorylation, we found that PTP1B contains E2F sites in its promoter (data not shown) and is potently induced by dnE2F. Ectopic expression of PTP1B induces caspase-8 cleavage, whereas inhibition of PTP1B blocks caspase-8 cleavage. PTP1B is a plausible candidate for mediating this apoptotic response because it localizes to focal adhesions, promotes FAK dephosphorylation, causes cell rounding, and suppresses tumorigenesis through inhibition of FAK (36Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with this potentially anti-oncogenic role for PTP1B, there is growing evidence that PTP1B may act as a tumor suppressor (45Dube N. Tremblay M.L. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). PTP1B can suppress transformation by Bcr-Abl (46LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Flint A.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Pandergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and it is down-regulated in esophageal cancers (47Warabi M. Nemoto T. Ohashi K. Kitagawa M. Hirokawa K. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 68: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These findings do not rule out the possibility that additional phosphatases may also be involved in this process. In contrast to the ER-dnE2F cells in which the dnE2F lacks a transactivation domain, the Rat2-E2F1/DP1 cells overexpress full-length E2F1 that can both activate transcription and displace endogenous Rb-E2F complexes. Interestingly, FAK is inactivated in the Rat2-E2F1/DP1 cells by down-regulation (rather than dephosphorylation) of the protein. Two potential explanations are that excess E2F1/DP1 promotes degradation of FAK, or that it transcriptionally inhibits FAK. Distinguishing between these possibilities is beyond the scope of this study, but it is intriguing that the FAK promoter contains p53 sites and is transcriptionally repressed by p53 (48Golubovskaya V. Kaur A. Cance W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which is a component of the intrinsic death pathway and is activated by full-length E2F1. Hence, both extrinsic and intrinsic Rb-E2F-associated apoptotic mechanisms appear to target FAK for inactivation, possibly as a means of coordinating apoptosis with cytoskeletal/adhesion functions. Rb-E2F Deregulation Triggers a Multifaceted Apoptotic Response—Rb-E2F deregulation triggers a complex and redundant apoptotic response involving both the intrinsic and extrinsic death pathways through transactivation and derepression of apoptotic genes to ensure the efficient elimination of abnormally proliferative cells (Fig. 6). Nahle et al. (10Nahle Z. Polakoff J. Davuluri R.V. McCurrach M.E. Jacobson M.D. Narita M. Zhang M.Q. Lazebnik Y. Bar-Sagi D. Lowe S.W. Nat.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27593-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed that p53, an intrinsic pathway component that is activated by the E2F-inducible ARF protein, positively regulates caspase-8, a component of the extrinsic pathway. Some E2F responsive apoptotic genes may be regulated through both repression and transactivation. Aslanian and co-workers (50Aslanian A. Iaquinta P.J. Verona R. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) showed that ARF is basally repressed by E2F3b and becomes derepressed by E2F3 loss; under oncogenic conditions, however, E2F1 and E2F3a are recruited to the ARF promoter to transcriptionally activate the gene. Additionally, the liberation of free E2F in this model system may interfere with E2F-independent anti-apoptotic functions of Rb, such as inhibition of c-Abl and other pro-apoptotic proteins (51Chau B.N. Chen T.T. Wan Y.Y. DeGregori J. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4438-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our results corroborate and extend these findings by linking Rb-E2F-associated apoptosis to FAK and caspase-8. This relationship may serve to coordinate apoptotic and cytoskeletal signaling, and may explain at least in part the rounding and detachment of adherent cells that occurs during with apoptosis (52Beviglia L.

https://openalex.org/W2090851778,"The enzyme CYP17 primarily regulates androgen production by mediating four reactions: conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, respectively (17α-hydroxylase activity), followed by conversion of the 17-hydroxylated steroids to dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, respectively (17,20-lyase activity). Most mammalian CYP17 isoforms have high 17α-hydroxylase relative to 17,20-lyase activities and preferentially mediate one of the two 17,20-lyase reactions. In contrast, Xenopus laevis CYP17 potently regulates all four reactions in the frog ovary. CYP17 isoforms generally rely on the cofactor cytochrome b5 for the 17,20-lyase reaction, suggesting that the high lyase activity of Xenopus CYP17 might be due to a lesser dependence on b5. The kinetics of Xenopus CYP17 expressed in yeast microsomes were therefore examined in the absence and presence of Xenopus on human b5. Xenopus CYP17 mediated both 17,20-lyase reactions in the absence of b5, confirming that the activity did not require b5. However, both Xenopus and human b5 slightly enhanced Xenopus CYP17-mediated lyase activity, indicating that the enzyme was still at least partially responsive to b5. Surprisingly, only the human b5 cofactor enhanced human CYP17-mediated lyase activity, implying that the human enzyme had more specific cofactor requirements than Xenopus CYP17. Studies using human/Xenopus chimeric b5 proteins revealed that human b5 residues 16–41 were important for the specific regulation of the lyase activity of HuCYP17, possibly serving as an interacting domain with the enzyme. CYP17 may therefore have evolved from a general producer of sex steroids in lower vertebrates to a more tightly regulated producer of both sex steroids and glucocorticoids in mammals.

The development and maintenance of male and female fertility depends on the normal function of androgens and their cognate androgen receptor. Androgens induce male sexual differentiation before birth, promote sexual maturation during puberty, and maintain male reproductive function in adults (1Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In women, androgens serve as precursors for estrogen biosynthesis (2Simpson E. Rubin G. Clyne C. Robertson K. O'Donnell L. Jones M.

Science. 1986; 234: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). CYP17 mediates two enzymatic reactions. Its 17-hydroxylase activity primarily converts pregnenolone (Δ5 pathway) and progesterone (Δ4 pathway) to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, respectively. The 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17 then converts the 17-hydroxylated pregnenolone and progesterone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 1The abbreviations used are: DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; b5, cytochrome b5; Xb5, Xenopus b5; Hb5, human b5; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholami-dopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; XeCYP17, Xenopus CYP17; human CYP17, HuCYP17.1The abbreviations used are: DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; b5, cytochrome b5; Xb5, Xenopus b5; Hb5, human b5; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholami-dopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; XeCYP17, Xenopus CYP17; human CYP17, HuCYP17. and androstenedione, respectively. Notably, the cofactor cytochrome b5 has been implicated as a critical component of the 17,20-lyase reaction. Nearly all mammalian CYP17 isoforms that have been examined have little 17,20-lyase activity in the absence of b5. The addition of b5 markedly enhances lyase activity, although it usually remains lower than the hydroxylase activity under similar conditions (10Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most mammalian isoforms of CYP17 respond to b5 by preferentially promoting lyase activity in only one of the two pathways (Δ4 versus Δ5) (11Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these b5-dependent responses ensure that mammalian CYP17s will regulate the production of a variety of steroids, including both androgen precursors such as DHEA and androstenedione, as well as 17-hydroxylated progestins such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone and 17-hydroxypregnenolone.We have previously shown that ovarian androgen production is extremely important in the female frog Xenopus laevis, as testosterone and androstenedione appear to be the physiologic regulators of oocyte maturation, or re-entry into meiosis. These androgens trigger maturation by signaling in an unusual nongenomic (transcription-independent) fashion that involves at least in part classical androgen receptors (12Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Lutz L.B. Jamnongjit M. Yang W.H. Jahani D. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Mol Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1106-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Xenopus ovarian androgen production is dependent upon both ovarian germ and somatic cells, as CYP17 activity is found almost exclusively in oocytes, whereas all other steroidogenic enzymes are expressed in the surrounding follicle cells. Initial characterization of CYP17 activity in frog oocytes revealed remarkably high 17,20-lyase activity in both the Δ4 and the Δ5 pathways, with lyase rates at least equaling those of the 17α-hydroxylase reactions (14Yang W.H. Lutz L.B. Hammes S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9552-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, Xenopus ovaries produced virtually no detectable progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, or 17-hydroxypregnenolone upon stimulation with gonadotropins, whereas ovarian androgens such as androstenedione and testosterone levels were very high.The unusually high lyase activity of Xenopus CYP17 (XeCYP17) suggested that the enzyme was either more sensitive to or less dependent on cytochrome b5. To address this issue, we designed a series of experiments that would examine the b5 dependence of XeCYP17. As a comparison, similar studies were performed in parallel using the well characterized human isoform of CYP17 (HuCYP17). Finally, the effects of both Xenopus and human b5 (Xb5 and Hb5, respectively) on each isoform of CYP17 were examined to study the specificity of the CYP17/b5 interactions.We found that XeCYP17 contained significant 17,20-lyase activity in both the Δ4 and the Δ5 pathways in the absence of b5, although these activities were slightly enhanced upon the addition of either the Xenopus or the human b5. In contrast, HuCYP17-mediated 17,20-lyase activity was extremely low in both pathways in the absence of b5 and was markedly enhanced by the human, but not the Xenopus b5, cofactor. Finally, studies with Xenopus/human b5 chimeras revealed residues within Hb5 that were important for its specific interactions with HuCYP17. In addition to uncovering a potential CYP17-binding domain in b5, these studies suggest that CYP17 from lower vertebrates such as frogs may be more potent regulators of androgen production in part due to their lesser dependence on cytochrome b5 as a regulator of the 17,20-lyase reaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSSynthesis of Recombinant Wild-type Xb5 and Human/Xenopus b5 Chimeras—The expression vector pT7-7 and cDNA of Hb5 were generous gifts from Drs. Ron Estabrook and Richard Auchus (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The cDNA encoding Xb5 was obtained by PCR amplification from a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library (GenBank™ accession number AY775052). The 5′ primer introduced a NdeI site and four histidine codons prior to the start codon (Supplementary Table). The Xb5 cDNA was cloned into pT7-7, and the DNA was transformed into the Rosetta bacterial strain (Dr. R. Auchus, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The recombinant human/Xenopus b5 chimeras (see Fig. 1C) were obtained by PCR using primers described in the Supplementary Table.Expression of the Wild-type Xb5 and Recombinant Human/Xenopus b5 Chimeras—The cytochrome b5 proteins were expressed as described (15Holmans P.L. Shet M.S. Martin-Wixtrom C.A. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-ml cultures of Rosetta bacterial cells transformed with plasmid pT7-7 containing cDNAs encoding the wild-type or chimeric b5 proteins were grown at 30 °C in medium (2 g/liter peptone, 12 g/liter tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 4 ml/liter glycerol, 17.5 mm KH2PO4, and 72.5 mm K2HPO4) containing ampicillin (0.2 mg/ml), chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), and glucose (0.2%). The overnight cultures were diluted to an A600 = 0.03 in 1 liter of the same medium except without glucose. The cells were incubated at 30 °C with shaking until an A600 = 0.8–1.5 (7–10 h) was reached, at which time 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. Cells were then incubated at 24 °C overnight (about 15 h).Isolation and Purification of Wild-type Xb5 and Recombinant Human/Xenopus b5 Chimeras—Cells from cultures expressing b5 were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Pelleted cells were suspended in 2 volumes (w/v) of buffer A (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and broken by emulsification (Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 20% glycerol) with a Dounce homogenizer. The membrane fraction was harvested by centrifugation (32,000 rpm for 50 min) and stored frozen at –80 °C. The frozen membrane fraction was then thawed, and CHAPS (Pierce) was slowly added to the cold suspension of stirred membranes until a concentration of 1% (w/v) was attained. The suspension was stirred for an additional hour, and the solubilized membranes were centrifuged for 50 min at 32,000 rpm. The supernatant was carefully decanted and diluted with an equal amount of buffer B supplemented with 0.1% CHAPS (B/CHAPS). The sample was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column followed by 10 column volumes of buffer B/CHAPS. The b5 was eluted with buffer B/CHAPS containing 100 mm imidazole (Sigma). The fractions containing b5 were combined and dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% CHAPS. SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of b5.Yeast Transformation and Microsome Preparation—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains YiV(B) and plasmid V60, which contains the cDNA encoding oxidoreductase, were gifts of Dr. R. Auchus (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). YiV(B) yeast were transformed with 1 μg of plasmid V60 containing the cDNA encoding either wild-type HuCYP17 or wild-type XeCYP17. Microsomes were prepared as described (16Gupta M.K. Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4416-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Sherbet D.P. Tiosano D. Kwist K.M. Hochberg Z. Auchus R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48563-48569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and microsomal proteins were quantified colorimetrically. CYP17 concentrations were determined using difference spectroscopy (Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). For the studies here, the concentration of HuCYP17 was 348.88 pmol/mg of total microsomal protein, whereas the concentration of XeCYP17 was 40.71 pmol/mg of total microsomal protein.CYP17 Enzyme Assays—17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in yeast microsomes were measured as described previously (10Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Microsomes were assayed under initial rate kinetics by incubation in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.03–1 μm steroid (Sigma and Steraloids, Newport, RI) and 1 mm cofactor NADPH (Sigma) in 500 μl of total volume at room temperature for 30 min. Each reaction contained 25 μg of microsomes (final concentrations of 17.4 pmol/ml HuCYP17 and 2.0 pmol/ml XeCYP17) and 50,000 cpm of [7-3H(N)]pregnenolone, [1,2,6,7-3H]17α-hydroxypregnenolone, [1,2,6,7-3H(N)]progesterone, or [1,2,6,7-3H(N)]17α-hydroxyprogesterone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Unless otherwise indicated, reactions contained 2.5 μg/ml (∼150 pmol/ml) final concentration of cytochrome b5. Recombinant Hb5 was purchased from Pan Vera (Madison, WI). Steroids were extracted with 3 ml of 3:2 ethyl acetate:hexane, concentrated under nitrogen, and separated by TLC using 3:1 chloroform:ethyl acetate. Relative steroid amounts were determined by cutting out the steroid spots on the TLC plate and measuring radioactivity using liquid scintillation. Kinetic behavior was approximated using Michaelis-Menten analysis.Computer Modeling—Graphics for the cytochrome b5 modeling were created on a Silicon Graphics Octane/S.E. R12000 work station (Mountain View, CA) using the ribbonjr program of MidasPlus software version 2.1. The coordinates of bovine cytochrome b5 (Protein Data Bank ID1CYO) were used as a template, and residue side chains were replaced with the swapaa command of MidasPlus without additional model refinement.RESULTSXeCYP17 Catalyzed the 17,20-Lyase Reaction in Both a b5-independent and b5-dependent Manner—Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that Xenopus oocyte membranes contained high 17,20-lyase activity in both the Δ4 and the Δ5 pathways (14Yang W.H. Lutz L.B. Hammes S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9552-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, these experiments using crude membrane preparations did not prove that XeCYP17 was the primary mediator of this activity, nor could they be used for detailed quantitative analyses of XeCYP17-mediated catalysis. Additionally, oocyte membranes likely contained cytochrome b5; thus, they could not be used to quantify the b5 dependence of the XeCYP17-mediated lyase reaction. To address these issues, XeCYP17 was expressed in yeast microsomes, and its enzymatic activities were examined both in the absence and in the presence of cytochrome b5.Xb5 protein containing 4 amino-terminal histidines was expressed in bacteria and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The purity of the final Xb5 preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, although the predicted mass of Xb5 is ∼17 kDa, the predominant band in the gel migrated at a slightly higher molecular mass of ∼25 kDa. This differed from the Hb5, which migrated at the predicted mass of 17 kDa (Fig. 1B). Mass spectroscopy and proteolysis studies confirmed that the dominant band from the Xenopus preparation was Xb5 and that its true molecular mass was indeed 17 kDa (data not shown). Thus, the slower than predicted electrophoretic mobility of Xb5 appeared to be due to SDS- and reduction-resistant structural differences.Interestingly, XeCYP17 contained significant 17,20-lyase activities in both the Δ5 and the Δ4 pathways independent of Xb5 as radiolabeled 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were converted to DHEA and androstenedione, respectively, in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 2, A and B). XeCYP17 contained b5-dependent lyase activity as well since the addition of Xb5 enhanced both reactions (Fig. 2, A and B). To further quantify the enzymatic activities of XeCYP17 and to precisely determine the contribution of b5 to the lyase reaction, detailed kinetic analyses of XeCYP17 were performed (Table I). The Vmax values for XeCYP17-mediated lyase activities in the absence of b5 were substantial and relatively similar in both the Δ4 and the Δ5 pathways (0.51 + 0.11 and 0.41 + 0.12 min–1, respectively), confirming that XeCYP17 could mediate the 17,20-lyase reaction in the absence of b5. Xb5 at the predetermined concentration yielding maximum activity (2.5 μg/ml, data not shown) only slightly enhanced 17,20-lyase activity, increasing the rate of the Δ4 lyase reaction (17-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione) by ∼2-fold and the rate of the Δ5 lyase reaction (17-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA) by ∼4-fold (Table I). As expected, Xb5 did not significantly alter XeCYP17-mediated hydroxylase activities in either pathway, nor did it markedly affect the calculated Km values of any of the reactions examined. Of note, the Vmax and Km values for XeCYP17-mediated 17α-hydroxylase activity in the Δ4 pathway were higher than in the Δ5 pathway, suggesting that progesterone might be the preferred substrate for XeCYP17 in vitro when substrate concentrations are high. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated that virtually no progesterone is produced by the Xenopus ovary in vivo, most likely due to the extremely slow conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone, indicating that pregnenolone is in fact the dominant physiologic substrate of XeCYP17 (14Yang W.H. Lutz L.B. Hammes S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9552-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Fig. 2XeCYP17 has b5-independent and b5-dependent 17,20-lyase activity. Radiolabeled 17-hydroxypregnenolone (A, 17OH-PREG) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (B, 17OH-PROG) were added at concentrations of 4 nm to yeast microsomes containing XeCYP17 with or without Xb5 (2.6 μg/ml). Steroids were extracted at the indicated time points and resolved by TLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Experiments were performed at least three times with nearly identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKinetic parameters of 17α-hydroxylase (H) and 17, 20-lyase (L) activity of XeCYP17 in yeast microsomesXeCYP17KmVmaxnmmin-1Δ4-b5H856 ± 2503.14 ± 0.97L183 ± 480.51 ± 0.11+Xb5H697 ± 1293.07 ± 0.52L313 ± 1191.33 ± 0.41+Hb5H674 ± 1563.85 ± 0.34L151 ± 92.13 ± 0.07Δ5-b5H23 ± 80.20 ± 0.03L634 ± 2830.41 ± 0.12+Xb5H22 ± 20.27 ± 0.03L240 ± 221.96 ± 0.02+Hb5H44 ± 50.40 ± 0.04L332 ± 941.71 ± 0.32 Open table in a new tab Hb5 Enhanced XeCYP17 Lyase Activity but Xb5 Did Not Affect HuCYP17—Since Xb5 enhanced the 17,20-lyase activity of XeCYP17, Hb5 was next examined. The human and Xenopus b5 share ∼55% identity with several conserved regions (Fig. 1A); thus, Hb5 was predicted to be a sufficient cofactor for XeCYP17. As anticipated, Hb5 improved XeCYP17-mediated lyase activity similarly to Xb5, raising the Vmax values by ∼4-fold in both the Δ4 and the Δ5 pathways while having little effect on hydroxylase activities (Table I). These results suggest that the XeCYP17 is promiscuous in its ability to interact with b5 isoforms from other species.Similar studies using the HuCYP17 in yeast microsomes revealed strikingly different results. First, as expected, HuCYP17 mediated very little b5-independent lyase activity in the Δ5 pathway (Vmax = 0.08 min–1) and none in the Δ4 pathway (Table II). Second, Hb5 enhanced the lyase activity of HuCYP17 significantly more than for the XeCYP17-mediated reaction, raising the Vmax value in the Δ5 pathway (17-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA) by ∼9-fold and raising the Vmax value in the Δ4 pathway (17-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione) by an even greater ratio (Table II). Together, these results indicate that, as described previously (10Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the HuCYP17-mediated 17,20-lyase reaction is more dependent on and sensitive to cytochrome b5 than its Xenopus counterpart. Of note, the absolute values of lyase activity, as well as the magnitude of the b5-mediated enhancement of the HuCYP17-mediated 17,20-lyase reactions, were similar to published data, (10Auchus R.J.

Finally, to our surprise, Xb5 did not enhance HuCYP17-mediated lyase activity in either the Δ4 or the Δ5 pathways (Table II), suggesting that HuCYP17 might have more stringent requirements for b5 interactions than XeCYP17.Table IIKinetic parameters of 17,20-lyase activity of HuCYP17 in yeast microsomesHuCYP17KmVmaxnmmin-1Δ4-b5ND< 0.003+Hb5441 ± 1320.13 ± 0.04+Xb5ND< 0.003+H(1-69)Xb5509 ± 990.13 ± 0.03+H(1-50)Xb5660 ± 260.10 ± 0.01+H(1-11)Xb5455 ± 270.04 ± 0.01+X(1-74)Hb5ND< 0.003+X(1-55)Hb5459 ± 60.05 ± 0.01+X(1-16)Hb5322 ± 80.12 ± 0.01Δ5-b5269 ± 750.08 ± 0.01+Hb5338 ± 380.68 ± 0.05+Xb5255 ± 550.10 ± 0.01+H(1-69)Xb5312 ± 650.62 ± 0.07+H(1-50)Xb5257 ± 90.40 ± 0.01+H(1-11)Xb5378 ± 460.11 ± 0.01+X(1-74)Hb5444 ± 1400.10 ± 0.01+X(1-55)Hb5191 ± 130.13 ± 0.01+X(1-16)Hb5173 ± 160.29 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Residues 16–41 of the Hb5 Were Necessary for Its Specific Actions on the HuCYP17—The inability of Xb5 to enhance the HuCYP17-mediated lyase reaction was exploited to determine the regions of Hb5 that were important for its interactions with HuCYP17. Human/Xenopus b5 chimeras were made as represented schematically in Fig. 1C and then expressed in bacteria as described under “Materials and Methods.” Protein purity was qualitatively assessed by gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA system (Pierce). Varying concentrations of human/Xenopus b5 chimeras, as well as the wild-type Xb5 and Hb5, were added to yeast microsomes containing HuCYP17, and the conversion from 17-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione was measured (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, Xb5 did not enhance the lyase activity of HuCYP17 at any concentration, whereas Hb5 up-regulated HuCYP17-mediated lyase activity in a dose-dependent fashion that peaked between 1 and 5 μg/ml Hb5 (Fig. 3A). Substitution of the first 69 amino acids of Hb5 with the cognate 74 amino acids of Xb5 (X(1–74)Hb5) did not increase the lyase activity of HuCYP17 (Fig. 3A, closed squares). A similar chimera containing the first 55 amino acids of Xb5 in place of the cognate region in Hb5 (X(1–55)Hb5) mildly enhanced HuCYP17-mediated lyase activity, although 100-fold more X(1–55)Hb5 relative to Hb5 was needed to reach a still suboptimal maximum level of activity (Fig. 3A, closed triangles). These data suggest that the amino-terminal half of Hb5 might be necessary for regulating HuCYP17-mediated lyase activity.Fig. 3Effects of wild-type and mutant cytochrome b5 proteins on 17,20-lyase activities.A and B, the production of DHEA from [1,2,6,7-3H]17α-hydroxypregnenolone (Δ5 pathway) was measured in yeast microsomes containing 8.7 pmol HuCYP17 (25 μg of microsomes). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with increasing concentrations of the indicated b5 proteins. Steroids were then extracted, and radioactive spots representing 17-hydroxypregneolone and DHEA were counted by liquid scintillation. Activity is plotted as the fold over control (without b5) and was determined by cutting out the radioactive spots and counting them by liquid scintillation.

All experiments were performed at least three times with nearly identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, substitution of the first 16 amino acids of Xb5 for the cognate region in Hb5 (X(1–16)Hb5) enhanced HuCYP17-mediated lyase activity to a maximum induction equal to that regulated by Hb5, although 5-fold more protein was necessary to do so (Fig. 3A, closed circles). Similar substitutions replacing Xb5 regions with the cognate Hb5 sequences revealed that the presence of the first 50 amino acids of Hb5 (H(1–50)Xb5) was sufficient to promote maximum HuCYP17-mediated lyase activity; however, again, 5-fold more protein was necessary to do so (Fig. 3B, closed triangles). In contrast, substitution of the first 11 amino acids of Hb5 into Xb5 (H(1–11)Xb5) did not enhance lyase activity (Fig. 3B, closed circles).Similar results were obtained when examining the effects of the b5 chimeras on the substrate 17-hydroxyprogesterone (Fig. 3, C and D), although the effects were less dramatic due to the known slower rate of the huCYP17-mediated 17,20-lyase rate in the Δ4 pathway (10Auchus R.J.

Furthermore, all of these results were confirmed quantitatively in Table II, using 2.5 μg/ml human, Xenopus, or chimeric b5 proteins. H(1–50)Xb5 enhanced HuCYP17-mediated 17,20-lyase activity similarly to Hb5 in both the Δ4 and the Δ5 pathways, whereas H(1–11)Xb5 only minimally enhanced the lyase reaction. Together, these results indicate that residues 12–50 in the Hb5 are necessary for regulating the lyase activity of HuCYP17. Since the first 4 and last 9 amino acids of this region are identical to those in Xb5, they are less likely to be important for this specificity; thus, the region of specificity can likely be narrowed down to resides 16–41 (Fig. 3A, boxed region).Xb5 Did Not Block Hb5-mediated Lyase Activity of HuCYP17—The residues in region 16–41 of the Hb5 could be specifically regulating HuCYP17 by two possible mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive. First, residues 16–41 might be necessary for Hb5 binding to HuCYP17. Alternatively, residues 16–41 might be important for specifically activating HuCYP17 but not for binding. Competition studies were performed using increasing amounts of Xb5 in the face of a smaller, activating amount of Hb5 (0.2 μg/ml). If Xb5 was binding to the HuCYP17 enzyme but could not promote lyase activity, then the addition of excess Xb5 should have blocked the ability of Hb5 to bind to HuCYP17, thus reducing its activity. In fact, up to 100-fold excess of Xb5 had very little effect on Hb5-mediated lyase activity, confirming t"
