https://openalex.org/W1571844404,"Protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-zeta) is a member of the protein kinase C gene family which using in vitro preparations has been described as being resistant to activation by phorbol esters. PKC-zeta was found to be expressed in several cell types as an 80-kDa protein. In vitro translation of a full-length PKC-zeta construct also yielded as a primary translation product an 80-kDa protein. In the U937 cell, PKC-zeta was slightly more abundant in the cytosol than in the particulate fraction. Acute exposure of U937 cells to tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phorbol dibutyrate, mezerin, or diacylglycerol derivatives did not induce translocation of this isoform to the particulate fraction. Chronic exposure to 1 microM TPA failed to translocate or down-regulate PKC-zeta in U937, HL-60, COS, or HeLa-fibroblast fusion cells. To examine whether PKC-zeta was activated by TPA, PKC activity was evaluated in COS cells transiently over-expressing this isoform. In non-transfected cells, two peaks of phospholipid- and TPA-dependent kinase activity were observed. Eluting at a lower salt concentration was a peak of activity associated with PKC-alpha. PKC-zeta eluted with the second peak of activity and at a higher salt concentration. In transfected cells which expressed PKC-zeta at 4-10-fold over endogenous levels, there was only a slight increase in activity associated with the second peak. The activity and quantity of PKC-zeta did not strictly correlate. Treatment with TPA under conditions that did not alter PKC-zeta content abolished detection of the second peak of PKC activity eluting from the Mono Q column. Thus, PKC-zeta does not translocate or down-regulate in response to phorbol esters or diacylglycerol derivatives. However, for reasons discussed these studies do not resolve the issue of whether this isoform is activated by TPA."
https://openalex.org/W1605340054,"The substrate specificities of human aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase toward trioses, triose phosphates, and related three-carbon aldehydes and ketones were evaluated. Both enzymes are able to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of all of the substrates used. Aldose reductase shows more discrimination among substrates than does aldehyde reductase and is generally the more efficient catalyst. The best substrate for aldose reductase is methylglyoxal (kcat = 142 min-1, kcat/Km = 1.8 x 10(7) M-1 min-1), a toxic 2-oxo-aldehyde that is produced nonenzymatically from triose phosphates and enzymatically from acetone/acetol metabolism. D- and L-glyceraldehyde and D- and L-lactaldehyde are also good substrates for aldose reductase. The aldose reductase-catalyzed reduction of methylglyoxal produces 95% acetol, 5% D-lactaldehyde. Further reduction of acetol produces only L-1,2-propanediol. Acetol and propanediol are two products that accumulate in uncontrolled diabetes. Both acetol and methylglyoxal were compared with glucose for their abilities to produce covalent modification of albumin. All three of these carbonyl compounds reacted with albumin to produce modified proteins with new absorption and emission bands that are spectrally similar. Both methylglyoxal and acetol are much more reactive than glucose. A new integrative model of diabetic complications is proposed that combines the aldose reductase/polyol pathway theory and the nonenzymatic glycation theory except that emphasis is placed both on methylglyoxal/acetol metabolism and on glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1569026702,"The entire nucleotide sequences (6.8 kilobase pairs) of the bphABC genes and their products involved in the initial dioxygenation and ring-meta-cleavage of biphenyls and polychlorinated biphenyls were determined. The first bphA gene starts about a 100 base pairs downstream from the transcriptional initiation site. The bphA region, which encodes a cluster of enzymes including biphenyl dioxygenase catalyzing the initial catabolic step, consists of five open reading frames (ORFs). Five proteins corresponding to these ORFs in the molecular masses were detected by in vitro protein synthesis, of which four ORFs are very similar to the recently reported todC1C2BA genes coding for the corresponding enzymes catalyzing the initial dioxygenation reactions of toluene (Zylstra, G.J., and Gibson, D. T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14940-14946). The third open reading frame (ORF3) of the bphA region, missing its counterpart in the toluene dioxygenase gene cluster, was site-specifically deleted, and the resulting enzymatically active mutant reveals that this ORF3 is not mandatory for the catabolism of biphenyls. Thus the biphenyl degradation pathway and the responsible enzymes/genes are very similar to those of toluene degradation despite their discrete substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1598762088,"The human CD44 cell-surface glycoprotein participates in a wide variety of cell-cell interactions including lymphocyte homing and tumor metastasis. The CD44 antigen is known to display extensive size heterogeneity when compared between different tissue sources although the structural basis for this variation is not yet clear. Recently, two further isotypes in addition to the basic hemopoietic form of the CD44 antigen have been cloned and sequenced and these have been found to contain all or part of a 200-400-base pair insert within the extracellular domain, suggesting that the characteristic heterogeneity in the molecule may be generated by a mechanism of alternative splicing. We have obtained further evidence for alternative splicing, and we report here the cloning and sequencing of six different CD44 sequence variants from a variety of cell lines using a combination of expression cloning and the polymerase chain reaction. Comparison of these variants indicates that each is probably assembled by the insertion of five different exon units in tandem into a discrete site within the membrane proximal region of the extracellular domain. One of the variants contains an exon that shares extensive amino acid sequence homology with a recently described rat CD44 variant that mediates tumor metastasis. Another variant contains a new exon that encodes a tandem repeat of the consensus sequence SG for covalent modification with chondroitin sulfate and is expressed predominantly on mammary tumors. We suggest that a mechanism of alternative exon splicing generates much of the observed structural heterogeneity of CD44 and that the particular set of CD44 variants expressed in a single cell may represent a precise postal code directing the final destination of migrating cells and metastatic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1563504393,"Abstract An 11-kilobase gene region of Streptococcus mutans has been identified which contains eight contiguous genes involved with the uptake and metabolism of multiple sugars (the msm system). Sequence analysis of this region indicates that several of these genes specify proteins with strong homology to components of periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems of Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, this operon is controlled by a regulatory gene (msmR) that acts as a positive effector. The proteins specified by the structural genes of the msm operon include alpha-galactosidase (aga), a periplasmic-like sugar-binding protein (msmE), two membrane proteins (msmF, msmG), sucrose phosphorylase (gtfA), an ATP-binding protein (msmK), and dextran glucosidase (dexB). Insertional inactivation of each of these genes along with uptake data indicate that this system is responsible for the uptake of melibiose, raffinose, and isomaltotriose and the metabolism of melibiose, sucrose, and isomaltosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1813072582,"Type IIA von Willebrand disease (vWD) results from abnormalities in von Willebrand factor (vWF) characterized by absence of plasma high molecular weight (HMW) vWF multimers. In this report, 5 distinct point mutations were identified in 6 Type IIA vWD families. A total of 7 mutations, all clustered within a 124-amino acid segment of the vWF A2 domain, now account for 9 of a panel of 11 Type IIA families. In COS-7 cells, 3 single amino acid substitutions, Val844----Asp, Ser743----Leu, and Gly742----Arg, impaired the transport of vWF multimers between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex, with more profound effects on the secretion of HMW multimers than lower molecular weight forms. In contrast, 2 substitutions, Arg834----Trp and Gly742----Glu, resulted in secretion of HMW multimers similar to wild-type vWF. The vWF structure observed within patient platelets correlated closely with the synthesis pattern seen for the corresponding mutants in COS-7 cells. These findings demonstrate that structural alterations within the A2 domain of vWF can produce the characteristic phenotype of Type IIA vWD via two distinct molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1554043067,"Murine macrophages have previously been shown to secrete a zinc-dependent proteinase that can degrade elastin. In this report, we identify murine macrophage elastase (MME) cDNA and show that it is a distinct member of the metalloproteinase gene family. Small amounts of MME were purified to homogeneity, and N-terminal amino acid sequence was obtained. This sequence was used to obtain a partial cDNA clone by the polymerase chain reaction; a cDNA library derived from a mouse macrophage-like cell line (P388D1) was screened with this probe. A full-length MME cDNA spanning approximately 1.8 kilobases contained an open reading frame of 1386 base pairs; the predicted molecular mass of the MME proenzyme is 53 kDa. The gene encoding MME is represented only once in the mouse genome and is located on chromosome 9. Despite a size that is similar to other metalloproteinases, MME is distinct, sharing only 33-48% amino acid homology with other metalloproteinases. In contrast to other metalloenzymes, MME appears to be rapidly processed to an active truncated form (N-terminal and C-terminal cleavage). We expressed recombinant MME in Escherichia coli and demonstrated that it has significant elastolytic activity that is specifically inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. MME is therefore a true metalloproteinase that may be involved in tissue injury and remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1517788739,"The cloned rat fat pad endothelial cell (RFP-EC) line synthesizes anticoagulantly active heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGact) and anticoagulantly inactive heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGinact), both of which exhibit 25-, 30-, and 50-kDa core proteins of extremely similar structure. The primary sequences of internal peptides obtained from HSPGinact core proteins and the NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the 25-kDa component from the HSPGinact core proteins demonstrate that the 30-kDa component is a previously unidentified species, designated as ryudocan, with the 25-kDa component representing a proteolytic degradation product, while the 50-kDa component is the rat homolog of syndecan (Saunders, S. Jalkanen, M., O'Farrell, S., and Bernfield, M. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 108, 1547-1556). Specific oligonucleotide probes were obtained for ryudocan and syndecan by polymerase chain reaction, and the corresponding cDNAs were isolated from a RFP-EC library. The cDNAs encode type I integral membrane proteins of 202 and 313 amino acids, respectively, which have homologous transmembrane and intracellular domains but very distinct extracellular regions. In particular, ryudocan exhibits only three potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites within the extracellular region while syndecan has five glycosaminoglycan attachment sites within the same domain. Both species are expressed in RFP-EC lines, primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells and primary rat skin fibroblast cells. The levels of ryudocan and syndecan mRNA were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in primary microvascular endothelial cells and closely associated non-endothelial cells isolated by cell sorting. Ryudocan and syndecan mRNAs were abundantly expressed in both populations representing about 0.1-0.5% of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1539630105,"The effect of the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) on the antioxidant reactions of all-trans-beta, beta-carotene (BC) was investigated in a soybean phosphatidylcholine liposome system. Peroxyl radicals generated by thermolysis of azo-bis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) at 37 degrees C initiated lipid peroxidation. BC inhibited lipid peroxidation, which was monitored by conjugated diene formation, by up to 70% versus control at 160 and 15 torr O2. In contrast, at 760 torr O2 the maximum inhibition was approximately 40% versus control and inhibition was less reproducible. Peroxyl radicals oxidized BC to 5,6-epoxy-beta,beta-carotene and several unidentified polar products. The rates of both product formation and BC consumption were significantly higher at 160 torr than at 15 torr O2. However, at 160 and 760 torr O2, the rates of product formation and BC depletion were similar. In liposomes without azo-bis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), BC depletion at 160 torr was only 64% that at 760 torr O2. These results suggest that both radical trapping and autoxidation reactions consume BC and that the latter are accelerated by high pO2. Autoxidation consumes BC without scavenging peroxyl radicals and may attenuate BC antioxidant activity, especially at high pO2. The similarity in its antioxidant effects at 15 and 160 torr O2 suggests that BC could provide antioxidant protection to any tissue within the normal physiologic range of pO2."
https://openalex.org/W1572631706,"We have purified an RNA helicase to near homogeneity from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. The enzyme migrated as a 130-kDa protein upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and exhibited a sedimentation coefficient of 6.4 on glycerol gradient centrifugation. The enzyme translocated in a 3' to 5' direction and acted catalytically, displacing at least a 4-fold molar excess of duplex RNA compared with the enzyme added. All eight common nucleoside triphosphates supported RNA helicase activity at relatively low concentrations (Km in values in the 15-20 microM level). In the presence of RNA and some single-stranded DNAs, the RNA helicase hydrolyzed all nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme displaced deoxyribooligonucleotides provided they were hydrogen-bonded to RNA possessing 3' single-stranded regions, but it did not displace ribooligonucleotides hydrogen-bonded to DNA containing 3' single-stranded regions. The enzyme, in the absence of ATP, binds to both single-stranded RNA and DNA, but the amount of complex formed with RNA was 20-fold greater than the complex formed with DNA. In both cases, the complex formed in the absence of ATP was rapidly reversed by the addition of ATP and not by adenyl-5'-yl (beta,gamma-methylene)-diphosphate. We propose that the enzyme can bind to both single-stranded RNA and DNA and hydrolyze ATP, but by virtue of its greater stability on RNA, the enzyme can only translocate on RNA possessing 3' single-stranded regions."
https://openalex.org/W1602721680,"The role of the hydroxyl group of tyrosine 6 in the catalytic mechanism of isoenzyme 3-3 of rat glutathione S-transferase has been examined by x-ray crystallography and site-specific replacement of the residue with phenylalanine and evaluation of the catalytic properties of the mutant enzyme. This particuar tyrosine residue is conserved in the sequences of all of the cytosolic enzymes and is found, in crystal structures of both isoenzyme 3-3 from the mu-gene class and an isoenzyme from the pi-gene class, to be proximal to the sulfur of glutathione (GSH) or glutathione sulfonate bound at the active site. The 2.2-A structure of the binary complex of isoenzyme 3-3 and GSH indicates that the hydroxyl group of Tyr6 is located 3.2-3.5 A from the sulfur of GSH, well within hydrogen bonding distance. Removal of the hydroxyl group of Tyr6 has essentially no effect on the dissociation constant (22 +/- 3 microM) for GSH. Nevertheless the Y6F mutant exhibits a turnover number which is only about 1% that of the native enzyme when assayed at pH 6.5 with either 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) or 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one. UV difference spectra of the binary enzyme-GSH complexes suggest that the predominant ionization state of GSH in the active site of the Y6F mutant is the neutral thiol (e.g. EY6F.GSH) which is in contrast to the native enzyme in which the thiol is substantially deprotonated (e.g. E.GS-). Spectrophotometric titration suggests that the pKa of the thiol is 6.9 +/- 0.3 in the E.GSH complex and greater than or equal to 8 in the EY6F.GSH binary complex. In addition, the pH dependence of kcat/KmCDNB reveals that the reactions catalyzed by the native enzyme and the Y6F mutant are dependent on a single ionization in the E.GSH and EY6F.GSH complexes with pKa = 6.2 +/- 0.1 and 7.8 +/- 0.3, respectively. The results suggest that the hydrogen bond between Tyr6 and the enzyme-bound nucleophile helps to lower the pKa of GSH in the binary enzyme-substrate complex."
https://openalex.org/W1512706674,"We have isolated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) from cloned rat microvascular endothelial cells using a combination of ion-exchange chromatography, affinity fractionation with antithrombin III (AT III), and gel filtration in denaturing solvents. The anticoagulantly active heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGact) which bind tightly to AT III bear mainly anticoagulantly active heparan sulfate (HSact) whereas the anticoagulantly inactive heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGinact) possess mainly anticoagulantly inactive heparan sulfate (HSinact). HSact and HSinact were also isolated by a combination of ion-exchange chromatography, treatment with protease and chondroitin ABC lyase, and affinity fractionation with AT III. HSact and HSinact have molecular sizes of about 25-30 kDa with the same overall composition of monosaccharides except that HSact exhibits about nine glucuronsyl 3-O-sulfated glucosamines/chain whereas HSinact possesses about three glucuronsyl 3-O-sulfated glucosamines/chain. Direct isolation of the AT III-binding site of HSact by exposing carbohydrate chains to Flavobacterium heparitinase in the presence of protease inhibitor revealed only a single interaction site which contained two to three glucuronsyl 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues. The core proteins of HSPGact and HSPGinact were isolated by treatment with Flavobacterium heparitinase and purification by ion-exchange chromatography. The molecular sizes of the core proteins were established by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and their primary structures were examined by cleavage with trypsin or endopeptidase Glu-C as well as separation of peptides by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that both sets of core proteins exhibited three major components with molecular sizes of 50, 30, and 25 kDa, respectively. The 25-kDa species appears to be a proteolytic degradation product of the 30-kDa species. The peptide mapping revealed that HSPGact and HSPGinact possess extremely similar core proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1492596019,"Growth hormone (GH) influences a number of tissue-specific biological activities in diverse cell types. However, little is known about the biochemical pathway by which the signal initiated by GH binding to its cell-surface receptor is transduced. The GH receptor has been reported to be phosphorylated on tyrosine in 3T3-F442A cells, a cell line in which GH promotes differentiation and inhibits mitogen-stimulated growth; however, it is not known whether tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in GH signal transduction. We report that GH treatment of 3T3-F442A cells resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of at least four proteins. These included 42- (pp42) and 45-kDa (pp45) proteins immunologically related to ERK1 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1), a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to mitogens. Prolonged phorbol ester pretreatment attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp42 and pp45 in platelet-derived growth factor-treated cells, but not in GH-treated cells. Maximal GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp42 and pp45 coincided with peak levels of a 42-kDa renaturable MBP kinase activity in lysates of GH-treated cells resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The observation that multiple cellular proteins are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to physiological concentrations of GH suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in GH signal transduction. Moreover, the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK-related proteins by GH suggests that mitogens and nonmitogens may employ common phosphotyrosyl proteins in the activation of ultimately distinct cellular programs."
https://openalex.org/W1571992686,"A library of mutants of the catalytic subunit of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cAMP-dependent protein kinase was screened in vitro for mutants defective in the recognition of the regulatory subunit. The mutations identified were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the mouse catalytic subunit with a peptide inhibitor. Mutations defective in the recognition of both the regulatory subunit and the peptide substrate Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) mapped to the peptide-binding site shared by all substrates and inhibitors of the catalytic subunit and functionally define the binding site for the autoinhibitor sequence in the hinge region of the regulatory subunit. Mutants defective only in the recognition of the regulatory subunit identified residues that comprise additional binding sites for the regulatory subunit. The majority of these residues are clustered on the surface of the catalytic subunit in a region flanking the distal portion of the autoinhibitor/peptide-binding site. The simultaneous substitution of Lys233, Asp237, Lys257, and Lys261 in this region caused a 260-fold decrease in affinity for the regulatory subunit, whereas the catalytic efficiency toward Kemptide decreased by only 1.8-fold. The substitution of autophosphorylated Thr241, also in this region, and the 3 residues interacting with the phosphate also caused an unregulated phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1837186493,"Intron and 5'-flanking regions of the androgen-regulated C3 subunit gene contain potential cis-acting transcription control sequences including several 15-base pair (bp) partial palindromes resembling response elements for glucocorticoid (GRE) and progesterone (PRE) receptors. Specific DNA binding of the androgen receptor (AR) and androgen-dependent activation of transcription indicate that some of these GRE/PRE-like sequences are capable of functioning as androgen response elements (ARE). A 0.3-kilobase pair (kbp) 5'-flanking fragment including the promoter region contains one such sequence (element A) and a 0.5-kbp region of the first intron contains two sequences (elements B and C). Androgen-dependent enhancement of transcription was assayed by cotransfection of CV1 cells with a rat AR expression vector, pCMVrAR, and C3 genomic fragments or synthetic elements cloned into the reporter vector ptkCAT. Enhancement of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity with the 0.5-kbp first intron fragment was 16 +/- 4-fold, while with the 0.3-kbp 5'-flanking fragment no response was detected and element C alone was greater than B or A. Binding of AR in the mobility shift assay correlated with androgen-dependent enhancement of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. The intensity of transcriptional enhancement with the 0.5-kbp intron fragment suggested that other regulatory sequences within this intron region potentiated the ARE activities of elements B and C. ARE activity of the strongest C3 gene response element (C) was similar to that of a potent GRE (element M) of the mouse mammary tumor virus gene."
https://openalex.org/W1533664250,"Plant protoporphyrinogen oxidase is of particular interest since it is the last enzyme of the common branch for chlorophyll and heme biosynthetic pathways. In addition, it is the target enzyme for diphenyl ether-type herbicides, such as acifluorfen. Two distinct methods were used to investigate the localization of this enzyme within Percoll-purified spinach chloroplasts. We first assayed the enzymatic activity by spectrofluorimetry and we analyzed the specific binding of the herbicide acifluorfen, using highly purified chloroplast fractions. The results obtained give clear evidence that chloroplast protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity is membrane-bound and is associated with both chloroplast membranes, i.e. envelope and thylakoids. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase specific activity was 7-8 times higher in envelope membranes than in thylakoids, in good agreement with the number of [3H]acifluorfen binding sites in each membrane system: 21 and 3 pmol/mg protein, respectively, in envelope membranes and thylakoids. On a total activity basis, 25% of protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity were associated with envelope membranes. The presence of protoporphyrinogen oxidase in chloroplast envelope membranes provides further evidence for a role of this membrane system in chlorophyll biosynthesis. In contrast, the physiological significance of the enzyme associated with thylakoids is still unknown, but it is possible that thylakoid protoporphyrinogen oxidase could be involved in heme biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1526463044,"Factor VIIa is a plasma glycoprotein which, when bound to the integral membrane glycoprotein tissue factor, forms an enzymatic complex that is essential for normal hemostasis. We have developed a fluorescent substrate (6-(Mes-D-Leu-Gly-Arg)amino-1-naphthalenediethylsulfamide) which can be used to directly measure the enzymatic activity of factor VIIa in the presence and absence of tissue factor and phospholipid. The sensitivity of this substrate allows for detection of factor VIIa at concentrations below 10(-9) M. The kinetics of substrate hydrolysis by factor VIIa were evaluated and it was observed that the binding of factor VIIa to tissue factor increases the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of factor VIIa substrate hydrolysis greater than 100-fold. The increase in enzymatic efficiency of factor VIIa, when complexed to tissue factor, is mediated primarily by an increase in kcat. These data suggest that tissue factor induces an alteration in the catalytic site of factor VIIa, which allows for more efficient hydrolysis of the small fluorescent substrate. Measurements conducted using various phospholipids and detergents demonstrated that the increase in catalytic efficiency of factor VIIa, when complexed to tissue factor, is independent of the supporting surface. The differential rate of substrate hydrolysis when factor VIIa is complexed to tissue factor was used to estimate the binding of factor VIIa to tissue factor. From these data an apparent dissociation constant for factor VIIa binding to tissue factor was calculated to be between 1.1 and 2.1 nM with a binding stoichiometry of 1.04:1 (factor VIIa:tissue factor). When the reactivity of this small fluorescent substrate toward single-chain factor VII was investigated, both in the presence and absence of tissue factor, no substrate hydrolysis was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1536231102,"We have isolated clones of an established cell line which express defects in intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Chinese hamster ovary cells were mutagenized, and clones unable to mobilize low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol to the plasma membrane were selected. Biochemical analysis of two mutant clones revealed a phenotype characteristic of the lysosomal storage disease, Niemann-Pick type C. The mutant cell lines were found to be defective in the regulatory responses elicited by LDL-derived cholesterol. LDL-mediated stimulation of cholesterol esterification was grossly defective, and LDL suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was impaired. However, the mutants modulated these activities normally in response to 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonate. The LDL-specific defects were predicated by the inability of these mutants to mobilize LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes. Cell fractionation studies showed that LDL-derived, unesterified cholesterol accumulated in the lysosomes of mutant cells to significantly higher levels than normal, commensurate with defective movement of cholesterol to other cellular membranes. Characterization of cell lines defective in intracellular cholesterol transport will facilitate identification of the gene(s) required for intracellular cholesterol movement and regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1558484175,"The transforming abl proteins p160gag-abl, p185bcr-abl, and p210bcr-abl and the normal protein p140c-abl have identical catalytic sites, but differ in their N-terminal domains. Previous studies have indicated that the transforming abl proteins possess higher tyrosine kinase activity than the normal abl proto-oncogene product. In the present study, we demonstrate that two transforming abl proteins, p210bcr-abl and p160gag-abl, exhibit a higher affinity toward ATP and synthetic tyrosine containing substrates than p140c-abl. Furthermore, protein tyrosine kinase blockers from the tyrphostin family can discriminate between normal abl and transforming abl proteins of both human and mouse origin. These results suggest that the transforming potency of the abl proteins may result from their higher affinities toward intracellular signal transducers and demonstrate for the first time that oncogene products can differ from their homologous proto-oncogene product in substrate specificity. The ability of tyrphostins to discriminate between normal and transforming abl proteins suggests that it may be possible to design specific abl kinase inhibitors to combat abl-associated human leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W1523950365,"Abstract cAMP receptors mediate signal transduction pathways during development in Dictyostelium. A cAMP receptor (cAR1) has been cloned and sequenced (Klein, P., Sun, T. J., Saxe, C. L., Kimmel, A. R., Johnson, R. L., and Devreotes, P. N. (1988) Science 241, 1467-1472) and recently several other cAR genes have been identified (Saxe, C. L., Johnson, R., Devreotes, P. N., and Kimmel, A. R. (1991a) Dev. Genet. 12, 6-13; Saxe, C. L., Johnson, R. L., Devreotes, P. N., and Kimmel, A. R. (1991b) Genes Dev. 5, 1-8). We have expressed three receptor subtypes, cAR1, cAR2, and cAR3, in growing cells and have investigated their affinity and pharmacological specificity in a series of [3H]cAMP binding studies. In phosphate buffer, there were two affinity states of about 30 and 300 nM for cAR1 and 20 and 500 nM for cAR3 but no detectable affinity for cAR2. In the presence of 3 M ammonium sulfate, there was one affinity state of 4 nM for cAR1 and 11 nM for cAR2 and two affinity states of approximately 4 and 200 nM for cAR3. The relative affinities of 14 cyclic nucleotide derivatives were tested for each cAR in ammonium sulfate. These studies suggest a model (Van Haastert, P. J. M., and Kien, E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9636-9642) in which cAMP binds to all three receptor subtypes by maintaining hydrogen bond interactions at the N6 and O3' positions. Interactions at the exocyclic oxygens of cAMP varied between the receptors; cAR2 and cAR3 lacked a stereoselective interaction at the axial oxygen which was present in cAR1. The cleft, which binds the adenine ring of cAMP, was hydrophobic in cAR1 and cAR3 but relatively polar in cAR2. The analog specificity of cAR1 and cAR3 in phosphate buffer was similar to that measured in ammonium sulfate though the derivatives' relative affinity to cAMP was reduced. We conclude that these cAMP receptor subtypes can be distinguished by distinct pharmacological properties which will allow selective activation of each cAR during development."
https://openalex.org/W1574152255,"The cysteine proteinase rat cathepsin B was expressed in yeast in an active form and was found to be heterogeneously glycosylated at the consensus sequence for N-linked oligosaccharide substitution. Purified enzyme fractions containing the highest levels of glycosylation were shown to have reduced activity. A glycosylation minus mutant constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (by changing the Ser to Ala in the consensus sequence) was still secreted by the yeast and was shown to be functionally identical with purified rat liver cathepsin B. Recombinant cathepsin B was used to further characterize the pH dependence of cathepsin B-catalyzed hydrolyses using 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) and p-nitroaniline (pNA) substrates with arginine as the P1, and either arginine or phenylalanine as the P2 residue. The AMC and pNA groups give insights into the leaving group binding site (P') of cathepsin B. These studies show for the first time that at least seven dissociable groups are involved in substrate binding and hydrolysis in cathepsin B activity. Two of these groups, with pKa values of 6.9 and 7.7 in the recombinant enzyme, are in the leaving group binding site and are most likely His110 and His111. The same groups in rat liver cathepsin B have higher pKa values than in recombinant cathepsin B, but have identical function in the two enzymes. Two other groups are probably the active site Cys29 and His199 with pKa values of 3.6 and 8.6, respectively. A group with a pKa of 5.1 interacts with substrates containing Arg at P2, and the group is most likely Glu245. The remaining two groups, one with a pKa of about 4.9 and the other about 5.3, are most likely carboxyl residues possibly interacting with Arg at P1 in the substrate. The possible candidates on the basis of the x-ray structure are Asp22, Asp69, Glu171, and Glu122, all found within a 13 A radius from the active site thiol of Cys29."
https://openalex.org/W112756771,"Efflux of [14C]cholesterol from various cells was monitored in the presence of discoidal complexes of egg phosphatidylcholine and purified apolipoproteins, containing either apoAI, AII, or Cs. Particles containing apoAI were more efficient acceptors than those containing apoAII or Cs when the donor cells were J774 macrophages. No differences were observed when the same acceptor preparations were exposed to Fu5AH rat hepatoma or rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. The differential efficiency of apolipoproteins in stimulating cholesterol removal from J774 cells was maintained in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction isolated from the same cells. Nonlinear regression analysis of kinetic data obtained from J774 cells exposed to apoAI complexes indicated that cholesterol efflux was best fitted to a curve describing the release from two kinetic compartments. Approximately 10% of cholesterol was transferred from a rapidly exchangeable pool with a t1/2 ranging between 1.5 and 3 h, and the remaining fraction was released from a slower pool with a t1/2 of about 20 h. Modulation of cholesterol efflux from J774 cells by either varying the concentration or the apolipoprotein composition of the acceptors influenced the size of the pools and the t1/2 of the slow pool. Kinetics of cholesterol efflux from membranes isolated from J774 cells also best fit a two-compartment model and modification of the apolipoprotein composition of the acceptor induced a pattern of changes in pool size and half-time similar to that described for whole cells. In the three cell lines studied, we consistently resolved a slow pool with a half-time ranging between 15 and 20 h. In smooth muscle cells only the slow pool was evident, whereas in Fu5AH a very large fast pool was also resolved. In contrast to J774 cells, apolipoprotein composition of the acceptor did not influence the pools in these two cell lines. These results led us to propose a new model regarding the influence of multiple kinetic pools of cholesterol on the regulation of cholesterol desorption from the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1569900298,"The membrane-bound form of aminopeptidase P (aminoacylprolyl-peptide hydrolase) (EC 3.4.11.9) was purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine lung microsomes. The enzyme was solubilized using phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Bacillus thuringiensis), indicating that bovine lung amino-peptidase P is attached to membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The enzyme was purified 1900-fold with a yield of 25% by chromatography on decyl-agarose, omega-aminodecyl-agarose, a second decylagarose column, DEAE-Sephacel, and an ultrafiltration step. Native gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single stained protein band whose position in the gel corresponded to cleavage of the Arg1-Pro2 bond of bradykinin. The Mr was 360,000 by gel permeation chromatography and 95,000 by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The substrate specificity of aminopeptidase P was determined using approximately 50 peptides with proline in the second position. The enzyme could hydrolyze lower NH2-terminal homologs of bradykinin, including Arg-Pro-Pro, which was used as the routine substrate in a rapid fluorescence assay performed in the absence of added Mn2+. Some peptides having NH2-terminal amino acids other than arginine were also cleaved. Aminopeptidase P appeared to favor peptides that had 2 proline residues or proline analogs in positions 2 and 3 of the substrate. In general, tripeptides having a single proline residue in position 2 were poor substrates. Aminopeptidase P was inhibited by a series of peptides, 3-8 residues long, having an NH2-terminal Pro-Pro sequence. The enzyme was also inhibited by metal-chelating agents, 2-mercaptoethanol (4 mM), p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, and NaCl at concentrations greater than or equal to 0.25 M. The purified enzyme had a pH optimum of 6.5-7.0 and was most stable in the basic pH range. A role for membrane-bound aminopeptidase P in the pulmonary inactivation of circulating bradykinin is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1517316308,"Previously we have shown that bovine vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) express c-myb mRNA (Reilly, C. F., Kindy, M. S., Brown, K. E., Rosenberg, R. D., and Sonenshein, G. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6990-6995). Here we have characterized changes in the low level of c-myb mRNA expressed in quiescent serum-deprived subconfluent SMCs upon entry into the cell cycle. After serum stimulation, levels of c-myb mRNA increased 3-4-fold during late G1 and remained at this level during S phase. A 1.5-kilobase partial c-myb cDNA clone, isolated from a bovine SMC library, was partially sequenced and found to be 89 and 85% homologous to the human and murine c-myb genes, respectively. Using bovine and murine c-myb clones, no change in the rate of c-myb gene transcription or mRNA stability was detected during the cell cycle. Thus, the regulation of changes in c-myb mRNA levels in SMCs appears distinct from mechanisms seen in hematopoietic or fibroblastic cells. Vectors containing myb binding sites linked to the thymidine kinase promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene were transiently transfected into SMC cultures. KHK-CAT-dAX, which contains nine concatenated myb binding sites, exhibited 7-fold more activity than the parental dAX-TK-CAT vector in exponentially growing SMCs. The levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in exponentially growing cells were approximately 2-fold higher than in cells that had been serum deprived for 24 h and were entering quiescence. Thus SMCs produce a functional c-myb protein that can activate transcription from a heterologous promoter. Furthermore, introduction of antisense c-myb oligonucleotides to quiescent serum-deprived SMC cultures severely inhibited entry of cells into S phase upon serum addition. Thus, expression of the c-myb oncogene plays an important role in cell cycle progression of SMCs."
https://openalex.org/W1917364401,"We show here that yeast tRNA ligase protein is essential in the cell and participates in joining together tRNA half-molecules resulting from excision of the intron by the splicing endonuclease. A haploid yeast strain carrying a chromosomal deletion of the ligase gene is viable only if ligase protein can be supplied from a plasmid copy of the gene. When synthesis of the plasmid-borne ligase gene is repressed, cells eventually die and accumulate endonuclease cut but unligated half-molecules and intervening sequences. Half-molecules that accumulate appear to be fully end-processed. Two temperature-sensitive ligase mutant strains have been isolated; these strains accumulate a similar set of unligated half-molecules at the nonpermissive temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1577486449,"The murine blk gene, which encodes a B-lymphoid-specific tyrosine kinase of the Src family (p55blk), contains 13 exons that span more than 30 kilobases of DNA on chromosome 14. In the first three exons, which encode the 5'-untranslated region and N-terminal amino acid sequence unique to p55blk, the blk gene differs from other members of the src family; in the last 10 exons, the organization of the blk gene is similar to that of other src genes. By primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analyses, we show that blk transcripts initiate from four major sites at the 5'-flank of blk; two sites predominate. The resulting transcripts differ only in the lengths of their 5'-untranslated sequences and encode identical proteins. None of the transcriptional start sites are preceded by consensus TATA elements, AT-rich elements, or extensive GC-rich regions. Expression of blk is regulated during B-cell development: blk RNA is expressed in all pro-B-, pre-B-, and mature B-cell lines examined, but is absent from plasma cell lines. Immunolocalization of p55blk in normal mouse spleen supports these observations: staining is restricted to lymphocytes and is concentrated in regions rich in B-cells; plasma cells and stromal cells are not stained with anti-Blk antibodies. Assays for RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei indicate that the lineage and developmental stage specificities of blk expression are regulated at least in part by changes in its rate of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1556804002,"12 carboxyl residues of the Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelD were mutated to alanine. The specific activity of five of the mutated proteins was 1% or less that of wild type. The Ca2+ binding isotherms of these five were similar to those of wild type CelD, consistent with the fact that none of the mutated residues is observed to be directly involved in Ca2+ binding in the three-dimensional structure of the protein (Juy, M., Anit, A. G., Alzuri, P. M., Poljak, R. J., Claeyssens, M., Beguin, P., and Aubert, J.-P., manuscript in preparation) and suggesting that the mutations did not result in gross alterations of the tertiary structure. Analysis of the physico-chemical and enzymatic properties of the five purified mutated proteins and consideration of their position in the three-dimensional structure suggest that carboxyl groups identified may play roles as a general acid catalyst and a source of negative charge in stabilizing a carbonium ion intermediate. Among mutated residues, Glu-555 appears as the most likely candidate for participating in the catalytic mechanism of endoglucanase CelD."
https://openalex.org/W1579312266,"Kinetic analyses of tRNA binding to the ribosome and of the translocation reaction showed the following results. 1) The activation energy for the P site binding of AcPhe-tRNA to poly(U)-programmed ribosomes is relatively high (Ea = 72 kJ mol-1; 15 mM Mg2+). If only the P site is occupied with deacylated tRNA(Phe), then the E site can be filled more easily with tRNA(Phe) (no activation energy measurable) than the A site with AcPhe-tRNA (Ea = 47 kJ mol-1; 15 mM Mg2+). 2) A ribosome with blocked P and E sites represents a standard state of the elongation cycle, in contrast to a ribosome with only a filled P site. The two states differ in that AcPhe-tRNA binding to the A site of a ribosome with prefilled P and E sites requires much higher activation energy (87 versus 47 kJ mol-1). The latter reaction simulates the allosteric transition from the post- to the pretranslocational state, whereby the tRNA(Phe) is released from the E site upon occupation of the A site (Rheinberger, H.-J., and Nierhaus, K. H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9133-9139). The reversed transition from the pre- to the posttranslocational state (translocation reaction) requires about the same activation energy (90 kJ mol-1). 3) Both elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G drastically reduce the respective activation energies. 4) The rate of the A site occupation is slower than the rate of translocation in the presence of the respective elongation factors. The data suggest that the A site occupation rather than, as generally assumed, the translocation reaction is the rate-limiting step of the elongation cycle."

Although both enzymes utilize a serine protease-like catalytic triad, they differ in the topological position of the acid. We speculate that these proteins are evolutionarily related and that the pancreatic lipase is an evolutionary intermediate in the pathway of migration of the catalytic acid to a new position within the fold."
https://openalex.org/W1892783347,"We have established testis-specific in vitro transcription of the mouse protamine 1 (MP1) gene using rat testis nuclear extracts. Addition of testis nuclear extracts to brain extracts enhanced transcription from the MP1 upstream sequence-carrying adenovirus major late promoter. Moreover, the MP1 upstream region from positions -92 to -41 alone exhibited transcriptional activation in a tissue-specific manner. DNase I footprinting demonstrated the presence of a DNA-binding factor around position -60 (Tet-1) in testis nuclear extracts, but not in other tissues. Gel shift analysis also revealed the presence of testis-specific Tet-1. Since mutational analysis in transcriptional and binding assays demonstrates that the Tet-1 site is responsible for transcriptional activation, we suggest that Tet-1 is a novel tissue-specific trans-acting factor. The Tet-1-recognizing sequence was delineated to the 11-mer TGACTTCATAA at position -64. Although the first 8-mer in the Tet-1 11-mer shares homology with the cyclic AMP-responsive element, Tet-1 is demonstrated to be distinct from known cAMP-responsive element-binding factors."
https://openalex.org/W1580190049,"Association constants for tRNA binding to poly(U) programmed ribosomes were assessed under standardized conditions with a single preparation of ribosomes, tRNAs, and elongation factors, respectively, at 15 and 10 mM Mg2+. Association constants were determined by Scatchard plot analysis (the constants are given in units of [10(7)/M] measured at 15 mM Mg2+): the ternary complex Phe-tRNA.elongation factor EF-Tu.GTP (12 +/- 3), Phe-tRNA (1 +/- 0.4), AcPhe-tRNA (0.7 +/- 0.3), and deacylated tRNA(Phe) (0.4 +/- 0.15) bind with decreasing affinity to the A site of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes. tRNA(Phe) (7.2 +/- 0.8) binds to the P site with higher affinity than AcPhe-tRNA (3.7 +/- 1.3). The affinity of the E site for deacylated tRNA(Phe) (1 +/- 0.2) is about the same as that of the A site for AcPhe-tRNA (0.7 +/- 0.3). At lower Mg2+ concentrations the affinity of the E site ligand becomes stronger relative to the affinities of the A site ligands. Phe-tRNA and ternary complexes can occupy the A site at 0 degrees C in the presence of poly(U) even if the P site is free, whereas, as already known, deacylated tRNA or AcPhe-tRNA bind first to the P site of programmed ribosomes. Hill plot analyses of the binding data confirm an allosteric linkage between A and E sites in the sense of a negative cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W1514710171,"Previous studies in many cell lines have shown that Brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits the forward movement of newly synthesized glycoconjugates by fusing the cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi compartments with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Studies on the oligosaccharide processing of individual glycoproteins have yielded confusing and incomplete results regarding the location of the block. Assuming that all glycoproteins with N-linked oligosaccharides follow the same endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi pathway, a more complete picture on the location and nature of the block can be determined by analyzing N-linked oligosaccharides synthesized in the presence of BFA. In bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, BFA (0.1 microgram/ml) reversibly inhibits the secretion of greater than 95% of Tran35S and [3H]Man-labeled glycoproteins without affecting protein synthesis or N-linked glycosylation. In addition, BFA inhibits the synthesis and secretion of 35SO4-labeled oligosaccharides. Initial oligosaccharide trimming is uninhibited, but further processing is affected since the majority (65%) of the chains terminate only in beta-GlcNAc residues. Concomitantly, the proportion of [3H]Man-labeled N-linked anionic oligosaccharides is reduced from 60 to 20%, and the great majority of the charge is due to one sialic acid. The rate-limiting step for sialylation appears to be the branch selective addition of beta-Gal residues. The remaining charge is due to sulfate esters (0.6%) which normally account for greater than 10% of the anionic substituents. BFA also reduces the amount of phosphorylated chains by 80% and greatly diminishes further phosphodiester processing since the majority of these oligosaccharides (60%) contain a Man-6-PO4 residue in an acid-sensitive diester linkage. The addition of all polylactosamine chains, outer-branch fucose and terminal alpha-Gal residues are completely inhibited by BFA. Secretion, fucosylation, and sialylation are completely restored when BFA is removed, but the other modification steps are only partially restored. Our results indicate that addition of sulfate esters, terminal alpha-Gal residues, polylactosamine chains, outer-branch fucose residues, some initial phosphorylation, and most phosphodiester processing may occur beyond a compartment where some beta-Gal and sialic acid residues can be added. Essentially, all of the effects on oligosaccharide processing are partially or completely reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1528639851,"The COOH-terminal tail domain of the neurofilament polypeptide M from rat nervous tissue contains approximately six molecules of phosphate. We report here that protein kinases in a crude cytoskeleton preparation of rat nervous tissue phosphorylated a set of tryptic peptides of M similar (but not identical) to those phosphorylated by living dorsal root ganglion cells in culture. Using these phosphopeptides as markers, we purified these same peptides from rat spinal cord and identified six specific phosphorylation sites in M by enzymatic and chemical criteria. These sites, serines 502, 506, 536, 606, 608, and 666, are all located in the COOH-terminal tail domain. Four are embedded in the repeated motif KSP whereas two are within variants of this motif, KSD and ESP. All of the sites that were preceded by lysine were resistant to alkaline phosphatase prior to modification of the lysine with citraconic anhydride. The identification of these sites should aid in investigations of the function of the phosphorylation of this protein and provides criteria for identifying the relevant kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2141898517,"We have recently characterized two types of rat 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4 isomerase (3 beta-HSD) isoenzymes expressed in adrenals and gonads. In addition, we have cloned a third type of cDNA encoding a predicted type III 3 beta-HSD protein specifically expressed in the male rat liver which shares 80% similarity with the two other isoenzymes. Transient expression in human HeLa cells of the cDNAs reveals that the type III 3 beta-HSD protein does not display oxidative activity for the classical substrates of 3 beta-HSD, in contrast to the type I 3 beta-HSD isoenzyme. However, in the presence of NADH, type III isoenzyme, in common with the type I isoform, converts 5 alpha-androstane-3,17-dione (A-dione) and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to the corresponding 3 beta-hydroxysteroids. In fact, the type I and the type III isoenzymes have the same affinity for DHT with Km values of 5.05 and 6.16 microM, respectively. When NADPH is used as cofactor, the affinity for DHT of the type III isoform becomes higher than that of the type I isoform with Km values of 0.12 and 1.18 microM, respectively. The type III isoform is thus a 3-ketoreductase using NADPH as preferred cofactor which is responsible for the conversion of 3-keto-saturated steroids such as DHT and A-dione into less active steroids."

In the micromolar concentration range, the enzyme:inhibitor binding stoichiometry is still 1:1 for elastase but shifts to 2:1 for the three other proteinases. These data could be confirmed by three nonenzymatic methods: (i) fluorescence anisotropy measurements of mixtures of proteinases with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylated or fluoresceinylated MPI, (ii) absorption spectrocospy of fluorescein-MPI-proteinase complexes isolated by gel filtration, (iii) analytical ultracentrifugation which showed that the molecular mass of the MPI-chymotrypsin complex is 56 kDa, whereas that of the MPI-elastase complex is 39 kDa. The binary MPI-elastase complex is unable to inhibit trypsin or cathepsin G. On the other hand, 1 mol of elastase displaces 2 mol of trypsin or cathepsin G from their ternary complexes with MPI."
https://openalex.org/W1539279552,"On the basis of the molecular evolution of hen egg white, human, and turkey lysozymes, three replacements (Trp62 with Tyr, Asn37 with Gly, and Asp101 with Gly) were introduced into the active-site cleft of hen egg white lysozyme by site-directed mutagenesis. The replacement of Trp62 with Tyr led to enhanced bacteriolytic activity at pH 6.2 and a lower binding constant for chitotriose. The fluorescence spectral properties of this mutant hen egg white lysozyme were found to be similar to those of human lysozyme, which contains Tyr at position 62. The replacement of Asn37 with Gly had little effect on the enzymatic activity and binding constant for chitotriose. However, the combination of Asn37—-Gly (N37G) replacement with Asp101—-Gly (D101G) and Trp62—-Tyr (W62Y) conversions enhanced bacteriolytic activity much more than each single mutation and restored hydrolytic activity toward glycol chitin. Consequently, the mutant lysozyme containing triple replacements (N37G, W62Y, and D101G) showed about 3-fold higher bacteriolytic activity than the wild-type hen lysozyme at pH 6.2, which is close to the optimum pH of the wild-type enzyme."

SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme reveals a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 43,000. The protein is basic, with an isoelectric point between 7.6-8.0. Its Stokes radius of 22 A and its sedimentation coefficient of 4.1 S suggest a native molecular weight of 38,000, indicating that the protein is a monomer under our experimental conditions. Western blots and immunoprecipitations of crude extracts reveal a cross-reacting protein of 48 kDa, suggesting that the purified enzyme may be an enzymatically active proteolytic product. The mitochondrial origin of the polymerase was confirmed by cell fractionation. Our results indicate that the C. fasciculata enzyme may be among the smallest known mitochondrial polymerases."

U.S.A. 86, 4833-4837) of DNAs containing extra or bulged bases on one of the two strands of a duplex showed that they exhibit slower electrophoretic mobility than non-bulged DNAs, indicating that bulges create stiff kinks in the DNA. Here we paired a 97-base single-stranded DNA from the intact cystic fibrosis (CF) gene with a complementary 94-base strand containing a central 3-base deletion (delta F508), common to many CF patients. This produced a 94-base pair DNA with a central 3-base bulge. Visualization of these DNAs by electron microscopy showed that twice as many bulge-containing DNAs had a central kink as compared with the non-bulged controls. Examination of the distribution of kinking angles showed that the bulged population contained 5-7-fold more molecules with a central kink of 80 +/- 10 degrees than did the control molecules. When the 3-base bulge was replaced by a 3-base gap, the resulting duplex DNA showed central kinks with a somewhat lower frequency but greater range of kinking angles."
https://openalex.org/W5631094,"A mutant human lysozyme C77/95A, in which Cys77 and Cys95 are replaced with alanine, has been characterized by 8-fold greater secretion in yeast (Taniyama, Y., Yamamoto, Y., Nakao, M., Kikuchi, M., and Ikehara, M. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 152, 962-967) and almost the same three-dimensional structure as wild-type human lysozyme (Inaka, K., Taniyama, Y., Kikuchi, M., Morikawa, K., and Matsushima, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12599-12603). To clarify the molecular features of C77/95A and the reason for its increased secretion in yeast, the stabilities of the mutant C77/95A and the wild-type proteins were examined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation, and the unfolding-refolding kinetics were determined from circular dichroism and fluorescence stopped-flow measurements. Equilibrium experiments showed that the delta G of unfolding of C77/95A in water was 5.8 kcal/mol less stable than that of the wild-type protein at pH 4.0 and 10 degrees C. The unfolding rate of C77/95A was 4 orders of magnitude faster than that of the wild-type protein whereas the two proteins shared similar refolding rates. The slowly refolding phase of the wild-type protein disappeared in C77/95A, indicating that the disulfide bond affects this phase. These observations show that the disulfide bond Cys77-Cys95 contributes to the stabilization of the folded form of human lysozyme by suppressing the unfolding rate and that the increase in the unfolding rate, or the disappearance of the slowly refolding phase in vitro, could correlate with the increase in secretion efficiency in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1603254979,"The coding sequence for the human transferrin receptor gene has been mutated in order to abolish the attachment of the oligosaccharide closest to the transmembrane sequence. Expression of the mutant receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted, after analysis under nonreducing conditions, in an 85- and a 73-kDa receptor species. After reduction, the 85-kDa receptors were mostly converted to 73 kDa, although with short labeling periods some 85-kDa receptor remained suggesting that the mutated gene was capable of coding for the entire polypeptide which was then proteolytically processed. This was supported by in vitro translation of mRNA from either wild type or mutant cells which in both cases yielded an 80-kDa protein, the full size of the nonglycosylated protein. The solubility characteristics of the mutant receptor suggest that it contains the COOH-terminal extracellular domain but not the transmembrane sequence. This is supported by the endoglycosidase H sensitivity of the 73-kDa protein which is compatible with the retention of two of the original three high mannose oligosaccharides. The receptor that lacks one oligosaccharide is unable to form intermonomer disulfide bridges or to migrate to the cell surface and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum where it is further degraded after a lag period of about 30 min."
https://openalex.org/W1531895753,"Brain spectrin alpha and beta chains bind 45Ca2+, as shown by the calcium overlay method. Flow dialysis measurements revealed eight high affinity binding sites/tetramer that comprise two binding components (determined by nonlinear regression analysis). The first component has one or two sites (kd = 2-30 x 10(-8) M), depending on the ionic strength of the binding buffer, with the remaining high affinity sites in the second component (kd = 1-3 x 10(-6) M). In addition, there is a variable, low affinity binding component (n = 100-400, kd = 1-2 x 10(-4) M). Magnesium inhibits calcium binding to the low affinity sites with a K1 = 1.21 mM. Proteolytic fragments from trypsin or chymotrypsin digests of brain spectrin bind 45Ca2+ if they include alpha domain IV, alpha domain III, or the amino-terminal half of the beta chain (but more than 25 kDa from the amino-terminal). These data suggest that calcium ions bind with high affinity to the putative EF-hands in alpha domain IV and to one site in the amino-terminal half of the beta chain that is associated with alpha domain IV in the native dimer. The localization is consistent with a direct calcium modulation of the spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 interaction. In addition, there appears to be one high affinity site near the hypersensitive region of alpha brain spectrin. All four proposed binding sites occur near probable calmodulin-binding or calcium-dependent protease cleavage sites."
https://openalex.org/W1495052042,"Acetylglutamate and ATP accelerate the oxidative inactivation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I by mixtures of Fe3+, ascorbate, and O2, but the mechanism of the inactivation differs with each ligand. In the presence of acetylglutamate, MgATP prevents, Mg2+, Mn2+, and catalase have no effect, and EDTA increases the inactivation, and the two phosphorylation steps of the enzyme reaction are lost simultaneously. The inactivation appears to be mediated by dehydroascorbate and is associated with the reversible oxidation of the highly reactive cysteines 1327 and 1337 and with oxidation of non-thiolic groups in the second 40-kDa domain (the enzyme consists of 4 domains of 40, 40, 60, and 20 kDa, from the amino terminus). The data are consistent with oxidation of groups at or near the site for ATPA (ATPA yields Pi; ATPB yields carbamoyl phosphate), and with the location of this site at the interphase between the second 40-kDa and the COOH-terminal domains. The oxidative inactivation promoted by ATP is inhibited by Mg2+, Mn2+, catalase, and EDTA, is not mediated by dehydroascorbate, and is not associated with oxidation of cysteines 1327 and 1337. Groups in the 60-kDa domain are oxidized. The phosphorylation step involving ATPB is lost preferentially, and the inactivation and the binding of ATPB exhibit the same dependency on the concentration of ATP. The results indicate that the oxidation is catalyzed by FeATP bound at the site for ATPB and support the binding of ATPB in the 60-kDa domain. We also demonstrate that mercaptoethanol, reducing impurities in glycerol, and dithioerythritol, in the presence of EDTA, replace ascorbate in the oxidative system. In addition, we study the influence of the oxidation on the degradation of the enzyme by rat liver lysosomes, mitochondria, and cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1501459115,"The significance of the 5' heterogeneity of the transmitter gene ppEnk was evaluated by comparing start site usage (E1-E4) between 12 tissues from untreated rats, using primer extension analysis. In the basal state, we found that E3- and E4-initiated transcripts accounted for 80% of the total striatal RNA present compared with a preferential usage of the E2 start site in all other tissues. To determine whether this selective expression could be modified by biologically relevant pathways, rats were made hypoglycemic. After insulin shock, only E3 + E4-initiated transcripts increased (16-fold at 1 day) in the adrenal medulla but were unaffected in the striatum. As the effects of insulin shock on the adrenal medulla are mediated by cholinergic pathways and the striatum also receives cholinergic inputs, we also compared the effects of cholinergic drug treatments on start site usage in these two tissues. Rats were treated with cholinergic agonists (nicotine + oxotremorine) which induced adrenomedullary E2 and E3 + E4 transcripts (5- and 80-fold, respectively). This effect peaked at 2 days. In contrast, in the same animals, striatal ppEnk RNA (E3 + E4) increased only 10-15-fold after drug treatment. Hence it appears that biologically relevant whole animal stimuli (insulin shock or cholinergic agents) activate biochemical pathways, which affect start site usage in a tissue-specific fashion. Selective RNA start site usage suggests a biological significance, which may be important in the widespread tissue expression of this gene."

Structure-activity studies revealed that only C-terminal fragments can exhibit an NPY-like inhibitory effect on 125I-NPY binding and adenylate cyclase activity of rat cardiac ventricular membranes. Although NPY(17-36) inhibited 125I-NPY binding with high potency, it produced a biphasic effect on basal (GTP, 10 and 100 microM or guanosine 5'-gamma-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S, 10 microM) adenylate cyclase activity. Low concentrations (less than 1 nM) of NPY(17-36) inhibited the adenylate cyclase activity whereas high concentrations (greater than 1 nM) reversed this action. GTP gamma S (100 microM) reversed the biphasic effect of NPY(17-36). NPY(17-36) exhibited only a stimulatory effect in the membranes from pertussis toxin-treated rats and an inhibitory effect with membranes from cholera toxin-treated rats. Low concentrations (less than 1 nM) of NPY(17-36) inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity whereas high doses (greater than 1 nM) reversed this activity. The cardiac NPY receptor antagonist, NPY(18-36) (1 microM), completely blocked the biphasic effect of NPY(17-36) on isoproterenol-stimulated activity. The inhibitory dose-response curve of NPY on isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was shifted parallel to the right by NPY(17-36) (1 microM), suggesting that it is an antagonist of NPY at high concentrations. N-alpha-acetylated and C-terminally deamidated analogs of NPY(17-36) had no effect on the adenylate cyclase activity. [im-DNP-His26] NPY exhibited a more pronounced biphasic effect whereas N-alpha-myristoyl-NPY(17-36) elicited only a stimulatory effect. These investigations suggest that: 1) the inhibitory and stimulatory effects of NPY(17-36) are mediated by high affinity NPY receptors coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and a distinct population of low affinity receptors coupled to a cholera toxin-sensitive G protein, respectively; and 2) the stimulatory effect of NPY(17-36) is dissociable."
https://openalex.org/W1594653437,"Abstract Heat-shocked organisms are known to produce not only heat shock proteins but also diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) and related compounds that may act as alarmones that alert the cell to the onset of metabolic stress. We found that Ap4A is synthesized in chicken erythrocytes and that the Ap4A level in the whole blood of heat-stressed birds increases about 10-fold. In searching for alarmone receptors, we found that the diadenosine polyphosphates bind preferentially with high affinity to the deoxy conformation of hemoglobin in a ratio of one/tetramer. The binding affinity of this new class of effectors of hemoglobin function is directly related to the number of phosphates which bridge the nucleotide moieties, with the most dramatic in vitro effect on oxygen affinity being shown by Ap6A. Decreasing effects are brought about by diadenosine penta-, tetra-, tri-, di-, and monophosphates. The association constant for Ap4A binding to deoxygenated human hemoglobin at pH 7.25 is 26 microM-1, close to that for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. At 100-fold excess over heme, Ap4A increases the P50 of stripped Hb A in 0.05 M HEPES buffer at pH 7.25, 20 degrees C, from 0.85 to 6.03 mm Hg. The binding, which markedly enhances the Bohr effect, involves the beta chain anion-binding site. The kinetics of both ligand binding and dissociation are affected, with a greater quantitative effect on the oxygen dissociation process. Although the low concentration of the diadenosine polyphosphates in red cells precludes a physiologically significant modulation of oxygen delivery, competition with the ATP- and NAD(P)H-binding sites on hemoglobin or regulatory enzymes may prove to be of adaptive significance."
https://openalex.org/W1521464125,"We have demonstrated previously that Leishmania enriettii contains the enzymatic machinery to mediate efficient interplasmidic homologous recombination. In this report we show that a sequence insertion targeting vector, pALT-Neo-Tub, can be inserted into the genome of L. enriettii by homologous recombination between alpha-tubulin sequences found in the plasmid and their homologs in the genome. pALT-Neo-Tub, a pBluescript-derived vector containing the neor gene flanked by the alpha-tubulin intergenic and alpha-tubulin coding sequences, was used to transfect cells to G418 resistance. Analysis of the DNA from the drug resistant clones indicates that all of the insertion events are restricted to the alpha-tubulin gene repeats. As little as 200 base pairs of sequence homology between the plasmid and the genome is required for integration. Nonhomologous recombination events are not detected. These results indicate that exogenous DNA sequences can be integrated into the L. enriettii genome provided that they are flanked by homologous DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2136724086,"Secondary structures for all five spliceosomal small nuclear (sn) RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs) have been derived from phylogenetic, biochemical, and genetic data, but tertiary structure information has been more difficult to obtain. Here we have used the general cross-linking reagent nitrogen mustard (bis-(2-chloroethyl)methylamine) to explore the tertiary conformation of naked U1 snRNA. We detected two intramolecularly cross-linked U1 species (X-U1#1 and X-U1#2) after cross-linking of deproteinized HeLa nuclear extract. We determined the cross-linked sites and found that X-U1#1 is cross-linked between the C82-A85 and U129, while X-U1#2 is cross-linked between U105-G108 and A118. We then tested the ability of these two cross-linked species to bind small nuclear ribonucleo-protein (snRNP) proteins in vitro (in HeLa nuclear extract or S100) and in vivo (in Xenopus oocytes). Both X-U1#1 and X-U1#2 were found to reconstitute efficiently in vitro and in vivo, as judged by immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for Sm and U1-specific proteins. Our data suggest that (i) the Sm-binding site lies on the surface of the native U1 snRNP, since the cross-link in X-U1#1 involves the Sm-binding site but does not block snRNP assembly, and (ii) U1 snRNA may adopt the correct tertiary conformation even in the absence of U1 snRNP proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1536094246,"Although the T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR) lacks intrinsic kinase activity, stimulation of this receptor induces tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates. In contrast, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has intrinsic cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase catalytic activity that is activated upon EGF binding. To compare the functional effects of the TCR and a transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), we used retrovirus-mediated gene transduction to express the human c-erbB proto-oncogene, encoding the EGFR, in a murine T-cell hybridoma. Tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the TCR and the EGFR occurred on substrates unique to each receptor as well as on several shared substrates, including the zeta chain of the TCR. Stimulation of the EGFR induced calcium ion flux in these cells, suggesting that the heterologous tyrosine kinase can couple to the T-cell phospholipase signal transduction pathway, but this stimulus did not lead to interleukin 2 production. However, EGF stimulation of transduced cells significantly enhanced TCR signaling, as assessed by interleukin 2 production, indicating that cross talk can occur between the TCR and a transmembrane PTK."
https://openalex.org/W1572871294,"The binding of nuclear proteins of hematopoietic cells to transcriptional enhancers of interferon-inducible genes has been studied before and after exposure to alpha-interferon. Mobility shift assays show that a complex formed with interferon-inducible transcriptional enhancers before interferon induction contains a 73- and 84-kDa protein. Amino acid sequencing of the oligoaffinity column purified 73- and 84-kDa proteins showed that they belonged to a family of DNA-binding proteins which have been previously identified to exhibit binding in a sequence nonspecific manner to the ends of fragmented DNA or the origin of replication of adenovirus Type 2 DNA and sequence-specific binding to the distal regions of the U1 small nuclear RNA promoter, the promoter of the transferrin receptor gene, and the transcriptional regulatory regions of HLA genes. Following exposure to alpha-interferon, more slowly migrating complexes appeared which contained a 48-kDa protein, a 95-kDa protein, and a 105-kDa protein which bound to the 9-27 transcriptional enhancer in a sequence-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1579079147,"A system of exon was produced from the functionally rearranged epsilon-heavy gene isolated from the rat IgE-secreting immunocytoma IR162. The five individual exons, encoding the variable and constant region domains, were isolated and subcloned into the multiple cloning site of a pair of plasmid vectors with opposed orientation multiple cloning sites. The use of opposed orientation multiple cloning sites and the flanking restriction enzyme sites contained therein allows for the modular manipulation of the gene. These exon modules were initially used to reconstruct the epsilon-heavy chain gene into the native configuration to demonstrate the efficacy of the modular system for synthesis of IgE. Upon transfection into the rat myeloma cell line Y3, the reconstructed gene produced a polypeptide that associated with the endogenous light chain polypeptide and was secreted from the cell as tetrameric IgE. All physical and functional characterizations indicate that the IgE molecule produced is indistinguishable from native IR162 IgE. This modular system of exons will facilitate the manipulation of IgE structure through the systematic assembly of different epsilon-heavy chain mutant constructions. The resulting novel IgE proteins will be very useful to study the molecular nature of the interaction of IgE with its Fc receptor."
