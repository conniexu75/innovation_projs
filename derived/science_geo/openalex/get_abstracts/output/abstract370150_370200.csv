https://openalex.org/W2160619010,"Phytophthora infestans is the most destructive pathogen of potato and a model organism for the oomycetes, a distinct lineage of fungus-like eukaryotes that are related to organisms such as brown algae and diatoms. As the agent of the Irish potato famine in the mid-nineteenth century, P. infestans has had a tremendous effect on human history, resulting in famine and population displacement. To this day, it affects world agriculture by causing the most destructive disease of potato, the fourth largest food crop and a critical alternative to the major cereal crops for feeding the world's population. Current annual worldwide potato crop losses due to late blight are conservatively estimated at $6.7 billion. Management of this devastating pathogen is challenged by its remarkable speed of adaptation to control strategies such as genetically resistant cultivars. Here we report the sequence of the P. infestans genome, which at approximately 240 megabases (Mb) is by far the largest and most complex genome sequenced so far in the chromalveolates. Its expansion results from a proliferation of repetitive DNA accounting for approximately 74% of the genome. Comparison with two other Phytophthora genomes showed rapid turnover and extensive expansion of specific families of secreted disease effector proteins, including many genes that are induced during infection or are predicted to have activities that alter host physiology. These fast-evolving effector genes are localized to highly dynamic and expanded regions of the P. infestans genome. This probably plays a crucial part in the rapid adaptability of the pathogen to host plants and underpins its evolutionary potential."
https://openalex.org/W2154430204,"In epithelial tissues, the lineage relationship between normal progenitor cells and cell type(s) of origin for cancer has been poorly understood. Here we show that a known regulator of prostate epithelial differentiation, the homeobox gene Nkx3-1, marks a stem cell population that functions during prostate regeneration. Genetic lineage-marking demonstrates that rare luminal cells that express Nkx3-1 in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant Nkx3-1-expressing cells, CARNs) are bipotential and can self-renew in vivo, and single-cell transplantation assays show that CARNs can reconstitute prostate ducts in renal grafts. Functional assays of Nkx3-1 mutant mice in serial prostate regeneration suggest that Nkx3-1 is required for stem cell maintenance. Furthermore, targeted deletion of the Pten tumour suppressor gene in CARNs results in rapid carcinoma formation after androgen-mediated regeneration. These observations indicate that CARNs represent a new luminal stem cell population that is an efficient target for oncogenic transformation in prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2014142698,"Infectious prion diseases-scrapie of sheep and chronic wasting disease (CWD) of several species in the deer family-are transmitted naturally within affected host populations. Although several possible sources of contagion have been identified in excretions and secretions from symptomatic animals, the biological importance of these sources in sustaining epidemics remains unclear. Here we show that asymptomatic CWD-infected mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) excrete CWD prions in their faeces long before they develop clinical signs of prion disease. Intracerebral inoculation of irradiated deer faeces into transgenic mice overexpressing cervid prion protein (PrP) revealed infectivity in 14 of 15 faecal samples collected from five deer at 7-11 months before the onset of neurological disease. Although prion concentrations in deer faeces were considerably lower than in brain tissue from the same deer collected at the end of the disease, the estimated total infectious dose excreted in faeces by an infected deer over the disease course may approximate the total contained in a brain. Prolonged faecal prion excretion by infected deer provides a plausible natural mechanism that might explain the high incidence and efficient horizontal transmission of CWD within deer herds, as well as prion transmission among other susceptible cervids."

https://openalex.org/W1965032353,"The ability of a transcription factor (TF) to regulate its targets is modulated by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, resulting in highly context-dependent regulatory networks. However, high-throughput methods for the identification of proteins that affect TF activity are still largely unavailable. Here we introduce an algorithm, modulator inference by network dynamics (MINDy), for the genome-wide identification of post-translational modulators of TF activity within a specific cellular context. When used to dissect the regulation of MYC activity in human B lymphocytes, the approach inferred novel modulators of MYC function, which act by distinct mechanisms, including protein turnover, transcription complex formation and selective enzyme recruitment. MINDy is generally applicable to study the post-translational modulation of mammalian TFs in any cellular context. As such it can be used to dissect context-specific signaling pathways and combinatorial transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2083493439,"Enlarged subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes have been shown to predict incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Pima population of Arizona (USA). We investigated the role of subcutaneous abdominal adipocyte size (AAS), as well as femoral adipocyte size (FAS), as predictors of T2D in a population-based Swedish cohort. In 1974-1975, a sample of 1302 middle-aged women underwent a health examination, including anthropometry and evaluation of parental medical history. In addition, body composition (total body potassium and total body water), AAS and FAS (adipose tissue needle biopsy) were assessed in a subsample of 245 women. Incidence of T2D was followed until 2001, with 36 cases eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Women developing T2D had larger AAS at baseline vs. women remaining healthy (age/heredity-adjusted hazard ratio for increase of AAS by 1 sd [AAS-HR] 1.91; P<0.001). Further adjustment for both body fat percentage and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) indicated a robust association. For FAS, the corresponding associations were consistently weaker. WHtR retained a strong predictive association independent of AAS and FAS (WHtR-HR 2.6 and 2.7, respectively; P<0.001). To conclude, in addition to the amount and distribution of body fat in women, subcutaneous adipocyte size, particularly in the abdominal region, predicts incidence of T2D in later life."

https://openalex.org/W2106447785,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in a RecQ-like DNA helicase. Mice lacking the helicase domain of the WRN homologue exhibit many phenotypic features of WS, including a prooxidant status and a shorter mean life span compared to wild-type animals. Here, we show that Wrn mutant mice also develop premature liver sinusoidal endothelial defenestration along with inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Vitamin C supplementation rescued the shorter mean life span of Wrn mutant mice and reversed several age-related abnormalities in adipose tissues and liver endothelial defenestration, genomic integrity, and inflammatory status. At the molecular level, phosphorylation of age-related stress markers like Akt kinase-specific substrates and the transcription factor NF-kappaB, as well as protein kinase Cdelta and Hif-1alpha transcription factor levels, which are increased in the liver of Wrn mutants, were normalized by vitamin C. Vitamin C also increased the transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism PPARalpha. Finally, microarray and gene set enrichment analyses on liver tissues revealed that vitamin C decreased genes normally up-regulated in human WS fibroblasts and cancers, and it increased genes involved in tissue injury response and adipocyte dedifferentiation in obese mice. Vitamin C did not have such effect on wild-type mice. These results indicate that vitamin C supplementation could be beneficial for patients with WS."
https://openalex.org/W2098387013,"Accessibility within chromatin is an important factor in the prompt removal of UV-induced DNA damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER). Chromatin remodeling by the SWI/SNF complex has been shown to play an important modulating role in NER in vitro and yeast in vivo. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of cross-talk between SWI/SNF and NER in mammalian cells is not fully understood. Here, we show that knockdown of Brg1, the ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF, negatively affects the elimination of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), but not of pyrimidine (6, 4)pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PP) following UV irradiation of mammalian cells. Brg1-deficient cells exhibit a lower chromatin relaxation as well as impaired recruitment of downstream NER factors, XPG and PCNA, to UV lesions. However, the assembly of upstream NER factors, DDB2 and XPC, at the damage site was unaffected by Brg1 knockdown. Interestingly, Brg1 interacts with XPC within chromatin and is recruited to UV-damaged sites in a DDB2- and XPC-dependent manner. Also, postirradiation decrease of XPC levels occurred more rapidly in Brg1-deficient than normal cells. Conversely, XPC transcription remained unaltered upon Brg1 knockdown indicating that Brg1 affects the stability of XPC protein following irradiation. Thus, Brg1 facilitates different stages of NER by initially modulating UV-induced chromatin relaxation and stabilizing XPC at the damage sites, and subsequently stimulating the recruitment of XPG and PCNA to successfully culminate the repair."
https://openalex.org/W2033682153,"Copper is an essential co-factor in many important physiological processes, but at elevated levels it is toxic to cells. Thus at both the organism and cellular level mechanisms have evolved to finely tune copper homeostasis. The protein responsible for copper entry from the circulation in most human cells is hCTR1, a small protein (190 amino acid residues) that functions as a trimer in the plasma membrane. In the present work we employ cell surface biotinylation and isotopic copper uptake studies of overexpressed hCTR1 in HEK293 cells to examine the acute (minutes) response of hCTR1 to changes in extracellular copper. We show that within 10 min of exposure to copper at 2.5 microM or higher, plasma membrane hCTR1 levels are reduced (by approximately 40%), with a concomitant reduction in copper uptake rates. We are unable to detect any degradation of internalized hCTR1 in the presence of cycloheximide after up to 2 h of exposure to 0-100 microM copper. Using a reversible biotinylation assay, we quantified internalized hCTR1, which increased upon the addition of copper and corresponded to the hCTR1 lost from the surface. In addition, when extracellular copper is then removed, internalized hCTR1 is promptly (within 30 min) recycled to the plasma membrane. We have shown that in the absence of added extracellular copper, there is a small but detectable amount of internalized hCTR1 that is increased in the presence of copper. Similar studies on endogenous hCTR1 show a cell-specific response to elevated extracellular copper. Copper-dependent internalization and recycling of hCTR1 provides an acute and reversible mechanism for the regulation of cellular copper entry."

For stroma-free Hb this regulation is lost, and the potential for Hb to become a peroxidase is high and further increased by inflammatory cells generating superoxide. The latter can be converted into H2O2 and feed Hb peroxidase activity. Haptoglobins (Hp) bind with extracellular Hb and reportedly weaken Hb peroxidase activity. Here we demonstrate that: (i) Hb peroxidase activity is retained upon binding with Hp; (ii) in the presence of H2O2, Hb·Hp peroxidase complexes undergo covalent cross-linking; (iii) peroxidase activity of Hb·Hp complexes and aggregates consumes reductants such as ascorbate and nitric oxide; (iv) cross-linked Hb·Hp aggregates are taken up by macrophages at rates exceeding those for noncovalently cross-linked Hb·Hp complexes; (v) the engulfed Hb·Hp aggregates activate superoxide production and induce intracellular oxidative stress (deplete endogenous glutathione and stimulate lipid peroxidation); (vi) Hb·Hp aggregates cause cytotoxicity to macrophages; and (vii) Hb·Hp aggregates are present in septic plasma. Overall, our data suggest that under conditions of severe inflammation and oxidative stress, peroxidase activity of Hb·Hp covalent aggregates may cause macrophage dysfunction and microvascular vasoconstriction, which are commonly seen in severe sepsis and hemolytic diseases.

Svistunenko D.A. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In red blood cells, this potentially dangerous activity is strictly regulated by the reducing environment and the lack of oxidizing equivalents. The inadvertently appearing ferric forms of Hb are short-lived, and the hemoprotein is effectively converted into ferro-Hb (deoxy-Hb) by metHb reductase (2Hultquist D.E. Passon P.G. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 229: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Normally, less than 2% of total Hb exists in the form of MetHb because the rate of Hb reduction is far greater than its oxidation (2Hultquist D.E. Passon P.G. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 229: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For stroma-free Hb, however, this intracellular regulation is lost, and the likelihood for Hb to act as a peroxidase is high. This possibility is markedly increased in the course of severe inflammation (e.g. in sepsis) by the generation of superoxide radicals by immune cells. The latter can be spontaneously or catalytically (by extracellular superoxide dismutase) converted into H2O2, a fuel for Hb peroxidase activity. In line with this, several clinical and experimental investigations have established that lethality in sepsis is increased in the setting of hemolysis (3Cooper G.S. Havlir D.S. Shlaes D.M.

Whether these hetero-oligomeric covalent aggregates retain the peroxidase activity is unknown. If the aggregates retain peroxidase activity, they may continue to be a source of oxidative stress both in circulation as well as in phagocytizing cells involved in their clearance such as macrophages. In the current work, we determined the extent to which: (i) Hb peroxidase activity is decreased by binding with Hp; (ii) peroxidase activity of Hb·Hp complexes initiates cross-linking into covalent hetero-oligomers; (iii) peroxidase activity of Hb·Hp complexes and aggregates utilizes nitric oxide (NO•); (iv) Hb·Hp aggregates are taken up by macrophages as compared with noncovalent Hb·Hp complexes; and (v) the engulfed Hb·Hp aggregates induce oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. Here, we report that Hb·Hp complexes and aggregates are potent peroxidases capable of inducing oxidative stress in both plasma and macrophages. We further demonstrate the presence of Hb·Hp aggregates in septic plasma. RPMI 1640 medium, non-heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum were from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). BioSep-SEC-S4000 column was purchased from Phenomenex, Inc. (Torrance, CA). Human Hb, Hp from pooled human plasma, haptoglobin phenotype 1-1 (Hp 1-1), haptoglobin phenotype 2-2 (Hp 2-2), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), dexamethasone, and H2O2 were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. MultiTox-Glo Multiplex cytotoxicity assay kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit DMPO nitrone adduct polyclonal antiserum was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI), goat anti-human Hb antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Montgomery, TX), rabbit anti-human Hp antibody was from Dako Cytomation (Carpinteria, CA), and anti-actin antibody was obtained from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). Anti-4-HNE antibody and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD163 antibody were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antiserum, goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antiserum, SilverSNAP stain kit, SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, and Lumi-Phos WB chemiluminescent substrate were purchased from Fisher. THP-1 cells (American Tissue Culture Collection) were cultured in the RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5000 units of penicillin/streptomycin and maintained in suspension at 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml. The adherent, differentiated macrophages were obtained by the addition of PMA (20 nm) to culture medium for 4 days. The cells were then treated with fresh culture medium containing dexamethasone (250 nm) for 24 h to trigger CD163 expression (17Asleh R. Marsh S. Shilkrut M. Binah O. Guetta J. Lejbkowicz F. Enav B.

Cell surface CD163 expression was determined by flow cytometry using a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD163 antibody. A flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) equipped with a 488-nm argon ion laser and supplied with the Cell Quest software was used to perform the analysis. Mean fluorescence intensity from 10,000 cells was acquired. To quantify Hb or Hb·Hp uptake, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled respective ligands at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (as the amount of Hb) in serum-free medium and analyzed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. After 2 h of incubation, the cells were washed with Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing EDTA to dissociate extracellular Hb·Hp from CD163 (18Bächli E.B. Schaer D.J. Walter R.B.

After 1 h of incubation, the cells were treated with Trypan blue to quench extracellular fluorescence signal followed by fixation with paraformaldehyde. The images were obtained using Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. THP-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plate and differentiated with PMA followed by dexamethasone treatment. The cells were incubated with either Hb, Hb·Hp complexes, or their aggregates at a concentration of 0.4 and 0.6 mg/ml (as the amount of Hb) for 1 h in serum-free medium, after rinsing with Ca2+-free PBS. The cells were further incubated for another 6 h (serum was added after 4 h of incubation to minimize the toxic effect of serum withdrawal). Cytotoxicity was determined using Promega MultiTox assay kit according to the manufacturer's manual by a Fusion α universal microplate analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To make the data comparable, digitonin (30 μg/ml) was used as 100% cytotoxicity standard. Low molecular mass thiols (predominantly GSH) in cells were determined using ThioGloTM-1, a maleimide reagent that produces highly fluorescent adducts with SH groups. Briefly, after differentiated THP-1 cells were incubated with either Hb, Hb-aggregates, Hb·Hp complexes, or Hb·Hp aggregates in the same condition as in cytotoxicity assay, 0.2 × 105 cells were suspended in PBS and lysed by freezing and thawing. GSH content was estimated by an immediate fluorescence response to ThioGloTM-1. The Fusion α microplate analyzer was employed for fluorescence assay using excitation at 388 nm and emission at 500 nm. A standard curve was established by the addition of GSH (0.04–4.0 μm) to 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm ThioGloTM-1. The total amount of protein was determined using the Bradford assay. The GSH level was expressed as nmol/mg protein. Oxidation-dependent fluorogenic dye, dihydroethidium (DHE, Molecular Probes) was used to evaluate intracellular production of superoxide radicals. Briefly, the cells were incubated with 5 μm DHE for 10 min followed by washing with PBS. The cells were collected and resuspended in PBS after incubation with either Hb, Hb aggregates, Hb·Hp complexes, or aggregates at concentrations of 0.4 mg/ml in cell culture medium without serum for 1 h. The fluorescence of ethidium was measured using a FACscan flow cytometer and Cell Quest software. Mean fluorescence intensity from 10,000 cells was acquired using a 585-nm band pass filter (FL-2 channel). Hb aggregates and Hb·Hp aggregates were prepared by incubation of Hb or Hb·Hp (1:1) in the presence of H2O2 added in equal portions every 15 min (H2O2/Hb ratio 15:1) for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of catalase (1400 units/ml). In some cases oleic acid (oleic acid/Hb ratio 100:1) was added to increase the amount of Hb·Hp aggregates. To produce FITC-labeled Hb·Hp complexes, the Hb·Hp mixture (1:1) was incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min, and then FITC was added at a ratio of 150 μg of FITC/1 mg of protein and incubated for 1 h. Nonbound FITC was removed by spin column. To form labeled aggregates, FITC-labeled complexes were incubated with H2O2 (H2O2/Hb ratio 15:1) for 1 h. For EPR power saturation measurements, 200 μm ascorbate was added to the formed aggregates and incubated for 15 min to reduce all of the protein immobilized radicals. The residual ascorbate was removed by ascorbate oxidase (1 unit/100 μl; 5 min). Formation of ascorbate radicals was monitored by EPR spectroscopy using a JEOL-RE1X EPR spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) at 25 °C. Ascorbate radical EPR spectra were recorded at the following settings: 3350 G, center field; 10 G, sweep width; 10 milliwatt, microwave power; 0.5 G, field modulation; 103, receiver gain; 0.03 s, time constant; 4 min, scan time. The time courses of ascorbate radical generation were obtained by repeated scanning of the EPR spectrum (5 G, sweep width; other instrumental conditions were the same). UV absorbance measurements of ascorbate during its oxidation were performed by at 265 nm using UV160U spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments). To form heme-nitrosyl complexes, 10 μm metHb was incubated with a nitroxyl donor, Angeli's salt (40 μm), for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen. The spectra of nitrosylated Hb were recorded under the following instrumental settings: 3200 G, center field; 500 G, sweep width; 5 G, field modulation; 10 milliwatt, microwave power; 103, receiver gain; 0.1 s, time constant; 2 min, time scan. EPR spectra of oxoferryl-related tyrosyl radicals were measured at 77 K in 30 s after the addition of H2O2 (50 or 100 μm) to the samples. EPR settings: center field, 3230 G; sweep width, 100 G; field modulation, 5 G; microwave power, 5 milliwatt; receiver gain, 103; time constant, 0.1 s; time scan, 2 min. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, and informed consent was obtained from parents for sample collection. Venous blood samples were collected in anticoagulant sodium citrate (3.2%)-containing tubes. The blood samples were centrifuged 10 min at 2400 rpm, and plasma was stored in −80 °C until further analysis. Hb, Hb·Hp complexes, Hb·Hp aggregates, and plasma samples were separated by native, SDS-PAGE, or SDS-DTT-PAGE in Tris-glycine buffer. Because of the high molecular mass of aggregates, gels with different porosity (12% acrylamide, 7.5% acrylamide, 2.5% acrylamide 0.5% agarose) were used. The gels were stained by SilverSNAP stain kit according to the manufacturer's manual. Proteins from SDS-PAGE gels were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (0.05%) for 1 h, the membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibodies (at 4 °C). The membranes were washed several times followed by incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase for 60 min at room temperature. For analysis of intracellular accumulation of Hb·Hp aggregates and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adducts control and Hb·Hp aggregates treated THP-1 cells were washed three times with PBS containing EDTA by centrifugation, suspended in PBS, lysed by mild sonication, and centrifuged by 500 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatants were separated on 1% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with West Pico (for peroxidase activity), anti-Hb or anti-Hp antibodies, monoclonal anti-4-HNE antibody, or anti-actin antibody for loading control. The protein bands were visualized by using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate for the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody or Lumi-Phos WB chemiluminescent substrate for the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. The density of the bands was determined using EpiChemi II Darkroom (UVP BioImaging Systems, Upland, CA) or by exposure of Kodak scientific imaging film X-OMAT LS (Carestream Health Inc., Rochester, NY). The samples were subjected to native or SDS-PAGE in Tris-glycine buffer in 7.5% polyacrylamide gel; peroxidase activity was determined by the incubation of gels or membranes containing electrotransferred proteins with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, which is a typical substrate for peroxidases. HPLC chromatography of oxidized Hb·Hp was performed on BioSep-SEC-S4000 column in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Collected fractions were concentrated by Ultracel YM-30 cut -off filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Assessment of peroxidase activity of fractions was performed by measuring the fluorescence of resorufin, an oxidation product of Amplex Red, or by assessment of ascorbate radical EPR signals. The reaction conditions for the Amplex Red assay were: 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 100 μm DTPA, 100 μm Amplex Red, 50 μm H2O2. The reaction conditions for EPR experiments were: 1 μm ascorbate, 500 μm etoposide, 200 μm H2O2. HPLC ChromatographyData are expressed as means (standard deviation of at least triplicate determinations). The changes in variables were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. The differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Initially, the involvement of Hb-driven peroxidase activity in its cross-linking with Hp and formation of Hb·Hp aggregates was explored in model biochemical systems. To assess peroxidase activity of Hb, we utilized ascorbate as a well known substrate and monitored its oxidation by EPR spectroscopy. EPR is a specific and reliable method for detection of ascorbate radicals formed as one-electron intermediates during oxidation of ascorbate to dehydroascorbate (20Hubel C.A. Kagan V.E. Kisin E.R. McLaughlin M.K. Roberts J.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Incubation of Hb with ascorbate and H2O2 resulted in the formation of ascorbate radicals with a typical doublet signal in the spectrum with hyperfine splitting constants of 1.7 G (Fig. 1A, inset). Monitoring the time course of ascorbate radical EPR signals (Fig. 1A) revealed that Hp increased the lifespan of detectable ascorbate radicals, i.e. delayed its oxidation. This effect of Hp on the lifespan of ascorbate radicals generated by Hb/H2O2 was dependent on Hp/Hb ratios and saturated at ratios of 1:1 and higher (Fig. 1B). Without Hb (control), H2O2 did not cause the appearance of ascorbate radical signals (in the presence of the metal chelator DTPA, 100 μm). Further, the magnitude of Hb-induced signal in the absence of H2O2 was ∼8-fold lower than that observed in its presence (data not shown). Thus, Hp suppressed oxidation of ascorbate by Hb/H2O2, resulting in delayed disappearance of its radical. In line with the EPR data, measurements of ascorbate absorbance (with a max at 265 nm) showed that Hb/H2O2-induced consumption of ascorbate was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of Hp (Fig. 1C). Similarly to EPR assessments, absorbance measurements demonstrated that increasing inhibition of Hb peroxidase activity by Hp reached saturation at Hb·Hp ratio of 1:1. This is compatible with the known very high affinity of Hp for Hb (Kd is on the order of approximately ×10−14 m) (21McCormick D.J. Atassi M.Z. J. Protein Chem. 1990; 9: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity of free Hb and Hb·Hp complexes was also assessed zymographically after native PAGE. By incubating gels with a typical chemiluminescent substrate for peroxidases, West Pico, we detected the peroxidase activity in bands, corresponding to free Hb as well as to its complexes with either Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2. In agreement with the above results on ascorbate oxidation, Hp suppressed peroxidase activity of Hb toward West Pico (Fig. 1D). Quantification of zymograms revealed that the peroxidase activity of Hb·Hp complexes was ∼30% of that for free Hb (Fig. 1E). We showed that at Hp/Hb ratios exceeding 1:1, no free Hb could be detected on the gels, indicating that the complexes were the only species with the peroxidase activity. These results are consistent with data in the literature that stoichiometry of Hb interactions with Hp is 1:1 (22Lavialle F. Rogard M. Alfsen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Thus, kinetic estimates could be performed at this ratio of Hb·Hp. The results obtained with Amplex Red as a typical peroxidase substrate demonstrated that Hp caused a mixed type of inhibition of Hb peroxidase activity, acting as a competitive inhibitor as well as a noncompetitive inhibitor (Fig. 1F). Apparently, Hp itself acted as a substrate of the peroxidase reaction catalyzed by Hb (see below). The noncompetitive mechanism of the inhibitory action may derive from covalent modification of Hb·Hp complexes leading to the aggregation. Hb-induced oxidation of several small molecule substrates: ascorbate, West Pico and Amplex Red, was partially and concentration-dependently inhibited upon binding of Hp, suggesting that oxidizing potential of Hb might be competitively redirected toward oxidation of Hp. Alternatively, binding of Hp could block access of small molecules (including H2O2) to the heme-catalytic site of Hb. To experimentally examine this, we studied interactions of Hb and its complexes with Hp with NO•, a small molecule that produces characteristic low temperature EPR spectra upon binding with the heme moiety in deoxy-Hb (23Angelo M. Hausladen A. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 436: 131-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When a source of nitroxyl radicals, Angeli's salt, was added to free Hb or Hb·Hp complexes, a characteristic EPR spectrum of hexa-coordinate heme-nitrosyl complexes of Hb was readily detectable at 77 K (supplemental Fig. S1A, panels a and b). The magnitude of the signals was 15–20% lower in the presence of Hp (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that Hp does not preclude interactions of Hb with small molecules such as nitroxyl and NO•. In the absence of small molecule substrates, peroxidase activity of Hb can cause oxidation of protein itself yielding protein-immobilized radical intermediates, most commonly tyrosyl radicals (Tyr•) (13Reeder B.J. Svistunenko D.A. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1214-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The production of these radical intermediates can be detected by low temperature EPR spectroscopy (25Svistunenko D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1707: 127-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Hb contains several potentially oxidizable tyrosine residues (Tyr42 and Tyr24 in α-chain). A typical low temperature EPR spectrum obtained from an incubation system containing either Hb or Hb·Hp complexes and H2O2 represents a characteristic signal of protein-derived (tyrosyl) radicals with a peak-to-trough width of 19 G and a g factor of 2.005 (25Svistunenko D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1707: 127-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). (supplemental Fig. S1B, panels a and b). The magnitude of Hb·Hp Tyr• radicals was significantly higher than that of Tyr• radicals of Hb (Fig. 2B, bars a and b). The proximity of Tyr• radical intermediates to the heme moiety of Hb can be probed by power saturation experiments. When these measurements were performed for Hb/H2O2 and Hb·Hp/H2O2 incubations, no differences were found (Fig. 2C). This suggests that Hp did not significantly affect the structural organization of Hb as a peroxidase. Protein-immobilized (tyrosyl) radicals formed during the peroxidase reaction can realize their oxidizing potential to trigger the protein oligomerization process. In this reaction, the radicals recombine, resulting in carbon-carbon cross-linking that involves not only the initiating hemoprotein itself but surrounding proteins in close proximity yielding hetero-oligomers (13Reeder B.J. Svistunenko D.A. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Vallelian F. Pimenova T. Pereira C.P. Abraham B. Mikolajczyk M.G. Schoedon G.

Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4894-4907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This type of covalent cross-linking may be particularly effective between proteins in complexes. In the case of Hb·Hp complexes, the formation of covalent hetero-oligomers is indicative of the recombination of radicals formed on both Hb and Hp and can be interpreted in terms of Hp being a substrate of the Hb-catalyzed peroxidase reaction. Both Hb and Hp contain several cysteines that can participate in disulfide bonding. Therefore, two different types of aggregates can be formed during co-oxidation of Hb with Hp: (i) S-S bridges (two coupled thiol groups that are dissociable by S-S reducing reagents) and (ii) Tyr-Tyr cross-links (nondissociable by S-S reducing reagents). PAGE analysis of fully denatured proteins in the presence of SDS and a disulfide reducing agent, DTT, revealed that incubation of Hb with Hp in the presence of H2O2 resulted in accumulation of aggregates with different molecular masses. Western blot analysis showed that these aggregates contained both Hb and Hp as evidenced by their positive staining with anti-Hb and anti-Hp antibodies (Fig. 3). Resistance of Hb·Hp aggregates to DTT suggests that they are covalently linked via non S-S bonds. Although both Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-2 underwent oxidative cross-linking, a greater amount of very high molecular mass aggregates was formed after conjugation of Hb with Hp 2-2. The above results indicate that Hp acted as a substrate for Hb-driven peroxidase activity. Consequently, small molecule reducing substrates such as NO•, ascorbate, Amplex Red, or DMPO, known to interact with reactive intermediates of Hb peroxidase (15Tyurina Y.Y. Kini V. Tyurin V.A.

Prior studies have shown that Akt phosphorylation of the Rab GTPase-activating protein, AS160 (160-kDa Akt substrate; also known as TBC1D4), triggers GLUT4 translocation, most likely by suppressing its Rab GTPase-activating protein activity. However, the regulation of a very similar protein, TBC1D1 (TBC domain family, member 1), which is mainly found in muscle, in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation has been unclear. In the present study, we have identified likely Akt sites of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of TBC1D1 in C2C12 myotubes. We show that a mutant of TBC1D1, in which several Akt sites have been converted to alanine, is considerably more inhibitory to insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation than wild-type TBC1D1. This result thus indicates that similar to AS160, Akt phosphorylation of TBC1D1 enables GLUT4 translocation. We also show that in addition to Akt activation, activation of the AMP-dependent protein kinase partially relieves the inhibition of GLUT4 translocation by TBC1D1. Finally, we show that the R125W variant of TBC1D1, which has been genetically associated with obesity, is equally inhibitory to insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, as is wild-type TBC1D1, and that healthy and type 2 diabetic individuals express approximately the same level of TBC1D1 in biopsies of vastus lateralis muscle. In conclusion, phosphorylation of TBC1D1 is required for GLUT4 translocation. Thus, the regulation of TBC1D1 resembles that of its paralog, AS160.

In conclusion, phosphorylation of TBC1D1 is required for GLUT4 translocation. Thus, the regulation of TBC1D1 resembles that of its paralog, AS160. Insulin stimulates glucose transport into adipose and muscle cells by increasing the amount of the GLUT4 glucose transporter at the cell surface by a process termed GLUT4 translocation (1Huang S.

Insulin activates signaling cascades that lead to the trafficking of specialized GLUT4 vesicles to the cell membrane and fusion of the vesicles therewith. A key signaling pathway for GLUT4 translocation proceeds from the insulin receptor through the activation of the protein kinase Akt. One Akt substrate that connects signaling to GLUT4 trafficking is the Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) 3The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinAICAR5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranosideHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseAPCallophycocyanin. known as AS160. There is now considerable evidence for the following scheme (2Zaid H. Antonescu C.N. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2008; 413: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 3Sakamoto K. Holman G.D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 295: E29-E37Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar): under basal conditions, AS160 acts as a brake on GLUT4 translocation by maintaining one or more Rab proteins required for translocation in their inactive GDP state; in response to insulin, Akt phosphorylates AS160 and thereby suppresses its GAP activity; as a consequence, the elevation of the GTP form of the Rab proteins occurs, leading to the increased docking and subsequent fusion of the GLUT4 vesicles at the plasma membrane.

More recently, we and others have characterized a paralog of AS160 known as TBC1D1 (4Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem.

J. 2008; 409: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Overall, TBC1D1 is 47% identical to AS160, with the GAP domain being 79% identical (4Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Its GAP domain has the same Rab specificity as the GAP domain of AS160 (4Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). TBC1D1 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle; its expression in adipocytes is very low (5Chavez J.A.

Nevertheless, 3T3-L1 adipocytes are a convenient cell type in which to examine the role of proteins in GLUT4 translocation, because insulin causes an ∼10-fold increase in GLUT4 at the cell surface. Previously, we examined the role of TBC1D1 in GLUT4 translocation by overexpressing it in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Surprisingly, even though insulin led to phosphorylation of TBC1D1 on Akt site(s), ectopic TBC1D1 potently inhibited GLUT4 translocation (4Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Chavez J.A. Roach W.G. Keller S.R. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9187-9195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). By contrast, overexpression of AS160 did not inhibit GLUT4 translocation (8Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Mîinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This difference suggested that the regulation of TBC1D1 might be fundamentally different from that of AS160. In the present study, we show that this is not the case. By reducing the level of ectopic TBC1D1, we have obtained evidence that phosphorylation of TBC1D1 on several likely Akt sites relieves the inhibitory effect on GLUT4 translocation. In addition, we have examined the effect of a variant of TBC1D1 genetically associated with obesity on GLUT4 translocation and determined the relative levels of TBC1D1 in muscle biopsies from healthy and type 2 diabetic individuals. The cDNA for the long splice variant of mouse TBC1D1 (gi 28972622) was obtained from the Kazusa Foundation and inserted into the NotI and XbaI sites of p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma). Comparison of the sequence of this cDNA with sequences for mouse TBC1D1 in the mRNA and genomic data bases revealed that it has a mutation in which Glu at position 174 has been replaced by Lys. Lys-174 was mutated to Glu using the QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) to obtain plasmid encoding wild-type TBC1D1. A number of mutations in wild-type TBC1D1 were generated through use of the QuikChange kit. In each case, the complete cDNA for TBC1D1 was sequenced, because the mutagenesis procedure occasionally introduced a base change at sites other than the desired one. An affinity-purified antibody against mouse TBC1D1 was the previously described PG antibody (5Chavez J.A. Roach W.G. Keller S.R. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9187-9195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The myogenin antibody (number 21835) was from GeneTex (Irvine, CA); the antibody against GAPDH (number 25778) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-FLAG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (number A8592) was from Sigma. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (CL-173, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and C2C12 myoblasts (CRL-1772, ATCC) were maintained and differentiated into adipocytes and myotubes, respectively, according to previously described procedures (9Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chavez J.A. Knotts T.A. Wang L.P. Li G. Dobrowsky R.T. Florant G.L. Summers S.A. J. Biol.

For identification of phosphorylation sites, TBC1D1 was isolated from C2C12 myotubes on day 4 of differentiation. Ten-cm plates of cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then left untreated or treated with 160 nm insulin for 15 min or 1 mm AICAR for 45 min. Each plate was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 0.6 ml of SDS lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mg/ml SDS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, with protease inhibitors 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm EP475, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and held at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, the sulfhydryl groups were capped by adding 15 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The SDS lysate from three plates was diluted with 9.6 ml 2.6% nonionic detergent nonaethyleneglycol dodecyl ether, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with 15 μg antibody against TBC1D1 for 4 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were collected by mixing with 40 μl protein A-Sepharose beads for 12 h. The immune complexes were released from the beads with reducing SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. By visual comparison with known amounts of protein standards, ∼500 ng of TBC1D1 were isolated from three 10-cm plates. For mass spectrometric analysis, the gel bands containing TBC1D1 were split into thirds and digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase to maximize coverage. Peptide sequence analysis of each digestion mixture was performed by microcapillary, reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with nanospray tandem mass spectrometry on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Preliminary sequencing of peptides was facilitated with the SEQUEST algorithm with a 30 ppm mass tolerance against the MGI mouse subset of Uniprot Knowledgebase, concatenated to a reverse decoy data base. Peptides were accepted with a mass error <2.5 ppm and score thresholds to attain an estimated false discovery rate of 1%. Data sets for all digest results were combined in silico, culled of minor contaminating keratin or autolytic peptide spectra, and re-searched with SEQUEST against the TBC1D1 sequence without taking into account enzyme specificity and with differential modifications of phosphorylated tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues. The discovery of phosphopeptides and subsequent manual confirmation of their spectra were facilitated in-house versions of programs MuQuest, GraphMod, and FuzzyIons (Proteomics Browser Suite, ThermoFisher Scientific). For immunoblot analysis, SDS samples of C2C12 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were prepared by washing plates with phosphate-buffered saline and scraping the cells into SDS sample buffer with 10 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors, and holding the samples at 100 °C for 5 min. The concentration of protein in the samples was determined by the precipitating Lowry assay (11Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed using antibodies to the protein of interest followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein bands were detected using SuperSignal West Pico ECL (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and Kodak BioMax XAR film (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY). The assay for the measurement of GLUT4 at the cell surface has been described in detail previously (12Lyons P.D. Peck G.R. Kettenbach A.N. Gerber S.A. Roudaia L. Lienhard G.E. Biosci. Rep. 2009; 29: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes on day 4 of differentiation were co-transfected with 75 μg of HA-GLUT4-GFP plasmid together with 10 μg of wild-type or mutant TBC1D1 plasmid plus 90 μg p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1 control plasmid, unless stated otherwise. On the next day, cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then left untreated or treated with 160 nm insulin for 30 min. In some experiments, cells were treated with 1 mm AICAR for 70 min or with the combination of AICAR for 70 min and insulin for the final 30 min. Cells were then analyzed for HA-GLUT4-GFP at the cell surface. The HA-GLUT4-GFP is a reporter form of GLUT4, in which the HA tag is located in the amino-terminal cell surface loop, and the GFP is located at the intracellular carboxyl terminus. HA-GLUT4-GFP at the cell surface was labeled with anti-HA followed by APC-conjugated secondary antibody. The adipocytes were then analyzed by flow cytometry. The ratio of APC to GFP fluorescence intensity was measured for ∼2,000 GFP-positive cells under each condition. The mean APC/GFP ratio was corrected for nonspecific binding of the APC-conjugated secondary antibody by subtracting the mean APC/GFP ratio for GFP-positive adipocytes labeled only with the secondary antibody. This corrected APC/GFP ratio is a measure of the relative amount of HA-GLUT4-GFP at the cell surface, normalized to the expression level of GFP in each cell. To compare replicate experiments done on different days, each experiment included a vector control, and the values for the amount of HA-GLUT4-GFP at the cell surface were normalized to the value for the vector control in the insulin state. By immunofluorescence of permeabilized cells, as described in Ref. 12Lyons P.D. Peck G.R. Kettenbach A.N. Gerber S.A. Roudaia L. Lienhard G.E. Biosci. Rep. 2009; 29: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, we determined that 97% of the cells expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP in our assay also expressed the FLAG-tagged TBC1D1. This assay has been described in detail previously (12Lyons P.D. Peck G.R. Kettenbach A.N. Gerber S.A. Roudaia L. Lienhard G.E. Biosci. Rep. 2009; 29: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes were co-transfected with HA-GLUT4-GFP and TBC1D1 plasmids as described above for the cell surface GLUT4 assay. On the next day, cells were serum-starved and then treated with 160 nm insulin for 15 min. Endogenous transferrin receptor at the cell surface was then labeled with antibody against the extracellular domain of the receptor, followed by the APC-conjugated secondary antibody. The mean APC fluorescence intensity of ∼2,000 GFP-positive cells was obtained using flow cytometry. This value was corrected for nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody by subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity of GFP-positive cells labeled only with the secondary antibody. The corrected value is a measure of the relative amount of endogenous transferrin receptor at the cell surface in the GFP-positive cells. In this assay, GFP serves as a marker for cells that are co-transfected and so also express TBC1D1. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis portion of the quadriceps femoris muscle were obtained under local anesthesia (5 mg/ml mepivacaine chloride) from healthy control subjects and type 2 diabetic patients. The study protocol was approved by the regional human ethical committee at Karolinska Institutet, and informed consent was received from all subjects before participation. The clinical characteristics of the subjects are given in supplemental Table 1. Muscle samples were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm NaP2O7, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm microstatin) and were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of each supernatant was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis for TBC1D1 or GAPDH. Bands were quantified by densitometry. Statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired, two-tailed t test. Previous studies have shown that TBC1D1 is strongly expressed in skeletal muscles of the mouse (5Chavez J.A. Roach W.G. Keller S.R. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

To find a cell system in which to examine TBC1D1, we assessed the expression of TBC1D1 upon differentiation of the mouse C2C12 line from myoblasts into myotubes. In this line, fusion of the myoblasts into myotubes is complete on approximately day 4 after switching to the differentiation medium. TBC1D1 increased ∼8-fold on day 2 of differentiation and remained at this level until day 8 (Fig. 1). A similar increase was seen for myogenin, a marker for differentiation (13Ariga M. Nedachi T. Katagiri H. Kanzaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10208-10220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The substantial expression of TBC1D1 in C2C12 myotubes allowed the use of these cells to identify sites on TBC1D1 that are phosphorylated in response to insulin, as well as to an activator of the protein kinase AMPK. Myotubes on day 4 of differentiation were left untreated or treated with insulin or the AMPK-activating agent AICAR. TBC1D1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE and digested with proteases, and phosphopeptides were characterized by mass spectrometry. Table 1 summarizes the results. A number of the sites are in the motifs characteristic for phosphorylation by the Akt kinase and/or by AMPK. Several of the sites have been identified previously. Taylor et al. (6Taylor E.B. An D. Kramer H.F. Yu H. Fujii N.L. Roeckl K.S. Bowles N. Hirshman M.F. Xie J. Feener E.P. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol.

We have reported that human TBC1D1 expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is phosphorylated on the sites corresponding to Thr-590 in response to insulin and to Ser-231 in the basal state as well as in response to insulin and AICAR (4Roach W.G.

A limitation of the data in Table 1 is that peptide coverage of TBC1D1 was incomplete (see the legend to Table 1), and quantification of the extent of phosphorylation on the sites was not performed. Nevertheless, the results in Table 1 indicate that insulin treatment of the C2C12 myotubes led to phosphorylation of Ser-489, Thr-499, and Ser-501 (Table 1), and the knowledge of these sites served as a basis for identifying sites that control the activity of TBC1D1 (see below).TABLE 1TBC1D1 phosphorylation sites identified by mass spectrometrySiteBasalInsulinAICARSite motifSer-145/Ser-146+Ser-229+pAktSer-231+AMPKSer-489+*AktSer-497**Thr-499+*pAktSer-501++pAktSer-519*Ser-521++Ser-559/Ser-560+AMPK(559)Ser-565*Thr-590+Akt, pAMPKSer-608*+Ser-621+++pAkt, pAMPKSer-660+++pAMPKSer-661**Ser-697/Ser-698/Ser-699++pAkt(697), pAMPK(697)Ser-700+++AMPKSer-1028*Tyr-1039***Thr-1218+++ Open table in a new tab Previously, we examined the effect of overexpression of an alternatively spliced, short version of TBC1D1 on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (4Roach W.G.

Chem. 2008; 283: 9187-9195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This short version of TBC1D1 differs from that found in muscle, in that the former lacks the exon encoding amino acids 631–724 (4Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Chavez J.A. Roach W.G. Keller S.R. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9787-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In those studies, we found that under our assay conditions, the short version of TBC1D1 almost completely inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (4Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Chavez J.A. Roach W.G. Keller S.R. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9187-9195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, the long version of TBC1D1, which was used here, almost completely inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation under our previous conditions, in which 100 μg of the TBC1D1 plasmid was co-transfected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 75 μg of the reporter HA-GLUT4-GFP plasmid (Fig. 2). Reduction in the amount of TBC1D1 plasmid used in the transfection resulted in lower expression of TBC1D1 protein (Fig. 2B) and correspondingly less inhibition of GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 2A). With 10 μg TBC1D1 plasmid, TBC1D1 expression was one-fourth that with 100 μg plasmid, and GLUT4 translocation was only inhibited by about 50%. This reduced inhibition of GLUT4 translocation with less TBC1D1 plasmid allowed examination for the first time of whether phosphorylation of TBC1D1 regulates its inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. To do so, we determined the effect of replacing with alanine the known sites of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. The T590A mutant (designated 1P mutant) caused a reduction in cell surface GLUT4 in the insulin state compared with the wild-type TBC1D1 (Fig. 3A). Introduction of combined T499A and S501A mutations into the 1P mutant (designated the 2P mutant) caused a further substantial reduction in cell surface GLUT4 (Fig. 3A). Finally, introduction of the S489A mutation into the 2P mutant (designated 3P mutant) caused only a very slight further reduction in cell surface GLUT4. These results thus indicate that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr-590 and Thr-499 and/or Ser-501 reduce the inhibitory effect of TBC1D1 on GLUT4 translocation. The insulin-stimulated increase in GLUT4 at the cell surface in the presence of the 3P mutant was only 28% of the increase that occurred in the presence of wild-type TBC1D1. In these experiments, the level of expression of the wild-type and mutant forms of TBC1D1 was the same (Fig. 3B). This finding excludes higher expression of the mutants as an explanation for the results. The GAP domain of TBC1D1 contains an Arg residue that is critical for its activity. Mutation of this residue to Lys completely inactivates the GAP activity (4Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that the short form of TBC1D1 with the R941K mutation did not inhibit GLUT4 translocation (4Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This result indicated that inhibition required the functional GAP domain. Here, we examined the effect of the same mutation in the long form of TBC1D1, as well as in the 3P mutant thereof. Both of these mutants largely, although not entirely, restored GLUT4 at the cell surface to the level seen with the vector control (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that inhibition by both the wild-type TBC1D1 and 3P mutant largely depends upon a functional GAP domain. Each of the mutants was equally expressed compared with the wild-type TBC1D1 (Fig. 4B). In a previous study, we reported that activation of AMPK with AICAR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes partially relieved the inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation caused by the short version of TBC1D1 (5Chavez J.A. Roach W.G. Keller S.R. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9187-9195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the same conditions, which led to maximal AMPK activation, to examine the effect of AMPK activation on inhibition by the long version of TBC1D1 and its 3P mutant. The combination of AICAR and insulin led to 1.6- and 2.0-fold increases in the amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface for the wild-type TBC1D1 and 3P mutant, respectively, compared with the increase with insulin alone (Fig. 5). As was the case in Figs. 3 and 4, in these experiments it was established by immunoblotting that the wild-type TBC1D1 and 3P mutant were equally expressed (data not shown). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the transferrin receptor undergoes continuous recycling between the endosomal system and the cell surface. Insulin treatment causes an ∼2-fold increase in transferrin receptor at the cell surface, mainly by stimulation of its rate of exocytosis (14Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether TBC1D1 regulated the constitutive recycling system, we examined the effect of ectopic expression of wild-type TBC1D1 and its 3P mutant on the amount of endogenous transferrin receptor at the cell surface. As expected, in the vector control, insulin increased the amount of cell surface transferrin receptor 68 ± 1% (Fig. 6). Compared with the vector contol, cells expressing wild-type TBC1D1 showed the same amount of cell surface transferrin receptor in the basal state, but a trend toward less in the insulin-stimulated state, such that insulin caused an increase of 54 ± 9% (Fig. 6). Cells expressing the 3P mutant showed a modest reduction of cell surface transferrin receptor in both the basal and insulin-stimulated state, with the net result that insulin caused a 47 ± 3% increase (Fig. 6). Thus, relative to the vector control, the 3P mutant reduced the insulin-stimulated increase in cell surface transferrin receptor from 68% to 47% (p < 0.05), which constitutes a 31% reduction in the insulin stimulation. By contrast, the inhibitory effect of the 3P mutant on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was much more marked. The average insulin-stimulated increases in cell surface GLUT4 over the basal value were 1,160% for the vector control and 220% in the presence of the 3P mutant (data from Figs. 3A and 4A), and hence the 3P mutant caused an 81% reduction in GLUT4 translocation.

In high light, these plants was more susceptible to photoinhibition than wild-type plants. Also oxygen-evolving activity of isolated thylakoid membranes from the PTOX-overexpressing plants was more strongly inhibited in high light than in thylakoids from wild-type plants. In contrast in low light, in the PTOX overexpressor, the thylakoids were protected against photoinhibition while in wild type they were significantly damaged. The production of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals was shown by EPR spin-trapping techniques in the different samples. Superoxide and hydroxyl radical production was stimulated in the overexpressor. Two-thirds of the superoxide production was maintained in the presence of DNP-INT, an inhibitor of the cytochrome b(6)f complex. No increase of the SOD content was observed in the overexpressor compared with the wild type. We propose that superoxide is produced by PTOX in a side reaction and that PTOX can only act as a safety valve under stress conditions when the generated superoxide is detoxified by an efficient antioxidant system."

However, the mechanisms associated with ATM recruitment remain ill defined. Herein, we describe in vitro chemotaxis studies, in which adipocyte conditioned medium was used to stimulate macrophage migration. We demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor α and free fatty acids, key inflammatory stimuli involved in obesity-associated autocrine/paracrine inflammatory signaling, stimulate adipocyte expression and secretion of macrophage chemoattractants. Pharmacological studies showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonists and glucocorticoids potently inhibit adipocyte- induced recruitment of macrophages. This latter effect was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor, which led to decreased chemokine secretion and expression. In vivo results were quite comparable; treatment of high fat diet-fed mice with dexamethasone prevented ATM accumulation in epididymal fat. This decrease in ATM was most pronounced for the proinflammatory F4/80+, CD11b+, CD11c+ M-1-like ATM subset. Overall, our results elucidate a beneficial function of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activation and glucocorticoid receptor/glucocorticoids in adipose tissue and indicate that pharmacologic prevention of ATM accumulation could be beneficial.

IntroductionObesity is associated with various metabolic abnormalities characterized as the metabolic syndrome or syndrome X (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). These abnormalities are causally related to type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and coronary heart disease (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate that the metabolic syndrome and its disease manifestations are linked to adipose tissue inflammation, which results from infiltration and accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages (3Patsouris D. Li P.P. Thapar D. Chapman J. Olefsky J.M. Neels J.G. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Since numerous genetic manipulations of myeloid-derived cells in knock-out mice have clearly demonstrated the role of macrophage-mediated inflammation in insulin resistance/diabetes, strategies to interfere with macrophage migration could have clinical benefit (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar).In inflammatory diseases, the secretion of specific chemoattractants, termed chemokines, mediates leukocyte recruitment. The chemokine family consists of numerous members (>50) that can be divided into two major subfamilies based on characteristic amino acid sequences (CCL versus CXCL). Specific monocyte/macrophage chemokines from the CCL subfamily have been identified, including CCL2 (MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1)). Leukocyte recruitment is regulated by the expression of the corresponding chemokine receptor (CCR versus CXCR) on specific myeloid cell types. Chemokine and cytokine expression are tightly linked and are typically stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines (4Mantovani A. Sica A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Vecchi A. Locati M.

Interestingly, in obese, insulin resistance states, such cytokines are elevated in adipose tissue, and this correlates with increased macrophage accumulation.

In particular, insulin-sensitizing TZD PPARγ agonists, such as rosiglitazone, exert broad anti-inflammatory properties in macrophages (15Pascual G. Fong A.L. Ogawa S. Gamliel A. Li A.C. Perissi V.

In addition to PPARγ agonists, GR, liver X receptor α, PPARα, and PPARβ/δ agonists can have anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages (16Glass C.K. Ogawa S. Nat. Rev.

Whether these nuclear hormone receptor agonists display similar anti-inflammatory properties directly in adipocytes is not fully understood.In the current studies, we used an in vitro chemotaxis assay to investigate the mechanisms underlying macrophage recruitment by mature adipocytes (21Yu R. Kim C.S. Kwon B.S. Kawada T. Obesity. 2006; 14: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). First, we demonstrate that proinflammatory stimuli, such as TNFα and free fatty acids (FFAs), increased the ability of adipocytes to release chemokines that induce chemotaxis. TZDs and glucocorticoids potently inhibited macrophage recruitment. The ability of glucocorticoids to interfere with chemotaxis was also observed in vivo, since treatment of obese mice with dexamethasone led to decreased ATM accumulation.DISCUSSIONChronic tissue inflammation is recognized as a key component of obesity- related insulin resistance (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). It is also known that there is an increased content of macrophages in adipose tissue in obesity and that these proinflammatory macrophages are an important cause of the inflammation- induced insulin resistance (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Macrophages must undergo migration into tissues before they can accumulate, and the mechanisms underlying chemotaxis of macrophages into adipose tissue are poorly understood. In these studies, we have focused on the process of macrophage migration and, specifically, the ability of adipocytes to stimulate the process of macrophage chemotaxis. In these studies, we found that inflammatory stimuli, such as TNFα and FFAs, promote adipocyte secretion of chemokines into the medium, which, in turn, induces chemotaxis of macrophages. Treatment of adipocytes with anti-inflammatory nuclear hormone ligands suppresses chemokine expression, secretion, and macrophage migration. Among the chemokines studied, RANTES and MIP1α responded most dramatically to proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals. Of the receptors tested, GR agonism gave the most robust anti-inflammatory effects, followed by PPARγ activation. These studies directly show that the secretion of chemokines by adipocytes is under the control of pro- and anti-inflammatory signals and demonstrates the powerful effects of GR and PPARγ agonists on this process. In vivo treatment studies in mice confirm the potent effects of dexamethasone to inhibit macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue.It is of interest that dexamethasone exerts the most potent effects of all compounds tested to inhibit chemokine expression, secretion, and macrophage chemotaxis and markedly restricts macrophage content of adipose tissue in the context of obesity and insulin resistance. If this were the only effect of dexamethasone, one would expect improved glucose tolerance and a reduction in insulin resistance. However, independent of their anti-inflammatory effects, GR agonists have well known prodiabetic effects, mediated through entirely different mechanisms. These diabetogenic effects include stimulation of the gluconeogenic program in hepatocytes as well as decreased insulin signaling and Glut4 expression in adipocytes and muscle cells (44Reynolds R.M. Walker B.R. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2003; 5: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Andrews R.C. Walker B.R. Clin. Sci. 1999; 96: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). If a selected GR agonist can be identified, lacking the diabetogenic effects, then such an agent could be a potent insulin-sensitizing compound.These studies of in vitro chemotaxis clearly demonstrate that both adipocytes and macrophages secrete chemokines into the medium, which stimulates macrophage migration. Since there are multiple chemokines that reciprocally respond to proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, the effects of the different chemokines on chemotaxis are likely to be combinatorial, with no single chemokine essential for the entire CM effects. Since both adipocytes and macrophages secrete chemokines, the results are consistent with a model in which stimuli, such as enlarging adipocytes, microhypoxia, ER stress, etc., activate inflammatory programs within adipocytes, leading to secretion of chemokines, which cause migration of macrophages. In turn, the recruited ATMs then release their own chemokines, which leads to a further increase in macrophage migration and even greater accumulation of ATMs in a feed-forward manner.As illustrated through the expression of keratinocyte-derived chemokine, a known neutrophil chemoattractant, and RANTES, a macrophage/lymphocyte chemoattractant, adipocytes have the intrinsic property to recruit various leukocytes (i.e. neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages). The early accumulation of neutrophils in eWAT of DIO mice was recently described; however, their involvement in insulin resistance is not established to date. Three recent publications demonstrate an increase in proinflammatory and/or a decrease in anti-inflammatory lymphocytes in eWAT of mice fed a high fat diet (46Nishimura S. Manabe I. Nagasaki M. Eto K. Yamashita H. Ohsugi M. Otsu M. Hara K. Ueki K. Sugiura S. Yoshimura K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 47Winer S. Chan Y.

Med. 2009; 15: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). These lymphocytes were identified in adipose tissue prior to M1 macrophage detection. Furthermore, Nishimura et al. (46Nishimura S. Manabe I. Nagasaki M. Eto K. Yamashita H. Ohsugi M. Otsu M. Hara K. Ueki K. Sugiura S. Yoshimura K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the interplay between lymphocytes and adipocytes leads to the secretion of factors that induce monocyte maturation and recruitment. It might hence be of particular interest to study the role of lymphocyte-specific cytokines, such as interferon-γ, on adipocytes and subsequent chemokine secretion. However, since adipocytes are clearly present before proinflammatory lymphocytes, they are probably the primary agent that relays the signal inducing leukocyte recruitment.The adipose tissue expansion and adipocyte hypertrophy with obesity is accompanied by the accumulation of ATMs, and some have proposed a role for ATMs in mediating, or at least facilitating, the processes necessary for adipose tissue expansion (49Neels J.G. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we find that dexamethasone treatment greatly decreases ATM content at the same time that it stimulates increased fat pad mass. This disconnect between ATM content and adipose tissue expansion is not consistent with a necessary role of ATMs in the processes of adipocyte hypertrophy and expansion, indicating that these events occur independently of macrophages.Although MCP1 released by adipocytes and macrophages is clearly an important component in macrophage chemotaxis, it is interesting that the CCR5 ligands MIP1α and RANTES respond most robustly to inflammatory signals and are suppressed the most by the anti-inflammatory PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone and GR ligand dexamethasone. This is consistent with recent findings that the CD11c-positive M1-like macrophage subset expresses higher levels of CCR5 than do alternatively activated macrophages (50Wu H. Ghosh S. Perrard X.D. Feng L. Garcia G.E. Perrard J.L. Sweeney J.F. Peterson L.E. Chan L. Smith C.W. Ballantyne C.M. Circulation. 2007; 115: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The concept that the five chemokines we have measured work in a combinatorial, reinforcing fashion is supported by the fact that MCP1 alone induces substantial macrophage chemotaxis but that neutralization of MCP1 only abrogates a portion (∼40%) of the chemotactic effect of CM. Since the effects of chemokines on macrophage migration are combinatorial, an effective anti-inflammatory therapeutic for inflammation/insulin resistance should broadly inhibit chemokine secretion. IntroductionObesity is associated with various metabolic abnormalities characterized as the metabolic syndrome or syndrome X (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin.

These abnormalities are causally related to type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and coronary heart disease (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin.

Recent findings indicate that the metabolic syndrome and its disease manifestations are linked to adipose tissue inflammation, which results from infiltration and accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages (3Patsouris D.

Since numerous genetic manipulations of myeloid-derived cells in knock-out mice have clearly demonstrated the role of macrophage-mediated inflammation in insulin resistance/diabetes, strategies to interfere with macrophage migration could have clinical benefit (1Schenk S.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar).In inflammatory diseases, the secretion of specific chemoattractants, termed chemokines, mediates leukocyte recruitment. The chemokine family consists of numerous members (>50) that can be divided into two major subfamilies based on characteristic amino acid sequences (CCL versus CXCL). Specific monocyte/macrophage chemokines from the CCL subfamily have been identified, including CCL2 (MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1)). Leukocyte recruitment is regulated by the expression of the corresponding chemokine receptor (CCR versus CXCR) on specific myeloid cell types. Chemokine and cytokine expression are tightly linked and are typically stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines (4Mantovani A. Sica A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Vecchi A. Locati M.

TZDs and glucocorticoids potently inhibited macrophage recruitment. The ability of glucocorticoids to interfere with chemotaxis was also observed in vivo, since treatment of obese mice with dexamethasone led to decreased ATM accumulation. DISCUSSIONChronic tissue inflammation is recognized as a key component of obesity- related insulin resistance (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). It is also known that there is an increased content of macrophages in adipose tissue in obesity and that these proinflammatory macrophages are an important cause of the inflammation- induced insulin resistance (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Macrophages must undergo migration into tissues before they can accumulate, and the mechanisms underlying chemotaxis of macrophages into adipose tissue are poorly understood. In these studies, we have focused on the process of macrophage migration and, specifically, the ability of adipocytes to stimulate the process of macrophage chemotaxis. In these studies, we found that inflammatory stimuli, such as TNFα and FFAs, promote adipocyte secretion of chemokines into the medium, which, in turn, induces chemotaxis of macrophages. Treatment of adipocytes with anti-inflammatory nuclear hormone ligands suppresses chemokine expression, secretion, and macrophage migration. Among the chemokines studied, RANTES and MIP1α responded most dramatically to proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals. Of the receptors tested, GR agonism gave the most robust anti-inflammatory effects, followed by PPARγ activation. These studies directly show that the secretion of chemokines by adipocytes is under the control of pro- and anti-inflammatory signals and demonstrates the powerful effects of GR and PPARγ agonists on this process. In vivo treatment studies in mice confirm the potent effects of dexamethasone to inhibit macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue.It is of interest that dexamethasone exerts the most potent effects of all compounds tested to inhibit chemokine expression, secretion, and macrophage chemotaxis and markedly restricts macrophage content of adipose tissue in the context of obesity and insulin resistance. If this were the only effect of dexamethasone, one would expect improved glucose tolerance and a reduction in insulin resistance. However, independent of their anti-inflammatory effects, GR agonists have well known prodiabetic effects, mediated through entirely different mechanisms. These diabetogenic effects include stimulation of the gluconeogenic program in hepatocytes as well as decreased insulin signaling and Glut4 expression in adipocytes and muscle cells (44Reynolds R.M. Walker B.R. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2003; 5: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Andrews R.C. Walker B.R. Clin. Sci. 1999; 96: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). If a selected GR agonist can be identified, lacking the diabetogenic effects, then such an agent could be a potent insulin-sensitizing compound.These studies of in vitro chemotaxis clearly demonstrate that both adipocytes and macrophages secrete chemokines into the medium, which stimulates macrophage migration. Since there are multiple chemokines that reciprocally respond to proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, the effects of the different chemokines on chemotaxis are likely to be combinatorial, with no single chemokine essential for the entire CM effects. Since both adipocytes and macrophages secrete chemokines, the results are consistent with a model in which stimuli, such as enlarging adipocytes, microhypoxia, ER stress, etc., activate inflammatory programs within adipocytes, leading to secretion of chemokines, which cause migration of macrophages. In turn, the recruited ATMs then release their own chemokines, which leads to a further increase in macrophage migration and even greater accumulation of ATMs in a feed-forward manner.As illustrated through the expression of keratinocyte-derived chemokine, a known neutrophil chemoattractant, and RANTES, a macrophage/lymphocyte chemoattractant, adipocytes have the intrinsic property to recruit various leukocytes (i.e. neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages). The early accumulation of neutrophils in eWAT of DIO mice was recently described; however, their involvement in insulin resistance is not established to date. Three recent publications demonstrate an increase in proinflammatory and/or a decrease in anti-inflammatory lymphocytes in eWAT of mice fed a high fat diet (46Nishimura S. Manabe I. Nagasaki M. Eto K. Yamashita H. Ohsugi M. Otsu M. Hara K. Ueki K. Sugiura S. Yoshimura K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 47Winer S. Chan Y. Paltser G. Truong D. Tsui H. Bahrami J. Dorfman R. Wang Y. Zielenski J. Mastronardi F. Maezawa Y. Drucker D.J. Engleman E. Winer D. Dosch H.M. Nat.

Med. 2009; 15: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). These lymphocytes were identified in adipose tissue prior to M1 macrophage detection. Furthermore, Nishimura et al. (46Nishimura S. Manabe I. Nagasaki M. Eto K. Yamashita H. Ohsugi M. Otsu M. Hara K. Ueki K. Sugiura S. Yoshimura K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the interplay between lymphocytes and adipocytes leads to the secretion of factors that induce monocyte maturation and recruitment. It might hence be of particular interest to study the role of lymphocyte-specific cytokines, such as interferon-γ, on adipocytes and subsequent chemokine secretion. However, since adipocytes are clearly present before proinflammatory lymphocytes, they are probably the primary agent that relays the signal inducing leukocyte recruitment.The adipose tissue expansion and adipocyte hypertrophy with obesity is accompanied by the accumulation of ATMs, and some have proposed a role for ATMs in mediating, or at least facilitating, the processes necessary for adipose tissue expansion (49Neels J.G. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we find that dexamethasone treatment greatly decreases ATM content at the same time that it stimulates increased fat pad mass. This disconnect between ATM content and adipose tissue expansion is not consistent with a necessary role of ATMs in the processes of adipocyte hypertrophy and expansion, indicating that these events occur independently of macrophages.Although MCP1 released by adipocytes and macrophages is clearly an important component in macrophage chemotaxis, it is interesting that the CCR5 ligands MIP1α and RANTES respond most robustly to inflammatory signals and are suppressed the most by the anti-inflammatory PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone and GR ligand dexamethasone. This is consistent with recent findings that the CD11c-positive M1-like macrophage subset expresses higher levels of CCR5 than do alternatively activated macrophages (50Wu H. Ghosh S. Perrard X.D. Feng L. Garcia G.E. Perrard J.L. Sweeney J.F. Peterson L.E. Chan L. Smith C.W. Ballantyne C.M. Circulation. 2007; 115: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The concept that the five chemokines we have measured work in a combinatorial, reinforcing fashion is supported by the fact that MCP1 alone induces substantial macrophage chemotaxis but that neutralization of MCP1 only abrogates a portion (∼40%) of the chemotactic effect of CM. Since the effects of chemokines on macrophage migration are combinatorial, an effective anti-inflammatory therapeutic for inflammation/insulin resistance should broadly inhibit chemokine secretion. Chronic tissue inflammation is recognized as a key component of obesity- related insulin resistance (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). It is also known that there is an increased content of macrophages in adipose tissue in obesity and that these proinflammatory macrophages are an important cause of the inflammation- induced insulin resistance (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Macrophages must undergo migration into tissues before they can accumulate, and the mechanisms underlying chemotaxis of macrophages into adipose tissue are poorly understood. In these studies, we have focused on the process of macrophage migration and, specifically, the ability of adipocytes to stimulate the process of macrophage chemotaxis. In these studies, we found that inflammatory stimuli, such as TNFα and FFAs, promote adipocyte secretion of chemokines into the medium, which, in turn, induces chemotaxis of macrophages. Treatment of adipocytes with anti-inflammatory nuclear hormone ligands suppresses chemokine expression, secretion, and macrophage migration. Among the chemokines studied, RANTES and MIP1α responded most dramatically to proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals. Of the receptors tested, GR agonism gave the most robust anti-inflammatory effects, followed by PPARγ activation. These studies directly show that the secretion of chemokines by adipocytes is under the control of pro- and anti-inflammatory signals and demonstrates the powerful effects of GR and PPARγ agonists on this process. In vivo treatment studies in mice confirm the potent effects of dexamethasone to inhibit macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue. It is of interest that dexamethasone exerts the most potent effects of all compounds tested to inhibit chemokine expression, secretion, and macrophage chemotaxis and markedly restricts macrophage content of adipose tissue in the context of obesity and insulin resistance. If this were the only effect of dexamethasone, one would expect improved glucose tolerance and a reduction in insulin resistance. However, independent of their anti-inflammatory effects, GR agonists have well known prodiabetic effects, mediated through entirely different mechanisms. These diabetogenic effects include stimulation of the gluconeogenic program in hepatocytes as well as decreased insulin signaling and Glut4 expression in adipocytes and muscle cells (44Reynolds R.M. Walker B.R. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2003; 5: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Andrews R.C. Walker B.R. Clin. Sci. 1999; 96: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). If a selected GR agonist can be identified, lacking the diabetogenic effects, then such an agent could be a potent insulin-sensitizing compound. These studies of in vitro chemotaxis clearly demonstrate that both adipocytes and macrophages secrete chemokines into the medium, which stimulates macrophage migration. Since there are multiple chemokines that reciprocally respond to proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, the effects of the different chemokines on chemotaxis are likely to be combinatorial, with no single chemokine essential for the entire CM effects. Since both adipocytes and macrophages secrete chemokines, the results are consistent with a model in which stimuli, such as enlarging adipocytes, microhypoxia, ER stress, etc., activate inflammatory programs within adipocytes, leading to secretion of chemokines, which cause migration of macrophages. In turn, the recruited ATMs then release their own chemokines, which leads to a further increase in macrophage migration and even greater accumulation of ATMs in a feed-forward manner. As illustrated through the expression of keratinocyte-derived chemokine, a known neutrophil chemoattractant, and RANTES, a macrophage/lymphocyte chemoattractant, adipocytes have the intrinsic property to recruit various leukocytes (i.e. neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages). The early accumulation of neutrophils in eWAT of DIO mice was recently described; however, their involvement in insulin resistance is not established to date. Three recent publications demonstrate an increase in proinflammatory and/or a decrease in anti-inflammatory lymphocytes in eWAT of mice fed a high fat diet (46Nishimura S. Manabe I. Nagasaki M. Eto K. Yamashita H. Ohsugi M. Otsu M. Hara K. Ueki K. Sugiura S. Yoshimura K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 47Winer S. Chan Y. Paltser G. Truong D. Tsui H. Bahrami J. Dorfman R. Wang Y. Zielenski J. Mastronardi F. Maezawa Y. Drucker D.J. Engleman E. Winer D. Dosch H.M. Nat.

Med. 2009; 15: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). These lymphocytes were identified in adipose tissue prior to M1 macrophage detection. Furthermore, Nishimura et al. (46Nishimura S. Manabe I. Nagasaki M. Eto K. Yamashita H. Ohsugi M. Otsu M. Hara K. Ueki K. Sugiura S. Yoshimura K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the interplay between lymphocytes and adipocytes leads to the secretion of factors that induce monocyte maturation and recruitment. It might hence be of particular interest to study the role of lymphocyte-specific cytokines, such as interferon-γ, on adipocytes and subsequent chemokine secretion. However, since adipocytes are clearly present before proinflammatory lymphocytes, they are probably the primary agent that relays the signal inducing leukocyte recruitment. The adipose tissue expansion and adipocyte hypertrophy with obesity is accompanied by the accumulation of ATMs, and some have proposed a role for ATMs in mediating, or at least facilitating, the processes necessary for adipose tissue expansion (49Neels J.G. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we find that dexamethasone treatment greatly decreases ATM content at the same time that it stimulates increased fat pad mass. This disconnect between ATM content and adipose tissue expansion is not consistent with a necessary role of ATMs in the processes of adipocyte hypertrophy and expansion, indicating that these events occur independently of macrophages. Although MCP1 released by adipocytes and macrophages is clearly an important component in macrophage chemotaxis, it is interesting that the CCR5 ligands MIP1α and RANTES respond most robustly to inflammatory signals and are suppressed the most by the anti-inflammatory PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone and GR ligand dexamethasone.

Dynamic self-assembly of the ATPase appears to enable active partition of replicon copies into cell-halves, but for Walker-box partition ATPases the molecular mechanism is unknown. ATPase activity appears to be essential for this process. DNA and centromere-binding proteins are known to stimulate the ATPase activity but molecular details of the stimulation mechanism have not been reported. We have investigated the interactions which stimulate ATP hydrolysis by the SopA partition ATPase of plasmid F. By using SopA and SopB proteins deficient in DNA binding, we have found that the intrinsic ability of SopA to hydrolyze ATP requires direct DNA binding by SopA but not by SopB. Our results show that two independent interactions of SopA act in synergy to stimulate its ATPase. SopA must interact with (i) DNA, through its ATP-dependent nonspecific DNA binding domain and (ii) SopB, which we show here to provide an arginine-finger motif. In addition, the latter interaction stimulates ATPase maximally when SopB is part of the partition complex. Hence, our data demonstrate that DNA acts on SopA in two ways, directly as nonspecific DNA and through SopB as centromeric DNA, to fully activate SopA ATP hydrolysis.

Faithful segregation of low copy number plasmids in bacteria depends on partition loci, named Par. Such loci are composed of two genes, generically termed parA and parB, encoding an ATPase and a DNA-binding protein, respectively, and a cis-acting centromeric site parS (reviewed in Ref. 1Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These three essential elements are sufficient for the partition process. ParBs assemble on parS to form nucleoprotein structures called partition complexes (2Hayakawa Y. Murotsu T. Matsubara K. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 349-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Funnell B.E.

ParA ATPases are considered to be motors that direct displacement and positioning of partition complexes inside the cell. Partition systems have been classified into two major types, distinguished by the nature of their ATPase proteins (7Gerdes K. Møller-Jensen J. Bugge Jensen R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Type I is characterized by Walker box ATPases, which are specified by many plasmids and most bacterial chromosomes. In some (Type Ia) the nucleotide-binding P-loop is preceded by an N-terminal regulatory domain, in the others (Type Ib) it is not. Type II specifies actin-like ATPases and is present on relatively few plasmids. It is presently the best understood system at the molecular level (8van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D.

Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism that drives partition still remains elusive for both systems. Our work aims at the understanding of an archetypal representative of Type Ia, namely SopABC of the Escherichia coli plasmid F. The several activities of Type Ia ParA proteins are regulated by binding of adenine nucleotides (11Bouet J.Y. Funnell B.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which induce conformational changes in the proteins (13Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15286-15292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Libante V. Thion L. Lane D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In their apo and/or ADP-bound forms these proteins display site-specific DNA binding activity, recognizing their cognate promoters through their N-terminal domains. Such activity is involved in the autoregulation of par operon expression (15Mori H. Mori Y. Ichinose C. Niki H. Ogura T. Kato A. Hiraga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15535-15541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Friedman S.A. Austin S.J. Plasmid. 1988; 19: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the ATP-bound form, they specifically interact with cognate partition complexes through contact with ParB proteins. The ATP-bound form of type I ParAs spontaneously forms polymers, which appear as bundled filaments in electron micrographs (12Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Barillà D. Rosenberg M.F. Nobbmann U. Hayes F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The role of these filaments is not understood but they could be related to the rapid movement of partition complexes in the cell. In vivo, ParA proteins form dynamic assemblies that move back and forth in the cell if the cognate ParB protein and parS centromere are present (20Marston A.L. Errington J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The link between this oscillatory behavior and the segregation of partition complexes is not clear. They both require the ATPase activity of ParA proteins but the role of ATP hydrolysis in the partition process is not understood. It has long been known that ParA partition proteins exhibit low intrinsic ATPase activity (24Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe E. Wachi M. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis is modestly stimulated by either DNA or the cognate ParB alone but is strongly activated (up to 35-fold) when both DNA and ParBs are present (12Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe E. Wachi M. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The lack of major stimulation of ATPase by DNA in the absence of ParB proteins has been taken to mean that the DNA-bound form of ParB is the effective activator (26Leonard T.A. Butler P.J. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, incorporation of centromere sites in the DNA added to ParB did not increase stimulation of ATPase (24Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe E. Wachi M. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), leaving doubts as to the role of the partition complex in ATPase activation. The mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis acts in the partition process is not known for type I systems. This is in marked contrast to actin-based partition ATPases whose ATPase activity is stimulated in growing filaments (8van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), where it provokes the rapid disassembly of filaments unless these are capped by the cognate partition complex (9Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, for the type II partition system, ATP hydrolysis ensures discrimination between unproductive filaments that are rapidly disassembled and productive filaments that drive partition complexes to opposite ends of the cell. This dynamic instability, which ensures elongation of actin-like filaments only between two partition complexes to be segregated, thus provides regulation of the partition process. Recently, it has been shown that two members of the type I ParA family, Soj of Thermus thermophilus and SopA of plasmid F, bind nonspecific DNA in the presence of ATP (12Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Leonard T.A. Butler P.J. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Two studies revealed that this DNA binding activity is essential for partition (27Hester C.M. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20326-20331Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Castaing J.P. Bouet J.Y. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1000-1011PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, it has been shown that a SopA mutant deficient in DNA binding no longer stimulates ATP hydrolysis efficiently, suggesting that DNA could play a direct role in the regulation of the ATPase activity (28Castaing J.P. Bouet J.Y. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1000-1011PubMed Google Scholar). This finding raises the issue of the interactions required for activation of the type I partition ATPase activity by cognate proteins and DNA. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of activation of ATP hydrolysis by SopA. First, we have found that the formation of the F partition complex is required for strong stimulation of the SopA intrinsic ATPase activity. We have also found that the partition complex and DNA stimulate ATP hydrolysis independently but that these two independent interactions act in synergy to amplify SopA ATPase activity. Lastly, we have identified an arginine finger motif in SopB responsible for the stimulation of SopA ATPase activity. Plasmids used are listed in supplemental Table S3). pJYB57 was made by inserting the sopC sequence, amplified by PCR from pDAG114 (29Bouet J.Y. Rech J. Egloff S. Biek D.P. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), into pBSKS(+) using EcoRV and EcoRI restriction sites. pYAS6 is a pTYBI derivative (NEBioLabs) into which, the sopB-G324 gene, PCR amplified from pDAG170 (30Bouet J.Y. Bouvier M. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was inserted using NdeI and SapI restriction sites. sopB mutations were introduced into pYAS6 by mutagenic primer-directed replication using the Stratagene QuikChange kit and were verified by sequencing. Native SopA protein was purified as described (12Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Intein-tagged SopB-G324 and mutant proteins were purified from strain C2833 (NEBioLabs) as follows: overnight cultures grown at 30 °C in LB were diluted 100-fold and incubated at 42 °C. At A600 0.5–0.8, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.4 mm; incubation was continued at 30 °C for 4 h or, for SopB*1/*2/*3, at 20 °C for 16–20 h. Cells were lysed by sonication in B buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 10 μg·ml−1 lysozyme. The lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml chitin column and washed successively with 15 ml of B buffer, 50 ml of 1 m NaCl in B buffer, and 15 ml of B buffer. The column was then quickly equilibrated with 15 ml of 50 mm dithiothreitol in B buffer, and stored at 4 °C for 16–20 h to allow protein cleavage. After elution, proteins were dialyzed against S buffer (12Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), loaded onto a mono-S column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 50–600 mm KCl gradient in S buffer. SopB fractions were kept at −80 °C. SopB-N52 was purified as an intein-tagged peptide as above, except that the final mono-S step was replaced by an amicon ultra 15–30K concentration step, and the flow-through was concentrated on a Vivaspin 6K filter device (Sartorius).

Chromatographs were developed with 1 m formic acid/0.5 m LiCl. EMSA were performed using 1 nm radiolabeled DNA probes, and binding reaction products were resolved at 4 °C by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels in TGE (25 mm Tris base, 190 mm glycine, 10 mm EDTA) for 4 h at 180 V. electromobility shift assay helix turn helix nonspecific DNA arginine finger surface plasmon resonance resonance unit wild type. Binding and kinetic studies were performed using a Biacore 3000. Immobilization steps of biotinylated DNA probes, performed on a streptavidin-coated sensorchip in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20), were stopped when 498 RU of 136-bp DNA probe (reference) and 503 RU of 136-bp sopC DNA probe were obtained. Binding analyses were performed with multiple injections of different protein concentrations at 25 °C. Samples, diluted in BD buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg·ml−1 sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), were injected at 10 μl·min−1 over both sensor surfaces at the same time for 180 s. Reference sensorgrams were subtracted from sensorgrams obtained with the 136-bp sopC DNA probe to yield true binding responses. Kinetic constants were calculated using BIAevaluation 4.0.1 software. To determine whether DNA could play a direct role in SopA ATPase activity, we first standardized our ATP hydrolysis assay. The results in Fig. 1A (left panel) show that the intrinsic SopA ATPase activity (0.3 mol/h/mol) is moderately activated both by DNA (2-fold) and by SopB (∼3-fold) and is highly activated (43-fold) when nonspecific DNA (NS DNA) and SopB are added together. These results are equivalent to those obtained previously (12Bouet J.Y. Ah-Seng Y. Benmeradi N. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe E. Wachi M. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to previous reports that ATPase stimulation was indifferent to the presence of the cognate centromere (24Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe E. Wachi M. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we found that use of sopC-containing DNA with SopB raised the level of ATPase activation to 122-fold (36 mol/h/mol), 3 times higher than with NS DNA (Fig. 1A). Without SopB, such activation does not occur. The disparity between this and the earlier observations motivated us to clarify the “centromeric effect” observed in our conditions. We assayed SopA ATPase activity in the presence of SopB as a function of DNA concentration (Fig. 1B). ATP hydrolysis increased in proportion to DNA concentration with both NS and sopC-containing DNA, reaching a plateau of maximal activation around 80 μg·ml−1. At this saturating DNA concentration, sopC-containing DNA still activates ATP hydrolysis to a 2.5-fold higher level than NS DNA, indicating that centromeric DNA is needed for maximal ATPase stimulation in our assay conditions. We then measured SopA ATP hydrolysis as a function of SopB concentration (Fig. 1C). ATPase activity rose sharply with increasing SopB concentration, reaching maximal activation at 6 μm. At this activation plateau ATP hydrolysis is still 35–40% higher with sopC-containing DNA than with NS DNA. At lower SopB concentrations, centromeric DNA is a much better ATPase activator than NS DNA; at 1 μm SopB, sopC-containing DNA activates SopA ATPase 6 times more strongly than NS DNA. Thus, the lower the concentration of SopB the more important sopC becomes for efficient activation of SopA ATPase. Taken together, these observations suggest strongly that the F partition complex, SopB bound to sopC centromere, is required for full activation of SopA ATPase activity, and reinforce the idea that the DNA-bound form of SopB is the effective activator. To examine the influence of DNA on SopA ATP hydrolysis we took advantage of a recently identified SopA mutant, SopAK340A, impaired in ATP-dependent DNA-binding but still able to interact with SopB (28Castaing J.P. Bouet J.Y. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1000-1011PubMed Google Scholar). Like wt, its basal ATPase activity was stimulated ∼2-fold by SopB (Fig. 1A, right panel). In contrast to wt SopA however, no stimulation was observed in the presence of DNA. Moreover, addition of NS DNA in the presence of SopB results in only weak activation (3-fold), 14-times less than with wt SopA, confirming that the SopAK340A DNA binding mutant is severely impaired in ATPase activation (28Castaing J.P. Bouet J.Y. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1000-1011PubMed Google Scholar). When sopC-containing DNA was present along with SopB, SopAK340A ATPase activity increased only 15-fold, much less than the 122-fold observed with wt SopA. These data indicate that in conditions supporting maximal stimulation of wt SopA, SopAK340A ATPase is not activated by DNA other than indirectly through SopB. Because interaction of SopAK340A with SopB is unimpaired (28Castaing J.P. Bouet J.Y. Lane D. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1000-1011PubMed Google Scholar), the strong reduction in ATPase stimulation stems from the protein DNA binding deficiency, indicating direct involvement of DNA in activation of SopA ATPase activity. Hence the view that DNA stimulates SopA ATP hydrolysis by binding to SopB appeared too simple, and the question of whether DNA stimulates SopA ATPase independently or through SopB remained open. To determine whether DNA can also stimulate SopA ATPase via SopB, we constructed SopB mutants deficient in DNA binding. SopB recognizes sopC through a helix-turn-helix (hth) motif comprising residues 178 to 198. SopB*1, mutated in the first helix (A183P) is expected to lose DNA binding activity and SopB*2, mutated in the recognition helix (K191A-R195A) is expected to lose sopC-specific binding. Binding of the purified SopBs to specific (sopC) and nonspecific (NS) DNAs in the presence and absence of competitor DNA was analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 2). WT SopB binding is illustrated in Fig. 2A and quantitation of wt and mutant SopB binding is shown in Fig. 2B. To summarize, binding of the SopB mutants conformed to that expected if binding affinity is determined largely by the first helix and specificity by the second. Thus, with competitor present SopB*1 retained some ability to retard sopC but SopB*2 did not. When the wt first helix of SopB*2 is no longer sequestered by competitor its binding to both sopC and NS DNAs exceeds that of SopB*1 even while the latter continues to bind preferentially to sopC. A third mutant, SopB*3 (A183D-K191A-R195A), made by combining mutated positions, was both unable to differentiate NS and sopC DNAs and even less active in DNA binding. The distinct DNA-binding character of these three SopB variants enabled us to investigate the interactions required for SopA ATPase activation. The three SopB variants were assayed for activation of SopA ATPase activity (Fig. 3). Without DNA, the SopB mutant deficient in sopC-specific binding, SopB*2, activated ATP hydrolysis slightly (1.4-fold), like wt. With either NS or sopC-containing DNA, SopB*2 strongly enhanced ATP hydrolysis, 21- and 26-fold, respectively. The 3-fold stimulatory effect of sopC observed with wt SopB was not seen with SopB*2, consistent with the need for direct SopB-sopC interaction in maximal ATPase activation. Proteins, SopB*1 and SopB*3, whose mutated Ala-183 position weakens DNA binding, showed an intrinsic ATPase activation ability ∼3-fold higher than wt. (Fig. 3). In the presence of either NS or sopC-containing DNA they both strongly activated SopA ATPase activity (60–120-fold). Hence, the need for DNA in SopB-mediated stimulation of SopA ATPase is bypassed with these mutants (see last section). The possibility that residual DNA binding by SopB*3 enables this mutant to activate ATPase was excluded by showing that it failed to do so with the SopAK340A DNA-binding mutant (not shown). These data indicate that stimulation of ATP hydrolysis occurs also via direct contact between SopA and DNA, and therefore that two independent interactions are required for SopA ATPase activation, one with SopB and another with DNA. Nucleotide hydrolysis by many NTPases is stimulated by an arginine finger (R-finger) motif (31Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The R-finger is usually located in flexible loops, either in cis on the same polypeptide chain or in trans provided by a partner protein, that can enter the catalytic pocket and stabilize the transition state through neutralization of the negative charges generated during phosphoryl transfer. Identification of R-fingers is not possible by direct homology search but a comprehensive survey by Scheffzek et al. (1998) concluded that they must fulfil the following criteria: (i) they are invariant within a subfamily of GTP/ATP-activating proteins; (ii) they cannot be functionally replaced, even by a basic residue; and (iii) mutations should abrogate stimulatory activity without affecting interaction of the two partner proteins. The requirement for SopB in ATPase activation suggests that SopB could provide such an R-finger motif in trans. Residues important for specificity of SopB-SopA interaction were shown to reside in the first 42 amino acids of SopB (32Ravin N.V. Rech J. Lane D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We purified a peptide composed of the first 52 amino acids of SopB, SopB-N52, and assayed its ability to activate SopA ATPase (Fig. 4B). In the absence of DNA, SopB-N52 stimulated basal SopA ATPase activity modestly; at 20 μm, ATP hydrolysis increased ∼4-fold. In the presence of DNA, either with or without sopC, ATPase activity was strongly activated by SopB-N52. Maximal activation, reached at 20 μm, was comparable to that obtained with full-length SopB in the presence of DNA (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the SopB ATPase activation domain is present within its first 52 amino acids. Although the SopB-N52 peptide does not carry the hth DNA binding domain, it exhibits NS DNA binding activity at concentrations above 5 μm. However, this NS DNA binding activity is salt-sensitive and is barely detectable above 150 mm KCl (supplemental Fig. S1). By contrast, SopA ATP hydrolysis is still fully stimulated by SopB-N52 in the presence of DNA at 200 mm KCl, where SopB-N52 does not bind DNA. These data confirm that direct interaction of DNA with SopA is important for activation of SopA ATPase. Three arginine residues are present in SopB-N52 (Fig. 5). We tested two of them, Arg-36 and Arg-42, (excluding the extreme N-terminal one as unlikely) for stimulation of SopA ATPase by mutation to alanine and lysine. The purified mutant SopB proteins were fully functional for binding to sopC DNA (data not shown). SopBR42A showed a diminished ability to activate SopA ATPase (Fig. 4A); none in the absence of DNA and a 6-fold reduction in the presence of either NS or sopC DNA compared with wt SopB. Thus, residue Arg-42 is important for ATPase stimulation. However, the other variant, SopBR42K, activated SopA ATPase activity to the levels obtained with wt SopB, both with and without DNA (Fig. 4A), indicating that although Arg-42 is involved in SopA ATPase activation, it is not an R-finger as defined by Scheffzek et al. (31) (criterion (ii) above). Neither of the Arg-36 mutants was able to stimulate SopA ATPase in the absence of DNA (Fig. 4A). With NS DNA, SopBR36A and SopBR36K exhibited 17- and 8-fold reduction, respectively, in SopA ATPase stimulation compared with wt SopB. With sopC-containing DNA, the loss of activation was still high (21-fold) for SopBR36A and moderate (5-fold) for SopBR36K. Thus, in contrast to Arg-42, Arg-36 cannot be fully replaced for SopA ATPase stimulation even by lysine. This strongly suggests that SopB activates SopA ATPase through the action of Arg-36 as an R-finger. We next checked whether Arg-36 fulfilled the two other criteria. The N-terminal domains of ParB proteins are extremely variable, both in sequence and size, which limits reliable alignment of this domain with the ParB homolog family. To evaluate conservation of the apparent R-finger, we restricted alignment to closely related SopB homologs. We found only nine homologs that have an arginine corresponding to SopB-R36 (Fig. 5). Members of this small subfamily are present on seven plasmids and two phages, which share 45–95% amino acid identity with the whole of the SopB sequence. Arg-42 is not found in all members of this subfamily. It is effectively deleted from the prophage plasmids. In two other members of the group it is replaced by lysine, which, taken with the full stimulation of SopA ATPase by SopB-R42K, argues for a role of this positively charged residue in activation of ATP hydrolysis. Because the N terminus of SopB includes the SopA recognition domain, attribution of R-finger function to Arg-36 was conditional on the ability of SopB-R36 mutant proteins to interact normally with SopA. We therefore analyzed the interaction properties of the wt and mutant SopB proteins. In EMSA, both Arg-36 mutants were as effective as wt in retarding sopC DNA, showing that their affinity for DNA was unaffected (supplemental Fig. S2). To test interaction of SopB with SopA, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, in which SopB had been loaded onto immobilized 136-bp DNA probes containing a single SopB binding site (sopC unit - sCu) as shown in Fig. 6A. These dose response data (Fig. 6A), gave a Ka (association) of 2.0 105 mol−1 s−1, a Kd (dissociation) of 4.6 10−4 s−1 and the resulting KD of 2.3 nm, comparable with our previous results obtained by EMSA and filter binding experiments (6Bouet J.Y. Lane D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When SopA was injected after formation of SopB/sopC complexes (Fig. 6B), an increase in the SPR signal (about 50 RU) was detected, indicating interaction between SopA and SopB bound to sCu-containing DNA. Such interaction occurred only when ATP was present. If ATP was replaced by ADP or omitted, no interaction was detected. SopA showed no spec"

The goal of this study is to determine whether cholesterol suppresses Kir channels directly. To achieve this goal, purified prokaryotic Kir (KirBac1.1) channels were incorporated into liposomes of defined lipid composition, and channel activity was assayed by 86Rb+ uptake. Our results show that 86Rb+ flux through KirBac1.1 is strongly inhibited by cholesterol. Incorporation of 5% (mass cholesterol/phospholipid) cholesterol into the liposome suppresses 86Rb+ flux by >50%, and activity is completely inhibited at 12–15%. However, epicholesterol, a stereoisomer of cholesterol with similar physical properties, has significantly less effect on KirBac-mediated 86Rb+ uptake than cholesterol. Furthermore, analysis of multiple sterols suggests that cholesterol-induced inhibition of KirBac1.1 channels is mediated by specific interactions rather than by changes in the physical properties of the lipid bilayer. In contrast to the inhibition of KirBac1.1 activity, cholesterol had no effect on the activity of reconstituted KscA channels (at up to 250 μg/mg of phospholipid).

Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are known to play critical roles in the regulation of multiple cellular functions including membrane excitability, heart rate, and vascular tone (1Lopatin A.N.

Kir channels are classified into seven subfamilies (Kir1–7) identified by distinct biophysical properties and sensitivities to different regulators (2Kubo Y. Adelman J.P. Clapham D.E. Jan L.Y.

Our earlier studies have shown that Kir2 channels, one of the major subfamilies of Kir that are responsible for maintaining membrane potential in a variety of cell types, are strongly suppressed by the elevation of membrane cholesterol (4Romanenko V.G.

Furthermore, the same effect was observed ex vivo in endothelial cells and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells isolated from hypercholesterolemic pigs (8Fang Y. Mohler 3rd, E.R. Hsieh E. Osman H.

In terms of the mechanism, the first insights came from comparing the effects of cholesterol and of its chiral analogue, epicholesterol. Although the two sterols are known to have almost identical effects on the biophysical properties of the lipid bilayer (10Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 11Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), their impact on Kir activity is completely different; partial substitution of endogenous cholesterol with epicholesterol resulted in significant increase in Kir current in endothelial cells (4Romanenko V.G. Rothblat G.H. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3211-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that specific sterol-protein interactions may be involved in the cholesterol sensitivity of Kir2 channels. However, in the complex environment of the plasma membrane, cholesterol may interact not only with the channels themselves but also with other proteins, which in turn may regulate the activity of the channels. In the cellular environment, therefore, it is impossible to discriminate between direct channel-cholesterol interactions and indirect effects. Moreover, it is impossible to define the actual concentrations of cholesterol in any given membrane compartment. To quantitatively test direct cholesterol-protein interactions, it is necessary to examine sensitivity of pure Kir channels to membrane cholesterol in a membrane of defined lipid composition. To date, only the cytoplasmic domains of several mammalian Kir channels have been purified (Kir2.1, Kir3.1, and Kir3.2) (12Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 13Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat.

We therefore concentrate in this study on the effect of cholesterol on two bacterial K+ channels that differ in the level of their homology to mammalian Kir channels, KirBac1.1 and KcsA. KirBac channels have high sequence homology with mammalian Kirs (e.g. 52% homology between KirBac1.1 and Kir2.1; see Fig. 7A) and have now been extensively used as structural models of mammalian Kir channels (3Bichet D. Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M.

Structure. 2005; 13: 1463-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between KcsA and mammalian K channels lies mainly in the transmembrane domain (18Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar). The overall sequence homology of KcsA to mammalian Kir channels is relatively low (e.g. 22% homology between KcsA and Kir2.1; see Fig. 7A), with an entirely different cytoplasmic domain structure. Here we show that, similarly to Kir2 channels, prokaryotic Kir channels incorporated into liposomes are strongly suppressed by an increase in membrane cholesterol. Furthermore, the sensitivity of prokaryotic Kir to cholesterol is stereo-selective to cholesterol optical analogues. In contrast, KscA channels are insensitive to membrane cholesterol. These observations suggest that cholesterol directly suppresses Kir channels.

Transformed Escherichia coli BL21 GOLD (DE3) pLysS cells were grown in a shaker at 37 °C until an A600 of 1.0 was reached. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle, and resuspended (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 30 mm decylmaltoside, and one EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet). The suspension was gently rocked for 2–4 h at room temperature and then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was mixed with cobalt affinity beads for 2 h. The supernatant/bead mixture was moved to an empty column, and the beads were extensively washed with 20–30 bed volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm decylmaltoside). Target protein was eluted with 1–2 ml of wash buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The purity of KirBac1.1 and KcsA isolations was verified using SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). Both KirBac1.1 and KcsA show a single major band corresponding to the expected molecular weight. In addition, KirBac1.1 has a minor band of slightly lower molecular weight, which we have shown previously to be recognized by an anti-His antibody, a tag that is attached to the channels, indicating that a minor band is also a modification of KirBac1.1 (19Enkvetchakul D.

There is also a minor band of higher molecular weight corresponding to a dimer of KirBac1.1 subunit. KcsA also shows two minor bands corresponding to a dimer and a tetramer, as reported previously (20Krishnan M.N. Bingham J.P. Lee S.H. Trombley P. Moczydlowski E. J. Gen.

In brief, disposable polystyrene columns (Pierce) were packed with Sephadex G-50 (fine) beads (1 ml), swollen overnight in buffer A or B (buffer A: 450 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm NMG, pH 7; buffer B: 450 mm sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm NMG, 50 μm KCl, pH 7.0). Purified KirBac1.1 or KcsA proteins (2.5–10 μg/mg of total lipid) was added to CHAPS (37 mm) solubilized mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylglycerol (9:1, Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., 10 mg of total lipid/ml) in buffer A and incubated for 30 min. The choice of lipids was based on a well established protocol for assaying the activity of purified KirBac1.1 channels, as described in earlier studies (19Enkvetchakul D. Bhattacharyya J.

The ratio of 9:1 PE/PG was also based on previous studies, in which it was established that this lipid composition yields the highest stability of the liposomes, as determined by the maximal uptake of 86Rb+ (23Wang S.

Columns A (with Sephadex beads in buffer A) were partially dehydrated by spinning at 3,000 rpm in a Hermle Z283 centrifuge. The liposomes were formed by spinning 100 μl of detergent-solubilized lipid/protein mixture through the partially dehydrated column A at 2,500 rpm. Extraliposomal solution was exchanged for buffer B by centrifugation through a partially dehydrated column B. The assay was initiated by adding 400 μl of buffer B with 1–5 μm 86Rb+. 50-μl aliquots of the radioactive mixture were taken at indicated time points, and extraliposomal 86Rb+ was removed by passage over a 0.5-ml Dowex cation exchange column in the NMGH+ form. The samples were mixed with scintillation fluid and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Cholesterol was incorporated into the liposomes along with the POPE:POPG (9:1), according to the following protocol. The lipids were mixed and dried under nitrogen; then solubilized in 37 mm CHAPS before adding the 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 450 mm KCl, 4 mm NMG, pH 7.4; and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to swell the lipids. The strength of this system is that it allows full control of cholesterol content of the liposomes. In addition, a separate series of experiments was performed when cholesterol was added to the liposomes after the incorporation of ion channels. In a separate series of control experiments, we compared different 86Rb+ concentrations (1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μm) on the same day and found that the effect of cholesterol on KirBac-mediated 86Rb+ flux was exactly the same (data not shown). Polarization and anisotropy were measured as described previously (24Ahn K.W. Choi C.H. Kim I.S. Chung I.K. Cho G.J. Jang H.O. Yun I. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 541-547Google Scholar) to assess the effect of sterol incorporation on the fluidity of the liposomes. Briefly, fluorescent probe 1(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6-phenyl-hexa- 1,3,5-triene was dissolved in dimethylformamide (1 mg/ml), and 1 μg was incorporated into the liposomes, prepared as described above. Anisotropy was measured using excitation wavelength of 362 nm, and the emission was monitored at 424 nm using ISS PCI photo counting Spectrofluorometer at 37 °C. Statistical analysis of the data were performed using a standard two-sample Student's t test assuming unequal variances of the two data sets. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed distribution assumption and was set at 5% level (p < 0.05). The fitting of the curves for the time courses was done using Origin software. Statistical analysis of the correlation between 86Rb+ uptake and anisotropy was obtained from a linear fit using Origin as well. Alignment of Kir2.1, KirBac1.1, and KcsA sequences was done using ClustalW software, and the structures were generated with Visual Molecular Dynamics and Pymol packages for Figs. 7 (B and C), respectively. Alignment of Kir2.1 and KirBac1.1 structures was performed with Discovery Studio Visualizer. Earlier studies have shown that purified KirBac1.1 protein incorporated into liposomes forms a functional K+ channel, as assessed by selective uptake of Rb+ (19Enkvetchakul D. Bhattacharyya J. Jeliazkova I. Groesbeck D.K. Cukras C.A. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47076-47080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, liposomes with and without the protein are exposed to 86Rb+ in the external medium at time 0, and the uptake is monitored over time. Maximal uptake is measured after the addition of a K+ ionophore, valinomycin. Here we show that, as expected, the uptake of 86Rb+ into the liposomes increases with an increased incorporation of KirBac1.1 protein (0–10 μg/mg of PL), indicating that the uptake is channel-mediated (Fig. 1A). No difference was observed for different levels of incorporation of KirBac1.1 protein after the addition of valinomycin, indicating that incorporation of the channels does not interfere with liposome formation or integrity. At high protein concentration (10 μg/mg of PL), the uptake was similar to that observed after the addition of valinomycin, and therefore, an intermediate concentration of 5 μg of KirBac1.1/mg of PL was used for the rest of the experiments. The first finding of this study is that incorporation of cholesterol strongly suppresses KirBac1.1-mediated 86Rb+ flux (Fig. 1B), indicating that the addition of cholesterol per se is sufficient to suppress the channels and excluding the possibility that additional protein or other cellular intermediates are required (Fig. 1B). In this experiment, incorporation of 50 μg of cholesterol/mg of PL (5%) cholesterol resulted in a more than 3-fold decrease in KirBac-mediated 86Rb+ uptake but had no effect on 86Rb+ uptake in liposomes containing no protein. The latter observation indicates that the addition of cholesterol at this concentration does not affect nonspecific 86Rb+ background counts. No effect was also observed on maximal 86Rb+ uptake after the addition of valinomycin, verifying that incorporation of cholesterol does not interfere with liposome formation. In the next series of experiments, we compared KirBac1.1 activity in liposomes containing 4–120 μg/mg of PL (Fig. 2). A significant decrease in KirBac1.1-mediated 86Rb+ uptake was observed above 25 μg/mg of PL with complete inhibition of channel activity at 80–120 μg/mg of PL. To compare multiple cholesterol conditions across independent experiments, 86Rb+ uptake in each experiment was normalized to the uptake level at 240 s measured in liposomes containing no cholesterol in the same experiment (Fig. 2B). It is important to note that KirBac1.1 is inhibited by levels of cholesterol that are significantly lower than normal cholesterol levels in the plasma membranes of mammalian cells, which range between 30 and 50% of total membrane lipids (25Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 26Yeagle P.L. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, KirBac1.1 channels would be expected to be completely closed at normal cholesterol levels of mammalian cells. As pointed out before, an increase in membrane cholesterol in this range (4–120 μg/mg of PL) had no effect on the amount of uptake after the addition of valinomycin, excluding the possibility that a cholesterol-induced decrease in 86Rb+ flux could be partially due to a decrease in the number and/or size of the liposomes (Fig. 2B, inset). Similar effects were observed when cholesterol was added to the lipid mixture before or after incorporation of channel protein. Specifically, when cholesterol was incorporated into liposomes after reconstitution with KirBac1.1 protein, it also significantly inhibited KirBac1.1-mediated 86Rb+ flux (supplemental Fig. S2). These observations exclude the possibility that cholesterol inhibition could be attributed to decreased incorporation of KirBac1.1 protein into the liposomes. We next asked whether cholesterol-induced inhibition of KirBac1.1 might be attributed to changes in the physical properties of the lipid bilayer. It is well known that an increase in membrane cholesterol decreases membrane fluidity (25Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 26Yeagle P.L. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), increases membrane stiffness (27Needham D. Nunn R.S. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 997-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 28Evans E. Needham D. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 4219-4228Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar), and alters the packing of phospholipids (29Gidwani A. Holowka D. Baird B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12422-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Kahya N. Schwille P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a variety of membrane proteins have been shown to be sensitive to changes in the physical properties of the membrane (26Yeagle P.L. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31Burger K. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1577-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Alternatively, channels may be regulated by specific cholesterol-protein interactions (26Yeagle P.L. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31Burger K. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1577-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To discriminate between these possibilities, we compared KirBac1.1 activity in liposomes containing cholesterol or its chiral analogue, epicholesterol. The only difference between the two sterols is the orientation of the hydroxyl group in position 3 (see the structures in Fig. 4), and both have similar effects on membrane physical properties (10Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 11Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, epicholesterol is significantly less efficient than cholesterol in inhibiting KirBac1.1-mediated 86Rb+ uptake (Fig. 3). At lower concentrations (25 μg/mg), cholesterol significantly suppressed KirBac1.1 activity, but epicholesterol had no effect. There was also a significantly lower maximal effect of epicholesterol. Different effects of cholesterol and epicholesterol suggest that channel inhibition is unlikely to be fully accounted for by changes in the physical properties of the lipid bilayer. It is also possible that epicholesterol can bind directly to the channel protein but with a lower affinity than cholesterol, as was shown previously for Scap-1 protein (32Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A relationship between KirBac1.1 activity and membrane fluidity is explored further in the next part of the study.FIGURE 3Comparison of cholesterol and epicholesterol. A, time courses of 86Rb+ uptake in liposomes incorporating 10, 25, and 50 μg of epicholesterol (Epi) or cholesterol (Chol)/mg of PL normalized to control.

In group A, we tested five different sterols: 25-hydroxycholesterol (5-cholesten-3β,25-diol), which differs from cholesterol by having an additional hydroxyl group in position 25; desmosterol (5, 24-cholestadien-3β-ol), which has an additional double bond at position 24; and three sterols that have an additional ethyl, ethylene, or methyl group in position 24: β-sitosterol (5-cholesten-24β-ethyl-3β-ol), fucosterol (5-cholesten-24(28)-ethylidene-3β-ol), and campesterol (5-cholesten-24α-methyl-3β-ol) respectively (Fig. 4A). Of these five sterols, only 25-hydroxycholesterol did not have an effect on KirBac1.1-mediated 86Rb+ uptake, whereas desmosterol and β-sitosterol had partial effects, and fucosterol and campesterol were indistinguishable from cholesterol (Fig. 5, A and B). In group B, five sterols were tested: 19-hydroxycholesterol (5-cholesten-3β,19-diol), which has an additional hydroxyl group in position 19; epicholesterol (5-cholesten-3α-ol), which, as described above, differs from cholesterol (5-cholesten-3β-ol) by the orientation of the hydroxyl group at position 3; and coprostanol (5β-cholestan-3β-ol), epicoprastanol (5β-cholestan-3α-ol), and cholestanol (5α-cholestan-3β-ol), which lack a double bond at position 5. In addition, epicoprostanol also differs from cholesterol in the orientation of the hydroxyl group at position 3, and cholestanol differs from coprostanol in the orientation of the hydrogen at position 5. In this group, the only sterol that did not inhibit KirBac1.1-mediated 86Rb+ flux was 19-hydroxycholesterol, whereas epicholesterol, as described above, had an intermediate effect, and coprostanol and cholestanol had the same effect as cholesterol (Fig. 5, C and D). Finally, in group C, we tested three more sterols: 5-adrosten 3β-17β-diol, which has no side chain but has an extra hydroxyl group in the ring structure at position 17; ergosterol, which, similarly to campesterol, has an additional methyl group at position 24 and two additional double bonds at positions 22 (side chain) and 7 (rings); and stigmastanol, which has an ethyl group at position 24 (side chain) and a lack of double bond at position 5 (rings). In this group, 5-adrosten 3β-17β-diol had no effect on KirBac1.1, ergosterol had a partial effect, and stigmastanol was identical to cholesterol (Fig. 5, E and F). In summary, the three sterols without effect on KirBac1.1 function all have additional hydroxyl groups at positions 25, 19, or 17, suggesting that the addition of a hydroxyl group significantly interferes with sterol-channel interactions. To examine whether there is a correlation between the inhibition of KirBac1.1 activity and membrane fluidity, we estimated membrane anisotropy for liposomes that incorporated each of the sterols used in this study. Even though earlier studies have already estimated the effects of these sterols on membrane anisotropy in different types of membranes, the exact effects may depend on other lipids in the membrane, and it is important, therefore, to perform these measurements in the same set of liposomes as used in the rest of the study. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between KirBac1.1 activity and membrane anisotropy measured in the same liposomes. As expected, incorporation of cholesterol, as well as of several other sterols, significantly increases the membrane anisotropy, indicating that membrane fluidity is decreased. However, most importantly, there is no correlation between the decrease in KirBac1.1 activity and anisotropy. Specifically, although several sterols, such as 5-adrosten 3β-17β-diol, have similar effects on anisotropy to that of cholesterol, they exhibit significantly different effects on KirBac1.1 activity. Conversely, sterols that are similar to cholesterol in their suppression of KirBac1.1 activity, such as coprostanol, fucosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol, have very different effects on membrane anisotropy. Finally, we tested whether cholesterol also inhibits KcsA channels similarly purified and incorporated into liposomes. Earlier studies have shown that KscA can be incorporated into liposomes and form functional K+ channels (19Enkvetchakul D. Bhattacharyya J. Jeliazkova I. Groesbeck D.K. Cukras C.A. Nichols C.G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2030900319,"Resveratrol, a polyphenol derived from grapes, exerts important effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, yet detailed mechanisms mediating these effects remain unknown. The liver plays a central role in energy homeostasis, and glucokinase (GK) is a key enzyme involved in glucose utilization. Resveratrol activates SIRT1 (sirtuin 1), which promotes deacetylation of the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1. Previously, we reported that FoxO1 can suppress and that HNF-4 can stimulate GK expression in the liver. Here, we examined the role of FoxO1 and HNF-4 in mediating resveratrol effects on liver GK expression. Resveratrol suppressed hepatic GK expression in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes, and knocking down FoxO1 with shRNAs disrupted this effect. Reporter gene, gel shift, supershift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that FoxO1 binds to the GK promoter and that the interplay between FoxO1 and HNF-4 within the GK promoter is essential for mediating the effects of resveratrol. Resveratrol promotes deacetylation of FoxO1 and enhances its recruitment to the FoxO-binding element. Conversely, resveratrol suppresses recruitment of HNF-4 to its binding site, and knockdown of FoxO1 blocks this effect of resveratrol. Coprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that resveratrol enhances interaction between FoxO1 and HNF-4, reduces binding of HNF-4 to its own site, and promotes its recruitment to the FoxO site in a FoxO1-dependent manner. These results provide the first evidence that resveratrol represses GK expression via FoxO1 and that the interaction between FoxO1 and HNF-4 contributes to these effects of resveratrol."

It has been shown that Zfp206 is required to maintain ESC in an undifferentiated, pluripotent state. Presented here are data showing that Zfp206 works together with two other transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2, which are also essential regulators of ESC pluripotency. We show that Zfp206 binds to the Oct4 promoter and directly regulates Oct4 expression. Genome-wide mapping of Zfp206-binding sites in ESC identifies more than 3000 target genes, many of which encode transcription factors that are also targeted for regulation by Oct4 and Sox2. In addition, we show that Zfp206 physically interacts with both Oct4 and Sox2. These data demonstrate that Zfp206 is a key component of the core transcriptional regulatory network and together with Oct4 and Sox2 regulates differentiation of ESC."
https://openalex.org/W2127123093,"Combinatorial libraries of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) have been proven to be a valuable source of specific binding proteins, as they can be expressed at very high levels and are very stable. We report here the selection of DARPins directed against a macromolecular multiprotein complex, the baseplate BppUxBppL complex of the lactococcal phage TP901-1. Using ribosome display, we selected several DARPins that bound specifically to the tip of the receptor-binding protein (RBP, the BppL trimer). The three selected DARPins display high specificity and affinity in the low nanomolar range and bind with a stoichiometry of one DARPin per BppL trimer. The crystal structure of a DARPin complexed with the RBP was solved at 2.1 A resolution. The DARPinxRBP interface is of the concave (DARPin)-convex (RBP) type, typical of other DARPin protein complexes and different from what is observed with a camelid VHH domain, which penetrates the phage p2 RBP inter-monomer interface. Finally, phage infection assays demonstrated that TP901-1 infection of Lactococcus lactis cells was inhibited by each of the three selected DARPins. This study provides proof of concept for the possible use of DARPins to circumvent viral infection. It also provides support for the use of DARPins in co-crystallization, due to their rigidity and their ability to provide multiple crystal contacts."

Nitrile compounds are important intermediates in some industrial processes to produce nylon and acrylic fibers, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals. Although one of the most useful methods for nitrile production is dehydration of aldoxime, the chemical dehydration of aldoxime used in the industrial process requires harsh conditions. Therefore, a more environmentally benign process of aldoxime dehydration is needed, for which a biological dehydration of aldoxime is a possible candidate. In nature, some microbes have an “aldoxime-nitrile pathway” (supplemental Fig. 1), where aldoximes are metabolized to the corresponding carboxylic acids through nitriles formed by dehydration of aldoximes with aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd; 3The abbreviations used are: Oxdaldoxime dehydrataseOxdREaldoxime dehydratase from Rhodococcus sp. N-771PrOxpropionaldoxime (C3H9NO)BOxn-butyraldoxime (C4H9NO)MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. EC 4.99.1.5). There are two pathways for the conversion of nitriles to carboxylic acids. One is hydrolysis of nitriles by nitrilase, and the other is the combination of the reactions catalyzed by nitrile hydratase and amidase (1.Kato Y. Ooi R. Asano Y. Arch.

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of Oxd is dependent on the oxidation state of the heme iron, although the reaction catalyzed by Oxd is not a redox reaction. Ferrous Oxd containing a Fe2+ heme shows the enzymatic activity, but ferric Oxd containing a Fe3+ heme does not. Previous spectroscopic analyses reveal a novel mechanism, where the change in the coordination mode of the substrate plays a crucial role for the regulation of the enzymatic activity (7.Kobayashi K. Yoshioka S. Kato Y. Asano Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5486-5490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). Although the oxygen atom of aldoxime is coordinated to the ferric heme, the nitrogen atom of aldoxime is coordinated to the ferrous heme (7.Kobayashi K. Yoshioka S. Kato Y. Asano Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5486-5490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The dehydration reaction proceeds only via N-coordinated substrate in the ferrous heme. The organic substrate is directly coordinated to the heme iron in dehydration of aldoxime, which is a unique example among heme enzymes, although the coordination of O2 or H2O2 to the heme is well known in the heme-containing oxygenases, catalases, and peroxidases. It is proposed that the dehydration reaction of the heme-bound aldoxime proceeds in a general acid-base catalysis with a histidine working as a catalytic residue in the distal heme pocket (7.Kobayashi K.

However, the detailed reaction mechanisms remain to be elucidated mainly because the structural information of Oxd was lacking. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of Oxd from Rhodococcus sp. N-771 (OxdRE) in the substrate-free and substrate-bound forms. We could determine the crystal structure of the Michaelis complex of OxdRE by means of the unique property of OxdRE for the substrate binding. As the reaction spontaneously proceeds when mixing ferrous Oxd and the substrate, the crystallization of the substrate-bound OxdRE in the ferrous form (the Michaelis complex of OxdRE) is not possible by the usual methods. However, we could prepare the crystal of the Michaelis complex of OxdRE by the reduction of the crystal of the substrate-ferric Oxd complex using x-ray radiation under cryogenic temperature. The structures of the resting state and the Michaelis complex provide structural insights into the mechanisms of substrate recognition and the catalysis of OxdRE. The expression, purification, and enzymatic activity assay of OxdRE were performed according to reported methods (7.Kobayashi K. Yoshioka S. Kato Y. Asano Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5486-5490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with a slight modification as described below. The OxdRE used in this work has an additional 20 N-terminal residues encoded in the plasmid, including a His6 tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The deoxyoligonucleotide sequences used to introduce the desired mutations are shown in supplemental Table S1. Introduced mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing with an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Cultures of Escherichia coli stains BL21(DE3) (for wild type, E148Q, and F306A), HMS174(DE3) (for R178Q), and BL21CodonPlus(DE3)RIL-X (for S219A and H320A) carrying each expression plasmid were grown under agitation at 140 rpm in 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid for heme synthesis at 37 °C. OxdRE expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm after 5 h of growth. The cells were incubated under shaking with 100 rpm at 20 °C for 18 h for BL21(DE3) and HMS174(DE3) or 36 h for BL21CodonPlus(DE3)RIL-X, after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1 m MOPS buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.3 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole). The suspension was treated with 0.2 mg ml−1 lysozyme at 4 °C for 1 h and then with DNase mixture (10 μg ml−1 DNase I, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm MnCl2) for 30 min. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the cellular debris was discarded. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) column. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of lysis buffer followed by 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The OxdRE-containing fractions were combined and dialyzed against 40 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.8). The dialyzed sample was loaded on a RESOURCE Q column (GE Healthcare), and the adsorbed proteins were eluted under a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.75 m. The OxdRE-containing fractions were combined, concentrated, and subsequently purified using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare). OxdRE was concentrated by centrifugation with Amicon Ultra (Millipore). OxdRE was oxidized to the ferric form by adding excess potassium ferricyanide. Potassium ferricyanide was removed by a prepacked PD-10 column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) (Hampton Research). The purity of the sample used in the crystallization experiments was ∼98%, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. The OxdRE activity was assayed at 30 °C under anaerobic conditions by measuring the amount of phenylacetonitrile formed from Z-phenylacetaldoxime. The assay reaction was started by the addition of Z-phenylacetaldoxime (5 mm in the final concentration) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide into a 500 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) solution containing 5 mm sodium dithionite and 1 μm purified OxdRE, in a final volume of 0.5 ml. High pressure liquid chromatography analyses were performed as described previously (7.Kobayashi K. Yoshioka S. Kato Y. Asano Y. Aono S. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Proteins were crystallized with hanging drops of 3 μl of protein mixed with an equal volume of precipitant solution in a 24-well crystallization VDXMTM plate (Hampton Research) at 20 °C. OxdRE was concentrated to 30 mg ml−1 in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added to the concentrated sample to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the mixture was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20 min before crystallization. Initial screening using Natrix screening kit (Hampton Research) revealed substrate-free OxdRE crystals. The final crystallization condition of the substrate-free OxdRE was 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 75 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), and 100 mm magnesium acetate. For cryoprotection, the crystal was soaked in a reservoir solution containing 16% (w/v) sucrose and 12% (w/v) trehalose. To prepare substrate-bound crystals by the soaking method, substrate-free crystal was soaked for a few minutes in a reservoir solution supplemented with 16% (w/v) sucrose, 12% (w/v) trehalose, and 2% (v/v) substrate (BOx or PrOx). For co-crystallization of OxdRE and BOx, the concentrated OxdRE solution (10 mg ml−1) was mixed with BOx at a final concentration of 2% (v/v) and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C before starting crystallization. The final crystallization condition was 17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethylether, 100 mm Trizma (Tris base)/HCl (pH 7.0), and 200 mm calcium acetate. The crystal was soaked in reservoir solution containing 22% (w/v) xylitol and 2% (v/v) BOx for cryoprotection. The optical absorption spectra of the crystals were measured by a single-crystal microspectrophotometry system (11.Sakai K. Matsui Y. Kouyama T. Shiro Y. Adachi S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2002; 35: 270-273Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) on the beam line BL44B2 (SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan). Diffraction data were collected on beam lines BL41XU and BL44B2 (SPring-8). All image data were collected at 90 K. The HKL2000 (12.Otwinowski Z. Borek D. Majewski W. Minor W. Acta Crystallogr.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar) program was used for integration of diffraction intensity and scaling. Initial phases of substrate-free crystal were calculated by the SHELX-97 (14.Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr.

Phases were further improved and extended to 1.8 Å resolution data. Most parts of the atomic model of OxdRE were built automatically using the ARP/warp (17.Morris R.J. Zwart P.H. Cohen S.

The heme and remaining residues were manually built using the graphics program Coot (18.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The model was refined using REFMAC5 (19.Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry restrains were applied to the core region of the protein molecule throughout all refinement cycles. The model geometry was checked using the program WHAT IF (20.Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the substrate-bound form were determined by the molecular replacement method using the MOLREP program (21.Lebedev A.A. Vagin A.A. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The substrate-free OxdRE structure was used as a search model. The open and closed states were defined based on the conformations of the A- and C-chains in PrOx-soaked crystal and of the co-crystallized BOx-bound OxdRE, respectively. The α10 and following 310 helix region of B- and D-chains of PrOx-soaked crystal shows two conformations of the open and close states. When the model was refined with only a single conformation of the open state, the calculated difference Fourier map (Fo − Fc map) showed the positive density for the close state. The occupancies of alternative conformations were not refined by the program but estimated from manual adjustment in 0.05 steps, which is followed by the refinement and the check of B-factor of each atom and Fo − Fc map. The additional N-terminal 20 residues derived from the vector, including the His tag, were disordered in density for most of the polypeptide chains. The coordinates for OxdRE and BOx-bound OxdRE prepared by co-crystallization and for BOx-bound OxdRE and PrOx-bound OxdRE prepared by the soaking method were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes of 3A15, 3A17, 3A18, and 3A16, respectively. Statistics of the data collection and refinement of OxdRE are summarized in Table 1. The overall crystal structure of substrate-free OxdRE was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (16.Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and refined at a 1.8 Å resolution (supplemental Table 2). OxdRE formed a homodimer with non-crystallographic two-fold symmetry (Fig. 1A), consistent with previous gel filtration analysis results (22.Kato Y. Yoshida S. Xie S.X. Asano Y. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 97: 250-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each monomer contained one heme molecule. The α10 helix of one monomer interacted with the α10 helix of the other to create the dimer interface, which was stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions.TABLE 1Statistics of X-ray data collection and structure refinement of OxdRESubstrate-freePrOx (soaking)BOx (co-crystal)BOx (soaking)PDB code3A153A163A173A18BeamlineBL41XUBL41XUBL44B2BL41XUResolution (Å)20-1.820-1.620-2.520-1.8High resolution shell (Å)1.86-1.801.64-1.602.59-2.501.86-1.80Space groupP21P21P1P21Unit cella = 97.9 Å, b = 77.1 Å, c = 104.8 Å, β = 101.1°a = 62.7 Å, b = 147.7 Å, c = 78.9 Å, β = 90.0°a = 80.1 Å, b = 103.9 Å, c = 114.2 Å, α = 76.5°, β = 89.5°, γ = 87.5°a = 63.1 Å, b = 148.6 Å, c = 79.1 Å, β = 90.3°No. of monomer/asymmetric unit4484Wavelength (Å)1.01.01.01.0No. of observed624,9481,880,548222,482564,522No. of unique141,582188,090114,706132,895Rmerge (%)aNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.,bRmerge = Σhkl Σi|Ii(hkl) − <I(hkl)>|/Σhkl Σi Ii(hkl) where <I(hkl)> is the average intensity of the i observations.5.7 (32.5)8.0 (34.7)7.9 (29.3)8.4 (28.8)Completeness (%)aNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.99.6 (98.7)99.9 (100.0)90.8 (83.1)99.7 (98.0)I/σ (I)aNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.14.5 (2.8)23.4 (8.1)6.8 (2.3)13.4 (3.8)RedundancyaNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.4.4 (2.8)10.0 (10.0)1.9 (1.9)4.2 (3.3)Rwork/RfreecRwork = Σhkl ‖Fobs(hkl)| − |Fcalc(hkl)‖/Σhkl |Fobs(hkl)|.

Open table in a new tab Each monomer of OxdRE has a α+β structure consisting of an elliptic β-barrel flanked on both sides by α-helices (Fig. 1B). The barrel was composed of eight β-strands, β3↓ β4↑ β2↓ β5-5′↑ β11-11′↓ β8-8′↑ β9↓ β10↑, with all strands exhibiting an antiparallel pattern. Some regions of β-strands failed to form hydrogen bonds with the neighboring strand because of the insertion of a short turn or loop, which deformed the β-barrel. The interior of the β-barrel primarily consisted of hydrophobic residues. A hydrogen-bonding network involving the side chains of Arg-218, Tyr-98, Tyr-278, Tyr-319, and Asp-80 was also found (supplemental Fig. 2). There was no space to create a cavity or channel inside the β-barrel. Structural data base searches using DALI (23.Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and MATRAS (24.Kawabata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3367-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) indicated that the eight-stranded elliptic barrel structure and secondary structure arrangement of OxdRE show a low similarity (z-score in DALI <8) to known proteins with a α+β ferredoxin-like fold consisting of four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets packed as a β-barrel against two kinked α-helices. OxdRE displayed a unique topology of β-strands in the barrel (2↓ 3↑ 1↓ 4↑ 8↓ 5↑ 6↓ 7↑) (supplemental Fig. 3), which was not identical to two repeats of (2↓ 3↑ 1↓ 4↑) that are seen in other ferredoxin-like folds (25.Zhang C. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although a hypothetical protein TT1485 that shows α+β ferredoxin-like fold is assumed to have heme binding ability (26.Ebihara A. Okamoto A. Kousumi Y. Yamamoto H. Masui R. Ueyama N. Yokoyama S. Kuramitsu S. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2005; 6: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the topology and the location of proposed heme-binding pocket of TT1485 are distinct from those of OxdRE (supplemental Fig. 4). Thus, the structure of OxdRE was evaluated as a hemoprotein containing a novel β-barrel topology. The crystal of the substrate-free OxdRE was obtained in ferric form, in which the heme iron was in the Fe3+ state. However, the heme was reduced by x-ray radiation, as confirmed from the visible crystal spectra obtained with the single-crystal microspectrophotometry system. As data collections for the structural analyses were begun after heme reduction was complete, the structure of the substrate-free OxdRE reported here is the same as that of ferrous OxdRE. The heme exists between the β-barrel and the helix in the hydrophobic pocket composed of non-polar side chains of Trp-172, Ile-217, Ile-238, Leu-242, Leu-249, Leu-289, Trp-292, Ile-302, Phe-303, Phe-306, and Phe-307 (supplemental Fig. 5). His-299 in the α10 helix was the proximal ligand of the heme iron. The orientation of the His-299 imidazole ring was stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the Nδ1 atom of His-299 and the O atom of the main chain at position 293 (Fig. 2). A water molecule (w1) coordinated to the distal coordination site of the heme in the substrate-free form (Fig. 2). The heme 6-propionate group was directed to the proximal side, and its conformation was stabilized by interactions with two waters (w2 and w3) and the side chain of Ser-174 (supplemental Fig. 5B). The 7-propionate was directed to the distal side and interacted with the side chain of His-169 and the main chain amide of Gly-170 (supplemental Fig. 5B). A water molecule (w4) was shared by two propionates for hydrogen bonding (supplemental Fig. 5B). One of the β-strands in the barrel provided His-320, whose Nδ1 atom is located within a distance capable of a hydrogen bonding with w1. The side chain of Ser-219 also formed a hydrogen bond to w1 (Fig. 2). Another water molecule (w5) interacted with the side chains of Ser-219 and Gln-221 near w1. In the distal heme pocket, a hydrogen-bond network existed among His-320, Glu-143, and Arg-178 (Fig. 2). The structure of substrate-free OxdRE was determined, as described above. Determination of the structures of the resting state and the Michaelis complex of OxdRE should provide useful information for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of OxdRE catalysis. In principle, crystallization of the Michaelis complex of a native enzyme is not possible because the complex is a transiently formed intermediate on enzymatic catalysis that is formed only at very low concentrations. We obtained the crystal of the Michaelis complex by using the unique properties of OxdRE. The substrate-bound ferric form of the OxdRE crystal was obtained by crystallization of ferric OxdRE in the presence of the substrate or by soaking the substrate-free crystal of ferric OxdRE in a substrate-containing solution. Ferric OxdRE is an inactive form that forms a dead-end complex with the substrate. The oxidation state of the heme iron and the coordination mode of the substrate were different between this dead-end complex and the Michaelis complex (supplemental Fig. 1). We postulated that the crystal of the OxdRE Michaelis complex could be obtained by reduction of the heme iron in the crystal of the dead-end complex using x-ray radiation under cryogenic temperature. The optical absorption spectra of the substrate-free and substrate-bound OxdRE crystals were changed upon x-ray radiation (Fig. 3). The spectral change in the Q-band region indicates that the heme iron in the substrate-bound crystal was also reduced by x-ray radiation at 90 K, as was also the case for substrate-free OxdRE. The heme iron began to be reduced within seconds by the x-ray beam of SPring-8 BL44B2, and reduction was complete within 60 s (Fig. 3C). We collected x-ray diffraction images for structural analyses after confirming the reduction of the heme iron by microspectrophotometry. The structures of the BOx-bound OxdRE and PrOx-bound OxdRE were determined at 1.8 and 1.6 Å resolutions, respectively (supplemental Fig. 6). The nitrogen atom of aldoxime was coordinated to the heme in these complexes, indicating that reduction by x-ray radiation has successfully reconstructed the coordination structure of the aldoxime-heme complex from the inactive to the active form, even in the crystal. The overall structure of the substrate-bound OxdRE was almost the same as that of the substrate-free OxdRE, but there were some local conformational changes upon substrate binding, as discussed below. The structures around the heme of PrOx- and BOx-bound OxdRE are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, which clearly reveal that PrOx and BOx bound to the heme iron via the N atom. The structures around the heme were similar in PrOx- and BOx-bound OxdREs. The substrate alkyl group was surrounded by hydrophobic residues (Met-29, Leu-145, Phe-306, and Leu-318) in the distal side of the heme, but there was no specific arrangement of hydrophobic residues to discriminate the specific alkyl group (Fig. 5). A large cavity existed on the distal side of the heme (Fig. 6A). OxdRE has a broad substrate specificity capable of converting various aryl- and alkyl-aldoximes to their corresponding nitriles (22.Kato Y. Yoshida S. Xie S.X. Asano Y. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 97: 250-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is because the large cavity does not prevent accommodation of various substrates.FIGURE 5The heme distal side of the A-chains of PrOx-bound OxdRE (A) and BOx-bound OxdRE (B) prepared by the soaking method.

In the distal heme pocket, the hydrogen-bond network was retained among Glu-143, Arg-178, and His-320 (Fig. 5), as was the case of the substrate-free form. Conformational differences between the substrate-free and substrate-bound forms were not observed in these distal residues. Although no conformational differences were observed at the distal side of the heme among the determined structures, conformational variations were observed at the proximal side of the heme (Fig. 6B). The region 294–315, including the proximal α-helix (α10) and the following 310 helix (η4), displayed a conformational variation in each monomer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. In the dimer of the substrate-free form, two conformations were present: one subunit with an open form and another with a closed form. In the open form, the substrate-binding cavity in the distal side of the heme was connected to the protein surface through a channel formed between the 310 helix (309–312) and the loop (24.Kawabata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3367-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 25.Zhang C. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26.Ebihara A.

Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). This cavity will serve as the substrate access and product release channel (Fig. 6A). However, the entrance of the channel on the protein surface was closed in the closed form (Fig. 6C), in which the proximal α-helix was rotated ∼15° (as viewed from the heme) and the 310 helix deviated ∼5 Å to cover the channel entrance. The conformational change from the open to the closed form resulted from the sliding of Phe-306 by 3 Å vertically to the heme plane, accompanied by rotation of the proximal α-helix. This movement of Phe-306 disconnected the substrate-binding cavity from the substrate access/product release channel (Fig. 6A). Thus, the 310 helix and side chain of Phe-306 act as a gate for the channel, modulating substrate access and product release. Substrate-bound OxdRE displayed different populations of two conformations, depending on crystal preparation method. PrOx-bound OxdRE prepared by soaking the OxdRE crystal in PrOx for 30 s contained two dimers (AB and CD) in an asymmetric unit. Although the A- and C-chains had open conformation, the B- and D-chains had mixtures of open and closed forms, with estimated occupancies of 75 and 25% for the open and closed forms, respectively (supplemental Fig. 7A). BOx-bound OxdRE prepared by the soaking method had a similar population of the two forms as the PrOx-bound OxdRE (supplemental Fig. 7B). However, BOx-bound OxdRE prepared by co-crystallization had mainly the closed conformation (occupancy >90%) for all chains in the asymmetric unit. These results suggest that the open and closed forms are in equilibrium in solution and that the substrate binding can shift the equilibrium from the open to the closed form. As complete equilibration may not be achieved in the crystal prepared by soaking in PrOx or BOx, the substrate-bound OxdREs prepared by the soaking method will have a mixed conformation. The apparent role of the heme in OxdRE is to tether the substrate in the catalysis by aldoxime dehydratase. The crystal structures determined in this study reveal that hydrogen bonding between the OH group of aldoxime and the side chains of Ser-219 and His-320 controls the specific orientation of the heme-bound substrate suitable for the elimination of the OH group of aldoxime and that these residues and the heme create a prefixed site for substrate recognition and binding. An induced-fit type conformational change was not observed upon substrate binding at the distal heme pocket, the substrate-binding site in OxdRE. His-320 also serves as a catalytic residue for the elimination of the substrate OH group to form H2O, consistent with previous mutagenesis studies (7.Kobayashi K. Yoshioka S. Kato Y. Asano Y. Aono S.

A hydrogen-bond network existed among Glu-143, Arg-178, and His-320 that fixed the proper orientation of His-320 toward the heme-bound substrate. Based on analyses of the resonance Raman spectra of CO-bound aldoxime dehydratase from Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23 (OxdA), Konishi et al. (9.Konishi K. Ohta T. Oinuma K. Hashimoto Y. Kitagawa T. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have proposed that the catalytic His, which corresponds to His-320 in OxdRE, is in imidazolium form in the resting state, in which both of the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring are protonated. The hydrogen bond between Glu-143 and His-320 will play an important role not only for control of the proper orientation of His-320 but also for stabilization of the imidazolium form of His-320. Taken together, we propose the reaction scheme as shown in Fig. 7. Previous studies using a cavity mutant of OxdRE revealed that electron donation from the proximal ligand to the heme iron accelerates the dehydration reaction (27.Kobayashi K. Kubo M. Yoshioka S. Kitagawa T. Kato Y. Asano Y. Aono S. ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 2004-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bond between His-299 and the oxygen atom of the main chain will strengthen the imidazolate character and electron donation ability of the proximal His, partially regulating the enzymatic activity of OxdRE. These results suggest another functional role for the heme in which the substrate coordination polarizes the N=C bond, assisting in product formation. Mutagenesis studies confirmed the functional role of Glu-143, Arg-178, Ser-219, and His-320 deduced from the structural analyses. Mutation of Glu-143, Arg-178, Ser-219, His-320, or Phe-306 resulted in a 60–90% loss in enzymatic activity (Table 2). E143Q OxdRE displayed similar activity to that of H320A OxdRE, which lacked the catalytic residue. This result indicates that the proper orientation of His-320, which is mainly achieved by a hydrogen bond with Glu-143, is crucial for the enzymatic activity of OxdRE. The effect of the mutation of Phe-306 suggests that disconnection of the substrate-binding cavity from the substrate access channel and bulk solution, which is induced by substrate binding to the heme, controls the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the distal heme pocket for the reaction to proceed efficiently.

https://openalex.org/W2010098178,"Calumenin is a multiple EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein localized in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with C-terminal SR retention signal HDEF. Recently, we showed evidence that calumenin interacts with SERCA2 in rat cardiac SR (Sahoo, S. K., and Kim, D. H. (2008) Mol. Cells 26, 265–269). The present study was undertaken to further characterize the association of calumenin with SERCA2 in mouse heart by various gene manipulation approaches. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that calumenin and SERCA2 were partially co-localized in HL-1 cells. Knockdown (KD) of calumenin was conducted in HL-1 cells and 80% reduction of calumenin did not induce any expressional changes of other Ca2+-cycling proteins. But it enhanced Ca2+ transient amplitude and showed shortened time to reach peak and decreased time to reach 50% of baseline. Oxalate-supported Ca2+ uptake showed increased Ca2+ sensitivity of SERCA2 in calumenin KD HL-1 cells. Calumenin and SERCA2 interaction was significantly lower in the presence of thapsigargin, vanadate, or ATP, as compared with 1.3 μm Ca2+, suggesting that the interaction is favored in the E1 state of SERCA2. A glutathione S-transferase-pulldown assay of calumenin deletion fragments and SERCA2 luminal domains suggested that regions of 132–222 amino acids of calumenin and 853–892 amino acids of SERCA2-L4 are the major binding partners. On the basis of our in vitro binding data and available information on three-dimensional structure of Ca2+-ATPases, a molecular model was proposed for the interaction between calumenin and SERCA2. Taken together, the present results suggest that calumenin is a novel regulator of SERCA2, and its expressional changes are tightly coupled with Ca2+-cycling of cardiomyocytes. Calumenin is a multiple EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein localized in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with C-terminal SR retention signal HDEF. Recently, we showed evidence that calumenin interacts with SERCA2 in rat cardiac SR (Sahoo, S. K., and Kim, D. H. (2008) Mol. Cells 26, 265–269). The present study was undertaken to further characterize the association of calumenin with SERCA2 in mouse heart by various gene manipulation approaches. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that calumenin and SERCA2 were partially co-localized in HL-1 cells. Knockdown (KD) of calumenin was conducted in HL-1 cells and 80% reduction of calumenin did not induce any expressional changes of other Ca2+-cycling proteins. But it enhanced Ca2+ transient amplitude and showed shortened time to reach peak and decreased time to reach 50% of baseline. Oxalate-supported Ca2+ uptake showed increased Ca2+ sensitivity of SERCA2 in calumenin KD HL-1 cells.

We show that oxidized low density lipoprotein or antibody-induced clustering of CD36 triggers macropinocytosis and internalization of the receptor-ligand complex.

Infiltrated macrophages can then readily oxidize and take up the modified LDL.

OxLDL particles are recognized by a variety of receptors, including the class A scavenger receptor SR-A and the class B scavenger receptor CD36. CD36 is thought to be responsible for ∼50% of oxLDL uptake by murine and human macrophages (1Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol.

In addition, this protein mediates cholesterol uptake from high density lipoprotein (4Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and is also a receptor for internalization of oxidized high density lipoprotein (5Thorne R.F. Mhaidat N.M. Ralston K.J. Burns G.F. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CD36 encodes a protein with two transmembrane domains located near the N and C termini, leaving only short cytoplasmic tails at each end. Despite having small intracellular domains, engagement of CD36 by its cognate ligands triggers signaling reactions that lead to the internalization of the resulting complex. However, the precise pathways that are activated and the specific mode of internalization remain unclear. Jones and Willingham (6Jones N.L. Willingham M.C. Anat. Rec. 1999; 255: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in macrophages, modified LDL stimulates ruffling activity and the formation of phase-bright macropinosomes. By transmission electron microscopy they found that gold-conjugated modified LDL associated with ruffles and was present within macropinosomes. These observations underlie the widely accepted view that uptake of modified LDL occurs by macropinocytosis. However, Zeng et al. (7Zeng Y. Tao N. Chung K.N. Heuser J.E. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45931-45936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) showed that internalized DiI-oxLDL and CD36 were found in moderately sized cytoplasmic structures that co-localized with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, suggesting uptake via lipid raft endocytosis. Moreover, Sun et al. (8Sun B. Boyanovsky B.B. Connelly M.A. Shridas P. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Webb N.R. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2560-2570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported that uptake of oxLDL by CD36 was independent of actin but dependent on dynamin. The results of these two studies are not easily reconciled with mediation by macropinocytosis, an actin-dependent process that generates large vacuoles, and they suggest instead that CD36 is internalized by a more conventional endocytic pathway. It is not clear whether the apparent discrepancy stems from the engagement of different receptors in the different biological systems used in these studies. Jones and Willingham used macrophages, whereas Zeng et al. and Sun et al. studied, respectively, Chinese hamster ovary and COS cells heterologously transfected with CD36. The types and abundance of receptors capable of binding modified LDL in all likelihood differ greatly in these systems, and heterologous (over)expression in immortalized cells is liable to produce results of questionable biological relevance. In view of this uncertainty and considering the important and versatile roles of CD36, we set out to reexamine the mode of internalization of this receptor. We used both primary and cultured macrophages and selectively targeted CD36 using specific antibodies. The responses triggered by selective CD36 cross-linking were also compared with those elicited by oxLDL. We show that clustering CD36 initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of both macropinocytosis and internalization of CD36. Remarkably, however, CD36 internalization is largely independent of macropinocytosis and occurs by a novel dynamin-independent, actin-driven process that requires activation of Src family and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. Mouse anti-human CD36 IgG (clone 131.2) was prepared by Narendra N. Tandon. The following antibodies were purchased from the sources indicated: mouse anti-mouse CD36 IgA and mouse anti-GAPDH (Chemicon); anti-mouse IgA Texas Red (Bio/FX); anti-CD36 IgM (BD Pharmingen); anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen); anti-mouse IgG Cy3, anti-mouse F(ab′)2 Cy3, anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunological Laboratories); Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine primary antibody (PY-20 clone) (BioLegend); anti-mouse IgA-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich); mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) (Upstate); rabbit anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling); and mouse anti-vinculin (Chemicon). Human peripheral macrophages were prepared according to McGilvray et al. (9McGilvray I.D. Serghides L. Kapus A. Rotstein O.D. Kain K.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 3231-3240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and CD36-knock-out mouse peritoneal macrophages were a gift from Kevin Kain (University Health Network, Toronto, Canada) and prepared according to Patel et al. (10Patel S.N. Serghides L.

U937 cells (ATCC) were differentiated with 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Bioshop Canada) for 2 days. RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Wisent) with 10% fetal bovine serum. During live experiments, cells were maintained in HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 medium (H-RPMI; Wisent). Total CD36 immunostaining was accomplished by fixing RAW 264.7, differentiated U937, or human peripheral macrophages with 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences), permeabilizing with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocking with 5% serum, and labeling with anti-CD36 IgA or anti-human CD36 IgG, followed by anti-mouse IgA Texas Red or anti-mouse IgG Cy3 secondary antibody, respectively. CD36 receptors were internalized by cross-linking with a primary antibody followed by a secondary antibody and warming, as follows. RAW 264.7 cells were chilled for 3 min in ice-cold H-RPMI followed by a 5-min incubation in ice-cold 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich), a 10-min incubation in ice-cold anti-CD36 IgA, and a 10-min incubation in ice-cold anti-mouse IgA Texas Red or donkey anti-mouse F(ab′)2 Cy3. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold H-RPMI before and after antibody labeling steps. Differentiated U937 cells and human peripheral macrophages were similarly labeled using either mouse IgG clone 131.2 or mouse anti-CD36 IgM, followed by anti-mouse IgG Cy3. In cases where only surface labeling was to be examined, cells were washed in ice-cold H-RPMI and fixed in 4% PFA. For internalization protocols, cells were warmed at 37 °C in H-RPMI for 30 min in a non-CO2 incubator. In most cases, antibodies bound to the noninternalized CD36 were stripped off with an acid wash protocol: Cells were treated for 2 min with ice-cold acid wash buffer (0.5 m glacial acetic acid, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 2.5) followed by recovery in ice-cold H-RPMI for 2 min. Both steps were repeated once. Wild-type, CD36-knock-out mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells were serum-starved in H-RPMI for 1 h and treated with DiI-labeled oxidized LDL (1 μg/ml; Intracel). After 30 min, cells were acid-washed twice. Peritoneal cells were fixed in 4% PFA, and internalized oxidized LDL was imaged. RAW 264.7 cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 20 min, blocked with 5% serum, and stained with anti-CD36 IgA followed by anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488. For transfection experiments, RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA (wild-type Dynamin1, K44A dominant negative Dynamin1, PAK1-PBD-YFP, AKT1-PH-GFP, Rac1 DN, Cdc42 DN, RhoA DN, or Arf6 DN) using 6 μl of FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To examine PAK1 recruitment during CD36 cross-linking, cells were transfected with PAK1-PBD-YFP, labeled for CD36, warmed in H-RPMI for 3 min, fixed, and imaged on a spinning disc microscope. In all cases, cells were examined 16 h after transfection. For chemical inhibition, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with inhibitors as follows: latrunculin B (10 μm, 30 min; Calbiochem), cytochalasin D (5 μm, 30 min; Calbiochem), Clostridium difficile neurotoxin B (0.5 μg/ml, 3 h; Tech Lab), JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μm, 1 h; Calbiochem), wortmannin (250 nm, 30 min; Calbiochem), PP1 (10 μm, 30 min; Alexis Biochemicals); or LY294002 (100 μm, 30 min; Biomol) before labeling with antibody (see “CD36 Cross-linking”). Cells were warmed for 30 min and fixed (without acid wash), and CD36 internalization was imaged by spinning disc microscopy. For data quantification, the same experiment included an acid wash protocol prior to fixation. To determine the dependence of oxLDL-induced CD36 uptake on actin, Src family kinases, and phospho-JNK, RAW 264.7 cells were serum-starved for 4 h and incubated in the presence of unlabeled oxLDL (50 μg/ml; Intracel) and the appropriate inhibitor for 30 min before fixation. Total CD36 was detected by permeabilizing cells and labeling with anti-CD36 IgA and anti-mouse secondary antibody. RAW 264.7 cells were grown to 90% confluence in 6-well dishes, serum-starved in H-RPMI for 4 h, then treated with or without PP1. These cells were further treated as follows: no treatment or labeled with CD36 primary with or without secondary antibody in the cold, with the exception that the secondary antibody used was anti-mouse CD36 F(ab′)2 labeled in ice-cold H-RPMI for 10 min. Cells were then induced to internalize CD36 by incubating in prewarmed H-RPMI at 37 °C for 3 min, with or without PP1, lysed in Laemmli sample buffer containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Bioshop Canada), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 nm okadaic acid (Bioshop Canada), 1 mm sodium fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), and mammalian protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked overnight with 3% bovine serum albumin (EMD Biosciences) in 1× TBST (0.05% Tween 20), and probed with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. Blots were stripped and reprobed with mouse anti-GAPDH primary antibody. RAW 264.7 cells were serum-starved in H-RPMI without CO2 for 1 h and then treated with inhibitors as follows; no treatment, wortmannin (250 nm, 30 min), LY294002 (100 μm, 30 min), amiloride (0.5 mm, 10 min; Sigma-Aldrich), or HOE-694 (10 μm, 10 min) in H-RPMI at 37 °C. To induce macropinocytosis, cells were then incubated in H-RPMI containing 40 ng/ml mouse M-CSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 150 μg/ml sulforhodamine B (Molecular Probes), and the appropriate inhibitor for 30 min at 37 °C without CO2. The negative control contained sulforhodamine but no M-CSF. All experiments were performed three times. To measure sulforhodamine uptake, cells were fixed in 4% PFA, and multiple focal planes were immediately imaged on a DRM/IRE2 Leica fluorescent microscope, using OpenLab software 5.5.0 (Improvision). Images were analyzed in Photoshop by counting only macropinosomes larger than 0.7 μm. For each experimental condition, the total number of macropinosomes/cell was counted, averaged, and normalized to the control (no inhibitor). To determine whether the inhibition of macropinosome formation can lead to inhibition of CD36 internalization, cells were pretreated with agents shown to inhibit macropinocytosis (0.5 mm amiloride for 10 min or 10 μm HOE-694 for 10 min). Cells were fixed in 4% PFA, permeabilized, and stained 30 min with 10 μg/ml DAPI (Molecular Probes). To induce CD36 uptake for scanning electron microscopy, RAW 264.7 cells were labeled with CD36 antibodies (see “CD36 Cross-linking”), and warmed for 3 min at 37 °C. To demonstrate ruffles induced by M-CSF, cells were treated with mouse M-CSF and sulforhodamine B for 3 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Microscopy was performed on an FEI XL30 environmental scanning electron microscope. All images except those for macropinocytosis assays were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M spinning disc confocal microscope, using Volocity v.4.3.2 software (Improvision). Macropinocytosis images were acquired on a DRM/IRE2 Leica fluorescent microscope, using OpenLab software v. 5.5.0. Scanning electron microscope images were acquired at a magnification of ×5000. Data for the graphs in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7 were obtained by analyzing images taken with a spinning disc microscope. At least three assays were performed per data set. Z-stacks (30–40 layers) were flattened using Volocity software v. 4.3.2 to a single layer using the Extended Focus function while maintaining pixels at subsaturating levels, allowing an arbitrary pixel range from 0 to 64,535. Pixel densities were analyzed in ImageJ v.1.38 (National Institutes of Health) to obtain an arbitrary amount of CD36 internalization/number of cells. These data were normalized to the control (untreated cells), standard deviations were calculated, and the data were plotted in Excel. We first examined the steady-state distribution of unstimulated CD36 in fixed and permeabilized macrophages. For comparative purposes, we examined the murine RAW macrophage-like cell line, the human U937 monocyte cell line differentiated to macrophages by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and primary human macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, confocal microscopy revealed that virtually all of the endogenous CD36 resides at the cell surface of resting macrophages. The primary macrophages adopt a “fried egg” appearance on the coverslip so that confocal images of surface CD36 frequently appeared punctate, as seen in Fig. 1C. However, this was due to tangential sectioning through the plasma membrane of these flat cells, and reconstructions of the vertical profile (Z plane; shown beneath each image) clearly demonstrated that the staining was at the cell surface. Predominant cell membrane localization had previously been observed when CD36 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Zeng Y. Tao N. Chung K.N. Heuser J.E. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45931-45936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine whether antibody-induced cross-linking could trigger signaling through CD36 and drive its internalization, live cells were first incubated in the cold in the presence of anti-CD36 antibodies, followed by a labeled secondary antibody. When maintained at 0 °C, CD36 remained at the cell surface but gained a slightly more punctate appearance in all three cell types (Fig. 1, D–F). When cells that had been cross-linked in the cold were warmed to 37 °C, a striking redistribution of CD36 labeling was observed. After 30 min, CD36 was found in a punctate pattern within intracellular compartments (Fig. 1, G–I). To validate the intracellular localization of the punctate fluorescence and to quantify the efficiency of the internalization protocol, cells were treated as above and then fixed without permeabilization and immunostained with primary and a different secondary antibody to detect residual exofacial CD36. Little CD36 remained at the surface under the conditions used (data not shown). Two lines of evidence indicate that the internalization was not caused by engagement of Fcγ receptors, which are abundant on the surface of macrophages. First, extensive internalization was observed when CD36 was cross-linked in RAW cells using a primary IgA antibody followed by fluorescently labeled anti-mouse F(ab′)2 secondary antibodies (Fig. 1G, inset). Second, potent internalization was obtained by exposing U937 (Fig. 1H, inset) and primary human macrophages (Fig. 1I, inset) to anti-human CD36 IgM antibodies, which do not interact with Fc receptors. CD36 is thought to be responsible for ∼50% of oxLDL uptake by murine and human macrophages (1Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nozaki S. Kashiwagi H. Yamashita S. Nakagawa T. Kostner B. Tomiyama Y. Nakata A. Ishigami M. Miyagawa J. Kameda-Takemura K.

Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49982-49988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). To determine whether oxLDL would trigger internalization of CD36, RAW cells were incubated in the presence of oxLDL for 30 min and then fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained for CD36. As shown in Fig. 1J, CD36 was internalized into punctate organelles in the cytoplasm following exposure to oxLDL, resembling the pattern observed when antibodies triggered internalization. Similar results were reported earlier in J774 cells transfected with GFP-tagged CD36 (7Zeng Y. Tao N. Chung K.N. Heuser J.E. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45931-45936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To confirm that CD36 is at least partly responsible for oxLDL uptake in these cells, primary macrophages isolated from wild-type or CD36-deficient mice were incubated with DiI-labeled oxLDL. As shown in Fig. 1, K and L, wild-type macrophages bound and internalized a much greater amount of oxLDL than did CD36−/− macrophages. Quantification of three independent experiments revealed that CD36−/− macrophages only internalized 22.6 ± 0.9% as much oxLDL as control macrophages. Together, these results suggest that under the experimental conditions used, CD36 is responsible for the majority of oxLDL uptake and that the internalization of CD36 triggered by oxLDL can be mimicked by cross-linking the receptors with anti-CD36 antibodies. The recent study by Sun et al. (8Sun B. Boyanovsky B.B. Connelly M.A. Shridas P. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Webb N.R. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2560-2570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggested that in COS7 cells, uptake of oxLDL by CD36 depends on dynamin. We therefore examined whether the uptake of endogenous CD36 in macrophages also relies on dynamin. To test this, RAW cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type or dominant negative forms of dynamin1. As before, cells were incubated in the cold in the presence of anti-CD36 and a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and then warmed to 37 °C for 30 min, acid-washed, and fixed for microscopy. To ensure that dynamin inhibition had in fact occurred, we also labeled the cells with a brief pulse of fluorescent transferrin. Uptake of transferrin is known to occur by clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis (11Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A–C, the cells transfected with wild-type dynamin, like their untransfected neighbors, internalized both transferrin and CD36. Of note, there was little overlap in the distribution of these two markers, raising the possibility that they were internalized by different means. Indeed, cells transfected with dominant negative dynamin1 (Fig. 2, D–F) were unable to take up transferrin but internalized CD36 to levels comparable with their untransfected neighbors and wild-type dynamin control cells. Note that the acid washing technique removes bound surface transferrin that is not internalized. The results of three independent experiments, quantified and presented in Fig. 2G, demonstrate that internalization of endogenous CD36 is largely independent of dynamin in macrophages. Because macropinocytosis had been invoked as a mechanism for oxLDL uptake (6Jones N.L. Willingham M.C. Anat. Rec. 1999; 255: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we tested whether antibody-dependent internalization of CD36 required filamentous actin. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with either latrunculin B or cytochalasin D before cross-linking CD36 with primary and secondary antibodies. Fig. 3B shows that cytochalasin D blocked internalization (quantified in Fig. 3G) and caused CD36 to aggregate into large clusters on the cell surface (compare Fig. 3, A and B). Similar results were obtained with latrunculin B (Fig. 3G). Actin polymerization often follows activation of Rho family GTPases, and Rac has been implicated in forming large membrane ruffles of the type involved in macropinocytosis. To determine whether Rac or Cdc42 activation is occurring during CD36 cross-linking, RAW cells were transfected with YFP fused to the Rac binding domain of the Rac effector PAK1 (PAK1-PBD-YFP). This fusion protein binds to Rac and Cdc42 only when in the active, GTP-bound form but not when bound to GDP. In resting cells, PAK1-PBD-YFP is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C, inset) but is recruited to the plasma membrane upon cross-linking of CD36 (main panel in Fig. 3C). This implies that Rac and/or Cdc42 is activated upon CD36 engagement and raises the possibility that the GTPases may contribute to the internalization of the receptors. To test this possibility, cells were preincubated with C. difficile toxin B, which glucosylates and inhibits Rho family proteins. Following treatment with this toxin, CD36 internalization was impaired (Fig. 3, D and G). To define the contribution of Rho family GTPases further, we transfected RAW cells with constructs that express dominant negative forms of Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA and measured internalization in transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3H, Rac1 and Cdc42 dominant negative proteins significantly inhibited CD36 uptake by 56 and 45%, respectively (p < 0.01 in both cases). Because CD36 is also known to associate with integrins, we considered whether its internalization may occur by the Arf6 pathway implicated in integrin recycling (12Pellinen T. Ivaska J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Dominant negative Arf6 only reduced CD36 internalization by 25%, although this decrease was also significant (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3H). The preceding findings, which implicate Rac/Cdc42 and actin polymerization, are consistent with the notion that CD36 is internalized by macropinocytosis, as suggested by Jones and Willingham (6Jones N.L. Willingham M.C. Anat. Rec. 1999; 255: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) is an obligatory feature of macropinocytosis, we determined whether this phosphoinositide also accumulates upon CD36 clustering. The distribution of PIP3 was analyzed by transfecting RAW cells with a reporter construct consisting of the Pleckstrin homology domain of AKT linked to GFP. In unstimulated cells, this probe is found predominantly in the cytoplasm, indicating that PIP3 levels are low (Fig. 3E). However, following cross-linking of CD36, AKT-GFP rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane, reflecting increased levels of PIP3 and/or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which is a product of dephosphorylation of PIP3 and is also recognized by the probe (Fig. 3F). To ensure that the relocalization of the probe was due to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), cells were pretreated with the specific inhibitor, LY294002. This treatment blocked the accumulation of AKT-GFP at the membrane (Fig. 3F, inset), confirming that CD36 clustering leads to activation of PI3K. Activation of PI3K and Rac, followed by actin polymerization, are hallmarks of macropinocytosis (13Swanson J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether CD36 internalization occurred via the formation of macropinosomes. To assay macropinocytosis we incubated RAW cells in the presence of sulforhodamine as a fluid-phase marker. The macrophages were treated with either M-CSF, a well established inducer of macropinocytosis, or with anti-CD36 primary plus secondary antibodies to induce cross-linking, as above. Because sulforhodamine can also be taken up by endocytosis, only structures larger than 0.7 μm in diameter were scored as macropinosomes. As shown in Fig. 4A, few macropinosomes were seen in untreated cells. In contrast, M-CSF induced the appearance of macropinosomes in a considerable fraction of the cells (Fig. 4B), consistent with earlier findings in primary macrophages (14Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 867-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, CD36 cross-linking also induced the formation of macropinosomes in a significant fraction of the cells (Fig. 4C). To ensure that the large structures containing the fluid-phase marker are indeed macropinosomes, we performed experiments in the presence of LY294002. This inhibitor precluded accumulation of sulforhodamine in M-CSF-stimulated cells (Fig. 4D), confirming that PI3K activity is essential for macropinocytosis (15Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The accumulation of the fluid-phase marker was also obliterated by LY294002 (Fig. 4D), consistent with mediation by macropinocytosis. Macropinosome formation is also sensitive to amiloride. Although this drug has multiple cellular targets, its effect on macropinocytosis is likely mediated by inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange because it is replicated by HOE-694. At low micromolar concentrations this agent is a rather selective inhibitor of NHE1,"
https://openalex.org/W2070068901,"Amyloid accumulation is associated with pathological conditions, including type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Lipids influence amyloidogenesis and are themselves targets for amyloid-mediated cell membrane disruption. Amyloid precursors are surface-active, accumulating at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces (e.g., air-water), where their biophysical and kinetic behaviors differ from those in the bulk solution with significant and underappreciated consequences. Biophysical modeling predicted the probability and rate of beta-sheet amyloid dimer formation to be higher and faster at the air-water interface (AWI) than in the bulk (by 14 and approximately 1500 times, respectively). Time-course staining experiments with a typical amyloid dye verified our predictions by demonstrating that without AWI, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibrilization was abolished or slowed, depending on the conditions. Our controls included undisturbed IAPP reactions, and we ascertained that the AWI removal process (technical or material) did not itself affect the reaction. Furthermore, we showed that the role of membranes in amyloidogenesis has been previously underestimated; in an in vivo-like situation (with no AWI), anionic liposomes (containing dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol) enhanced IAPP fibrilogenesis far more than described previously in conventional assay conditions (in the presence of an AWI). These findings have implications for the protein misfolding field and in assay design to target toxic protein aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1984066565,"The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a cAMP-responsive global transcriptional regulator, responsible for the regulation of a multitude of diverse proteins. We have determined the crystal structures of the CRP.cAMP and CRP.N(6)-cAMP derivative-bound forms of the enzyme to 2.2- and 2.3 A-resolution, respectively, to investigate cAMP-mediated conformational and structural changes. The allosteric switch from the open, inactive conformation to the closed, active conformation begins with a number of changes in the ligand-binding cavity upon cAMP binding. These subtle structural changes and numerous non-bonding interactions between cAMP, the N-domain residues, and the C-domain helices demonstrate that the N-domain hairpin loop acts as a structural mediator of the allosteric switch. Based on the CRP.N(6)-cAMP crystal structure, binding of N(6)-cAMP with a bulkier methylphenylethyl extension from the N6 atom stabilizes the cAMP-binding domain, N-domain hairpin, and C-terminal domain in a similar manner as that of the CRP.cAMP structure, maintaining structural integrity within the subunits. However, the bulkier N6 extension of N(6)-cAMP (in R conformation) is accommodated only in subunit A with minor changes, whereas in subunit B, the N6 extension is in the S conformation hindering the hinge region of the central helix. As a result, the entire N-domain and the C-domain of subunit B integrated by the cAMP portion of this ligand, together tilt away ( approximately 7 degrees tilt) from central helix C, positioning the helix-turn-helix motif in an unfavorable position for the DNA substrate, asymmetrically. Together, these crystal structures demonstrate the mechanism of action of the cAMP molecule and its role in integrating the active CRP structure."
https://openalex.org/W2129256337,"The molecular determinants necessary and sufficient for recognition of its specific DNA target are contained in the C-terminal domain (H-NSctd) of nucleoid-associated protein H-NS. H-NSctd protects from DNaseI cleavage a few short DNA segments of the H-NS-sensitive hns promoter whose sequences closely match the recently identified H-NS consensus motif (tCG(t/a)T(a/t)AATT) and, alone or fused to the protein oligomerization domain of phage λ CI repressor, inhibits transcription from the hns promoter in vitro and in vivo. The importance of H-NS oligomerization is indicated by the fact that with an extended hns promoter construct (400 bp), which allows protein oligomerization, DNA binding and transcriptional repression are highly and almost equally efficient with native H-NS and H-NSctd::λCI and much less effective with the monomeric H-NSctd. With a shorter (110 bp) construct, which does not sustain extensive protein oligomerization, transcriptional repression is less effective, but native H-NS, H-NSctd::λCI, and monomeric H-NSctd have comparable activity on this construct. The specific H-NS-DNA interaction was investigated by NMR spectroscopy using monomeric H-NSctd and short DNA duplexes encompassing the H-NS target sequence of hns (TCCTTACATT) with the best fit (8 of 10 residues) to the H-NS-binding motif.

Nucleoid-associated DNA-binding protein H-NS plays the dual role of architectural protein of the nucleoid and regulator of expression of a large number of genes. Differential display analysis of transcriptomes of wild type and hns null mutants of Escherichia coli has revealed that the number of genes whose expression is directly or indirectly controlled by H-NS corresponds to ∼5% of the total chromosomal genes (1Hommais F.

Both mechanisms depend upon the recognition of DNA bends and bending of linear tracts of DNA, two H-NS properties that in turn depend upon the DNA binding and oligomerization capacity of this protein (4Spurio R.

H-NS binds preferentially to DNA bends (4Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10Bracco L. Kotlarz D. Kolb A.

Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but the quantitative aspects of this preference remained a matter of dispute, also because the very extended, ill-defined, and diffuse footprinting patterns often produced by H-NS on its target promoters (16Rimsky S. Spassky A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3765-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Falconi M. Brandi A. La Teana A. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suggested that H-NS was devoid of any DNA binding specificity (18Luijsterburg M.S. Noom M.C. Wuite G.J. Dame R.T. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus, the selectivity by which H-NS targets the promoters of some genes and not of others was difficult to explain. However, contrary to general opinion, recent data have shown that H-NS recognizes a specific 10-bp-long consensus sequence (19Lang B. Blot N. Bouffartigues E. Buckle M. Geertz M. Gualerzi C.O.

Furthermore, it was suggested that the consensus sequences represent the specific target where H-NS nucleation initially starts before subsequent protein oligomerization leads to the assembly of the transcriptional repression complex. Indeed, following initial binding to nucleation sites strategically located in a given promoter, H-NS-H-NS interactions could promote bridging between the two sides of a DNA bend (17Falconi M.

In this article we show that H-NSctd fused to the protein oligomerization domain of the bacteriophage λCI repressor, or even the isolated, monomeric H-NSctd can (auto)repress, both in vivo and in vitro, the H-NS-sensitive hns promoter with the same specificity, albeit not with the same efficiency, as native H-NS. Furthermore, we show that the isolated H-NSctd is able to selectively protect the same 10-bp consensus sequence recognized by the whole protein on the same promoter. These findings demonstrate that the H-NSctd contains all the molecular determinants necessary and sufficient for recognition and binding to a specific DNA target and that the interaction with these site(s) likely reflects a key step in the mechanism of transcriptional repression by which H-NS controls the expression of its own gene and, likely, that of entire groups of select genes. In light of the above premises, in this article we have used NMR spectroscopy to investigate the residues of H-NSctd involved in the specific recognition of its target DNA as well as the structural features of the DNA target itself. We conclude from our results that the specific binding of H-NSctd to its consensus target entails an interaction between a tetrapeptide loop of the protein and 5 bp in the duplex where its structure deviates from the canonical B-DNA form. Buffer A contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 60 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm benzamidine; Buffer B contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm benzamidine; Buffer C contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl; Buffer D contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm benzamidine; Buffer E contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; Buffer F contained 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0 buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% (v/v) Nonidet P-40; and Buffer G contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl. The full-length protein was overproduced in E. coli UT5600 harboring pcI857 and pPLc2833, which carries hns under the control of the λPL promoter. During the exponential phase the cells, grown at 30 °C in LB containing ampicillin (60 mg/l) and kanamycin (25 mg/l), were induced to overexpress H-NS by a 30–42 °C temperature shift. After 30 min at 42 °C and 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A, and ruptured by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the S30 cell fraction. The NH4Cl concentration was increased to 1 m, and the cell extract subjected to ultracentrifugation at 80 K rpm (Sorvall S80AT3–0181 rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C to yield a postribosomal (S100) fraction that was extensively dialyzed against buffer B. The extract was then loaded on a phosphocellulose column and eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (100–700 mm) in buffer B, and the fractions containing H-NS, identified by 16% SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B, loaded on a heparin-Sepharose column, and eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (100–700 mm) in buffer B. The pooled fractions containing H-NS were concentrated and subjected to gel filtration through a Superdex 75-HR column (Amersham Biosciences) eluting with buffer B containing 0.7 m NaCl. The H-NS-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C. The C-terminal domain of H-NS (residues 89–136) was overproduced in E. coli 71-18 harboring both pEV1, carrying the coding sequence for H-NS89–136 and pcI857. Induction of H-NSctd was carried out essentially as described for the full-length protein but for the fact that for the isotopic labeling the cells were grown in minimal medium (50 mg/liter MgSO4, 4.4 g/liter KH2PO4, 12 g/liter K2HPO4, 7 mg/liter (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O, 0.6 g/liter NH4Cl, 5 g/liter glucose, 10 mg/liter thiamine hydrochloride) supplemented with ampicillin (60 mg/liter) and kanamycin (25 mg/liter) as well as with 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl or with 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 3 g/liter 13C-glucose. Purification of the H-NSctd was carried out following a protocol similar to that used for the full-length protein, but for the use of buffer D and the elution from the column obtained with a 25–600 mm linear NaCl gradient and for the presence of 6 m urea in the buffer used for gel filtration. The purified proteins were resuspended in buffer E and stored at −80 °C. The DNA fragment containing the hns promoter was generated by PCR using Taq platinum polymerase (Invitrogen) and two primers, one of which was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) using phage T4 polynucleotide kinase. The primers (5′-GCTTCGCTCATTGTAGTAATC-3′ and 5′-AGTCCATGCTCTTATTGCGAC-3′) specifically amplify a 360-bp fragment from the template pKK400 (13Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The PCR product was purified on a GenElute PCR clean-up column (Sigma). The labeled fragment (<2 nm) containing the hns promoter was incubated at 20 °C with the indicated concentrations of protein. The nuclease reaction was carried out for 30 s at 20 °C with 10 μg/ml of DNase I (Sigma) in 20 μl of Buffer F. The reaction was stopped by placing the samples on ice and adding 75 μl of 100 mm EDTA. After phenol chloroform extraction, the samples were precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol in the presence of 20 μg/ml of glycogen and 1 μg/ml of calf thymus DNA. The samples were then resuspended in 5 μl of formamide blue (90% (v/v) formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol) and loaded on 8% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The plasmids used for the in vivo studies were constructed as follows. The DNA encoding the oligomerization domain of the λCI repressor was first placed into pBAD under the control of the ara promoter using the BglII and EcoRI sites. Then a fragment comprising the ara promoter and the oligomerization domain of λCI repressor was excised with HincII and PstI and placed into pACYC177 to give pACYC177-λCIctd. Finally, the PCR product of the DNA encoding the C-terminal domain of H-NS(Δ1–488) was inserted into the NcoI and BglII sites of pACYC177-λCIctd to yield the plasmid pACYC-H-NSctd:: λCIctd encoding the chimeric protein H-NS(Δ1–88)::CI(Δ1–92). To construct pACYC177-H-NSwt and pACYC177-H-NSctd, the plasmids expressing H-NSwt and the C-terminal domain of H-NS(Δ1–88) under the control of the ara promoter, the PCR products of the hns sequence encoding the entire H-NS protein or its C-terminal domain were inserted into the NcoI and PstI sites of pACYC177. The pACYC constructs were transformed into E. coli YK4124, an hns null strain (27Yasuzawa K. Hayashi N. Goshima N. Kohno K. Imamoto F. Kano Y. Gene. 1992; 122: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) carrying pKK400, pKK110, or pBR328, three plasmids encoding the cat reporter gene (13Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because in our hands, the ara promoter was rather leaky, its induction proved to be unnecessary to obtain the in trans expression of H-NSwt, H-NS(Δ1–88), and H-NS(Δ1–88)::CI(Δ1–92). The cellular level of these proteins was estimated, using a protocol similar to that previously described (28Brandi A. Spurio R. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), by semi-quantitative Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies raised against H-NSwt and calibration curves constructed with known amounts of the three purified proteins. The ability of H-NSwt, H-NSctd::λCIctd, or H-NSctd to repress transcription of the cat reporter gene was measured by testing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity expressed by the cells (29Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture contained ∼5 ng of the appropriate DNA fragment (end-labeled with [32P]dATP by fill-in reaction using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase), 50 ng of poly(IdT) DNA competitor, and the indicated amounts of purified proteins in 20 μl of Buffer G containing 1 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. After 10-min incubation at 22 °C, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis at room temperature on a 7% polyacrylamide gel in Tris acetate buffer. The reaction was carried out in 30 μl of Buffer G containing 2 mm spermidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μg of pKK400 DNA, 0.5 mm of the four NTPs, and the indicated amounts of purified proteins. The mixtures were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min and, after the addition of 0.2 unit of E. coli RNA polymerase, incubated at the same temperature for 30 min. The reactions were stopped with 5 mm EDTA, and the samples were precipitated with ethanol after the addition of 1 m ammonium acetate and 1 μg of tRNA. Electrophoretic analysis of the product, followed by Northern blotting and hybridization (30La Teana A. Brandi A. Falconi M. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10907-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), showed that chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA is the only product obtained. The DNA probe used to reveal the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA produced in the transcription reaction was a DNA fragment containing the entire cat gene labeled with [32P]dATP using a random primer kit (Amersham Biosciences). Typical conditions for NMR experiments consist of samples in 10–50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.5. The protein resonances were assigned using a double-labeled 15N-13C sample and recording 15N HSQC, 13C HSQC, 15N total correlated spectroscopy-HSQC, 15N NOESY-HSQC, HNHA, CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, HBHA(CO)NH spectra. NMR experiments were performed on Bruker AVANCE instruments operating at 400, 600, 750, and 900 MHz with the temperature set to 300 °K. Data were processed using NMRPipe (31Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11623) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (32Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar) or Sparky. Analysis of the titration of H-NSctd with the DNA fragment was performed considering the ΔδHN and the ΔδN difference shifts of the complex and the free protein domain as well as combining both shifts according to the relationship: Δδ = [ΔδHN2 + (ΔδN/R)2]1/2, where R = 10. All of the protons of the 20-, 15-, and 10-bp target fragments were assigned from two-dimensional NOESY and total correlated spectroscopy spectra obtained in both H2O and D2O following the established procedure (33Wijmenga S.S. Mooren M.M.W. Hilbers C.W. NMR of Biological Macromolecules: A Practical Approach.in: Roberts G.C.K. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 216-288Google Scholar). In previous studies we have used two-hybrid systems to study the in vivo oligomerization properties of H-NS as well as of its fragments and mutants and have shown that changes of some environmental parameters can affect the efficiency by which tetramers of H-NS (the biologically active form of this protein) are formed (24Stella S. Spurio R. Falconi M. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2896-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To study the H-NS-DNA interaction here we have used a similar two-hybrid approach. However, instead of using chimerae having the DNA binding capacity of a lambdoid repressor and the protein oligomerization property of H-NS, we have constructed a chimera in which the DNA binding property is provided by H-NSctd (H-NS(Δ1–88)) and the protein oligomerization function is provided by the C-domain of bacteriophage λ CI repressor (CI(Δ1–92)) (Fig. 1A). This chimera was tested in vivo for its capacity to repress transcription from the hns promoter, which is subject to transcriptional autorepression by H-NS (13Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Falconi M. Brandi A. La Teana A. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Dersch P. Schmidt K. Bremer E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For this purpose two plasmid constructs, pKK400 and pKK110 (schematically represented in Ref. 13Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were used. Both constructs contain the promoter-less reporter gene cat placed under the control of the core elements of the hns promoter. The construct pKK400 contains all three H-NS-binding regions found in hns, namely the promoter-proximal site and the two extended tracts of DNA flanking the intrinsic DNA bend located at approximately −150; pKK110, on the other hand, lacks the entire upstream region and contains only the promoter-proximal H-NS-binding site (13Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Falconi M. Brandi A. La Teana A. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As a result, transcription from pKK400 is strongly repressed by H-NS, which, exploiting its oligomerization capacity, can build an extended multimeric nucleoprotein complex, thereby preventing the RNA polymerase from forming a functional transcription initiation complex. On the other hand, transcription from pKK110 is inhibited with lower efficiency by H-NS, which can bind to only one DNA region and inhibits transcription by competing with RNA polymerase for binding to the same DNA tract (13Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Falconi M. Brandi A. La Teana A. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells harboring pBR328 were used as a control because in this plasmid the cat gene is expressed from its natural promoter, which is not H-NS-sensitive, unlike the hns promoter. These three plasmids (pBR328, pKK400, and pKK110) were transformed into hns null mutant cells which either: (a) do not express any H-NS; (b) express full-length H-NS (H-NSwt) in trans under the control of the ara promoter; (c) express the H-NSctd::λCIctd chimera; or (d) express a protein fragment (H-NSctd) consisting of the C-terminal domain. The level of cat expressed from the three plasmid constructs was then measured in the aforementioned genetic backgrounds. Because semi-quantitative Western blotting (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that the three forms of H-NS (H-NSwt, the H-NSctd::λCIctd chimera, and H-NSctd) were present in vivo in stoichiometrically comparable amounts, the level of cat measured should represent a good estimate of the in vivo repressor capacity of these proteins (see “Discussion”). As seen from the results obtained, cat transcription from pBR328 is essentially unaffected by H-NSwt, by the H- NSctd::λCIctd chimera, and by the isolated H-NSctd, its level of expression being in all cases ∼90% of the control lacking H-NS (Fig. 1B). This is the expected result for a promoter that is not under transcriptional control of H-NS. In contrast, cat expression from pKK400 was found to be severely repressed (∼90%) by H-NSwt, by the H-NSctd::λCIctd chimera (∼70%), and, albeit with a lower efficiency, by the isolated monomeric H-NSctd (∼40%). Furthermore, in agreement with published results (13Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), H-NSwt was able to repress cat expression from pKK110, albeit to a lesser extent than from pKK400 (∼40 versus ∼90%). It is remarkable, however, that with the pKK110 plasmid, cat is repressed to almost the same level by H-NSwt (∼44%), by the HNSctd::λCIctd chimera (∼37%), and by H-NSctd (∼32%) (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that the highest repression capacity of H-NS requires protein oligomerization, which brings together H-NS molecules bound to distant portions of the promoter, an event that is possible in the pKK400 plasmid where the hns promoter contains multiple H-NS-binding sites but not in pKK110, which contains a single H-NS-binding region (13Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Falconi M. Brandi A. La Teana A. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The similar repression capacity of the oligomerization-incompetent H-NSctd and of the oligomerization-competent H-NSwt and H-NSctd::λCIctd chimera adds further support to this premise. Furthermore, the good performance of the H-NSctd::λCIctd chimera in inhibiting cat transcription from pKK400 indicates that the C-terminal domain of the λCI repressor can efficiently replace H-NSntd in promoting H-NSctd oligomerization, yielding a transcriptional repressor with properties similar to those of H-NSwt and that the N-terminal domain of this protein does not significantly contribute to the recognition and binding of the DNA target, a property that is instead due to the C-domain of the protein. The premise that all molecular determinants for the recognition of a target promoter are contained within the C-domain of H-NS is further supported by the finding that, despite its lack of binding cooperativity, the monomeric H-NSctd is capable of selective transcriptional repression vis-à-vis an H-NS-sensitive promoter. Consistent with the in vivo results are in vitro data in which purified H-NSwt, H-NSctd::λCIctd chimera, and H-NSctd were compared for their DNA binding capacity and for their effect on hns::cat transcription. As seen from the electrophoretic band shift experiment shown in Fig. 2A, increasing concentrations of all three proteins retarded the mobility of a 400-bp DNA fragment (excised from pKK400) containing the complete hns promoter region. In addition to demonstrating that all three proteins can bind to this DNA fragment, these results indicate that the three proteins each have different affinity for this fragment. In fact, although the level of retardation reaches saturation with approximately the same amounts (in the pmol range) of both H-NSwt and H-NSctd::λCIctd chimera, a comparable retardation level requires much larger amounts (i.e. in the nmol range) of H-NSctd. From these results, we estimate that the affinity of the H-NSctd::λCIctd chimera for the DNA is ∼2–4 times lower than that of H-NSwt, whereas that of H-NSctd is ∼4 orders of magnitude lower. Because the gel shift experiments are car"

https://openalex.org/W2019873789,"Sex pheromone production in the pheromone gland (PG) of the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, is mediated by store-operated channels (SOCs) acting downstream of pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) binding. Although recent studies have implicated STIM1 and Orai1 as essential components of SOCs, little is known about the molecular nature of the SOCs involved in sex pheromone production. In this study we cloned silkmoth homologs of STIM1 and Orai1 and sought to determine whether they comprise the PG SOC pathway. BmSTIM1 is expressed in multiple tissues and, in the PG, is encoded by two transcripts of differing size. BmOrai1A and BmOrai1B, which are identical except for a 37-residue N-terminal truncation in BmOrai1B, arise from alternative splicing of the bmorai1 locus and are expressed as independent transcripts in various tissues. In the PG, only BmOrai1B is actively transcribed. Fluorescent chimeras demonstrated that BmSTIM1 expression is restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas both BmOrai1A and BmOrai1B localize to the cell surface. In Ca(2+)-free medium, thapsigargin-mediated depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores resulted in redistribution of BmSTIM1 to the plasma membrane, but only when the BmOrai1 homologs were also overexpressed. Translocation was dependent on the BmSTIM1 C terminus ""CRAC activation domain."" Ala mutation of Lys(380), Lys(383), Lys(384), Arg(382), and Arg(385) suggests that translocation involves electrostatic interactions. Translocation was also seen following PBAN stimulation in cells co-expressing BmSTIM1, BmOrai1B, and the PBAN receptor. In vivo RNA interference-mediated knockdown of BmSTIM1 and BmOrai1 significantly reduced sex pheromone production without affecting cell viability."

The present paper describes a novel biosynthetic pathway of the archaeal inositol phospholipid. To study the biosynthesis of archaetidylinositol in vitro, we prepared two possible substrates: CDP-archaeol, which was chemically synthesized, and myo-[14C]inositol 1-phosphate, which was enzymatically prepared from [14C]glucose 6-phosphate with the inositol 1-phosphate (IP) synthase of this organism. The complete structure of the IP synthase reaction product was determined to be 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate, based on gas liquid chromatography with a chiral column. When the two substrates were incubated with the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus membrane fraction, archaetidylinositol phosphate (AIP) was formed along with a small amount of archaetidylinositol (AI). The two products were identified by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and chemical analyses. AI was formed from AIP by incubation with the membrane fraction, but AIP was not formed from AI. This finding indicates that archaeal AI was synthesized from CDP-archaeol and d-glucose 6-phosphate via myo-inositol 1-phosphate and AIP. Although the relevant enzymes were not isolated, three enzymes are implied: IP synthase, AIP synthase, and AIP phosphatase. AIP synthase was homologous to yeast phosphatidylinositol synthase, and we confirmed AIP synthase activity by cloning the encoding gene (MTH1691) and expressing it in Escherichia coli.

This is the first report of the biosynthesis of ether-type inositol phospholipids in Archaea. IntroductionThe structures and composition of membrane polar lipids of Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus cells have been reported (1Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 95-102Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The major polar lipids of the archaeon are l-serine, ethanolamine, or myo-inositol-containing di- and tetraether-type phospholipids and phosphoglycolipids and gentiobiose-containing di- and tetraether-type glycolipids. The biosynthetic pathways of diether-type serine-phospholipid (archaetidylserine) and diether-type glycolipid (gentiobiosyl archaeol) were previously elucidated in vitro (3Morii H. Eguchi T. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Morii H. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pathway begins with the formation of the enantiomeric glycerophosphate (sn-glycerol 1-phosphate) from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (5Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After two ether bonds are formed on sn-glycerol 1-phosphate with two molecules of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (6Zhang D.L. Daniels L. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 1264-1265Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Zhang D.L. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1270-1277Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the product, 2,3-di-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate (or unsaturated archaetidic acid), is activated by CTP to form CDP-archaeol (8Morii H. Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36568-36574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Archaetidylserine is synthesized by replacing the CMP group of CDP-archaeol with l-serine. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction (archaetidylserine synthase) is homologous to bacterial type-II phosphatidylserine synthase. An extensive BLAST search by Daiyasu et al. (9Daiyasu H. Kuma K. Yokoi T. Morii H. Koga Y. Toh H. Archaea. 2005; 1: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) revealed a great number of homologous gene-encoding enzymes that attach polar head groups of several kinds of phospholipids in Archaea and Bacteria. A possible archaetidylinositol synthase was also included in the homologous group. Koga and Morii (10Koga Y. Morii H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the polar head group-attaching enzymes, which belong to an enzyme superfamily, CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase, were derived from a common ancestor enzyme and existed in a common ancestor of Archaea and Bacteria. The only enzyme in Archaea that belongs to the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase family to have been studied in vitro is archaetidylserine synthase. The hypothesis has not been supported by in vitro experiments of archaeal ether-type inositol lipids, however, because nothing is known about biosynthesis of the lipids.Many Archaea contain inositol lipids (11Koga Y. Akagawa-Matsushita M. Ohga M. Nishihara M. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1993; 16: 342-351Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Koga Y. Nakano M. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2008; 31: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Membrane phospholipids in many Archaea are composed solely of inositol phospholipids. To date, the only known Archaea that do not possess inositol lipids are organisms of Methanococcales, Methanomicrobiales, and Halobacteriales (12Koga Y. Nakano M. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2008; 31: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In M. thermautotrophicus, inositol lipids are the most predominant polar lipids (1Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 95-102Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Morii H. Koga Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 109: 283-288Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, archaetidylinositol (AI) 2The abbreviations used are: AIarchaetidylinositolAIPAI phosphateGLCgas liquid chromatographyIP1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphateIP(TMS)7myo-inositol-2,3,4,5,6-penta-O-trimethylsilyl-1-O-di(trimethylsilyl) phosphateFABfast atom bombardmentMSmass spectrometryBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. is essential for glycolipid biosynthesis in Archaea (3Morii H. Eguchi T. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the in vitro mechanism of AI biosynthesis is one of the most important topics in lipid biosynthesis in Archaea.CDP-archaeol was expected to be the common precursor of biosynthesis of the phospholipids, analogous to CDP-diacylglycerol in bacteria. Therefore, we investigated the AI synthetic pathway from CDP-archaeol as the starting material.The structure of archaetidyl-myo-inositol (myo is often omitted in this paper) is reported to be an archaeol linked with 1d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate by a phosphodiester linkage (see Fig. 1) (2Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 95-102Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This configuration of myo-inositol 1-phosphate is identical to that of yeast or soybean phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (14Ballou C.E. Pizer L.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 3333-3335Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and myo-inositol (15Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is generated from d-glucose 6-phosphate (16Chen I.W. Charalampous F.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 144-149Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Eisenberg Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D-Glucose6-phosphate→1L-myo-inositol1-phosphate(Eq. 1) 1L-myo-lnositol1-phosphate→1L-myo-inositol+Pi(Eq. 2) 1L-myo-lnositol+CDP-diacylglycerol→phosphatidyl-myo-inositol+CMP(Eq. 3) Reactions 1 and 3 are catalyzed by 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (IP) synthase and phosphatidylinositol synthase, respectively. A candidate gene (MTH1691) of AI synthase in the M. thermautotrophicus genome was detected by a data base search and is homologous to the yeast phosphatidylinositol synthase gene (9Daiyasu H. Kuma K. Yokoi T. Morii H. Koga Y. Toh H. Archaea. 2005; 1: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tried to induce an in vitro AI synthase reaction with CDP-archaeol, myo-inositol, and M. thermautotrophicus cell homogenates under conditions similar to those of the yeast phosphatidylinositol synthase reaction (18Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several trials using modified reaction conditions, however, were unsuccessful. The reaction sequence in the archaeon eventually proceeded after Reaction 1 as follows (Fig. 1), CDP-archaeol+1L-myo-inositol1-phosphate→archaetidyl-myo-inositol1-phosphate(Eq. 4) Archaetidyl-myo-inositol1-phosphate→archaetidyl-myo-inositol+Pi(Eq. 5) The natural product of the IP synthase of M. thermautotrophicus was confirmed to be 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate. Here, we identified the reaction sequence and the chemical structure of the reaction products. The nomenclature for archaeal ether lipids proposed by Nishihara et al. (19Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) is used throughout the present paper.RESULTSBecause eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and myo-inositol, an analogous reaction was first attempted; that is, CDP-archaeol (a diether analog of CDP-diacylglycerol) was incubated with myo-inositol in the presence of M. thermautotrophicus cell homogenates. Several attempts under various reaction conditions, however, were all unsuccessful. Therefore, we attempted to use other substrates for the reaction. First, we used myo-inositol 1-phosphate instead of myo-inositol.Activity of IP SynthaseBecause radioactively labeled IP is not commercially available, we synthesized it by IP synthase. The activity of the enzyme was detected in the supernatant fraction of M. thermautotrophicus homogenates, although this enzyme had not been studied in this organism. Because the enzyme was rather unstable, the supernatant fraction of M. thermautotrophicus cell homogenates was used for the synthesis of inositol 1-phosphate without purification, except for when determining the structure of the product. The apparent specific activity of this crude enzyme was 18 nmol h−1 mg of protein−1. Thus, it was sufficiently active to synthesize myo-inositol 1-phosphate for the study of AIP synthesis.The structure of myo-inositol 1-phosphate prepared with this enzyme was confirmed to be IP(TMS)7 by GLC after trimethylsilylation (data not shown). Furthermore, the absolute stereochemical configuration of myo-inositol 1-phosphate was determined by GLC of IP(TMS)5Me2 using a chiral capillary column. The main peak in the GLC profile of the reaction mixture coincided with authentic 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (Fig. 2B). Two other major peaks in the reaction mixture represented unreacted α- and β-glucose 6-phosphate (we did not determine which was α or β; Fig. 2). In addition, electron impact-mass spectrometry of the first main peak gave a signal of m/z 633 (M-CH3)+, which is consistent with the molecular weight of IP(TMS)5Me2. The second and third main peaks were confirmed to be glucose 6-phosphate(TMS)4Me2 by electron impact-mass spectrometry (m/z 561 (M-CH3)+). Thus, the product of the IP synthase reaction was decisively determined to be 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate. The unfractionated “[14C]inositol 1-phosphate” also included α- and β-[14C]glucose 6-phosphate. The configuration of 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate is identical to that of yeast (25Chen I.W. Charalampous F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 154-157Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), an animal (26Sherman W.R. Stewart M.A. Zinbo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5703-5708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a higher plant (27Loewus M.W. Loewus F.A. Brillinger G.U. Otsuka H. Floss H.G. J. Biol.

This configuration of myo-inositol 1-phosphate may form archaetidylinositol with the natural configuration by reacting with CDP-archaeol because the hydroxyl group at the 3 (1d) position remains free to react with the phosphate group of CDP-archaeol (Fig. 1). Therefore, “[14C]inositol 1-phosphate” was used as the substrate for the AIP synthase reaction.FIGURE 2Gas liquid chromatograms of trimethylsilyl-methyl derivatives of IP synthase reaction products on a cp-Chirasil-l-Val capillary column.

The apparent specific activity of this crude enzyme was 20 nmol h−1 mg of protein−1. The activity was completely dependent on the presence of CDP-archaeol and “myo-inositol 1-phosphate” and required the addition of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions (Table 1). When one of the two kinds of ions was added, partial AIP synthase activity was recovered. Full activity required both ions. One major spot and one minor spot were detected by TLC of the chloroform-soluble products with solvent B (Fig. 3). The major spot (Rf = 0.27) migrated slightly slower than standard diglucosyl caldarchaetidylinositol. The other minor radioactive spot comigrated with standard AI (Rf = 0.56). The two products were identified as AIP and AI by FAB-MS and chemical analysis (see below). The time course of AIP and AI synthesis from CDP-archaeol is shown in Fig. 3. Six percent of CDP-archaeol and 13% of [14C]inositol-1-phosphate were converted to the products (AIP + AI) during a 1-h reaction. AIP synthase activity was greatly stimulated by 0.5% Triton X-100. At this concentration most products were AIP, whereas more AI was formed when the concentration of the detergent was decreased to 0.1% (Fig. 3).TABLE 1Incorporation of “[14C]inositol 1-phosphate” into lipid (AIP and AI) under various AIP synthase reaction conditions“[14C]Inositol 1-phosphate”Source of enzymeOther constituents in the reaction mixtureaComplete mixture other than the enzyme preparation and “[14C]inositol 1-phosphate” contained 40 nmol of CDP-archaeol, 0.1 m Bicine buffer (pH 8.0), 4 mm MnCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100.Relative incorporation%+b[14C]Inositol 1-phosphate was synthesized from [14C]glucose 6-phosphate in a complete IP synthase reaction mixture with the supernatant fraction of the M. thermautotrophicus homogenate.M. thermautotrophicus membranecThe membrane fraction of M. thermautotrophicus homogenates (180 μg of protein/assay).Complete100+−CDP-ArOH4+−Mg2+, Mn2+2+−Mg2+91+−Mn2+52+−Triton X-1006+P. furiosusmembranedThe membrane fraction of P. furiosus homogenates (180 μg of protein/assay).Complete145+NoneComplete1+E. coli pET21a-MTH1691eHomogenate of E. coli pET21a-MTH1691 (180 μg of protein/assay).Complete281+E. coli pET21afHomogenate of E. coli pET21a (180 μg of protein/assay).Complete1−gThe IP synthase reaction mixture was incubated without the addition of the M. thermautotrophicussupernatant fraction.

The apparent specific activity of the latter organism was higher when measured at 70 °C than that of the former (Table 1).Identification of the AIP Synthase Reaction ProductsThe lipid products of the AIP synthase reaction from CDP-archaeol and non-radiolabeled “inositol 1-phosphate” were purified by TLC with solvent B. The FAB-MS of the major lipid product gave signals of m/z 973 (M-H)− and 731 (archaetidic acid) (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the molecular weight and structure of AI + HPO3 (AIP; Fig. 1). The minor lipid product showed signals of m/z 893 (M-H)− and 731 on FAB-MS, identical to AI (28Morii H. Nishihara M. Koga Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 3149-3156Google Scholar). The two products were completely hydrolyzed by 5% HCl, methanol at 100 °C for 2 h without forming any chloroform-soluble, phosphate-containing material. Chloroform-soluble materials of the both hydrolysates coincided with authentic archaeol on TLC with solvent A (data not shown). Strong acid hydrolysis of water-soluble methanolysate resulted in free inositol. It was proven to be myo-inositol on GLC of TMS derivatives, and the amounts were quantitatively measured. The ratio of phosphate to inositol in AIP and AI were 2.3: 1 (n = 3) and 1.3: 1 (n = 2), respectively. These results indicate that the major slower moving lipid has the structure of diphytanyl-glycerophospho-myo-inositol phosphate (AIP), and the minor faster migrating lipid is diphytanyl-glycerophospho-myo-inositol (AI) (Fig. 1).Cloning and Expression of an AIP Synthase Gene in E. coliDaiyasu et al. (9Daiyasu H. Kuma K. Yokoi T. Morii H. Koga Y. Toh H. Archaea. 2005; 1: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) predicted the MTH1691 gene as a candidate for archaetidylinositol synthase of M. thermautotrophicus by BLAST search. The amino acid sequence of the MTH1691 gene product is homologous to that of the phosphatidylinositol synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (supplemental Fig. S1). We, therefore, cloned and expressed the MTH1691 gene in E. coli cells. SDS-PAGE of the homogenates of the expressed E. coli cells clearly showed a new dense band corresponding to a molecular mass 20.9 kDa (Fig. 4), which coincided with the molecular weight (20,764) of the MTH1691 gene product calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (29Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. Harrison D. Hoang L. Keagle P. Lumm W. Pothier B. Qiu D. Spadafora R. Vicaire R. Wang Y.

J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). However, our trial to detect AI synthase activity in the E. coli cell homogenates, in which the MTH1691 gene was expressed, failed. The E. coli-containing pET21a-MTH1691 cell homogenates did display considerably higher AIP synthase activity than the M. thermautotrophicus membrane. E. coli pET21a cell homogenates carrying an empty vector possessed little activity for the AIP synthesis (Table 1). Therefore, we concluded that MTH1691 is a gene that encodes AIP synthase but not AI synthase, and AIP synthesis from CDP-archaeol and myo-inositol 1-phosphate is catalyzed by a single enzyme. AIP synthase encoded by the MTH1691 gene is composed of 195 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 20,764. Homologous genes from several archaeal species P. furiosus, Sulfolobus solfataricus, and Aeropyrum pernix, a bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and a eukaryote, S. cerevisiae, were aligned (supplemental Fig. S1). A typical sequence of a CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase motif was found by comparing to the motif proposed by Williams and McMaster (DGXXARXXXXXXXXGXXXDXXXD) (30Williams J.G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13482-13487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A phylogenic tree of the enzymes of the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase family has been published (9Daiyasu H. Kuma K. Yokoi T. Morii H. Koga Y. Toh H. Archaea. 2005; 1: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These genes belong to the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase family along with archaetidylserine synthase and phosphatidylserine synthase.FIGURE 4Production of the MTH1691 gene product in E. coli.

Lane M contains size marker proteins (Protein Marker, Broad range, New England Biolabs).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formation of AI from AIP (AIP Phosphatase Activity)To determine the reaction sequence of the synthesis of AIP and AI, [14C]AIP and [14C]AI were synthesized from CDP-archaeol and “[14C]inositol 1-phosphate” for 4 h under conditions similar to the AIP synthase reaction, except that the concentration of Triton X-100 was decreased to 0.1%, a concentration of Triton X-100 at which more AI was produced compared with that at 0.5% Triton X-100. The products were isolated by TLC. The purified [14C]AIP was converted to [14C]AI by the actions of the membrane fraction of M. thermautotrophicus cell homogenate but not by the supernatant fraction (Fig. 5). On the other hand, [14C]AIP was not formed from [14C]AI (Fig. 5, lane 4). The AIP phosphatase activity was localized in the membrane fraction of M. thermautotrophicus cells and inhibited by 8–20 mm phosphate buffer (Fig. 5). Although it was expected that the use of E. coli homogenate containing the recombinant AIP synthase instead of M. thermautotrophicus membranes in the same experiments would prevent the conversion of AIP to AI because the cells contained only AIP synthase as a methanogen protein, a small amount of AI was nevertheless also formed in this case.FIGURE 5Conversion of AIP to AI by the membrane fraction of M. thermautotrophicus cell homogenates or homogenates of E. coli pET21a-MTH1691. [14C]AIP and [14C]AI were prepared from CDP-archaeol and “[14C]inositol 1-phosphate” under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified [14C]AIP (lanes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8) or [14C]AI (lane 4) was incubated at 60 °C for 2 h with either enzyme preparation (500 μg protein/30–80 μl), the membranes of M. thermautotrophicus homogenate (lanes 1, 2, and 4), the supernatant fraction of M. thermautotrophicus homogenates (lane 3), the homogenates of E. coli pET21a-MTH1691 (lanes 5 and 6), or the homogenates of E. coli pET21a carrying an empty vector plasmid (lanes 7 and 8) in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Other constituents in the reaction mixture were the same as in the AIP synthase reaction. The enzyme preparation was dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer (lanes 1, 4, 5, and 7), in aqueous dithiothreitol solution (lanes 2 and 3), and in Bicine buffer (lanes 6 and 8). After the reaction, lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and recorded by autoradiography. s.f., solvent front.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONAn inositol-containing ether-type phospholipid in Archaea was synthesized from CDP-archaeol and 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate via AIP, which was dephosphorylated to the final product, AI (Fig. 1). Three enzyme activities, IP synthase, AIP synthase, and a possible phospholipid-phosphate phosphatase, were detected at the crude homogenate level. This pathway was also confirmed by identification of the chemical structures of the intermediates. This is a new biosynthetic pathway of inositol-phospholipid, either the ester type or ether-type phospholipid. This reaction sequence of attachment of the archaetidyl group and dephosphorylation is the reverse compared with eukaryotic inositol phospholipid synthesis.Because this pathway, characterized by the presence of AIP as the essential intermediate, was also synthesized by the membrane fraction of the other extremely thermophilic archaeon P. furiosus, and homologous genes encoding AIP synthase were found in two other hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota, S. solfataricus and A. pernix, the pathway is not unique to M. thermautotrophicus but rather seems to be generally functional in Archaea.This reaction sequence of AI synthesis and the stereo configuration of the IP synthase product are compatible with construction of AI with the natural configuration of 1d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (Fig. 1). Incidentally, the compatible solute of Archaeoglobus fulgidus (di-myo-inositol phosphate) is synthesized from 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (31Rodrigues M.V. Borges N. Henriques M. Lamosa P. Ventura R. Fernandes C. Empadinhas N. Maycock C. da Costa M.S. Santos H. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).AIP is an important intermediate in this new pathway (see above). The structure was identified as archaetidylinositol phosphate by FAB-MS and chemical analyses. Although the exact position of the inositol where the distal phosphate was bound has not been experimentally determined, the phosphoryl group is the most likely to be located at the position shown in Fig. 1. In animal tissues phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generates a powerful second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The distal phosphate group of AIP is linked at a position different from that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.Bachhawat and Mande (32Bachhawat N. Mande S.C. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 111-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that Archaea (M. thermautotrophicus etc.) contains an IP synthase gene (MTH1105) that has significant homology to the eukaryotic INO1 gene. MTH1105 is most likely an IP synthase structural gene. Because IP synthase activity was detected at the enzyme level in this work, the MTH1105 gene is more likely to be the gene encoding IP synthase, although the gene has not been isolated and the sequence of the enzyme has not been determined. There is a significant difference, however, in the length of the enzymes; the monomer polypeptide of the archaeal IP synthase deduced from the gene consists of 350–420 residues, whereas the eukaryotic enzyme comprises more than 550 residues. Nevertheless, the reaction catalyzed by the two groups of enzymes is the same. Although IP synthase has been studied in A. fulgidis as a member of a new osmolyte metabolism (33Neelon K. Wang Y. Stec B. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11475-11482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), this is the first report on the enzymatic analysis of IP synthase and the structural determination of IP as the enzyme reaction product in the methanoarchaeon.AIP synthase is a new member of the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase superfamily. This superfamily includes enzymes that catalyze the transfer of phosphatidyl (archaetidyl) groups to an alcohol to form phosphatidyl (archaetidyl)-alcohol, in which the CDP-bound substrates do not depend on ester/ether linkages, the stereochemical glycerophosphate backbone structure, or straight chain fatty acid/highly methyl-branched isoprenoid chains. A broad group of enzymes with activity toward such a variety of substrates suggests that the enzyme existed in a common ancestor before the differentiation of Archaea and bacteria and that diverse enzymes of phospholipid synthesis evolved from the ancestral enzyme.At the last step of AI synthase, AI is produced from AIP by a phosphatase. Because the homogenate of E. coli pET21a-MTH1691, in which only AIP synthase was expressed, showed AIP dephosphorylation activity, the possibility that AIP synthase also has AIP phosphatase activity cannot be excluded. Because the homogenate of E. coli pET21a carrying an empty vector also exhibited weak dephosphorylation activity, some phosphatases in E. coli cells might act to dephosphorylate AIP; for example, phosphatidyl glycerophosphate phosphatase. In fact, an M. thermautotrophicus gene, MTH798, is homologous to the E. coli pgpB gene that encodes a protein belonging to a phospholipid-phosphate phosphatase group. AIP dephosphorylation remains to be clarified. A modified pathway of lipid biosynthesis in Archaea, such as inversion of the transfer reaction and the dephosphorylation in AI synthesis, can be observed in another example, a modified mevalonate pathway for isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis found in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (34Grochowski L.L. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2836-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The new pathway is similar to that of phosphatidylglycerol synthesis of E. coli. Phosphatidylglycerol of E. coli is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol by two steps (35Kanfer J. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1720-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidyl glycerophosphate is first synthesized by the transfer of a phosphatidyl group from CDP-diacylglycerol to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate. Phosphatidyl glycerophosphate is then rapidly dephosphorylated to produce phosphatidylglycerol. Transfer of a phosphatidyl group to a phosphorylated polyol followed by dephosphorylation markedly resembled archaeal inositol phospholipid biosynthesis as described in this paper. This feature is not only observed in E. coli but is also seen in archaetidylglycerol synthesis in Halobacterium (36Moldoveanu N. Kates M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 960: 164-182Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Three types of phospholipids (ester or ether type) with ethanolamine, glycerol, and myo-inositol as polar head groups are all synthesized from serine, glycerophosphate, and inositol 1-phosphate phospholipids by the removal of small acidic groups (COOH or phosphate groups). These might be vestiges of ancient membrane phospholipid metabolism in a surface metabolism where a strong acidic group of phospholipids firmly bound to a pyrite surface, according to the surface metabolism hypothesis (37Wächtershäuser G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 452-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the acidic group is removed, the phospholipids are likely to be released from the surface and might form phospholipid bilayer membranes. IntroductionThe structures and composition of membrane polar lipids of Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus cells have been reported (1Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 95-102Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The major polar lipids of the archaeon are l-serine, ethanolamine, or myo-inositol-containing di- and tetraether-type phospholipids and phosphoglycolipids and gentiobiose-containing di- and tetraether-type glycolipids. The biosynthetic pathways of diether-type serine-phospholipid (archaetidylserine) and diether-type glycolipid (gentiobiosyl archaeol) were previously elucidated in vitro (3Morii H. Eguchi T. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Morii H. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pathway begins with the formation of the enantiomeric glycerophosphate (sn-glycerol 1-phosphate) from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (5Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After two ether bonds are formed on sn-glycerol 1-phosphate with two molecules of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (6Zhang D.L. Daniels L. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 1264-1265Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Zhang D.L. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1270-1277Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the product, 2,3-di-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate (or unsaturated archaetidic acid), is activated by CTP to form CDP-archaeol (8Morii H. Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36568-36574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Archaetidylserine is synthesized by replacing the CMP group of CDP-archaeol with l-serine. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction (archaetidylserine synthase) is homologous to bacterial type-II phosphatidylserine synthase. An extensive BLAST search by Daiyasu et al. (9Daiyasu H. Kuma K. Yokoi T. Morii H. Koga Y. Toh H. Archaea. 2005; 1: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) revealed a great number of homologous gene-encoding enzymes that attach polar head groups of several kinds of phospholipids in Archaea and Bacteria. A possible archaetidylinositol synthase was also included in the homologous group. Koga and Morii (10Koga Y. Morii H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the polar head group-attaching enzymes, which belong to an enzyme superfamily, CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase, were derived from a common ancestor enzyme and existed in a common ancestor of Archaea and Bacteria. The only enzyme in Archaea that belongs to the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase family to have been studied in vitro is archaetidylserine synthase. The hypothesis has not been supported by in vitro experiments of archaeal ether-type inositol lipids, however, because nothing is known about biosynthesis of the lipids.Many Archaea contain inositol lipids (11Koga Y. Akagawa-Matsushita M. Ohga M. Nishihara M. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1993; 16: 342-351Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Koga Y. Nakano M. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2008; 31: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Membrane phospholipids in many Archaea are composed solely of inositol phospholipids. To date, the only known Archaea that do not possess inositol lipids are organisms of Methanococcales, Methanomicrobiales, and Halobacteriales (12Koga Y. Nakano M. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2008; 31: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In M. thermautotrophicus, inositol lipids are the most predominant polar lipids (1Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 95-102Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Morii H. Koga Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 109: 283-288Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, archaetidylinositol (AI) 2The abbreviations used are: AIarchaetidylinositolAIPAI phosphateGLCgas liquid chromatographyIP1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphateIP(TMS)7myo-inositol-2,3,4,5,6-penta-O-trimethylsilyl-1-O-di(trimethylsilyl) phosphateFABfast atom bombardmentMSmass spectrometryBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. is essential for glycolipid biosynthesis in Archaea (3Morii H. Eguchi T. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the in vitro mechanism of AI biosynthesis is one of the most important topics in lipid biosynthesis in Archaea.CDP-archaeol was expected to be the common precursor of biosynthesis of the phospholipids, analogous to CDP-diacylglycerol in bacteria. Therefore, we investigated the AI synthetic pathway from CDP-archaeol as the starting material.The structure of archaetidyl-myo-inositol (myo is often omitted in this paper) is reported to be an archaeol linked with 1d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate by a phosphodiester linkage (see Fig. 1) (2Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 95-102Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This configuration of myo-inositol 1-phosphate is identical to that of yeast or soybean phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (14Ballou C.E. Pizer L.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 3333-3335Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and myo-inositol (15Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is generated from d-glucose 6-phosphate (16Chen I.W. Charalampous F.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 144-149Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Eisenberg Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

A candidate gene (MTH1691) of AI synthase in the M. thermautotrophicus genome was detected by a data base search and is homologous to the yeast phosphatidylinositol synthase gene (9Daiyasu H. Kuma K. Yokoi T. Morii H. Koga Y. Toh H. Archaea. 2005; 1: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tried to induce an in vitro AI synthase reaction with CDP-archaeol, myo-inositol, and M. thermautotrophicus cell homogenates under conditions similar to those of the yeast phosphatidylinositol synthase reaction (18Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several trials using modified reaction conditions, however, were unsuccessful. The reaction sequence in the archaeon eventually proceeded after Reaction 1 as follows (Fig. 1), CDP-archaeol+1L-myo-inositol1-phosphate→archaetidyl-myo-inositol1-phosphate(Eq. 4) Archaetidyl-myo-inositol1-phosphate→archaetidyl-myo-inositol+Pi(Eq. 5) The natural product of the IP synthase of M. thermautotrophicus was confirmed to be 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) found that EB1 inhibits catastrophe, yet the other studies observed that EBs trigger catastrophe events. There is clearly a need to resolve these apparent conflicts, especially as the same proteins in vivo appear to suppress catastrophe. To try to elucidate the mechanism by which EB proteins influence microtubule assembly, we developed a minimalist approach in which the potential for confounding factors to affect the data is reduced or eliminated. Our assay uses proteins from a single organism, S. pombe, and GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule seeds assembled from purified tubulin with only the seeds attached to the chamber surface. We used this system to measure the effects of unlabeled full-length Mal3 on the polymerization dynamics of unlabeled S. pombe microtubules. Microtubules were imaged using dark field microscopy to avoid fluorescent labeling (see Fig. 1A). We also developed a semiautomated analysis system that allows us to digitize a large number of events, which can then be processed by data averaging and filtering. This reduces noise, allowing us to examine the detailed kinetics of the catastrophic switch from growth to shrinkage. Using this system, we find that Mal3 has no direct effect upon the frequency or kinetics of catastrophe events but that it does reduce shrinkage rates and increase rescue frequency in a dose-dependent manner. S. pombe single isoform tubulin and Mal3 protein (Mal3-308) were prepared and concentrations determined as described in des Georges et al. (12des Georges A. Katsuki M. Drummond D.R. Osei M. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Pig brain tubulin was purified as described by Mitchison and Kirschner (14Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and fluorescently labeled using Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (A20000, Invitrogen) or Alexa Fluor 680 succinimidyl ester (A20008, Invitrogen) (15Hyman A. Drechsel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L. Mitchison T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Polarity-marked GMPCPP microtubule seeds were attached by anti-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (A11094, Invitrogen) to Sigmacote (Sigma)-coated coverglasses in flow cells. Dynamic non-labeled S. pombe microtubules were assembled by the addition of non-labeled 4.5 μm S. pombe single isoform tubulin in PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA) (16Walker R.A.

Fluorescent seeds were imaged by epifluorescence microscopy, and unlabeled microtubule dynamics were imaged by dark field microscopy in a temperature-regulated box at 25 ± 0.5 °C. Dark field images were captured at 1-s intervals during a 30-min incubation period using an electron-multiplying CCD camera (Andor, iXonEM+ DU-897E). Kymographs were created from time-lapse images of dynamic microtubules using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Kymographs of microtubule plus ends (n = 8–32 from 3–5 microtubules for each condition) were analyzed automatically using a custom macro for ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) that detects the microtubule end in dark field kymograph images. Catastrophe events were analyzed by superimposing and aligning different data sets from the automated tip tracking using a custom Excel macro. A median filter was then applied to remove outlying data points and noise using a custom Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro in Excel. All macros are available from the Marie Curie Research Institute Molecular Motors Group. See supplemental information for detailed methods. We examined the effect of Mal3 expressed in Escherichia coli on dynamic microtubules formed from highly purified single isoform S. pombe tubulin. Dynamic microtubules polymerized from immobilized, polarity-marked seeds assembled from pure tubulin were imaged by dark field microscopy (17Horio T. Hotani H. Nature. 1986; 321: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B; supplemental movies). Kymographs were generated (Fig. 1, C and D), and an automated tracking program was developed to digitize the microtubule end position (see the supplemental methods). Plots of microtubule end position against time were analyzed to determine microtubule growth and shrinkage rates and catastrophe and rescue frequencies, which together define microtubule dynamics (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Measurements were repeated over a range of Mal3 concentrations.TABLE 1Mal3 effect on microtubule dynamicsMal3Growth rateShrinkage rateCatastrophe frequencyRescue frequencyGrowth timeShrinkage timenmμm/minμm/minevents/minevents/minminminPlus end00.53 ± 0.1311.4 ± 4.00.4161.09127.43.67n = 90n = 21n = 53n = 4500.46 ± 0.2010.1 ± 4.60.5671.14141.083.52n = 64n = 39n = 80n = 41000.54 ± 0.157.8 ± 4.20.4151.82103.52.75n = 29n = 10n = 43n = 53000.55 ± 0.215.2 ± 1.60.6592.96113.759.47n = 33n = 34n = 75n = 285000.48 ± 0.134.1 ± 1.20.4425.67122.088.47n = 21n = 20n = 54n = 48Minus end00.19 ± 0.066.2 ± 5.70.2053.43136.432.33n = 32n = 9n = 28n = 8500.14 ± 0.085.9 ± 1.70.2643.26140.321.25n = 29n = 14n = 37n = 51000.13 ± 0.083.8 ± 5.30.2624.36114.370.92n = 23n = 18n = 30n = 43000.17 ± 0.071.00.078.18143.180.37n = 5n = 2n = 10n = 35000.15 ± 0.02NA0NA137.820.06n = 4 Open table in a new tab We find that microtubules containing S. pombe single isoform tubulin grow at 0.5 μm/min (Fig. 2A; Table 1) compared with 3 μm/min in vivo (18Drummond D.R. Cross R.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 766-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The addition of Mal3 at up to 500 nm does not alter this growth rate. Catastrophe frequency was determined from a large number of events (43–80 events during 103–140 min of microtubule growth) and remained constant at 0.5 min−1 over the full range of Mal3 concentrations tested (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Because Mal3 in vivo is reported to suppress catastrophe, we examined the intrinsic kinetics of in vitro catastrophe in more detail to determine whether Mal3 alters the time course of catastrophe rather than simply the frequency. For each Mal3 concentration, 8–32 subsets of catastrophe events suitable for further analysis were identified (supplemental Table 1), excised from the primary data, superimposed, and optimally aligned using a recursive procedure (see the supplemental methods). The final aligned data were median-filtered to reduce noise (supplemental Fig. S1). This image-processing procedure reveals the catastrophe event under unloaded conditions with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution (Fig. 2B). Although Schek et al. (19Schek 3rd, H.T. Gardner M.K. Cheng J. Odde D.J. Hunt A.J. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) previously tracked the dynamics of catastrophe at high resolution, their method requires exertion of force on the microtubule tip, which can alter the dynamics. Our methods detect catastrophes as rapid transitions from steady growth to steady shrinkage with no intermediate states such as pauses, at all Mal3 concentrations assayed (Fig. 2B). By eye, transition from steady growth to steady shrinkage appears to occur within 1 s or so, at all concentrations of Mal3 (Fig. 2B). Plotting of the regions enclosing 95% of the data points for the median-filtered growth and shrinkage data provides a formal specification for the transition between growth and shrinkage (supplemental Fig. S2). The overlap of these regions creates a zone around the catastrophe event where data points could belong to either growth or shrinkage regions or to some other transitional phase. The minimum physical extent we measure for this indeterminate zone is 64 nm (at 300 nm Mal3), whereas its minimum duration is 2.2 s (at 0 nm Mal3). These values represent upper limits for the spatiotemporal extent of the catastrophe zone. Tip tracking by Mal3 on brain microtubules is observed in vitro in conditions similar to our assay (7Bieling P. Laan L. Schek H. Munteanu E.L. Sandblad L. Dogterom M. Brunner D. Surrey T. Nature. 2007; 450: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Thus although we do not directly visualize Mal3, we infer that tip tracking Mal3 affects neither the frequency nor the intrinsic dynamics of catastrophe in S. pombe microtubules. Although Mal3 does not influence catastrophe frequency, it does have a considerable effect on plus end dynamics, reducing shrinkage rates and increasing rescue frequencies following catastrophe in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Previously we showed that Mal3 binds the lattice of both brain and S. pombe microtubules with a 1:1 stoichiometry and Kd ∼1 μm (12des Georges A. Katsuki M. Drummond D.R. Osei M. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We observe effects on shrinkage rates at Mal3 concentrations as low as 50 nm. With a Kd of 1 μm, Mal3 is predicted to occupy only about 4.6% of the lattice binding sites. Mal3 increased the rescue frequency 6-fold over the range 0–500 nm Mal3 (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Rescues probably restore a protective cap of GTP tubulin heterodimers to the microtubule, blocking further shrinkage and allowing regrowth. Mal3 might directly promote the addition of GTP heterodimers; however, this mechanism seems unlikely as we see no effect of Mal3 on the growth rate of microtubules assembling from GTP heterodimers. Instead, we favor a model in which Mal3 is stabilizing the GDP lattice by linking protofilaments and inhibiting protofilament peeling so that GTP subunits can more easily add to the GDP lattice microtubule end. Thus the same protofilament-linking mechanism could account for the ability of sparsely distributed Mal3 to inhibit shrinkage and to promote rescues. Sparsely distributed GTP heterodimers within the lattice can also induce rescue events (20Dimitrov A. Quesnoit M. Moutel S. Cantaloube I. Poüs C. Perez F. Science. 2008; 322: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), potentially by a similar mechanism. Mal3 tracks both the plus and the minus ends of microtubules in vitro (7Bieling P. Laan L. Schek H. Munteanu E.L. Sandblad L. Dogterom M. Brunner D. Surrey T. Nature. 2007; 450: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and just as at the plus end, Mal3 at the minus end has no effect on growth rate but slows shrinkage and promotes rescue in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A; Table 1). However, although Mal3 has no detectable effect on plus end catastrophe, it does appear to inhibit catastrophe at the minus end (Figs. 1C and 2A; Table 1; supplemental movies). Why does Mal3 apparently suppress catastrophe at minus ends but not at plus ends? Mal3 concentrations up to 100 nm do not inhibit the minus end catastrophe frequency, but higher Mal3 concentrations do, and 500 nm Mal3 reduces the rate to zero (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Strikingly, the suppression of minus end catastrophe was only observed at concentrations of Mal3 (>300 nm) that significantly suppress minus end shrinkage rates (<1.0 μm/min) and promote minus end rescue (>8.2 min−1) (Table 1). Inhibition of shrinkage and promotion of rescues requires more Mal3 at the plus end than at the minus end where the dynamics are already biased toward reduced shrinkage and increased rescues; even 500 nm Mal3 only reduces plus end shrinkage rate to 5.7 μm/min and increases the rescue frequency to 4.1 min−1. We propose a model where Mal3 does not affect the catastrophe frequency itself. Instead, increasing Mal3 concentrations make catastrophes progressively harder to detect by reducing the rate of shrinkage and the duration of shrinkage events (Fig. 3, A–C) until it becomes essentially impossible to observe catastrophes. Our model envisages that the true catastrophe frequency is unaffected, even at high Mal3 concentrations, but that the apparent catastrophe frequency decreases. Our model suggests that a sufficient increase in Mal3 concentration would cause the apparent suppression of all plus end catastrophes. We were unable to test this prediction directly in the dynamics assay as higher concentrations of Mal3 caused too much spontaneous nucleation of microtubules. Therefore we used a protocol in which microtubules were preassembled and catastrophe events were induced by reducing the free tubulin concentration (supplemental Fig. S3). In the absence of Mal3, reducing the tubulin concentration from 7.5 to 3 μm resulted in immediate catastrophe followed by shrinkage to the stabilized seed boundary. However, reducing the tubulin concentration to 3 μm in the presence of 1 μm Mal3 stabilized the microtubules for over 30 min in a paused state with no change in microtubule length or catastrophe events observable (supplemental Fig. S3B). Subsequently flushing the chamber with 3 μm tubulin alone again caused immediate shrinkage (supplemental Fig. S3C). Thus at high concentrations, Mal3 can suppress shrinkage and (apparently) suppress catastrophes at the microtubule plus end, consistent with our model. At the minus end, we observe continuous growth without catastrophes or pausing because of the combined effects of reduced shrinkage and increased rescue frequencies. The similar Mal3 dose dependence of shrinkage rate reduction and rescue promotion suggests that these effects may arise from the same mechanism. We propose that Mal3 linking of protofilaments stabilizes the microtubule GDP lattice, inhibiting shrinkage and promoting rescue, leading to masking of catastrophe events. Although like other EB family proteins Mal3 enriches at the tips of growing microtubules (7Bieling P. Laan L. Schek H. Munteanu E.L. Sandblad L. Dogterom M. Brunner D. Surrey T. Nature. 2007; 450: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), this higher concentration of Mal3 at microtubule ends when compared with the lattice does not influence the dynamics of the microtubule end (Fig. 3D). We conclude that the Mal3 binding mode at the microtubule tip and on the lattice is different, perhaps because the tip is the only part of the microtubule composed of GTP heterodimers or because the tip is structurally different from the lattice (or both). It is paradoxical that the apparently higher affinity tip binding has no detectable effect on microtubule dynamics. One resolution of this paradox would be if Mal3 binding made GDP-containing tubulin heterodimers behave more like GTP heterodimers, slowing their detachment from the microtubule, whilst enhancing the probability of microtubule rescue by promoting attachment of GTP subunits. We previously proposed that the microtubule-nucleating activity of Mal3 (12des Georges A. Katsuki M. Drummond D.R. Osei M. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) could be explained by Mal3 binding and stabilizing nascent sheets of heterodimers in a way analogous to its tip binding activity. Our present observations reveal that Mal3 does not stabilize tips, suggesting that the nucleating activity is more likely to arise from the lattice-stabilizing activity that we observe here. How do our observations apply in vivo? The concentration of Mal3 in cells may be about 200-fold less than the tubulin concentration (11Sandblad L. Busch K.E. Tittmann P. Gross H. Brunner D. Hoenger A. Cell. 2006; 127: 1415-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Based on our own preliminary estimates of tubulin concentration within S. pombe cells (not shown), the in vivo Mal3 concentration may be a few tens of nm, suggesting a potentially limited role for the direct effect of Mal3 on microtubule dynamics. To account for the observed stabilization of growing microtubules by Mal3 in vivo, additional Mal3 binding partner proteins may be required to recruit sufficient Mal3 onto the lattice (13Manna T. Honnappa S. Steinmetz M.O. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Browning H. Hackney D.D. J. Biol.

Alternatively, the stabilization of microtubules by Mal3 in vivo may be due to recruitment of Mal3 binding partners to the tips. By accumulating on microtubule tips without affecting their dynamics, Mal3 provides a neutral platform for the recruitment of an extensive list of binding partners.

https://openalex.org/W2092963600,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CFTR chloride channel. Wild type and mutant CFTR channels can be activated by curcumin, a well tolerated dietary compound with some appeal as a prospective CF therapeutic. However, we show here that curcumin has the unexpected effect of cross-linking CFTR polypeptides into SDS-resistant oligomers. This effect occurred for CFTR channels in microsomes as well as in intact cells and at the same concentrations that are effective for promoting CFTR channel activity (5-50 mum). Both mature CFTR polypeptides at the cell surface and immature CFTR protein in the endoplasmic reticulum were cross-linked by curcumin, although the latter pool was more susceptible to this modification. Curcumin cross-linked two CF mutant channels (Delta F508 and G551D) as well as a variety of deletion constructs that lack the major cytoplasmic domains. In vitro cross-linking could be prevented by high concentrations of oxidant scavengers (i.e. reduced glutathione and sodium azide) indicating a possible oxidation reaction with the CFTR polypeptide. Importantly, cyclic derivatives of curcumin that lack the reactive beta diketone moiety had no cross-linking activity. One of these cyclic derivatives stimulated the activities of wild type CFTR channels, Delta 1198-CFTR channels, and G551D-CFTR channels in excised membrane patches. Like the parent compound, the cyclic derivative irreversibly activated CFTR channels in excised patches during prolonged exposure (>5 min). Our results raise a note of caution about secondary biochemical effects of reactive compounds like curcumin in the treatment of CF. Cyclic curcumin derivatives may have better therapeutic potential in this regard."

Activation of these receptors in the cerebellum also leads to a slow excitatory postsynaptic current mediated by nonselective TRPC3 cation channels. How TRPC3 channels are opened is unknown, although it is widely thought that channel gating requires phospholipase C activation. Using the patch-clamp technique and immunohistochemistry in rat cer-ebellar slices, we show that metabotropic glutamate receptors activate TRPC3 channels through the small GTP-binding protein Rho and subsequent phospho-lipase D stimulation. TRPC3 channel gating is independent of phospholipase C activity. These results reveal a new mechanism for the gating of the ubiquitous TRPC3 channel and identify a key role for phospholipase D in the generation of the slow excitatory postsynaptic current in cerebellar Purkinje cells.—Glitsch, M.

Thus, DNA vaccine based on lysosome-targeted gly-coprotein of the rabies virus was evaluated in BALB/c mice. It imparted partial protection (60%) against challenge with 20 LD50 of the challenge virus standard (CVS) strain of rabies virus. To improve the outcome of vaccination, to ultimately enhance the immune response, we investigated different routes for DNA vaccine delivery, varied doses of DNA, and the influence of adjuvant supplementation. The highest immune response pertaining to IgG antibody titer, with a predominantly IgG1/IgG2a subclass distribution, effective cellular immunity, and a high level of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNAs) was attained by the optimized DNA vaccine formulation comprising intramuscular administration of 100 μg of DNA vaccine supplemented with Emulsi-gen®-D. In preexposure prophylaxis, a 3-dose regimen of this formulation generated a high RVNA titer (32 IU/ml) and conferred complete protection against challenge with 20 LD50 of CVS. For postexposure efficacy analysis, rabies was experimentally induced with 50 LD50 of CVS. Subsequent therapy with 5 doses of the formulation completely prevented rabies in BALB/c mice, which maintained protective RVNA titers of 4 IU/ml. The World Health Organization recommended rabies protective titer threshold is 0.5 IU/ml. Thus, this optimized DNA vaccine formulation provides an avenue for preventing and controlling rabies.—Kaur, M., Saxena, A., Rai, A., and Bhatnagar, R.

https://openalex.org/W2018664109,"Thinner can be better, at least for the industrially useful catalysts known as zeolites. A technique that allows single layers of zeolites to assemble from solution opens up a plethora of practical applications. Zeolites — microporous crystalline aluminosilicates — are widely used in industry as size- and shape-selective catalysts. But the very micropores that make this catalytic activity possible also cause diffusion limitations. Choi et al. now show that the problem can be overcome by synthesizing zeolites in the presence of bifunctional surfactants, which simultaneously direct the formation of micropores and limit the growth of the zeolite crystal to that of a 'nanosheet' with a thickness of only one unit cell. These structural features render the ultrathin zeolites highly active for the catalytic conversion of large organic molecules; they also minimize the adverse effects of diffusion limitations, as illustrated by drastically reduced coke deposition and catalyst deactivation during methanol-to-gasoline conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2001416444,"Id2 is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene expressed in a circadian manner in multiple tissues with a phase-locked relationship with canonical clock genes. Our previous studies have identified circadian phenotypes in Id2 null mice, including enhanced photo-entrainment and disruption of activity rhythms, and have demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect of ID proteins upon CLOCK-BMAL1 transactivation of clock gene and clock-controlled gene activity. We have now begun to explore the potential role that ID2 may play in specifically regulating clock output. Here we show that ID2 protein is rhythmically expressed in mouse liver. Time-of-day-specific liver gene expression in Id2(+/+) and Id2(-/-) mice under circadian conditions was studied using DNA microarray analysis, identifying 651 differentially expressed genes, including a subset of 318 genes deemed rhythmically expressed in other studies. Examination of individual time courses reveals that these genes are dysregulated in a highly time-specific manner. A cohort of different functional groups were identified, including genes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism, e.g. serum protein Igfbp1 and lipoprotein lipase. We also reveal that the Id2(-/-) mice show a reduction in lipid storage in the liver and white adipose tissue, suggesting that disruption of normal circadian activity of components of lipid metabolism can result in overt physiological alterations. These data reveal a role for the transcriptional repressor ID2 as a circadian output regulator in the periphery."

IntroductionTelomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase responsible for the maintenance and preservation of telomere ends in germ cells, immortalized cells, and cancer cells (1Osterhage J.L.

Chem. 2009; 284: 16061-16065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). hTERT, 3The abbreviations used are: hTERThuman telomerase reverse transcriptaseCKIIcasein kinase IIHsp90heat shock protein 90PP5protein phosphatase 5GFPgreen fluorescent proteinzbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketoneTRAPtelomeric repeat amplification protocolGAgeldanamycin. the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, possesses catalytic activity, whereas the associated RNA component, human telomerase RNA, serves as a template for the synthesis of telomeric sequences (2Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Expression analyses of hTERT and human telomerase RNA components in heterologous systems have enhanced our understanding of the biochemical features of telomerase. Human telomerase activity has been reconstituted in a variety of in vitro systems, including yeast, baculovirus, rabbit reticulocyte, wheat germ, and human cell extracts (3Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 4Bachand F. Autexier C. J. Biol.

In each system, the essential roles of hTERT and human telomerase RNA in active telomerase complexes have been confirmed. Recent studies have identified other proteins associated with the telomerase holoenzyme. For instance, Hsp90 and its co-chaperone, p23, bind hTERT and contribute to telomerase activity (6Keppler B.R. Grady A.T. Jarstfer M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19840-19848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Hsp90 chaperone complex, which includes Hsp90, p23, Hsp70, p60, and Hsp40/ydj, is required for the assembly of human telomerase both in vitro, in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, and in vivo, in human cells.Among the Hsp90 partners, the acidic protein p23 is the smallest and has a relatively simple structure (7Weikl T. Abelmann K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). p23 is ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotes, from yeast to humans. Initially discovered as part of the Hsp90 complex with the progesterone receptor (9Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), p23 has since been identified in complexes containing a variety of Hsp90-associated proteins, including other steroid receptors (10Freeman B.C. Felts S.J. Toft D.O. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 422-434PubMed Google Scholar), the heme-regulated kinase HRI (11Xu Z. Pal J.K. Thulasiraman V. Hahn H.P. Chen J.J. Matts R.L. Eur. J.

Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and polymerases such as telomerase (6Keppler B.R. Grady A.T. Jarstfer M.B.

Virol. 2002; 76: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although it is known that p23 binds directly to Hsp90 in an ATP-dependent manner, it is unclear whether it interacts with client proteins or solely with Hsp90. Recent studies have confirmed that Hsp90 undergoes a conformational change upon binding to ATP, which promotes formation of additional dimer contacts near the N terminus (14Siligardi G. Hu B. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51989-51998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). At this stage, ATP becomes trapped by Hsp90 and is committed to hydrolysis (15Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Sullivan W.P. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45942-45948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). p23 then binds Hsp90 and stabilizes this conformational state. Early studies on steroid receptor complexes indicate that p23 stabilizes the mature complex with Hsp90 in a state in which the receptor is active and able to bind hormones (17Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 18Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J.

(Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar).Intensive studies using biochemical and crystallographic analyses revealed that p23 contains two domains: a stable, folded core domain and an unstructured, highly acidic C-terminal tail of ∼30–50 amino acids (8Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Human p23 is a 160-amino acid protein that contains eight β-strands (residues 1–110) and a C-terminal tail (residues 111–160). The tail is required for chaperone activity but does not participate in binding to Hsp90 (7Weikl T. Abelmann K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, C-terminal truncation of p23 decreases hormone-binding activity to the receptor (8Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent reports have shown that several apoptotic stimuli induce p23 caspase-mediated cleavage at the C-terminal tail but do not directly alter interactions with Hsp90 (20Gausdal G. Gjertsen B.T. Fladmark K.E. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Døskeland S.O. Leukemia. 2004; 18: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Mollerup J. Berchtold M.W.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Active caspases 3, 7, and 8 cleave specifically at aspartic acid 142, generating a truncated form of p23 (Δp23) with 18 fewer amino acids than the wild-type protein. Recombinant Δp23 displays an affinity for Hsp90 similar to full-length protein but loses its own chaperone activity in vitro. However, it remains to be determined whether cleavage of p23 alters the chaperone activity of Hsp90.In the present study, we found that p23 cleavage was associated with a reduction in hTERT expression and telomerase activity during apoptosis. Moreover, overexpression of Δp23 induced a decrease in the amount of hTERT protein without affecting hTERT mRNA levels, suggesting that the loss of p23 function destabilizes the hTERT protein. Furthermore, Δp23 suppressed phosphorylation at specific serine residues in Hsp90, and phosphoserine-defective mutants of Hsp90 failed to enhance telomerase activity. These data indicate that down-regulation of telomerase activity during apoptosis correlates with hTERT destabilization via loss of Hsp90 chaperone activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of caspase-mediated regulation of the Hsp90 chaperone complex. These results further our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate telomerase activity in apoptotic cells.DISCUSSIONTelomerase activity is tightly regulated in cells, and hTERT is a key molecule in this process (2Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Although hTERT protein levels are primarily controlled by transcriptional regulation in normal human cells, recent reports suggest the additional involvement of ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation due to Hsp90 malfunction (28Kim J.H. Park S.M. Kang M.R. Oh S.Y. Lee T.H. Muller M.T. Chung I.K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The role of Hsp90 and its co-chaperone p23 in mediating the functional maturation of hTERT is well documented (6Keppler B.R. Grady A.T. Jarstfer M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19840-19848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we propose that p23 regulates Hsp90 phosphorylation, a process that is modulated by caspase-dependent cleavage of p23. By disrupting Hsp90 phosphorylation and function, truncated p23 induces proteasomal degradation of hTERT and down-regulates telomerase activity. The findings presented here provide support for the idea that Hsp90 co-chaperones regulate the post-translational modification of Hsp90 and help to determine the mechanisms underlying the regulation of telomerase activity during cell death.As part of this mechanism, p23 enhances CKII binding to Hsp90. We found that partial proteolysis of p23 by active caspase did not compromise CKII binding but did promote the binding of PP5 to Hsp90 (Fig. 9). Δp23 apparently binds Hsp90 by displacing pre-bound p23, consistent with our preliminary data showing that Δp23 has a greater affinity for Hsp90 than does full-length p23 (data not shown). It is currently unclear if cleavage of p23 increases PP5 recruitment into the Hsp90 chaperone complex, or if it blocks release of PP5 from the complex. Because PP5 is an essential component of the Hsp90 chaperone complex (35Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the latter mechanism is more likely. However, further investigation is necessary to clarify this issue.Hsp90 is a phosphoprotein that is primarily phosphorylated at serine residues but can be phosphorylated to a lesser extent on tyrosine and threonine residues (29Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2431-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mimnaugh E.G. Worland P.J. Whitesell L. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28654-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Wandinger S.K. Suhre M.H. Wegele H. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Earlier studies reported that a number of kinases are capable of phosphorylating Hsp90, including CKII, double-stranded DNA-activated kinase, and Akt (29Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2431-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17275-17280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Barati M.T. Rane M.J. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 1636-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, proteins that regulate Hsp90 phosphorylation by these kinases have yet to be identified. In a cell-free reticulocyte lysate system, we found that p23 alone had no effect on Hsp90 phosphorylation status, but was able to increase phosphorylation of Hsp90, an effect that was blocked by a CKII inhibitor (Fig. 5, C and E). In addition, expression of p23 in intact cells enhanced the interaction between Hsp90 and CKII. Collectively, these data indicate that full-length p23 stimulates CKII-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp90. Interestingly, overexpression of Δp23 also enhanced binding of CKII to Hsp90. Because CKII is a client protein of Hsp90 (34Miyata Y. Yahara I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8123-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), it is possible that the interaction between CKII and Hsp90 in the presence of Δp23 is not an enzyme-substrate interaction, but rather a client-chaperone interaction, thus, enhanced binding of CKII to Hsp90 by Δp23 overexpression might not increase Hsp90 phosphorylation.To our knowledge, CKII is the only kinase capable of phosphorylating Hsp90 at conserved serine residues located in the charged region. Although this region is apparently dispensable in Escherichia coli and yeast, it has been suggested that phosphorylation in this region influences Hsp90 chaperone function by modulating the interactions between Hsp90 and client proteins (40Tbarka N. Richard-Méreau C. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 41Scheibel T. Siegmund H.I. Jaenicke R. Ganz P. Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Ogiso H. Kagi N. Matsumoto E. Nishimoto M. Arai R. Shirouzu M. Mimura J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15510-15519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that phosphorylation of the charged region regulates the interaction between Hsp90 and the client protein, hTERT. Because the charged region of yeast Hsp90 does not contain any conserved serine residues that can be phosphorylated by CKII, we would not expect p23-mediated Hsp90 phosphorylation to be replicated in the yeast system. The length of this charged region is increased from six amino acids in E. coli to 67 in human Hsp90, suggesting that this region and its phosphorylation sites have been evolutionary targets for gain of function in higher organisms.To date, more than a dozen distinct Hsp90 co-chaperones have been identified (43Wandinger S.K. Richter K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18473-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Some of these co-chaperones facilitate activation of a specific set of substrate proteins. In this context, p23 participates in the maturation of steroid hormone receptors and hTERT. Interestingly, most client proteins are released from Hsp90 after completion of protein folding, although p23 and Hsp90 remain associated with mature hTERT (44Forsythe H.L. Jarvis J.L. Turner J.W. Elmore L.W. Holt S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15571-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that Δp23 induces proteasomal degradation of hTERT protein by blocking Hsp90 phosphorylation. Although it is possible that p23-regulated Hsp90 phosphorylation only affects the stability of hTERT, we cannot exclude the possibility that the levels of other client proteins, such as steroid hormone receptors, are also regulated by p23 cleavage. Further experiments are required to investigate this possibility.Research from several laboratories confirms that p23 is a substrate of active caspases (20Gausdal G. Gjertsen B.T. Fladmark K.E. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Døskeland S.O. Leukemia. 2004; 18: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Mollerup J. Berchtold M.W.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which caspase-cleaved p23 acts in dying cells are unclear, but two hypotheses have been proposed. One possibility is that the loss of p23 function, independent of its role as an Hsp90 co-chaperone, is the central factor. In this scenario, the resulting increase in Δp23 reduces anti-aggregating activity, and the depletion of p23 sensitizes cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress; thus, the loss of p23 function potentially plays a protective role against endoplasmic reticulum stress, passive chaperone activity, and cytosolic prostaglandin E2 synthetase activity (8Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22Rao R.V. Niazi K. Mollahan P. Mao X.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The second possibility involves the loss of p23 co-chaperone functions, dependent on Hsp90 interactions. Several reports demonstrate that hTERT requires the co-chaperone function of p23 as well as Hsp90 for full activity (6Keppler B.R. Grady A.T. Jarstfer M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19840-19848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 46Toogun O.A. Zeiger W. Freeman B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5765-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); Hsp90 promotes the proper folding of hTERT and subsequent binding to the telomeric primer, whereas p23 is involved in primer dissociation from telomerase. The p23-regulated serine phosphorylation of Hsp90 is essential for telomerase activity, and p23 cleavage leads to down-regulation of telomerase activity, as demonstrated here. In addition, telomerase activity is a prerequisite for cancer cell survival, and hTERT plays a protective role against certain apoptosis-inducing stimuli. Consistent with the role of full-length p23 in this process, we found that overexpression of Δp23 inhibited the growth of transformed cells and increased their sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Thus, reducing telomerase activity by enhancing p23 proteolysis may be an attractive strategy for cancer treatment. Further research is required to generalize the effects of p23 cleavage during cell death.In view of the protective roles of p23 in stress environments, it is reasonable to assume that the cleaved fragment of p23 in apoptotic cells undergoes rapid degradation. However, our results show that the p23 proteolytic fragment remained stable during cell death. It also displayed a binding activity to Hsp90 similar to that of full-length p23. Thus, the cleaved form of p23 is not merely apoptotic debris that has to be eliminated, but may be a functional molecule that turns off telomerase activity, and is required for apoptotic progression. In a recent report, Dix and colleagues showed that more than one-third of proteolytic fragments of newly characterized caspase substrate proteins are stable for at least 4 h (47Dix M.M. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Cell. 2008; 134: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Additional research is required to determine the general significance of this finding and to identify additional substrates regulated by caspase-mediated proteolysis.During the chaperone cycle, Hsp90 undergoes continuous phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (32Zhao Y.G. Gilmore R. Leone G. Coffey M.C. Weber B. Lee P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32822-32827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Evidently, dephosphorylation of Hsp90 is also important for the maintenance of chaperone activity. Another recent report showed that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP5/Ppt1 directly dephosphorylates Hsp90 and modulates the maturation of Hsp90 client proteins (31Wandinger S.K. Suhre M.H. Wegele H. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Δp23 strengthened the interaction between Hsp90 and PP5, suggesting that the truncated protein deregulates the Hsp90 phosphorylation cycle (Fig. 7, A and B). Although PP5 specifically dephosphorylates CKII-phosphorylated Hsp90 in vitro (31Wandinger S.K. Suhre M.H. Wegele H. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we found no evidence to suggest that PP5 directly dephosphorylates Hsp90 at CKII-phosphorylated serine residues in intact cells. Further studies are needed to confirm that PP5 bound to Δp23-containing Hsp90 complexes directly dephosphorylates serine residues located in the charged region of Hsp90. PP5 interacts with Hsp90 via the tetratricopeptide repeat domain (35Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The tetratricopeptide repeat domain-binding region of Hsp90, located at the C terminus, is the binding site for several co-chaperones. Recent structural data show that the acidic C-terminal tail of p23 becomes well ordered upon binding to Hsp90. The mechanism by which Δp23 enhances the interaction of Hsp90 with PP5 is currently unclear. However, we speculate that the structure of the tetratricopeptide repeat acceptor site of Hsp90 is altered depending on the presence or absence of the p23 C-terminal tail. IntroductionTelomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase responsible for the maintenance and preservation of telomere ends in germ cells, immortalized cells, and cancer cells (1Osterhage J.L.

Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Expression analyses of hTERT and human telomerase RNA components in heterologous systems have enhanced our understanding of the biochemical features of telomerase. Human telomerase activity has been reconstituted in a variety of in vitro systems, including yeast, baculovirus, rabbit reticulocyte, wheat germ, and human cell extracts (3Beattie T.L. Zhou W.

In each system, the essential roles of hTERT and human telomerase RNA in active telomerase complexes have been confirmed. Recent studies have identified other proteins associated with the telomerase holoenzyme. For instance, Hsp90 and its co-chaperone, p23, bind hTERT and contribute to telomerase activity (6Keppler B.R. Grady A.T. Jarstfer M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19840-19848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Hsp90 chaperone complex, which includes Hsp90, p23, Hsp70, p60, and Hsp40/ydj, is required for the assembly of human telomerase both in vitro, in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, and in vivo, in human cells.Among the Hsp90 partners, the acidic protein p23 is the smallest and has a relatively simple structure (7Weikl T.

Initially discovered as part of the Hsp90 complex with the progesterone receptor (9Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), p23 has since been identified in complexes containing a variety of Hsp90-associated proteins, including other steroid receptors (10Freeman B.C.

Virol. 2002; 76: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although it is known that p23 binds directly to Hsp90 in an ATP-dependent manner, it is unclear whether it interacts with client proteins or solely with Hsp90. Recent studies have confirmed that Hsp90 undergoes a conformational change upon binding to ATP, which promotes formation of additional dimer contacts near the N terminus (14Siligardi G. Hu B.

At this stage, ATP becomes trapped by Hsp90 and is committed to hydrolysis (15Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol.

Early studies on steroid receptor complexes indicate that p23 stabilizes the mature complex with Hsp90 in a state in which the receptor is active and able to bind hormones (17Richter K. Buchner J. J.

An hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-dependent induction of TFF genes has been reported in gastric epithelial cells. Nitric oxide (NO) is associated with mucosal damage and modulates HIF-1 activity. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of iNOS-derived NO in HIF-1alpha stabilization and TFF gene expression in damaged gastric mucosa. Aspirin caused gastric injury that peaked 6 h after dosing and returned to normality at 24 h. iNOS mRNA expression occurs in the corpus in parallel with damage. Blockade of iNOS activity did not modify gastric lesions induced by aspirin but delayed mucosal healing. Aspirin induced HIF-1alpha stabilization and TFF2 mRNA up-regulation in the mucosa, but these effects were diminished when iNOS activity was inhibited. Results obtained using a coculture setup showed that iNOS-derived NO from activated macrophages induced HIF-1alpha stabilization, TFF gene expression, and accelerated wound healing in cultured epithelial cells. Finally, transient silencing of endogenous HIF-1alpha in epithelial cells significantly undermined activated macrophage-induced TFF gene expression. Evidence suggests that the iNOS-derived NO associated with NSAID-induced gastric injury is implicated in mucosal restitution via the HIF-1-mediated induction of TFF genes."

In this paper, we aim to (i) investigate the essential elements of PTEN required for its complex formation and (ii) dissect the components of the PTEN-associated complex(es). Our results indicate that PTEN catalytic activity or its PDZ binding domain is not absolutely required for complex assembly. PTEN phosphorylation status on amino acids Ser380, Thr382, Thr383, and Ser385, on the other hand, has a significant role in complex formation. In addition, we demonstrate that the PTEN complex is enriched in nuclear lysates, which suggests a mechanism through which phosphorylation can regulate complex assembly. Using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) analysis and comparing proteins present in higher molecular mass fractions in the presence and absence of PTEN followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we have identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP C) as a potential component within the PTEN complex. PTEN and hnRNP C are shown here to interact and co-localize in the nucleus. We hypothesize that the PTEN and hnRNP C complex may play a role in RNA regulation. PTEN expression plasmids pSG5L A4-PTEN (S380A, T382A, T383A, and S385A), pSG5L E4-PTEN (S380E, T382E, T383E, and S385E), and NLS-PTEN were generous gifts from Dr. W. R. Sellers. The pCMV FLAG WT-PTEN and pCMV FLAG ΔPDZ-PTEN (1–400) constructs were made by cloning WT-PTEN and ΔPDZ-PTEN, lacking the 3 amino acids of the PDZ binding domain at the C terminus, into the pCMV-Tag2B vector (Stratagene) using BamHI and EcoRI sites. Constructs used to make the PC3 PTEN-inducible lines were generated using the pLenti4/V5-DEST Gateway Vector system (Invitrogen). WT and C124S PTEN cDNAs were recombined to entry vectors followed by recombination to destination, lenti vectors. For generation of PC3 WT-PTEN- and C124S-PTEN-inducible cell lines, PC3 parental cells were transiently transfected with either WT or C124S-PTEN pLenti4/V5-DEST clones in conjunction with pLenti/TR (tet repressor). Generation of stable lines was then achieved using co-selection with blasticidin and zeocin. The PC3-inducible and PC3 parental cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and HeLa cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). For H2O2 treatments, cells were incubated with 1 mm H2O2 and harvested after 1 h. For PTEN induction, 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) was added to the PC3 PTEN-inducible cells, and proteins were harvested 36–48 h after treatment. HeLa cells were harvested, and the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using the NE-PER extraction reagents (Thermo Scientific). For NLS-PTEN-transfected PC3 cells, fractionation was performed using the Nuclear Extract kit (Active Motif). Following that, 2 mg of nuclear lysate and 7 mg of cytosolic lysate were loaded on the gel filtration column. Constructs were transfected into PC3 cells using the Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen), and 48 h after transfection cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing phosphatase (Sigma) and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were quantitated, and after preparation in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, equal amounts were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with 4% stacking and 10% resolving layers. Proteins were transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose and after blocking with 2% milk incubated with antibodies made in 5% bovine serum albumin overnight. Following washing and incubation for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare), the blots were further washed and developed using ECL reagents (Pierce). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: Pan Actin (A5060; Sigma), AKT (9272; Cell Signaling), P-AKT (9271; Cell Signaling), GRP78 (3183; Cell Signaling), HDAC (sc-7872; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), hDLG (610874; BD Biosciences), hnRNP C (ab10294; Abcam), PTEN (9552, 9556; Cell Signaling), PTEN P380 (9551; Cell Signaling), and V5 (46-0705; Invitrogen). For whole lysate co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40), and 1 mg of protein in immunoprecipitation buffer was precleared using A/G Plus agarose beads (Upstate) and incubated overnight with IgG control (sc-2028; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or PTEN (sc-6818; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) antibodies. Samples were washed three times with the immunoprecipitation buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol followed by Western blot analysis. For co-immunoprecipitation done on nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, cells were fractionated (as described above), and 200 μg of nuclear and 1 mg of cytoplasmic lysates were used. Cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates, and PC3 WT-PTEN-inducible cells were induced for 36 h. After fixing with methanol, samples were blocked with 0.5% normal goat serum in 1% phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies: hnRNP C (ab10294; Abcam) and PTEN (9559; Cell Signaling) for 1–2 h followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 or 488 (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted using mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Cells were lysed in TNN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). After lysis and centrifugation, samples were applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline in 2-ml fraction volumes with a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. For immunoblot analysis, proteins in each fraction were precipitated using cold acetone and resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol followed by Western blot analysis as described previously. For quantitative immunoblotting, fractions were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filter devices (UFC8 003 24; Millipore). Bradford assay was performed on these fractions, and an equal amount of protein was loaded on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels. PC3 WT-PTEN-induced and uninduced samples were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, phosphatase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, 50 μg/ml DNase I, 20 μg/ml RNase A) and applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column. Samples were eluted with EB (20 mm Tris, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein fractions 19 and 20 from PTEN-induced and uninduced samples were selected and concentrated by using Microcon ultracentrifugal filtration devices (3-kDa molecular mass cutoff). Samples were precipitated with a two-dimensional Clean-up kit (GE Healthcare) and suspended in labeling buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.5). Protein concentration in the induced and uninduced fractions (19 and 20, respectively) was determined with the two-dimensional Quant protein quantitation kit (GE Healthcare), and fractions 19 and 20 from induced and uninduced samples were combined, respectively. Protein samples were labeled according to the manufacturer's minimum labeling protocol (GE Healthcare) with the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester derivatives of the cyanide dyes Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5. Briefly, each sample was divided into three equal volumes containing a 30 μg of proteins each and individually labeled with 1 μl (240 pmol/μl) of Cy3 and Cy5, while the remaining 30 μg of each induced and uninduced protein samples were pooled and labeled with Cy2. Equal amounts of Cy3-labeled and Cy5-labeled, induced and uninduced protein samples were combined with the Cy2-labeled pool sample. The labeled samples were applied to immobilized pH 3–11 nonlinear gradient isoelectric focusing gel strips, and isoelectric focusing of passively rehydrated immobilized pH gradient strips was performed on an Ettan IPGphor II apparatus. After isoelectric focusing, immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated in equilibration buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol for 15 min at room temperature with gentle shaking and then reequilibrated in the equilibration buffer containing 4% iodoacetamide instead of dithiothreitol. Immobilized pH gradient strips were placed on top of the SDS gradient gels (12–16%) for the second dimension separation. Gel images of the Cy2, Cy3, Cy5, and Sypro Ruby were scanned by using a Typhoon TRIO Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare). Many point mutations associated with human cancer are found in the catalytic domain of PTEN (30Ali I.U. Schriml L.M. Dean M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1922-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To test whether PTEN catalytic activity is required for its complex formation, we performed size-exclusion chromatography analysis using PC3-inducible cell lines carrying either WT or the catalytic inactive C124S (CS) PTEN construct. Consistent with previous studies (19Takahashi Y. Morales F.C. Kreimann E.L. Georgescu M.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Vazquez F. Grossman S.R.

Kaminetzky D. Shen R. Georgescu M.M. Nanus D.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 67-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), PTEN can be detected in two main fractions: a lower molecular mass monomer (depicted as I) and a higher molecular mass complex (depicted as II) (Fig. 1A). Importantly, both WT and CS PTEN are able to form higher molecular mass complexes at comparable efficiency, indicating that the catalytic activity of PTEN is not essential for its complex assembly. As validation, the V5-tagged WT and CS mutant PTEN could be detected in the presence of the tetracycline analog, Dox, and WT but not CS mutant PTEN could reduce endogenous AKT phosphorylation upon Dox treatment (Fig. 1B). The PDZ binding domain has been implicated in facilitating the interaction of PTEN with several PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as hDLG and NHERF2 (18Adey N.B. Huang L. Ormonde P.A. Baumgard M.L. Pero R. Byreddy D.V. Tavtigian S.V. Bartel P.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 35-37PubMed Google Scholar, 19Takahashi Y. Morales F.C. Kreimann E.L. Georgescu M.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, these proteins have been shown to co-fractionate with PTEN in high molecular mass fractions (19Takahashi Y. Morales F.C. Kreimann E.L. Georgescu M.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To test the importance of the PTEN PDZ binding domain in facilitating complex assembly, we transfected WT-PTEN (pCMV FLAG WT-PTEN) and PTEN with a truncated PDZ binding domain (pCMV FLAG ΔPDZ-PTEN) into the PTEN-null PC3 parental cells. Interestingly, we observed no significant change in complex assembly efficiency of ΔPDZ-PTEN (Fig. 1C). Because hDLG has been suggested as a potential component of the PTEN complex through interaction with its PDZ binding domain, we tested the recruitment of hDLG into high molecular mass fractions under PTEN-induced and uninduced conditions. As shown, in our PC3-inducible cells, hDLG recruitment to high molecular mass fractions takes place independently of PTEN status (Fig. 1D). Although we cannot rule out hDLG as a component of the PTEN complex, our result indicates that PTEN is not required for hDLG to be recruited to the high molecular mass complex. Moreover, our results suggest that neither the catalytic activity nor the PDZ binding domain of PTEN is essential for its complex formation. It has been proposed that PTEN activity and localization are regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the Ser/Thr residues 380, 382, 383, and 385; we therefore tested whether PTEN phosphorylation status on these four residues affects complex formation. Size-exclusion chromatography and Western blot analysis were performed using PC3 WT-PTEN-induced cells, and phosphorylated PTEN was detected with P380PTEN antibody (rabbit) followed by stripping and reprobing with total PTEN (mouse) antibody. The results demonstrated that phosphorylated PTEN was present in both the monomer (I) and complex (II) fractions (Fig. 2A). However, similar to the observation made by Vazquez et al. (27Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), quantitative analysis demonstrated that phosphorylated PTEN is preferentially enriched in the monomeric fractions (Fig. 2B). To determine whether complex assembly depends on phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues 380, 382, 383, and 385, we transfected PTEN-null PC3 parental cells with either A4- PTEN (S380A, T382A, T383A, and S385A), mimicking dephosphorylated PTEN, or E4-PTEN (S380E, T382E, T383E, and S385E), mimicking phosphorylated PTEN and applied the proteins to a size-exclusion column. As shown in Fig. 2C, although both mutants can participate in complex assembly, there is significantly less E4-PTEN mutant being recruited into high molecular mass fractions. Using monomeric PTEN levels as controls for protein stability, we found 6- and 2.7-fold less E4-PTEN proteins being recruited to fractions 19 and 20, respectively, suggesting that Ser380, Thr382, Thr383, and Ser385 are important for PTEN complex assembly. Our previous work suggests that the phosphorylation status of PTEN may regulate its nuclear localization. Specifically, dephosphorylation of PTEN at Ser380 leads to increased nuclear retention (26Chang C.J. Mulholland D.J. Valamehr B. Mosessian S. Sellers W.R. Wu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To address whether the enrichment of unphosphorylated PTEN in the higher molecular mass fractions is due to the preferential enrichment of the complex in the nucleus, the complex-forming potentials of WT versus NLS-PTEN, in which PTEN is fused to a nuclear localization sequence (26Chang C.J. Mulholland D.J. Valamehr B. Mosessian S. Sellers W.R. Wu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), were directly compared. In this experiment, NLS-PTEN or WT-PTEN was transfected into the PTEN-null PC3 cell line, and lysates were applied to a size-exclusion column. NLS-PTEN has significantly increased complex-forming capability compared with that of WT-PTEN (Fig. 3A). Because PTEN contains several nuclear exclusion signals, (31Gil A. Andrés-Pons A. Fernández E. Valiente M. Torres J. Cervera J. Pulido R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4002-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and therefore, a significant portion of NLS-PTEN can also be found outside of the nucleus, we addressed this issue by performing nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation followed by size-exclusion column. Although PTEN is present in high and low molecular mass fractions in both extracts, quantitative analysis, by normalizing the amount of PTEN protein in the complex fractions to total PTEN, demonstrated that PTEN complex is significantly enriched in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that a larger proportion of PTEN high molecular mass complex is in the nucleus. PTEN complexes found in the cytosolic compartment either belong to different complexes or are due to a contamination of nuclear/cytosol pools, which can happen during the fractionation process. To characterize the PTEN complex further and identify major components associated with it, we employed a two-dimensional DIGE approach. In this method, proteins from two or more samples are labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes, resolved via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and differentially expressed proteins are identified using mass spectrometry analysis (32Unlü M. Morgan M.E. Minden J.S. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2071-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar, 33Tonge R. Shaw J. Middleton B. Rowlinson R. Rayner S. Young J. Pognan F. Hawkins E. Currie I. Davison M. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, complex fractions 19 and 20 from PC3 WT-PTEN-inducible cells in the presence (+Dox) and absence (−Dox) of Dox were collected and labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively. The pool of these two samples was labeled with Cy2 and served as a standard control for normalization and quantitation of Cy5- and Cy3-labeled samples. The samples were combined and resolved on two-dimensional DIGE gels. Fig. 4A shows one of the representative two-dimensional DIGE images, where false-colored Cy5 (red) or Cy3 (green) spots indicate proteins that are potentially recruited to or excluded from the high molecular mass complex in the presence of PTEN, respectively, whereas Cy3/Cy5 (yellow) spots identify those proteins in the higher molecular mass fraction whose presence is independent of PTEN. Following this methodology, several proteins with altered abundance were discovered and further identified using mass spectrometric analysis. HnRNP C was one of the proteins identified through this methodology (supplemental Fig. S1) and was enriched by 2.2-fold in the presence of PTEN (Fig. 4B). To eliminate any CyDye labeling bias, a CyDye-swapping approach was used, and the PTEN-induced and uninduced samples were reversely labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. The results further validate that hnRNP C is enriched in PTEN+ fractions (Fig. 4B). Following identification of hnRNP C, PC3 WT-PTEN-induced cells fractionated through size-exclusion chromatography were immunoblotted with hnRNP C and PTEN. The hnRNP C antibody recognized two bands corresponding to hnRNP C1 and C2 (41 and 43 kDa, respectively), which represent alternatively spliced variants of the same gene (34Swanson M.S. Nakagawa T.Y. LeVan K. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1731-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PTEN and hnRNP C co-fractionated only in the high molecular mass fractions (Fig. 5A). By immunoblotting of higher molecular mass fractions (19 and 20) in the presence or absence of PTEN, we demonstrated increased recruitment of hnRNP C into these fractions (Fig. 5B). In addition, comparing hnRNP C levels in fractions 17–26 under PTEN-induced and uninduced conditions showed a shift of hnRNP C toward higher molecular mass fractions in the presence of PTEN (Fig. 5C). To rule out the possibility that PTEN regulates overall hnRNP C protein levels, whole lysates from PC3 WT-PTEN-induced and uninduced cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis. No change in the levels of hnRNP C was detected under PTEN-induced and uninduced conditions (Fig. 5D), suggesting that PTEN does not alter hnRNP C expression. To investigate the interaction of PTEN and hnRNP C, co-immunoprecipitation was performed using PC3 PTEN-induced cells with an antibody specific to the N terminus of PTEN and IgG control. The results demonstrated an interaction between PTEN and hnRNP C in these cells (Fig. 6A). The interaction between PTEN and hnRNP C was also present when PC3 cells were transiently transfected with WT-PTEN but absent with the C terminus of PTEN (supplemental Fig. S2). This suggests that the C terminus of PTEN on its own is not sufficient for complex formation with hnRNP C. Interaction of PTEN and hnRNP C was further validated in HeLa cells expressing endogenous levels of both proteins (Fig. 6B). We hypothesized that the interaction between PTEN and hnRNP C is taking place in the nucleus because of the higher relative levels of hnRNP C found in the nucleus and enrichment of PTEN-associated complex in nuclear lysates (Fig. 3). To test this, we used hydrogen peroxide to trigger nuclear retention of PTEN (26Chang C.J. Mulholland D.J. Valamehr B. Mosessian S. Sellers W.R. Wu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide treatment resulted in higher nuclear PTEN (Fig. 6C) and increased the interaction between PTEN and hnRNP C (Fig. 6B). To test further the interaction of PTEN and hnRNP C in the nucleus, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with PTEN and IgG control. Immunoblotting for hnRNP C showed specific interaction between endogenous hnRNP C and PTEN in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 6D). Further analysis using immunofluorescent-labeled antibodies showed the two proteins co-localized within the nucleus (Fig. 6E). As a negative control, PC3 WT-PTEN uninduced cells (−Dox) were used and showed undetectable PTEN levels and no co-localization between PTEN and hnRNP C. Taken together, our data show a physical interaction between PTEN and hnRNP C in the nucleus, which can be further enhanced with stimulation known to promote PTEN nuclear retention, such as H2O2 treatment. To address the functional significance of the interaction between PTEN and hnRNP C, we have investigated a possible role for hnRNP C in interacting with PTEN and regulating its lipid phosphatase activity by knockdown of hnRNP C expression in PC3 WT-PTEN-inducible cells. Compared with the uninduced cells, hnRNP C knockdown did not lead to detectable changes in either total PTEN or P-AKT levels (supplemental Fig. S3A). In addition, hnRNP C small interfering RNA did not decrease nuclear PTEN levels (supplemental Fig. S3B), suggesting that hnRNP C is not affecting PTEN localization and lipid phosphatase activity. The functional significance of this interaction and the regulation of hnRNP C function by PTEN remain to be studied further. In this study, we set to understand the key elements involved in PTEN complex assembly. Using inducible PTEN expression in PTEN-null cells, we demonstrated that the catalytic activity of PTEN is not absolutely required for its higher molecular mass assembly because the catalytically dead mutant, C124S, has similar complex assembly capability compared with the WT-PTEN protein. Previous reports have suggested that the PTEN complex forms through interaction with PDZ-containing proteins, such as NHERF2 and hDLG (19Takahashi Y. Morales F.C. Kreimann E.L. Georgescu M.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). By deleting the key amino acids of the PTEN PDZ binding domain, we showed that the absence of a functional PDZ domain does not prevent PTEN from being recruited to higher molecular mass fractions. These results open up the possibility that PTEN can exist in multiple high molecular mass complexes, and the PTEN PDZ binding domain may be required for the formation of certain complexes but dispensable for others. Interestingly, the presence of hDLG in the higher molecular mass complex is independent of PTEN. PTEN phosphorylation at its C-terminal tail has been shown to play a critical role in its regulation (20Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and previously it has been suggested that phosphorylation of PTEN in this region, measured by P380 antibody, negatively regulates its complex assembly (27Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Our results agree with these findings and demonstrate that phosphorylated PTEN is enriched in monomeric fractions and that a phospho-mimicking mutation of PTEN on Ser380, Thr382, Thr383, and Ser385 (E4-PTEN mutant) leads to decreased complex assembly. To identify further the mechanism through which phosphorylation of PTEN may regulate its complex assembly, we investigated the cellular localization of the PTEN complex. A previous study demonstrated that PTEN nuclear retention is positively regulated through dephosphorylation of its P380 residue. Our results showed that NLS-PTEN has increased complex-forming potential and such an increase is due, at least in part, to the enrichment of the PTEN-associated complex in the nuclear fraction. Characterization of novel PTEN-interacting partners is critical in understanding PTEN tumor-suppressive functions. To find new components to the PTEN-associated complex(es), DIGE was used to identify those proteins specifically being recruited to the complex in the presence of PTEN. Our approach led to the identification of hnRNP C. Interestingly, in a pulldown experiment performed by Crockett et al. (36Crockett D.K. Fillmore G.C. Elenitoba-Johnson K.S. Lim M.S. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a novel protein similar to hnRNP C was identified as an interacting partner of PTEN, but the interaction was not validated. Our results demonstrated that hnRNP C and PTEN co-fractionate only in high molecular mass complexes and that hnRNP C is significantly recruited into these fractions in the presence of PTEN. Further analysis using co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments showed complex assembly between hnRNP C and PTEN in the nucleus. Our results have identified hnRNP C as a component of the PTEN nuclear complex and show an interaction between these two proteins. To take an initial step in understanding the functional significance of this interaction, we have investigated the effect of hnRNP C on PTEN function. Our results demonstrate that under hnRNP C knockdown conditions, no significant changes in PTEN, P-AKT, and nuclear PTEN levels can be detected, suggesting that the interaction between these two proteins might be more important in regulating hnRNP C functions. HnRNP C is a very abundant nuclear protein and binds to RNA through its RNA binding domains (34Swanson M.S. Nakagawa T.Y. LeVan K. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1731-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 37Görlach M. Wittekind M. Beckman R.A. Mueller L. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3289-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is a component of the spliceosome complex (38Choi Y.D. Grabowski P.J. Sharp P.A. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1986; 231: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and a recent study using a hnRNP C knockdown approach identified BCL2L12 and PCBP4 as genes whose splicing is regulated by hnRNP C (39Venables J.P.
