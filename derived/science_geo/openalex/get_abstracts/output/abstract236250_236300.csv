Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V. Cell. 1993; 75: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9449) Google Scholar). miRNAs have since been implicated in many processes in invertebrates, including cell proliferation and apoptosis (6Xu P.

Nature. 2003; 426: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). As many miRNAs are conserved across species (9Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Weinstein E.G. Abdelhakim A. Yekta S. Rhoades M.W. Burge C.B.

Nature. 2000; 408: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar), they are likely to be involved in developmental processes in all animals. Only a few mammalian miRNAs have been assigned any function, and at least two of these are involved in developmental processes: miR-181 promotes B cell development in mice (12Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar) and miR-196a regulates several Hox genes (13Yekta S. Shih I.H. Bartel D.P. Science. 2004; 304: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar), which code for a family of transcription factors involved in various developmental programs in animals (14Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that miRNAs may play a role in maturation of human adipocytes. Understanding the molecular events involved in adipocyte differentiation is of interest for development of therapeutics for metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. In vitro cell culture systems, such as human primary subcutaneous pre-adipocytes, have been crucial in uncovering signaling pathways important for adipocyte differentiation (15Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These cells can be cultured with differentiation-promoting hormonal stimuli, causing them to develop into cells that morphologically and functionally resemble mature adipocytes. In this study we have inhibited a panel of miRNAs in pre-adipocytes using antisense oligonucleotides and evaluated the effect on adipocyte differentiation. Combined with expression analysis of miRNAs in differentiating adipocytes by microarray, one miRNA, miR-143, was identified which normally promotes adipocyte differentiation. These results indicate that miRNAs do play a role in adipocyte differentiation and are potential therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotide Synthesis—Oligonucleotides were prepared using conventional phosphoramidite chemistry and DNA synthesis equipment (Applied Biosystems). The 2′-O-methoxyethyl phosphoramidites and succinate-linked solid support were prepared as described previously (16Martin P. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1995; 78: 486-504Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The purity of all samples was >85% as monitored by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis following precipitation. ASO sequences were complementary to the published mature miRNA sequence, with the length of the ASO varying accordingly (see supplemental Fig. S1)Culture and Differentiation of Pre-adipocytes—Human white pre-adipocytes (Zen-Bio Inc.) were grown in pre-adipocyte media (Zen-Bio Inc.). One day before transfection, the pre-adipocytes were seeded into 96-well plates. Transfection of 250 nm oligonucleotide in Lipofectin (Invitrogen) was performed in triplicate, according to manufacturer's instructions. A positive control peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 (PPAR-γ2) ASO, and a negative control ASO were also included in at least 6 wells in each experiment. After the cells reached confluence, they were exposed to differentiation medium (Zen-Bio Inc.) containing rosiglitazone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin for 3 days. Cells were then fed adipocyte medium (Zen-Bio Inc.), which was replaced at 2-3-day intervals. Ten days after the induction of differentiation, cells were lysed and adipocyte endpoints were examined. Triglyceride accumulation was measured using the Infinity triglyceride reagent kit (Sigma).Real-time RT-PCR—Adipocyte total RNA was harvested from cells in 96-well plates using RNeasy 96 columns (Qiagen) on a Bio Robot 3000 (Qiagen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed (Applied Biosystems, Prism 7700) using the following primer/probe sets: adipocyte lipid-binding protein (aP2), 5′-GGTGGTGGAATGCGTCATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAACGTCCCTTGGCTTATGC-3′ (reverse); probe, 5′-FAM-AAGGCGTCACTTCCACGAGAGTTTATGAGA-TAMRA-3′; glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), 5′-GGCCTCCGCAGGTTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCGGAGCCTATCTGTTGGAA-3′ (reverse); probe, 5′-FAM-TCCAGGCCGGAGTCAGAGACTCCA-TAMRA-3′; hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), 5′-ACCTGCGCACAATGACACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGCTCGAGAAGAAGGCTATG-3′ (reverse); probe, 5′-FAM-CCTCCGCCAGAGTCACCAGCG-TAMRA-3′; PPAR-γ2, 5′-AAATATCAGTGTGAATTACAGCAAACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAATCGCTTTCTGGGTCAA-3′ (reverse); probe, 5′-FAM-TGCTGTTATGGGTGAAACTCTGGGAGATTCT-TAMRA-3′. Expression levels were normalized to total RNA, determined by Ribogreen (Molecular Probes).Microarray—254 oligonucleotides (5′-amino-modifier-C6) corresponding to human and mouse mature sense miRNA sequences were spotted on three-dimensional CodeLink slides (GE Health/Amersham Biosciences) with a final concentration of 20 μm and processed according to manufacturer's recommendations. First strand cDNA synthesized from 20 μg TRIzol-purified total RNA was labeled with biotinylated ddUTP using the Enzo BioArray end labeling kit (Enzo Life Sciences Inc.) Hybridization, staining, and washing were performed according to a modified Affymetrix Antisense genome array protocol. Axon B-4000 scanner and Gene-Pix Pro 4.0 software were used to scan images. Non-positive spots after background subtraction, and outliers detected by the ESD procedure (17Rosner B. Fundamentals of Biostatistics. Duxbury, New York2000Google Scholar) were removed. The resulting signal intensity values were normalized to per-chip median values and then used to obtain geometric means and standard errors for each miRNA. Each miRNA signal was transformed to log base 2, and a one-sample t test was conducted. For the adipocyte experiment shown here, two independent hybridizations for each sample were performed on chips with each miRNA spotted four times. Two sample Welch's t test was used for comparison of adipocyte and pre-adipocyte miRNA expression levels. Further details are included in the supplemental Methods.Northern Blotting—RNA from human tissues (Ambion) or RNA isolated from differentiating adipocytes (TRIzol, Invitrogen) was separated on a 10% acrylamide TBE-urea mini-gel (Invitrogen) and then electroblotted onto Hybond N+ nylon filter (Amersham Biosciences). An end-labeled (Promega) oligonucleotide probe for miR-143 (5′-TGAGCTACAGTGCTTCATCTCA-3′) was hybridized to the filter in Rapidhyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was reprobed for U6 to control for equal loading. Quantitation was done using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software.Luciferase Assay—pGL3-miR-143 sensor plasmid was constructed by insertion of two miR-143 binding sites in the XbaI site of the pGL3-Control vector (Promega). The pCR3-pri-mir-143 plasmid was constructed by T/A cloning of a 430-bp miR-143 PCR product into the pCR3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). The PCR primers used were: 5′-AGG TTT GGT CCT GGG TGC TCA AAT GGC AGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGC CCA GAC TCG TGA AGC AGA TCG TGG CAC-3′ (reverse). For transfection, adherent HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates in minimal essential medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) the following day, according to the manufacturer's instructions. 30 ng of pGL3-miR-143 sensor plasmid, 10 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega), 100 ng of pCR3-pri-mir-143 expression plasmid, and the indicated dose of ASO were transfected into each well, and each treatment was done in triplicate. 24 h after transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase assay (Promega). The sequence of scrambled control ASO is 5′-AGACTAGCGGTATCTTTATCCC-3′. The sequence of miR-129 ASO is 5′-GCAAGCCCAGACCGCAAAAAG-3′.Western Blotting—Adipocytes were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with anti-ERK5 antibody (Cell Signaling). The blot was reprobed with anti-G3PDH antibody (Abcam). Protein levels were quantitated on a Bio-Rad Chemidoc system.RESULTSIdentification of miRNAs Involved in Adipocyte Differentiation through Combined Functional and Expression Analysis—To identify miRNAs important for modulating adipocyte differentiation, primary human pre-adipocytes were transfected prior to induction of differentiation with 2′-O-methoxyethyl (2′-O-MOE) phosphorothioate-modified antisense RNA oligonucleotides targeting miRNAs. In each experiment, a negative control ASO was included, as well as a PPAR-γ2 ASO, which inhibits adipocyte differentiation. Three days after ASO transfection, when the cells reached confluence, they were exposed to differentiation-inducing medium containing dexamethasone, the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin. Ten days later, differentiation was assessed by measuring triglyceride accumulation in the cells, as well as the expression of four adipocyte-specific genes: the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4, HSL, fatty acid-binding protein aP2, and PPAR-γ2 by quantitative RT-PCR.The heat map in Fig. 1 summarizes the data from ASOs targeting 86 miRNAs. Two ASOs, targeting miR-9* and miR-143, inhibited all five adipocyte differentiation markers by at least 40%, when compared with control ASO-treated adipocytes. Five ASOs inhibited three adipocyte endpoints, but none of these affected PPAR-γ2, which is the most significant marker of adipocyte differentiation. While no ASO increased all five end points, three ASOs, targeting miR-196, let-7c, and miR-145, increased three endpoints by 40% or more. However, only let-7c caused an increase in PPAR-γ2 expression.To correlate this functional data with expression patterns of miRNAs in the developing adipocytes, a microarray-based technique was used to profile miRNA expression in the human pre-adipocytes and differentiated cells. The miRNA array was first used to profile miRNA expression in different cell lines and organs in human and mouse, and the data showed a good correlation with both published Northern blotting data (18Sempere L.F. Freemantle S. Pitha-Rowe I. Moss E. Dmitrovsky E. Ambros V. Genome Biology. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/3/R13)PubMed Google Scholar) and our own Northern blotting data. Using this technique, miRNAs that are differentially expressed in adipocytes compared with pre-adipocytes were identified and are shown in Table I. miR-143, which was a hit in the adipocyte differentiation functional assay, also appeared to be up-regulated in differentiated adipocytes, further supporting a role for it in modulating adipocyte differentiation.Table ImiRNAs differentially expressed during adipocyte differentiation Data from microarray analysis of miR expression was used to identify miRs with differential expression in human cultured adipocytes compared to preadipocytes. Only miRs with a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) differential expression are listed. Welch's two-sample t test was used to compute p values. -Fold change is the change in expression in adipocytes relative to pre-adipocytes.miRNA-Fold changep valuemiR-130b3.860miR-30c3.740.0154miR-1913.220.0040miR-30a*2.830.0329miR-130a2.760.0299miR-1432.610.0171miR-30d2.540.0169miR-1962.170.0356miR-1072.170.0007miR-30b2.020.0429miR-19b1.990.0480miR-1031.980.0267miR-2961.860miR-921.740let-7c1.480.0467miR-99b1.450.0089let-7a1.390.0025miR-198a1.340.0104miR-100–1.140.0175miR-138–2.180.0069miR-93–2.960.0086miR-20–3.150.0474 Open table in a new tab Concentration-dependent Inhibition of Adipocyte Differentiation by miR-143 Antisense Oligonucleotide—The effects of the miR-143 ASO were further characterized in pre-adipocytes. The reduction in triglyceride accumulation by the miR-143 ASO was concentration-dependent, with a maximum inhibition of 75% at 300 nm ASO (Fig. 2A). The negative control ASO failed to significantly reduce triglyceride accumulation at any concentration tested, while the positive control PPAR-γ2 ASO effectively inhibited triglyceride accumulation. Expression of the four adipocyte hallmark genes was also inhibited by the miR-143 ASO in a concentration-dependent manner, while the negative control ASO had no significant effect on their expression (Fig. 2A). ASO inhibition of miR-143 prevents adipocyte-specific gene expression and the accumulation of triglycerides, suggesting that miR-143 is normally involved in promoting adipocyte differentiation or function.Fig. 2Expression levels and ASO inhibition of miR-143 in differentiating adipocytes. A, concentration-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation end points by miR-143 ASO. The level of each adipocyte differentiation end point in pre-adipocytes and in adipocytes treated with PPAR-γ2 ASO (which inhibits adipocyte differentiation) are shown for comparison.

The highest levels of miR-143 were found in heart, kidney, and thymus, while modest levels were observed in spleen, brain, and liver (Fig. 2B). Expression of miR-143 was also examined in a similar panel of mouse tissues, and the expression pattern correlated well with the human tissues (data not shown). Although the human tissue panel did not include adipose tissue, white adipose tissue from the ob/ob mouse strain had the highest level of miR-143 of any tissues examined. Northern blot experiments confirmed that expression of miR-143 is increased in adipocytes relative to pre-adipocytes. (Fig. 2, C and D). MiR-143 expression increased between day 4 and day 10 by almost 4-fold (Fig. 2, C and D).2′-O-MOE Antisense Oligonucleotides Are Effective Inhibitors of MicroRNA Activity—Antisense inhibition of miRNAs using 2′-O-methyl-modified ASOs in cell culture, C. elegans, and Drosophila embryos has been reported (19Meister G. Landthaler M. Dorsett Y. Tuschl T. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 20Hutvagner G. Simard M.J. Mello C.C. Zamore P.D.

To verify that 2′-O-MOE ASOs were also able to effectively inhibit miRNA activity, a miRNA activity assay using a luciferase expression plasmid containing two perfectly complementary miR-143 binding sites was established (pGL3-miR-143 sensor, Fig. 3A). Transfection of the pri-mir-143 expression plasmid (pCR3-pri-mir-143, Fig. 3A) into HeLa cells caused a 14-fold inhibition of luciferase activity compared with pGL3-miR-143 sensor transfection alone (Fig. 3B). Addition of miR-143 ASO was able to prevent the repression of luciferase activity by miR-143 in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of a scrambled control ASO, or an ASO against an unrelated miRNA, miR-129, had no effect on luciferase repression by miR-143 (Fig. 3B). Thus, 2′-O-MOE ASOs are effective and specific inhibitors of miRNA activity.Fig. 32′-MOE antisense oligonucleotides are effective inhibitors of miRNA activity in cultured cells. A, expression plasmids used in luciferase assay for miR-143 activity. B, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega), pGL3-miR-143 sensor, and unless indicated, pCR3-pri-mir-143. ASOs were transfected at the indicated doses and evaluated for their ability to interfere with miR-143 inhibition of pGL3-miR-143 sensor luciferase expression. Luciferase activity was assayed 24 h post-transfection and for each sample was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. C, Northern blotting for miR-143 in differentiating adipocytes treated with 250 nm ASO targeting miR-143 at days 7 and 10 after induction of differentiation. The blot was reprobed for snRNA U6 as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The effect of miR-143 ASO treatment on miR-143 levels in differentiating adipocytes was also examined. Northern blotting for miR-143 in ASO-treated adipocytes revealed a 60% decrease in mature miR-143 levels compared with untreated control 7 days after the induction of differentiation. A negative control ASO did not cause a reduction in miR-143 (Fig. 3C). A reduction in miR-143 levels was not necessarily expected, as 2′-O-MOE ASOs do not support RNaseH-mediated cleavage of the target. However, in other experiments we have observed that 2′-O-MOE ASOs targeting mature miRNA can inhibit Drosha processing of pri-miRNA transcripts and subsequently reduce mature miR levels. 2B.

We wanted to test whether protein levels of any predicted miR-143 targets were altered in the miR-143 ASO-treated adipocytes. However, of the miR-143 targets proposed by Lewis et al. (4Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4171) Google Scholar), only antibodies for ERK5/BMK1 were commercially available. Levels of ERK5 protein in normal adipocytes were compared with adipocytes that had been treated with miR-143 ASO before induction of differentiation. After 7 or 10 days of differentiation, the level of ERK5 protein, normalized to G3PDH levels, was 2-fold higher in the miR-143 ASO-treated cells (Fig. 4). The levels of ERK5 protein were unchanged in adipocytes treated with an ASO targeting miR-23b, which also inhibited adipocyte differentiation in this assay (data not shown). These data suggest that the up-regulation of ERK5 is specific to the miR-143 ASO treatment and not a general result of inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, consistent with the hypothesis that ERK5 is a miR-143 target gene.Fig. 4Predicted miR-143 target ERK5/BMK1 is up-regulated in miR-143 ASO-treated adipocytes A, Western blotting for ERK5/BMK1 in differentiating adipocytes treated with 250 nm ASO targeting miR-143, at days 7 and 10 after induction of differentiation.

These data, together with a global analysis of miRNA expression patterns, allowed us to identify several miRNAs involved in adipocyte differentiation. 2′-O-MOE ASOs were a useful tool for dissecting the biological importance of miRNAs, and our library of miRNA ASOs will be of use in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems to rapidly uncover the biological roles of miRNAs. In addition, ASOs targeting miRNA may be valuable as therapeutics in a variety of disease indications.One miRNA identified in the screen, miR-143, was of particular interest. The observation that miR-143 is up-regulated as adipocytes differentiate, taken together with the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by miR-143 ASO, indicates that miR-143 normally promotes adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, miR-143 levels were previously reported to be decreased in colorectal adenocarcinomas compared with normal tissue (27Michael M.Z. O'Connor S.M. van Holst Pellekaan N.G. Young G.P. James R.J. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 882-891PubMed Google Scholar), and the authors were unable to detect miR-143 expression in a variety of human cancer cell lines. Our own efforts to find a cancer cell line expressing miR-143 were also unsuccessful (data not shown). This is consistent with a role for miR-143 in promoting differentiation and suggests that its down-regulation in cancer cell lines may be a cause or a consequence of the undifferentiated state.Numerous bioinformatics approaches to predicting miRNA targets have been put forward, but direct verification of a miRNA-regulated target in a biological system has so far only been accomplished in C. elegans (28Ha I. Wightman B. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Vella M.C. Choi E.Y. Lin S.Y. Reinert K. Slack F.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). ERK5/BMK1 was predicted to be a miR-143 target in one such study, and we found ERK5 protein levels up-regulated in miR-143 ASO-treated adipocytes. However, as each miRNA is expected to regulate multiple target genes, it is difficult to know whether the effect of miR-143 inhibition on adipocyte differentiation is primarily mediated through ERK5 or through other unknown miR-143 target genes. ERK5 is known to promote cell growth and proliferation in response to tyrosine kinase signaling (30Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D.

It may be involved in regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes. In this case, miR-143 inhibition of ERK5 protein in differentiated adipocytes, either directly, through binding of the ERK5 3′UTR, or indirectly through another target gene, may be one way to fine tune the MAP kinase signaling pathways to maintain the differentiated state. Further experiments will be necessary to dissect the role of ERK5 in adipocyte differentiation. Regardless, identification of miR-143 as an important regulator of adipocyte differentiation suggests that miRNAs are potential therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic disease.

The induction of potent cellular immune responses by vaccination in humans has proven difficult. Recombinant viral vectors, especially poxviruses and adenoviruses, are particularly effective at boosting previously primed CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against a number of intracellular pathogens in animal studies1,2,3,4,5,6,7. In the first phase 1 study of any candidate subunit vaccine against tuberculosis, recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) was found to induce high levels of antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting T cells when used alone in bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-naive healthy volunteers. In volunteers who had been vaccinated 0.5–38 years previously with BCG, substantially higher levels of antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting T cells were induced, and at 24 weeks after vaccination these levels were 5–30 times greater than in vaccinees administered a single BCG vaccination. Boosting vaccinations with MVA85A could offer a practical and efficient strategy for enhancing and prolonging antimycobacterial immunity in tuberculosis-endemic areas."

Although nuclear export of intron-containing cellular transcripts is restricted in mammalian cells, HIV-1 has evolved the viral Rev protein to overcome this restriction for viral transcripts. Previously, CRM1 was identified as a cellular cofactor for Rev-dependent export of intron-containing HIV-1 RNA. Here, we present evidence that Rev/CRM1 activity utilizes the ATP-dependent DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX3. We show that DDX3 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, which binds CRM1 and localizes to nuclear membrane pores. Knockdown of DDX3 using either antisense vector or dominant-negative mutants suppressed Rev-RRE-function in the export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Plausibly, DDX3 is the human RNA helicase which functions in the CRM1 RNA export pathway analogously to the postulated role for Dbp5p in yeast mRNA export."
https://openalex.org/W2136986586,"The t-loop structure of mammalian telomeres is thought to repress nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) at natural chromosome ends. Telomere NHEJ occurs upon loss of TRF2, a telomeric protein implicated in t-loop formation. Here we describe a mutant allele of TRF2, TRF2ΔB, that suppressed NHEJ but induced catastrophic deletions of telomeric DNA. The deletion events were stochastic and occurred rapidly, generating dramatically shortened telomeres that were accompanied by a DNA damage response and induction of senescence. TRF2ΔB-induced deletions depended on XRCC3, a protein implicated in Holliday junction resolution, and created t-loop-sized telomeric circles. These telomeric circles were also detected in unperturbed cells and suggested that t-loop deletion by homologous recombination (HR) might contribute to telomere attrition. Human ALT cells had abundant telomeric circles, pointing to frequent t-loop HR events that could promote rolling circle replication of telomeres in the absence of telomerase. These findings show that t-loop deletion by HR influences the integrity and dynamics of mammalian telomeres."

Assuming a founder effect in a large Old Order Amish pedigree, we carried out a genome-wide screen for linkage and identified a single region of homozygosity on chromosome 2p12–p11.2 spanning 5.1 cM (maximum lod score of 6.84). We sequenced genes in the region and identified a nonsense mutation in SIAT9, which is predicted to result in the premature termination of the GM3 synthase enzyme (also called lactosylceramide α-2,3 sialyltransferase). GM3 synthase is a member of the sialyltransferase family and catalyzes the initial step in the biosynthesis of most complex gangliosides from lactosylceramide. Biochemical analysis of plasma glycosphingolipids confirmed that affected individuals lack GM3 synthase activity, as marked by a complete lack of GM3 ganglioside and its biosynthetic derivatives and an increase in lactosylceramide and its alternative derivatives. Although the relationship between defects in ganglioside catabolism and a range of lysosomal storage diseases is well documented, this is the first report, to our knowledge, of a disruption of ganglioside biosynthesis associated with human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2117511932,"Fanconi anemia is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by diverse clinical symptoms, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer. Fanconi anemia has at least 11 complementation groups (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L); the genes mutated in 8 of these have been identified. The gene BRCA2 was suggested to underlie complementation group B, but the evidence is inconclusive. Here we show that the protein defective in individuals with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B is an essential component of the nuclear protein 'core complex' responsible for monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key event in the DNA-damage response pathway associated with Fanconi anemia and BRCA. Unexpectedly, the gene encoding this protein, FANCB, is localized at Xp22.31 and subject to X-chromosome inactivation. X-linked inheritance has important consequences for genetic counseling of families with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B. Its presence as a single active copy and essentiality for a functional Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway make FANCB a potentially vulnerable component of the cellular machinery that maintains genomic integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2057193041,"The classical model for the activation of the nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless (SOS) involves its recruitment to the membrane, where it engages Ras. The recent discovery that Ras•GTP is an allosteric activator of SOS indicated that the regulation of SOS is more complex than originally envisaged. We now present crystallographic and biochemical analyses of a construct of SOS that contains the Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) and catalytic domains and show that the DH-PH unit blocks the allosteric binding site for Ras and suppresses the activity of SOS. SOS is dependent on Ras binding to the allosteric site for both a lower level of activity, which is a result of Ras•GDP binding, and maximal activity, which requires Ras•GTP. The action of the DH-PH unit gates a reciprocal interaction between Ras and SOS, in which Ras converts SOS from low to high activity forms as Ras•GDP is converted to Ras•GTP by SOS."
https://openalex.org/W2050415180,"Brain imaging studies have explored the neural mechanisms of recovery in adults following acquired disorders and, more recently, childhood developmental disorders. However, the neural systems underlying adult rehabilitation of neurobiologically based learning disabilities remain unexplored, despite their high incidence. Here we characterize the differences in brain activity during a phonological manipulation task before and after a behavioral intervention in adults with developmental dyslexia. Phonologically targeted training resulted in performance improvements in tutored compared to nontutored dyslexics, and these gains were associated with signal increases in bilateral parietal and right perisylvian cortices. Our findings demonstrate that behavioral changes in tutored dyslexic adults are associated with (1) increased activity in those left-hemisphere regions engaged by normal readers and (2) compensatory activity in the right perisylvian cortex. Hence, behavioral plasticity in adult developmental dyslexia involves two distinct neural mechanisms, each of which has previously been observed either for remediation of developmental or acquired reading disorders."

The HCV IRES can form a binary complex with an eIF-free 40S ribosomal subunit. Next, a 48S-like complex assembles at the AUG initiation codon upon association of eIF3 and ternary complex. 80S complex formation is rate limiting and follows the GTP-dependent association of the 60S subunit. Efficient assembly of the 48S-like and 80S complexes on the IRES mRNA is dependent upon maintenance of the highly conserved HCV IRES structure.

Rutishauser U. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This carbohydrate is added post-translationally to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), which is responsible for a variety of functions, including axon pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and tissue formation in the central nervous system (2Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 425-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The expression of the polysialylated form of NCAM (PSA-NCAM) peaks early in development and decreases with age. In some exceptions, such as the hippocampus, cells continue to express PSA-NCAM throughout the life of the organism. These regions of PSA expression are also associated with neural plasticity and the remodeling of neural connections (1Bruses J.L. Rutishauser U. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 2Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 425-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of PSA-NCAM is associated with tumor malignancy and metastasis, and the expression of PSA-NCAM has been detected in small cell carcinoma, neuroblastomas, and Wilm's tumor (3Tanaka R. Otake Y. Nakagawa T. Kawano Y. Miyahara R. Li M. Yanagihara K. Nakayama J. Fujimoto I. Ikenaka K. Wada H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3072-3080PubMed Google Scholar). Polysialic acid is thought to facilitate cell migration and plasticity by inhibiting cell adhesion to other cells and to the extracellular matrix, as a result of the large excluded volume of the polymer (4Yang P. Yin X. Rutishauser U. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 116: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Yang P. Major D. Yin X. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23039-23044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy images showed that PSA expression increased intercellular spacing by 10-15 nm (4Yang P. Yin X. Rutishauser U. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 116: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The latter could be because of the inactivation of adhesion proteins or to the increased inter-membrane repulsion resulting from the confinement of the carbohydrate chains. Light scattering studies demonstrated that NCAM polysialylation doubles the hydrodynamic radius of NCAM. However, the latter results were based on calculations, using light scattering data and the assumption that the rod-like proteins were spherical. While this indicates the approximate size of the protein, the hydrodynamic radius does not quantify the effect of the carbohydrates on NCAM-mediated adhesion. In one proposed mechanism, for example, the increased repulsive pressure between the membranes is hypothesized to push the cells apart (6Rutishauser U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Such a shift in the force balance between cells from attractive to repulsive requires the increased intermembrane repulsion to be at least as large as the protein attraction at the membrane distance at which the proteins bind. For example, if NCAM bridges two membranes at a separation of 40 nm with an adhesion energy of ∼1000 kBT/μm2, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature, then NCAM polysialylation would have to increase the repulsion at 40 nm by at least this amount, to disrupt the adhesive junction. Testing this, however, requires determining both the magnitudes of the intermembrane forces and their range. The impact of ionic strength on the adhesion between cells expressing PSA-NCAM further supports the view that PSA acts by increasing the repulsion between cells. The hydrodynamic volume of polyelectrolytes decreases with increasing monovalent salt concentrations (7Pincus P. Macromolecules. 1991; 24: 2912-2919Crossref Scopus (891) Google Scholar), and this would in turn reduce the repulsion between two membranes with surface-anchored chains. Consistent with this, an increase in the monovalent salt concentration from 0.15 to 0.5 m NaCl restored the adhesion between cells expressing PSA-NCAM (5Yang P. Major D. Yin X. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23039-23044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Investigations of cell adhesion also suggested that the effects of PSA can be generalized to a diverse set of adhesion proteins, including NCAM, cadherin, L1, and integrins (8Fujimoto I. Bruses J.L. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31745-31751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this general abrogation of adhesion did not require NCAM domains beyond those minimally required for polysialylation. Recent structural studies utilizing both x-ray and neutron specular reflectivity show that the carbohydrate extends significantly above the membrane surface. 2Johnson, C. P., Fragneto, G., Konovalov, O., Legrand, J. F., and Leckband, D. E. (2005) Biochemistry, in press. These findings are consistent with a mechanism in which PSA alters cell interactions by increasing the nonspecific, inter-membrane repulsion. This would offset protein attraction, alter cell adhesion, and hence shift the equilibrium membrane separation. However, there is no direct evidence linking intermembrane spacing and the inhibition of adhesion by PSA. In this study, the surface force apparatus (SFA), and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) were used to investigate the molecular mechanism by which polysialic acid abrogates NCAM and C-cadherin-mediated intermembrane adhesion. The SFA quantifies the distance dependence of the force between extended surfaces such as membranes (10Israelachvili J. J. Surf. Sci. Rep. 1992; 14: 110-159Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 11Leckband D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These measurements are particularly relevant to gaining a mechanistic understanding of the biological activity of PSA. The configuration of grafted polyelectrolyte chains such as PSA, as well as the magnitude of the repulsive pressure they exert between membranes is a function of the chain density (7Pincus P. Macromolecules. 1991; 24: 2912-2919Crossref Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In this case, single molecule measurements would not yield useful mechanistic information. The results reported here show that the increase in the intermembrane repulsion following NCAM polysialylation is sufficient to overwhelm both homophilic NCAM and cadherin attraction at physiological ionic strength. Some adhesion recovers at high monovalent salt concentrations, concomitant with a significant reduction in the PSA-dependent intermembrane repulsion. FCS provided further, independent evidence that the hydrodynamic radius of PSA exceeds that of the unmodified NCAM. Additional measurements with mixed monolayers of NCAM and C-cadherin show that the inhibition of trans adhesive interactions can be generalized to other cell adhesion molecules. Materials—1,2-Di-tridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-di-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 6-[9-[2,3-Bis(dodecyloxy)propyl-(3,6,9-trioxanonyl-1-oxycarboxylamino)-2-[di(carboxymethyl)-amino]-hexanoic acid (NTA-TRIG-DLGE) was custom synthesized by Northern Lipids, Inc. (British Columbia, Canada). 1-Octadecanethiol, HEPES, sodium nitrate, nickel sulfate, and other high purity, inorganic salts were purchased from Aldrich. Rhodamine green was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 125I was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Endoneuraminidase-N (endo-N) was expressed and purified as described previously (12Prosser R.A. Rutishauer U. Ungers G. Fedorkova L. Glass J.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 15: 652-658Crossref Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNA of chicken NCAM120, encoding the seven extracellular domains of NCAM, was truncated at the onset of the transmembrane segment and fused to a sequence encoding a hexahistidine tag and a 3-amino acid linker, as described (13Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Perrin-Tricaud C. Rutishauser U. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6983-6988Google Scholar). This sequence was cloned into a PEE14 expression vector (gift from B. Gumbiner), and the soluble protein was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells under methotrexate selection. The resulting protein consisted of the seven extracellular domains fused to a C-terminal polyhistidine tail (13Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Perrin-Tricaud C. Rutishauser U. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6983-6988Google Scholar). The polyhistidine tail allows both the purification of the protein and its immobilization on fluid NTA-TRIG-DLGE lipid monolayers (13Johnson C.P.

PSA-NCAM expression was achieved by co-transfecting Chinese hamster ovary cells with a plasmid encoding the NCAM ectodomain and a second plasmid encoding the sialyltransferase enzyme PST (8Fujimoto I.

Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6983-6988Google Scholar). Both NCAM and PSA-NCAM were purified from the cell culture supernatants in a three-step process (13Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Perrin-Tricaud C. Rutishauser U. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6983-6988Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatant was first loaded onto a Ni-NTA-Sepharose column (Qiagen), and the protein was eluted with a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole (pH 7.5). Following the concentration of the protein eluant with a Centricon YM-30 concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA), the protein was further purified on a HiTrap Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The PSA-NCAM fractions were collected and concentrated. Finally, the protein was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration (Sephacryl S2000, Amersham Biosciences). The PSA-NCAM fractions were concentrated in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.5. Optical densities at 280 nm and an extinction coefficient of 99,030 cm-1m-1 were used to determine the NCAM concentration. The expression and purification of histidine-tagged NCAM and C-cadherin have been described previously (13Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Perrin-Tricaud C. Rutishauser U. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Protein Monolayers—Force measurements were carried out with proteins immobilized on opposing, supported lipid bilayers (Fig. 1a). The bilayers were prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett deposition (13Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Perrin-Tricaud C. Rutishauser U. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Lipid monolayers were prepared by spreading a chloroform solution of the lipid mixture at the air-water interface of a Langmuir trough (Nima, Coventry, England). The lipid monolayers were compressed to a desired surface pressure at room temperature, and deposited onto the surface of a mica sheet (15Sivasankar S. Gumbiner B.M. Leckband D. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1758-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Zhu B. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Jensen I.E. Gumbiner B.M. Leckband D. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 4033-4042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The first lipid monolayer was gel phase 1,2-di-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, deposited onto the mica from the air-water interface at a density of 43 Å2/lipid. The second, outer fluid phase lipid layer, containing 75 mol % of NTA-TRIG-DLGE and 25 mol % of 1,2-ditridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was deposited at 36 mN/m, which corresponds to ∼60 Å2/lipid. The supported bilayers were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaNO3, 15 μm NiSO4 (pH 7.7), and micromolar concentrations of the polyhistidine-tagged protein. The protein was adsorbed to the NTA lipid head group via the histidine tag. After 1 h, the lipid bilayers were washed with buffer to remove nonspecifically adsorbed protein, and the supported bilayers were then mounted in the surface force apparatus. For mixed protein monolayers, the supported bilayers were incubated either with C-cadherin and PSA-NCAM or with NCAM and C-cadherin at different molar ratios, to vary the PSA-NCAM:cadherin and NCAM:cadherin surface densities. Force Measurements—The forces were measured between two protein monolayers as a function of the intermembrane distance, D, with a Mark II SFA. The SFA quantifies the force between the surfaces of two crossed, hemi-cylindrical discs of geometric average radius (10Israelachvili J. J. Surf. Sci. Rep. 1992; 14: 110-159Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 11Leckband D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). R=R2R1=2cm From deflections in the spring supporting the lower disk, the force between the curved surfaces Fc, normalized by the radius, is determined as a function of the intersurface distance with a resolution of ±1 nN/m = mJ/m2 (10Israelachvili J. J. Surf. Sci. Rep. 1992; 14: 110-159Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18Israelachvili J. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1973; 44: 259-272Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Using multiple beam interferometry, SFA measurements quantify the absolute distances between the surfaces with a resolution of ±0.1 nm (18Israelachvili J. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1973; 44: 259-272Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In this work, the distance, D, refers to the distance between the dehydrated surfaces of the bilayers (Fig. 1a) (13Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Perrin-Tricaud C. Rutishauser U. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6983-6988Google Scholar, 15Sivasankar S. Gumbiner B.M. Leckband D. Biophys.

The radius R is also quantified directly from the interference fringes (18Israelachvili J. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1973; 44: 259-272Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar). An important aspect of this approach is that for geometries where the radius is significantly greater than the range of interaction, R >> D, the total force between the macroscopic curved surfaces Fc is directly related to the interaction energy between two equivalent flat surfaces Ef by the Derjaguin approximation, Fc/R = 2πEf (19Derjaguin B.V. Kolloid-Z. 1934; 69: 155-164Crossref Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Importantly, the curved geometry only introduces a 2πR factor, which scales the magnitude of the force. The normalized force Fc/2πR is therefore a direct measure of the intersurface potential. This well established result is described in several standard textbooks (20Israelachvili J. Intermolecular and Surface Forces. Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar). The adhesion energy per area is related to the force to detach the surfaces, or the pull-off force, Fpo, by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts theory, according to Ef = (Fpo)/(1.5πR) (21Johnson K.L. Kendall K. Roberts A.D. Proc. R. Soc. A. 1971; 324: 301-313Google Scholar). Quantification of Protein Surface Densities—To determine the surface density of proteins immobilized on the NTA-TRIG-DLGE supported bilayers, we measured the amount of bound 125I-labeled protein, according to procedures described previously (22Yeung C. Leckband D. Langmuir. 1997; 13: 6746-6754Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Yeung C. Purves T Koss A Sligar S. Langmuir. 1999; 15: 6829-6836Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 125I measurements were conducted with pure NCAM and PSA-NCAM monolayers, as well as with mixed NCAM:cadherin and PSA-NCAM:cadherin monolayers at ∼1:1 molar ratios. For the measurements with the mixed protein monolayers, one of the protein components was labeled with 125I, and both proteins were incubated with the supported bilayer. Thus, measurements with mixed monolayers were conducted with labeled NCAM and then with labeled cadherin. To quantify the surface densities of immobilized NCAM, PSA-NCAM and cadherin prepared from solutions of two proteins at molar ratios other than 1:1, we quantified the fluorescence intensities on the supported membranes. By fluorescently labeling one of the proteins and measuring the fluorescence intensity from monolayers prepared from the different protein mixtures, we determined the relative change in the surface density from the measured changes in the fluorescence. The surface densities of proteins adsorbed from 3:1 NCAM:cadherin and 1:3 PSA-NCAM:cadherin were then scaled by the change in fluorescent intensity relative to protein monolayers adsorbed from equimolar protein solutions. For example, a 3-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity from labeled NCAM would signal a 3-fold greater NCAM density. The rhodamine green (RG) dye used does not self-quench, and the measured intensities were below the saturation limit of the detector. Therefore, the intensity is assumed to scale linearly with the protein coverage. Because the fluorescence measurements quantify relative differences in fluorescence intensities, we calibrated the fluorescence intensity against the amount of 125I-labeled protein immobilized under identical conditions. For example, if the surface density of NCAM adsorbed from a 1:1 NCAM:cadherin solution is 2.0 ± 0.6 × 104/μm2, then a 2-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity would correspond to a surface density of 4 × 104/μm2. The proteins were fluorescently tagged with rhodamine green carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The molar ratio of dye to protein was kept at a stoichiometric ratio of 3:1 dye:protein. This yielded a labeling ratio of 1.1 for NCAM, 0.9 for PSA-NCAM, and 1.8 for cadherin. Fluorescence intensity images were taken using a ×100 UPLANFI oil objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), on a BX60 optical microscope from Olympus (Hamburg, Germany), which was interfaced to a digital camera (Diagnostics Instruments, Sterling, MI). For these measurements, a supported bilayer displaying a mixed protein monolayer, prepared as described above, was placed in a fluid cell and mounted on the microscope stage. The fluorescence intensity was determined by averaging the intensities from a minimum of 10 images taken from different regions of the supported bilayer. FCS—The diffusion coefficients of the macromolecules in solution were quantified by FCS. FCS quantifies fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity, as labeled molecules diffuse through a small excitation volume. The analysis of the fluorescent signal using an autocorrelation function (Equation 2) yields the diffusion coefficient of the macromolecule according to Ref. 24Muller J.D. Chen Y. Gratton E. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, G(τ)=⟨∂F(t)∂F(t+τ)⟩∂F(t) 2(Eq. 2) where G(τ) is the autocorrelation amplitude and δF(t) is the fluctuation in the number of molecules in the excitation volume at time t (25Cheng Y. Muller J.D. Berland K.M. Gratton E. Methods. 1999; 19: 234-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Sanchez, S., Chen, Y., Muller, J. D., Gratton, E., and Hazlett, T. L. (2001) 40,6903-6911Google Scholar). If applied to the translational diffusion of point-like particles, Equation 2 can be expressed as the following. G(τ)=122N(1+8dw2)−1(1+8dz2)−1/2 Here, w and z are the radii of the beam in the xy and z planes, respectively, N is the number of proteins, and d is the diffusion coefficient of the protein. We can thus accurately quantify differences in the hydrodynamic radii of NCAM and PSA-NCAM from their relative diffusion coefficients. NCAM and PSA-NCAM were fluorescently labeled with RG as described above. The protein was separated from excess dye by NTA affinity chromatography as described above, and was stored at 4 °C until use. The instrumentation for the measurement and the software for the analysis of FCS data are at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (24Muller J.D. Chen Y. Gratton E. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Sanchez, S., Chen, Y., Muller, J. D., Gratton, E., and Hazlett, T. L. (2001) 40,6903-6911Google Scholar). To excite the sample, a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Mira 900, Coherent, Palo Alto, CA) pumped by an intracavity doubled Nd:YVO4 vanadate laser (Verdi, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) was used as a photon source. Photon counts were collected using an Avalanche photodiode detector (model SPCM-AQ-151, EG&G) and the output was directed toward a data acquisition card. A Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV microscope (Thornwood, NY) was used with an oil immersion objective (NA = 1.4). The PSA-NCAM and NCAM concentrations used in the FCS experiments were ∼10-8m. Data were analyzed to determine the diffusion coefficient by fitting the experimental results to an autocorrelation function that assumes a Gaussian-Lorentzian intensity profile (25Cheng Y. Muller J.D. Berland K.M. Gratton E. Methods. 1999; 19: 234-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Sanchez, S., Chen, Y., Muller, J. D., Gratton, E., and Hazlett, T. L. (2001) 40,6903-6911Google Scholar). The Gaussian-Lorentzian function depends on the experimental setup and therefore must be calibrated. A solution of 1 × 10-8m fluorescein in 50 mm Tris was used both for calibration and as a standard for determining the size of the beam waist. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—To quantify the relative hydrodynamic dimensions of NCAM and PSA-NCAM, measurements were conducted using FCS. FCS measurements were performed with (RG)PSA-NCAM or (RG)NCAM. Nonlinear least squares fits of the data to Equation 2 (Fig. 2) yields an average diffusion coefficient of 26 ± 4 μm2/s for PSA-NCAM and 56 ± 3 μm2/s for the unmodified NCAM. Assuming a spherical shape, we estimated the hydrodynamic radius a using the Stokes-Einstein relation d = kBT/6πμa. Here d is the translational diffusion coefficient, kB is to the Boltzman constant, μ is the fluid viscosity, and a is the hydrodynamic radius. Using this relationship and the determined diffusion coefficients, the calculated ratio of the two hydrodynamic radii is aPSA-NCAM/aNCAM = 2.1 ± 0.3. PSA modification thus doubles the hydrodynamic radius of NCAM in 150 mm NaCl. Previous light scattering studies of PSA-NCAM extracted from neural cells gave a ratio of 1.5 (5Yang P. Major D. Yin X. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23039-23044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Density Determinations—The absolute surface densities of NCAM, PSA-NCAM, and cadherin were determined with isotopically labeled proteins. The surface density of 125I-labeled His6NCAM on membranes comprising 75 mol % NTA-TRIG-DLGE and 25 mol % 1,2-di-tridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was 2.4 ± 0.4 × 104 NCAM/μm2. These results are summarized in Table I. In studies performed with 125I-labeled His6PSA-NCAM, the measured surface density was somewhat higher at 4.2 ± 0.7 × 104 PSA-NCAM/μm2. In mixed monolayers adsorbed from a 1:1 solution of NCAM:cadherin, the NCAM surface density was 2 ± 0.6 × 104 NCAM/μm2, whereas the cadherin surface density was 2.4 ± 0.7 × 104 cadherin/μm2 (Table I). 125I measurements of monolayers adsorbed from a 1:1 PSA-NCAM:cadherin mixture yielded surface densities of 1 ± 0.5 × 104 PSA-NCAM/μm2 and 2.5 ± 0.6 × 104 cadherin/μm2. Thus, in a solution of equal protein concentrations, the ratios of the adsorbed proteins differ somewhat from those in solution.Table ISurface densities of immobilized proteinsProteinsMolar ratio of NCAM:cadherin in solutionMeasured surface density 104/μm2Immobilized NCAM cadherin ratioNCAMaQuantified with isotopically labeled protein2.4 ± 0.4CadherinaQuantified with isotopically labeled protein1.9 ± 0.5NCAM:cadherinaQuantified with isotopically labeled protein1:12 ± 0.6:2.4 ± 0.71:1.2NCAM:cadherinbQuantified by fluorescence imaging3:13.3 ± 0.6:1.1 ± 0.53:1PSA-NCAMaQuantified with isotopically labeled protein4.2 ± 0.5PSA-NCAM:cadherinaQuantified with isotopically labeled protein1:11.0 ± 0.5:2.5 ± 0.61:2.5PSA-NCAM:cadherinbQuantified by fluorescence imaging1:30.7 ± 0.5:2.6 ± 0.61:3.7PSA-NCAMcadherinbQuantified by fluorescence imaging1:80.34 ± 0.1:2.8 ± 0.31:8.2a Quantified with isotopically labeled proteinb Quantified by fluorescence imaging Open table in a new tab Fluorescence intensities were used to quantify the protein coverage at ratios other than 1:1. A comparison of the average intensities from (RG)NCAM on monolayers adsorbed from (RG)NCAM:cadherin solutions shows a 68 ± 3% increase in the fluorescence intensity when the solution composition was changed from 1:1 to 3:1 NCAM:cadherin. Scaling the intensity by the NCAM surface density determined from radiolabeling measurements (Table I), we calculate an NCAM density in the 3:1 monolayer of 3.3 ± 0.6 NCAM/μm2. The measurement was repeated with labeled cadherin. In this case the average fluorescence intensity decreased by 59 ± 3% when the relative amount of cadherin in solution decreased from 50 to 25 mol %. Using the known cadherin density on monolayers prepared from the 1:1 mixture, the calculated cadherin surface density is 1.1 ± 0.5 cadherin/μm2 (Table I). Fluorescence measurements with 1:1 and"

https://openalex.org/W2036894466,"Many G protein-coupled receptors form dimers in cells. However, underlying mechanisms are barely understood. We report here that intracellular factor XIIIA transglutaminase crosslinks agonist-induced AT1 receptor homodimers via glutamine315 in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the AT1 receptor. The crosslinked dimers displayed enhanced signaling and desensitization in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of angiotensin II release or of factor XIIIA activity prevented formation of crosslinked AT1 receptor dimers. In agreement with this finding, factor XIIIA-deficient individuals lacked crosslinked AT1 dimers. Elevated levels of crosslinked AT1 dimers were present on monocytes of patients with the common atherogenic risk factor hypertension and correlated with an enhanced angiotensin II-dependent monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Elevated levels of crosslinked AT1 receptor dimers on monocytes could sustain the process of atherogenesis, because inhibition of angiotensin II generation or of intracellular factor XIIIA activity suppressed the appearance of crosslinked AT1 receptors and symptoms of atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2059287499,"We investigated the involvement of ClC-3 chloride channels in endosomal acidification by measurement of endosomal pH and chloride concentration [Cl–] in control versus ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes and in control versus ClC-3-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Endosomes were labeled with pH or [Cl–]-sensing fluorescent transferrin (Tf), which targets to early/recycling endosomes, or α2-macroglobulin (α2M), which targets to late endosomes. In pulse label-chase experiments, [Cl–] was 19 mm just after internalization in α2M-labeled endosomes in primary cultures of hepatocytes from wild-type mice, increasing to 58 mm over 45 min, whereas pH decreased from 7.1 to 5.4. Endosomal acidification and [Cl–] accumulation were significantly impaired in hepatocytes from ClC-3 knock-out mice, with [Cl–] increasing from 16 to 43 mm and pH decreasing from 7.1 to 6.0. Acidification and Cl– accumulation were blocked by bafilomycin. In Tf-labeled endosomes, [Cl–] was 46 mm in wild-type versus 35 mm in ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes at 15 min after internalization, with corresponding pH of 6.1 versus 6.5. Approximately 4-fold increased Cl– conductance was found in α2M-labeled endosomes isolated from hepatocytes of wild-type versus ClC-3 null mice. In contrast, Golgi acidification was not impaired in ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes. In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing ClC-3A, endosomal acidification and [Cl–] accumulation were enhanced. [Cl–] in α2M-labeled endosomes was 42 mm (control) versus 53 mm (ClC-3A) at 45 min, with corresponding pH 5.8 versus 5.2; [Cl–] in Tf-labeled endosomes at 15 min was 37 mm (control) versus 49 mm (ClC-3A) with pH 6.3 versus 5.9. Our results provide direct evidence for involvement of ClC-3 in endosomal acidification by Cl– shunting of the interior-positive membrane potential created by the vacuolar H+ pump.

Our results provide direct evidence for involvement of ClC-3 in endosomal acidification by Cl– shunting of the interior-positive membrane potential created by the vacuolar H+ pump. Endosomal acidification is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including receptor and ligand sorting, vesicular fusion and budding, and protein degradation (1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 2Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 3Marshansky V. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2002; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Acidification is an active process in which H+ is pumped into the endosome lumen by a bafilomycin-sensitive vacuolar H+ ATPase. Charge balance requires the accompaniment of inward H+ movement by outward movement of cations such as K+ and/or inward movement of anions such as Cl–. Ion substitution, inhibitor, and endosomal pH/Cl– measurements suggest that Cl– is the principal ion in most cells responsible for shunting the interior-positive endosomal potential produced by active H+ entry (4Bae H.R.

Droogmans G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 177: 119-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In addition to ion conductances and pump rates, endosomal acidification depends on the magnitude of H+ leak, the buffer capacity and density of fixed charges in the endosome lumen, the pH and ionic content of cytoplasm, and the rate and nature of endosome fusion/budding events.It has been proposed without direct evidence that ClC-type Cl– channels are responsible for some or all endosomal Cl– conductance in many cell types, and hence they may be a major determinant of endosomal acidification. There is evidence for expression of at least five members of the ClC Cl– channel family (ClCs 3–7) in intracellular vesicles, including endosomes (reviewed in Ref. 11Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar).

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed by which defective endosomal Cl– conductance and acidification could produce these defects.The purpose of this study was to define the role of ClC-3 Cl– channels in endosomal acidification and Cl– accumulation. The kinetics of endosomal pH and [Cl–] were measured in intact cells using two models: primary cultures of hepatocytes from wild-type and ClC-3 knock-out mice, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; BAC, 10,10′-bis[3-carboxypropyl]-9,9′-biacridinium dinitrate; TMR, 5-(and 6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; Tf, transferrin; BAC-dextran-Tf-TMR, tetramethylrhodamine-labeled Tf conjugated to BAC-labeled dextran; BAC-dextran-α 2M-TMR, tetramethylrhodamine-labeled α2M conjugated to BAC-labeled dextran; CF, 6-carboxyfluorescein; [Cl–], Cl– concentration; CTb, cholera toxin B-subunit; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FITC-Tf-TMR, Tf labeled with fluorescein and TMR; FITC-α2M-TMR, α2M labeled with fluorescein and TMR; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; BAC, 10,10′-bis[3-carboxypropyl]-9,9′-biacridinium dinitrate; TMR, 5-(and 6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; Tf, transferrin; BAC-dextran-Tf-TMR, tetramethylrhodamine-labeled Tf conjugated to BAC-labeled dextran; BAC-dextran-α 2M-TMR, tetramethylrhodamine-labeled α2M conjugated to BAC-labeled dextran; CF, 6-carboxyfluorescein; [Cl–], Cl– concentration; CTb, cholera toxin B-subunit; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FITC-Tf-TMR, Tf labeled with fluorescein and TMR; FITC-α2M-TMR, α2M labeled with fluorescein and TMR; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. cells after transfection with control or ClC-3A-encoding cDNA.

The methodology for measurement of endosomal [Cl–] by ratio imaging fluorescence micros-copy was established and validated recently by the Verkman laboratory. Cells are imaged after pulse label-chase with fluorescent ligands (transferrin, Tf, or α2-macroglobulin, α2M) containing Cl–-sensitive and -insensitive chromophores (9Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We report here that ClC-3 deletion in mice remarkably impairs endosomal acidification and [Cl–] accumulation in hepatocytes and that transfection of ClC-3A into CHO cells enhances endosomal acidification and [Cl–] accumulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHepatocyte Cell Culture from Wild-type and ClC-3-deficient Mice— Wild-type and ClC-3 knock-out mice on a 129SV and C57BL/6 mixed genetic background were generated by targeted gene disruption as described previously (18Yoshikawa M. Uchida S. Ezaki J. Rai T. Hayama A. Kobayashi K. Kida Y. Noda M. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Marumo F. Kominami E. Sasaki S. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The ClC-3 knock-out mice were smaller than wild-type litter mates and had a higher mortality at 3–4 weeks. Hepatocytes were isolated by a modification of the two-step liver perfusion method (28Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5198) Google Scholar). After anesthesia, livers were perfused with liver perfusion medium (35 ml over 10 min) and then liver digest medium (35 ml over 10 min) (Invitrogen). Isolated hepatocytes were filtered, washed, and suspended in Williams' medium E (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were plated on 18-mm-diameter round coverslips that were coated with rat tail collagen (20 μg/cm2; BD Biosciences) and placed in a 5% CO2-95% air incubator at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with HepatoZYME-SFM (Invitrogen) after 3 h of culture. Measurements of pH and [Cl–] were done after 2–3 days of culture, at which time cells were nearly confluent.Construction of cDNA Encoding Mouse CLC-3—mRNA was isolated from mouse kidney (Oligo Direct mRNA kit; Qiagen) and cDNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) (SuperScript II preamplification kit; Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed with the cDNA template and primers designed from the mouse ClC-3A sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_007711). Primers were engineered with BglII and XbaI restriction sites: sense, 5′-GAAGATCTCAATGACAAATGG-AGGCAGCATTAATAGC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGAGTTGAACATT-ATTGAAGCGGGGTC-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into plasmid pcDNA6/Myc-His (Invitrogen), which introduces a c-Myc tag at the NH2 terminus. The full-length insert was confirmed by sequence analysis.CHO Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-K1 cells (ATCC number CCL-61) were grown in Ham's F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured on 18-mm-diameter round coverslips at 37 °C in 95% air-5% CO2 and used just prior to confluence.CHO-K1 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding ClC-3A in pcDNA6/Myc-His using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen). Measurements of endosomal pH and [Cl–] were done at 24–48 h after transfection.Fluorescent Ligands for Endosomal/Golgi [Cl–] and pH Measurements—Fluorescently labeled Tf, α2M, and cholera toxin B-subunit (CTb) were synthesized as described previously (9Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Dual chromophore Cl–-sensing conjugates contained the Cl–-sensitive green-fluorescing chromophore 10,10′-bis[3-carboxypropyl]-9,9′-biacridinium dinitrate (BAC) and the Cl–-insensitive chromophore tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). Ligands were labeled with TMR and conjugated 1:1 with BAC-dextran using an N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate disulfide linker (BAC-dextran-Tf-TMR for Tf conjugates, BAC-dextran-α2M-TMR for α2M conjugates). Dual chromophore pH-sensing conjugates were prepared by covalent conjugation with the pH-sensitive green-fluorescing chromophore FITC or 6-carboxyfluorescein (CF) and the pH-insensitive chromophore TMR (FITC-Tf-TMR for Tf conjugates, FITC-α2M-TMR for α2M conjugates). Previous studies established the purity, intracellular stability, and Cl–/pH-sensing characteristics of these fluorescent ligands (9Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Endosome Labeling and Kinetics of Endosomal [Cl–] and pH—Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 15 min at 37 °C before experiments. Labeling of cell surface receptors was done by incubation with Cl– or pH sensors (300 nm for Tf, 100 nm for α2M) for 20 min in PBS (containing 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2) at 4 °C. Coverslips were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and transferred to a precooled perfusion chamber containing ice-cold perfusate. Sets of BAC and TMR images (for Cl–) or FITC and TMR images (for pH) were acquired at specified times after rapid warming by perfusion at 37 °C. In some experiments, the perfusate contained bafilomycin A1 (200 nm).Golgi Compartment pH—Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with the Golgi pH indicator (200 nm) for 30 min in PBS at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and maintained at 37 °C for 45 min for Golgi targeting. CF and TMR images were acquired for pH determination.Fluorescence Microscopy and Data Analysis—Cells were imaged using a Leitz upright epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nipkow-wheel confocal attachment and 14-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera (24Sonawane N.D. Thiagarajah J.R. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5506-5513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was collected using a ×100 oil immersion objective (Nikon plan-apo, numerical aperture 1.4) and appropriate filter sets for BAC (excitation 470 ± 5 nm, dichroic 505 nm, emission 535 ± 20 nm), TMR, and FITC. Image analysis for computation of endosomal/Golgi [Cl–] and pH was done using custom software to compute area-integrated background-subtracted pixel intensities (9Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J.

Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and ClC-3 primary antibodies (Alamone Labs) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 555-conjugated IgG (Molecular Probes) or sheep anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated IgG (Sigma) secondary antibodies. For immunoblot analysis, c-Myc antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To study fluorescent probe localization, hepatocytes were labeled with Tf conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes), α2M-FITC (prepared according to Ref. 9Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or CTb-FITC (Sigma), chased at 37 °C, paraformaldehyde fixed, and immunostained using antibodies against EEA1 (early endosome-associated protein; BD Transduction Laboratories), Rab-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), giantin (Covance), or GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) or Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Golgi was also labeled with the fluorescent vital dye boron dipyrromethene difluoride TR-ceramide (5 μm ceramide-bovine serum albumin complex for 30 min at 37 °C; Molecular Probes) after CTb-FITC pulse-chase.Functional Analysis of Cl–Transport in Endosomes—Hepatocytes were freshly isolated as described above and washed three times in PBS. Cells were incubated with the α2M Cl– indicator (100 nm) for 45 min in PBS at 37 °C, washed three times, and then homogenized in ice-cold low Cl– buffer (120 mm KNO3, 20 mm NaNO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and debris. The supernatant containing fluorescently labeled endosomes was preincubated in low Cl– buffer in the absence or presence of valinomycin (10 μm) for at least 10 min at 37 °C. To drive Cl– influx, an isosmolar high Cl– buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was added to the stirred vesicle suspension to give 60 mm final [Cl–]. BAC fluorescence in the vesicle suspension was measured continuously using a Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter (excitation 470 ± 10 nm, emission 535 ± 10 nm).RESULTSImpaired Acidification and Cl–Accumulation in ClC-3-deficient Hepatocytes—Measurements were made in primary cultures of hepatocytes generated from wild-type and ClC-3 null mice. Fig. 1A shows a similar appearance of control and ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes by light microscopy. Fig. 1B shows co-localization of structures labeled with FITC-conjugated Tf (top) and α2M (bottom) with markers of early (EEA) and late (Rab7) endosomes, respectively. Fig. 1C shows fluorescence micrographs of hepatocytes after labeling with BAC-dextran-α2M-TMR and BAC-dextran-Tf-TMR at low temperature, followed by chase for 15 min (Tf) or 45 min (α2M) at 37 °C. A typical endosomal pattern was seen in the control and ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes, as found for internalization of Tf and α2M in many cell types (2Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 9Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Yamashiro D.J.

A membrane pattern was observed just after labeling, with progressive maturation over time (not shown). Cellular fluorescence was reduced to near zero when up to 100-fold excess unlabeled Tf or α2M was included in the labeling solution, confirming a receptor-mediated internalization mechanism.Fig. 2 summarizes the kinetics of endosomal acidification and Cl– accumulation in control and ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes. Initial pH in Tf-labeled endosomes was ∼7.2, decreasing over 15 min to 6.1 in control and 6.5 in ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes (Fig. 2A, left). Endosomal [Cl–] increased in parallel from an initial low value of 16 to 46 mm in control and 35 mm in ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes (Fig. 2A, right). As reported for CHO cells (9Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the low [Cl–] early after endocytosis is probably the consequence of a Donnan potential produced by surface negative charges that excludes Cl– during endosome formation. Endosomal acidification and Cl– accumulation were blocked by inclusion of the H+ pump inhibitor bafilomycin in the perfusate. Fig. 2B shows that pH in α2M-labeled endosomes at 45 min was reduced to 5.4 in control and 6.0 in ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes. Corresponding [Cl–] was increased to 58 mm in control and 43 mm in ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes. As found for early/recycling Tf-labeled endosomes, acidification and Cl– accumulation were bafilomycin-sensitive and significantly impaired in ClC-3 deficiency.Fig. 2Kinetics of endosomal pH and [Cl–]in Tf and α2M-labeled endosomes in hepatocytes from wild-type and ClC-3 null mice.

Fig. 3B (top) shows micrographs of hepatocytes after Golgi compartment staining, with CF (green) and TMR (red) fluorescence at 45 min after perfusion. Golgi pH, as determined by ratio imaging of the pH-sensitive CF chromophore and the pH-insensitive TMR chromophore, was not different in the ClC-3-deficient hepatocytes (Fig. 3B, bottom).Fig. 3Golgi pH measurement in hepatocytes from wild-type and ClC-3 null mice.A, fluorescence images showing colocalization of FITC-CTb (green) with the Golgi markers giantin, GM-130, and boron dipyrromethene difluoride TR-ceramide (red).

To determine the influence of expressed ClC-3A on endosomal acidification and Cl– accumulation, CHO cells were transfected with cDNA encoding c-Myc epitope-tagged mouse ClC-3A. Control cells were transfected with cDNA encoding c-Myc alone. Immunofluorescence with c-Myc and ClC-3 antibodies showed ClC-3A expression in the transfected CHO cells in an endosomal pattern (Fig. 4A). A diffuse cytoplasmic/nuclear pattern was seen for c-Myc expression in control cells. Immunoblot analysis showed the expected molecular size of 84 kDa for c-Myc-tagged ClC-3A in the transfected cells (Fig. 4A, bottom).

We have isolated the recently described human ric-3 cDNA and co-expressed it in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells with the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subunit. In addition to confirming the previously reported effect on α7 receptor expression in Xenopus oocytes we demonstrate that ric-3 promotes the formation of functional α7 receptors in mammalian cells, as determined by whole cell patch clamp recording and surface α-bungarotoxin binding. Upon application of 1 mm nicotine, currents were undetectable in HEK293 cells expressing only the α7 subunit. In contrast, co-expression of α7 and ric-3 cDNAs resulted in currents that averaged 42 pA/pF with kinetics similar to those observed in cells expressing endogenous α7 receptors. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that α7 and ric-3 proteins co-associate. Additionally, cell surface labeling with biotin revealed the presence of α7 protein on the plasma membrane of cells lacking ric-3, but surface α-bungarotoxin staining was only observed in cells co-expressing ric-3. Thus, ric-3 appears to be necessary for proper folding and/or assembly of α7 receptors in HEK293 cells.

The α7 receptor, for which α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) is a specific and high affinity antagonist, is one of the most abundant receptor subtypes in the mammalian brain (6Dominguez del Toro E. Juiz J.M.

In addition, α7 receptors have been implicated in a number of diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons disease (1Graham A.J. Martin-Ruiz C.M. Teaktong T. Ray M.A. Court J.A. Curr.

Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The reasons for poor heterologous surface expression in these cells are not well understood. Strategies to increase the number of functional receptors on the cell surface, including alteration of culture conditions (20Schroeder K.M. Wu J. Zhao L. Lukas R.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the generation of α7–5HT3 chimeras (21Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13974-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have met with some success. However, these strategies have resulted in only a modest increase in the number of functional receptors or the generation of non-native receptors, which are not ideal for drug discovery. Consequently, there is continued interest in identifying cellular factors that influence the expression of functional α7-containing nAChRs.A screen to identify genes necessary for nAChR function in Caenorhabditis elegans was recently described (23Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The search for suppressors of a dominant mutation in the nAChR subunit DEG-3 led to the identification of mutations in ric-3 (resistant to inhibitors of cholinesterase), and subsequent work demonstrated that ric-3 is required for the maturation of multiple nAChRs in oocytes (23Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recent work indicates that ric-3 is a member of a conserved gene family (24Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The human homolog (hric3) has diverse effects on co-expressed receptors, including the enhancement of α7-mediated whole cell current amplitudes as well as the reduction of α4β2 and α3β4 currents in oocytes. In this study we further examined the effects of hric3 on α7 receptors. In addition to demonstrating increased current amplitudes when co-expressed with α7 receptors in Xenopus oocytes, we show an association between α7 and hric3 proteins and demonstrate that hric3 promotes the formation of functional α7 receptors on the surface of mammalian cells. We also present evidence that α7 protein can be detected on the surface of HEK293 cells lacking hric3 and those levels do not change significantly in the presence of hric3, thus implicating hric3 as a mediator of folding and/or assembly of nAChR α7 receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Hric3 Coding Sequence—Sequences encoding the hric3 subunit were isolated by standard PCR techniques. Briefly, total adult brain RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used as the template for first strand cDNA synthesis using random hexamers and a Retroscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). An initial set of oligonucleotide primers was designed based on the hric3 sequences contained in the GenBank™ data base (GenBank™ accession number NM_024557). A sense strand 23-mer, TGCGACCACCGTGAGCAGTCATG (corresponds to hric3 nt –20 to 3), and an antisense 24-mer, CTGAGGAGAGAGAGGTCACC-TTGG (corresponds to hric3 nt 1142 to 1165), were used in amplification reactions with human adult brain cDNA and KOD Hotstart DNA polymerase (Novagen, Madison, WI). Reactions were performed at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min and an additional cycle of 72 °C for 7 min. A second sense strand 37-mer, CTGAATTCGCCACCATGGCGTACTCCACAGT-GCAGAG (contains hric3 nt 1 to 23 preceded by a ribosome binding site and an EcoRI restriction site), and a second antisense strand 34-mer, CTCTCGAGGAGTAATGGATACTTCAGACTGGCTG (contains hric3 nt 1111 to 1136 followed by an XhoI site), were used in a nested amplification reaction with the original PCR product. Following subcloning the reamplified PCR product was sequenced to confirm its identity.PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and first strand cDNA was synthesized as described above. Three primer pairs based on the cloned human sequence and two primer pairs based on partial rat sequences in GenBank (see Table I) were used in amplification reactions performed at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. For human templates, primers to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used in amplification reactions to show the presence of cDNA.Table IPCR primers used in distribution studiesPCR productForward primerReverse primerProduct sizentscNucleotides.HumanaPrimer sequences based on GenBank accession number AY326435.

Open table in a new tab DNA Constructs and Expression—For initial expression studies the full-length hric3 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). For biochemical studies a hric3 cDNA construct containing the hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence, YPYDVPDYAL, at its COOH terminus was generated by standard PCR techniques. A full-length human α7 sequence was reported previously (25Elliott K.J. Ellis S.B. Berckhan K.J. Urrutia A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Johnson E.C. Velicelebi G. Harpold M.M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The insert was subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) for transient expression studies and the BamHI-XhoI sites of pcDNA5/FRT for the development of a stable cell line using the flp-in system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A cell line stably expressing the nAChRα7 subunit, designated A7-3, was developed in HEK293 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. For some biochemical studies an α7 cDNA construct containing the HA epitope tag at a unique HindIII site (nt 82) near the amino terminus of the α7 coding sequence was generated. For transient expression studies in the A7-3 stable cell line cells plated in 10-cm dishes were transfected with a total of 24 μg of a hric3-containing expression plasmid or the bacterial expression plasmid pGEM7z. For experiments in which both α7 and hric3 were transiently expressed, HEK293 cells were transfected with α7 and hric3 DNAs in a 1:1 ratio. All transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and transfection efficiency, estimated to be 70–90%, monitored by expression of a green fluorescent protein construct. Cells were examined for protein expression 24–48 h after transfection.Western Blots—Proteins were separated on 8 or 4–20% gradient acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% dried milk followed by incubation with primary antibodies in PBS-T for 3 h at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used: α7 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:200 dilution, a HA epitope antibody (clone HA-7, Sigma) at a 1:10000 dilution, a p42 MAP kinase antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) at a 1:700 dilution, and a COX IV antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. The blots were washed with PBS-T (3 to 5 changes) followed by incubation for 1 h with a 1:150,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-goat Ig (Sigma) for α7 detection, a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences) for p42 MAP kinase detection, or with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Biosciences) for HA epitope and COX IV detection. Filters were subsequently washed with PBS-T (8 changes) and developed with the Lumi-Glo chemiluminescence substrate reagent (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD).Immunoprecipitations—Total cell membranes were prepared as described elsewhere (26Hans M. Luvisetto S. Williams M.E. Spagnolo M. Urrutia A. Tottene A. Brust P.F. Johnson E.C. Harpold M.M. Stauderman K.A. Pietrobon D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane preparation, solubilization, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Membranes were solubilized in PBS containing 1.0% Triton X-100 and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant removed to a new tube. To immunoprecipitate the α7 subunit, 5 μgof α7-specific antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubated overnight. To immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged hric3 subunit 50 μl of HA affinity gel (Sigma) was added and incubated overnight. Samples were washed 4 times with 1 ml of chilled PBS containing protease inhibitors, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot as described above.Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells on tissue culture dishes were washed 3 times with chilled PBS and incubated in the same buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 20 min at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by washing 3 times with chilled PBS containing 100 mm glycine. Cells were lysed and proteins were solubilized in PBS, 1% Triton X-100. Approximately 1 mg of solubilized protein was incubated with 70 μl of neutravidin-agarose (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4 times and bound protein was eluted by heating in SDS-PAGE buffer. Samples were electrophoresed and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies to α7, HA epitope tag, p42 MAP kinase, and COX IV.Immunofluorescence Staining—Mammalian cells expressing nAChR α7 alone, hric3 alone, or nAChR α7 + hric3 were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in a 24-well plate at a density of ∼1 to 2 × 105 cells/12-mm coverslip. Live, intact cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled α-Bgt (Molecular Probes) at a 1:500 dilution and a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma) at a 1:50 dilution. The secondary antibody was an Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (Molecular Probes) used at a 1:400 dilution. The primary antibody and α-Bgt were added directly to the growth media or diluted in PBS/bovine serum albumin and allowed to react with the cells for 1 h. Cells were rinsed 3 times and incubated with the second antibody for 30 min. Cells were rinsed 4 times with 1× PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After a final wash with 1× PBS, coverslips were dried and mounted on glass slides for visualization with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. In other experiments cells were fixed and permeabilized prior to Ab incubations.HEK293 Electrophysiology—Transient transfections for electrophysiological characterization included pCMVCD4, a human CD4+ expression plasmid, to permit the identification of transfected cells. Prior to recording, cells were washed with mammalian Ringer's solution, incubated for ∼10 min in a solution containing a 1/1000 dilution of M-450 CD4+ Dynabeads (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) and rewashed with mammalian Ringer's solution to remove excess beads. Expression of functional α7 receptors in transfected cells was evaluated 24–48 h following transfection using the whole cell patch clamp technique. All recordings were performed on single cells at room temperature (19–24 °C). Whole cell currents were recorded using an EPC-9 (HEKA elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) patch clamp amplifier, low-pass filtered at 1 kHz (–3 dB, 8-pole Bessel filter), and digitized at a rate of 10 kHz, unless otherwise stated. Pipettes were manufactured from borosilicate glass (TW150, WPI, Sarasota, FL) and had a resistance of 1.1–2.0 MΩ when filled with internal solution. Series resistances were 2–4 MΩ prior to compensation. The cell capacitance range was 5.7 to 13.6 pF. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 110 Tris phosphate dibasic, 28 Tris, 11 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl2, 4 ATP, 2 MgCl2 (pH 7.3, adjusted with Tris). The external solution contained (in mm): 120 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 25 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, adjusted with Tris). The membrane potential of individual HEK293 cells was held at –90 mV.Nicotine was obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions were prepared in water and stored at –20 °C. Nicotine was dissolved in the external solution and applied for 300 ms using a fast application system consisting of a triple-barrel glass pipette attached to an electromechanical switching device (piezo-electric drive, Winston Electronics, Millbrae, CA). The speed of solution exchange between control and nicotine-containing solution, measured as the open-tip response, displayed a time constant of 0.7 ms, with a steady state reached in less than 1.5 ms.Xenopus Oocyte Electrophysiology—Sections of ovary were surgically isolated from anesthetized Xenopus frogs (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI). Mature females were anesthetized by immersion in a 0.1% tricaine methanesulfonate solution and oocytes were surgically removed. The follicular cell layer was enzymatically removed by gentle shaking with collagenase (Worthington, Type II, 1.7 mg/ml for 90 min, then Sigma, Type II, 1.7 mg/ml for 30 min) in Ca2+-free Barth's solution. Oocyte injection and incubation methods used in this work were as previously reported (27Chavez-Noriega L.E. Crona J.H. Washburn M.S. Urrutia A. Elliott K.J. Johnson E.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 346-356PubMed Google Scholar), with minor changes as indicated below. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl containing 25 ng of α7 in vitro synthesized mRNA. In vitro transcribed hric3 RNA was injected in a 1:1 ratio when co-injected with rat or human α7. Following injection, oocytes were incubated at 16–19 °C for 4–7 days in Oocyte Ringer-3 medium containing 50% L-15 medium, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 25 μg/ml tetracycline, 4 mm glutamine, and 30 mm Na-HEPES (all from Invitrogen), with pH adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH. The extracellular recording solution (standard Ringer's) contained (in mm): NaCl (115), KCl (2.5), BaCl2 (1.8), HEPES (10Martin L.F. Kem W.R. Freedman R. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2004; 174: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), atropine (0.001), pH 7.3. Functional expression was examined using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique; membrane potential was held at –70 mV.Concentration-response curves were obtained by normalizing the current responses to varying concentrations of ACh to the maximal response observed to saturating concentrations of ACh in each oocyte. Curves were fitted by nonlinear regression to the Hill equation (27Chavez-Noriega L.E. Crona J.H. Washburn M.S. Urrutia A. Elliott K.J. Johnson E.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 346-356PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical significance between groups was assessed with a Student's t test (SigmaStat, SPSS Inc.).RESULTSHric3 mRNA Is Present in Neuronal Cells and Absent in HEK293 Cells—We amplified and subcloned the hric3 coding sequence from human adult brain RNA using primers based on sequence in the GenBank data base. Sequence analysis indicates that the coding sequence isolated here is identical to GenBank™ accession number AY326435 except for the absence of a single serine residue (Ser-173 in AY326435). This polymorphism was described previously (24Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).We used PCR to examine hric3 mRNA expression in several cell lines. Primers directed to portions of the hric3 coding sequence (Table I, Fig. 1A) were used to detect transcripts using standard PCR assays. As shown in Fig. 1B, we detected hric3 transcripts in brain tissue and the SH-SY5Y cell line, a human neuronal cell line known to express endogenous α7 receptors (28Peng X. Katz M. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 546-554PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, hric3 transcripts were not detected in HEK293 cells with primer pairs covering the majority of the hric3 coding sequence. A primer pair covering the extreme 3′ end of the coding sequence generated low, but detectable, levels of a fragment of the expected size from HEK293 cells, indicating that low levels of at least a portion of the hric3 transcript may be present in these cells.We extended our analyses to determine whether ric-3 is expressed in additional cell lines known to express functional α7 receptors. Primers homologous to the rat ric-3 subunit (Table I, Fig. 1C) were again used in standard PCR assays using cDNA generated from rat brain, PC12, and GH4C1 cells. In all cases PCR products of the expected size were detected (Fig. 1D), indicating the presence of ric-3 transcripts in these cell lines.α7 Protein Is Detected on the Surface of HEK293 Cells Lacking Hric3—We developed a HEK-based stable cell line constitutively expressing the α7 subunit (A7-3 cells) using the flp-in system. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, A7-3 cells express α7 protein with a pattern similar to that observed in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the human α7 subunit. The presence of the doublet at ∼60 kDa observed in HEK293 cells was similar to the pattern observed with human recombinant α7 expressed in GH4C1 cells 2M. E. Williams, B. O. Claeps, A. Rush, and L. E. Chavez-Noriega, unpublished observations. and may reflect differential posttranslational processing of the α7 protein. Despite the presence of α7 protein, patch clamp studies failed to identify detectable currents through α7 channels (Fig. 7).Fig. 2Immunoblot analysis of α7 expression in HEK293 cells.A, total α7 expression in HEK293 cells. Total membrane proteins (10 μg/lane) from transiently transfected HEK293 cells and an HEK293-based stable cell line were separated on an 8% gel and immunostained with polyclonal antisera specific for the α7 subunit. B, cell surface expression of the α7 subunit. Biotinylated surface proteins from whole cells were isolated with neutravidin-linked beads and separated on a 4–20% gradient gel. After protein transfer to nitrocellulose the filter was cut horizontally at the 50-kDa marker and below the 36-kDa marker to allow identification of multiple proteins in the same lane. The upper filter was immunostained with α7 antisera, the middle filter was immunostained with p42 MAP kinase antisera, and the lower filter was immunostained with a COX IV mAb. The subunits are denoted with arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Whole cell currents in A7-3 cells co-expressing α7 and hric3. Representative traces of current responses to 1 mm ACh applied during the time indicated by the horizontal bar in two different cells mock transfected (black trace) or transfected with hric3 (gray trace). Traces are typical currents observed at a holding potential of –90 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined if the lack of functional expression was because of lack of surface expression of α7 receptors. We biotinylated cell-surface proteins and isolated them by binding to streptavidin-linked agarose beads. The presence of α7 protein was subsequently detected by Western blot analysis. Fig. 2B shows that in the A7-3 cell line a detectable, albeit a proportionally low, level of α7 protein was biotinylated and pulled down with streptavidin beads, indicating its presence on the cell surface. To exclude the possibility of intracellular protein contamination, we also looked for the presence of COX IV, an integral mitochondrial membrane protein, and p42 MAP kinase, a cytosolic protein, in the biotinylation experiment. As demonstrated in Fig. 2B, neither COX IV nor p42 MAP kinase were detected, consistent with the biotinylation of only cell-surface proteins.α7 and Hric3 Proteins Co-associate—To determine whether hric3 can form a stable complex with the human α7 subunit we performed coimmunoprecipitations using untransfected A7-3 cells, A7-3 cells transiently expressing the hric3-HA fusion protein, or HEK293 cells transiently expressing the hric3-HA protein. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with subunit-specific antibodies from detergent extracts of total membrane fractions. The antibody to the HA epitope tag immunoprecipitated both the α7 subunit and the hric3-HA fusion protein from hric3-transfected A7-3 cells (Fig. 3, samples 1 and 5). There was no signal when using the HA epitope antibody with untransfected A7-3 cell extracts (samples 2 and 6). Conversely, the α7-specific antibody immunoprecipitated both the α7 and hric3 subunits from hric3-transfected A7-3 cells (samples 3 and 7). There was no signal from hric3-transfected HEK293 cells (samples 4 and 8). These results demonstrate that α7 and hric3 are able to form a stable complex in HEK293 cells.Fig. 3Physical association of α7 and hric3 subunits. Anti-α7 or anti-HA epitope antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate proteins from Triton-solubilized cell membrane fractions. For hric3 the immunoprecipitatio"

Nectins recruit and activate c-Src at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. c-Src then activates Cdc42 through FRG, a Cdc42-GDP/GTP exchange factor. We showed here that Rap1 small G protein was involved in the nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 and formation of AJs. Rap1 was recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites and locally activated through the c-Src-Crk-C3G signaling there. The activation of either c-Src or Rap1 alone was insufficient for and the activation of both molecules was essential for the activation of FRG. The activation of Rap1 was not necessary for the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation or recruitment of FRG. The inhibition of the Crk, C3G, or Rap1 signaling reduced the formation of AJs. These results indicate that Rap1 is activated by nectins through the c-Src-Crk-C3G signaling and involved in the nectin-induced, c-Src- and FRG-mediated activation of Cdc42 and formation of AJs.

Small G proteins comprise a superfamily consisting of the Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf/Sar, and Ran families and act as molecular switches to control a range of cell functions in all eukaryotic cells (1Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol.

They cycle between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms by regulators, and the GTP-bound form interacts with downstream effectors (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Our group and two other groups have independently identified Rap1 small G protein as the closest relative of Ras small G protein and named it Smg p21, Rap1, and Krev-1 (3Kawata M. Matsui Y. Kondo J.

Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), whereas we have shown that Rap1/Smg p21 stimulates DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells (6Yoshida Y. Kawata M. Miura Y. Musha T. Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and activates B-Raf protein kinase (7Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Rap1 has subsequently been shown to be involved in many cell functions, including integrin-mediated cell adhesion, exocytosis, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity (8Zhu J.J. Qin Y. Zhao M. Aelst VanL. Malinow R. Cell. 2002; 110: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 9Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

(11Knox A.L. Brown N.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, it still remains largely unknown how Rap1 is activated and regulates various cell functions including the formation of cell-cell AJs. A striking feature of small G proteins is the extensive crosstalk and cooperation between small G proteins (1Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 12Matozaki T. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of cross-talk between the Ras and Rho family members has been most clearly established in the budding process of the yeast: Bud1, a Rap-like small G protein related to mammalian Rap1, is activated at a positional landmark and defines the position of the new bud (1Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 9Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Activated Bud1 recruits and likely activates Cdc24, a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42 small G protein, resulting in the activation of Cdc42 (15Gulli M.P. Peter M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cdc42 recruits the actin cytoskeleton to the bud site and causes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through Rho1 small G protein (15Gulli M.P. Peter M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Tanaka K. Takai Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although we have previously shown that mammalian Rap1 substitutes for Bud1 (13Ruggieri R. Bender A. Matsui Y. Powers S. Takai Y. Pringle J.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it remains unknown whether the small G protein cascade of Rap1 controlling Cdc42 is functionally conserved from yeast to mammals. Nectins are Ca2+-independent Ig-like cell-cell adhesion molecules that form AJs cooperatively with cadherins (17Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 19Shimizu K. Takai Y. J.

Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2004: 345-372Google Scholar). Nectins comprise a family of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. All nectins form homo-cis-dimers and then homo- and hetero-trans-dimers, causing cell-cell adhesion. Nectins first form cell-cell contacts and recruit cadherins to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites, causing the formation of AJs. In addition, nectins induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins. Cdc42 activated in this way is likely to induce the formation of filopodia and to increase the number of cell-cell contact sites at the initial stage of the formation of AJs. On the other hand, Rac activated in this way induces the formation of lamellipodia that efficiently expands the cell-cell adhesion between filopodia, acting like a “zipper.” In epithelial cells, nectins furthermore recruit first junctional adhesion molecules and then claudins to the apical side of AJs, resulting in the formation of tight junctions (TJs). The cell polarity protein complex of Par-3, atypical protein kinase C, and Par-6 is essential for the formation of TJs, and Cdc42 induces the activation of this complex by binding to Par-6 (21Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown how Cdc42 is activated in this process. We have recently found that nectins directly bind Par-3, raising the possibility that Cdc42 activated by the action of nectins is involved in the activation of this cell polarity protein complex (22Takekuni K. Ikeda W. Fujito T. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5497-5500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdc42 and Rac activated by the action of nectins are likely to play important roles in the formation of cell-cell junctions and cell polarity. Extending these earlier observations, we have recently found that c-Src is recruited and activated by nectins at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites and that c-Src activated in this way then tyrosine phosphorylates and activates FRG, a Cdc42-GEF, resulting in the activation of Cdc42 (23Fukuhara T.

Along this line, we examined here whether Rap1 is involved in the nectin-induced, c-Src- and FRG-mediated activation of Cdc42 and formation of AJs. Plasmid Constructions and Protein Purification—V12Rap1B, in which a glycine residue at amino acid 12 of bovine Rap1B was replaced by a valine (V), was a constitutively active mutant of Rap1 and prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

After a 24-h transfection, the cells were replated on the dishes coated with 50 μg/ml Nef-3 or 50 μg/ml IgG. The cells were then imaged with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera, Cool-SNAP HQ (Roper Scientific), controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). For dual emission ratio imaging, we used a 440AF21 excitation filter, a 455DRLP dichroic mirror, and two emission filters, 480AF30 for CFP and 535AF25 for YFP (Omega Optical Inc.). The cells were illuminated with a 75-watt xenon lamp through a 6% neutral density filter (Omega Optical Inc.) and a 60× oil immersion objective lens. Exposure times for 3 × 3 binning were 200 ms to obtain images of CFP and YFP and 50 ms to obtain images of a differential interference contrast. After background subtraction, the ratio image of YFP/CFP was created with the MetaMorph software and used to represent FRET efficiency.

Briefly nectin-1-L cells were seeded on each well of a 24-well plate and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 12 h. Latex-sulfate microbeads coated with the recombinant extracellular fragment of nectin-3 fused to the human IgG (Nef-3) or IgG were added to each well. After a 30-min incubation, the cells were fixed and immunostained. Pull-down Assay for Small G Proteins—The pull-down assay was performed as described previously (23Fukuhara T. Shimizu K.

In brief, 26 μg of Nef-3 or human IgG (Fc-specific) (Sigma) was clustered using 9 μg of the anti-human IgG pAb (Sigma) in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. Nectin-1-L cells (5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were transiently transfected with the plasmid of Rap1GAP and cultured for 8 h. After a 16-h serum starvation, the medium was replaced by 1 ml of DMEM containing clustered Nef-3 or IgG, and the cells were incubated for the indicated periods of time. The cells were then washed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate) containing 10 μg GST fusion proteins, GST-RalGDS-RBD for Rap1, or GST-PAK-CRIB for Cdc42 and Rac, and incubated at 2 °C for 30 min. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 0 °C for 5 min and incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 2 °C for 1 h. After the beads were washed with Buffer A, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Assay for Immunoprecipitation and GEF Activity—The immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (23Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T.

In brief, nectin-1-L cells (1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with the combination of pEFBOS-Flag-FRG, pcDNA-c-Src, pEGFP, pEGFPV12Rap1, or pEGFP-Rap1GAP. After an 8-h culture, the cells were serum-starved for 16 h. The medium was then replaced by 3 ml of DMEM containing clustered Nef-3 or IgG, and the cells were incubated for the indicated periods of time. The cells were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, lysed in 0.5 ml of Buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% TritonX-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate/sodium, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, incubated with 5 μl of the anti-FLAG mAb at 4 °C for 1 h, and further incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. After the incubation, the beads were washed with Buffer B. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The GEF activity was assayed as described previously (31Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16626-16634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of [35S]GTPγS to Cdc42 (5 pmol) was assayed by measuring the radioactivity of [35S]GTPγS bound to Cdc42 after incubation for the indicated periods of time in the presence of each immunoprecipitant from the cells treated with clustered Nef-3 or IgG for 30 min. Assay for Cell-Cell Adhesion—Cell-cell adhesion of nectin-1-MDCK cells transiently overexpressing Flag-CrkI-W169L, C3G-dCD, Myc-Rap1GAP, GFP-V12Cdc42, GFP, or an empty vector was assayed as described previously (23Fukuhara T.

Briefly the cells transfected with the plasmid were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. After the culture, the cells were washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in DMEM (at a final concentration of 2 mm Ca2+) for 1 h. The medium was replaced by DMEM containing 5 mm EGTA (at a final concentration of 2 μm Ca2+), and then the cells were incubated for 2 h. After the incubation, the cells were washed with DMEM and further incubated in DMEM (at a final concentration of 2 mm Ca2+) for 2 h. The cells were fixed and immunostained with the anti-E-cadherin or anti-Myc mAbs. Necessity of Rap1 for the Nectin-induced Activation of Cdc42 and Rac—Rap1GAP has been shown to hydrolyze GTP bound to Rap1 and to inactivate it (32Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We first examined by using Rap1GAP whether Rap1 is involved in the nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 and Rac. We have previously shown by using Nef-3 that nectins induce the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia through the respective activation of Cdc42 and Rac in nectin-1-L and nectin-1-MDCK cells (23Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nectin-1-L cells were transfected with the plasmid of GFP-Rap1GAP or GFP as a control. After a 24-h culture, the cells were cultured on the Nef-3-coated coverslips. Neither filopodia nor lamellipodia were formed in nectin-1-L cells transiently overexpressing GFP-Rap1GAP, whereas these protrusions were markedly formed in nectin-1-L cells transiently overexpressing GFP (Fig. 1A). When nectin-1-L cells transiently overexpressing GFPRap1GAP or GFP were cultured on the IgG-coated coverslips as a control, neither filopodia nor lamellipodia were formed. The essentially same results were obtained for nectin-1-MDCK cells that were transiently overexpressing GFP-Rap1GAP or GFP as a control (data not shown). We then confirmed by the pull-down assay using GST-PAK-CRIB that Rap1GAP inhibited the Nef-3-induced activation of Cdc42 and Rac in nectin-1-L cells (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that Rap1 is necessary for the nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 and Rac and the subsequent formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively. Rap1 as an Upstream Regulator of Cdc42 and Rac and a Downstream Regulator of c-Src—If Rap1 functions upstream of Cdc42 and Rac, overexpression of V12Cdc42 and V12Rac1 in nectin-1-L cells expressing Rap1GAP would suppress the inhibitory effect of Rap1GAP on the Nef-3-induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. To test this possibility, nectin-1-L cells transiently co-expressing GFP-V12Cdc42, GFP-V12Rac1, or GFP as a control with Myc-Rap1GAP were cultured on the Nef-3-coated coverslips. Neither filopodia nor lamellipodia were formed in the cells co-expressing GFP with Myc-Rap1GAP, whereas both protrusions were formed in the cells expressing GFP alone as described above (Fig. 2 and see also Fig. 1A). Both filopodia and lamellipodia were formed to large and moderate extents, respectively, in the cells co-expressing GFP-V12Cdc42 with Myc-Rap1GAP, whereas lamellipodia were mainly formed to a large extent in the cells co-expressing GFP-V12Rac1 with Myc-Rap1GAP. We have previously shown that the activation of Cdc42 is necessary, but not sufficient, for the activation of Rac in nectin-1-L cells and that the activation of Rac is not necessary for the activation of Cdc42 (23Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that Rap1 functions upstream of Cdc42 and Rac in the nectin-induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. We have previously shown that c-Src functions downstream of nectins and upstream of Cdc42 and Rac (23Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To clarify that Rap1 functions downstream of c-Src, we examined whether the inhibitory effect of Rap1GAP on the Nef-3-induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia in nectin-1-L cells was not suppressed by co-expression of c-Src-CA. When nectin-1-L cells co-expressing Myc-Rap1GAP with c-Src-CA were cultured on the Nef-3-coated coverslips, neither filopodia nor lamellipodia were formed (Fig. 2). In addition, c-Src-CA enhanced the Nef-3-induced activation of Rap1 in nectin-1-L cells as estimated by the pull-down assay for Rap1 using the GST-RalGDS-RBD (see Fig. 4A, c). These results indicate that Rap1 functions downstream of c-Src. Insufficiency of the Activation of Rap1 Alone for the Nectin-induced Activation of Cdc42 and Rac—We have previously shown that PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinases, inhibits the Nef-3-induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia (23Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We examined whether the activation of Rap1 alone is sufficient for the Nef-3-induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. Nectin-1-L cells expressing GFP-V12Rap1 or GFP as a control were cultured on the Nef-3-coated coverslips in the presence of PP2 or PP3, an inactive analogue of PP2. In nectin-1-L cells expressing GFP, filopodia and lamellipodia were markedly formed in the presence of PP3, whereas both protrusions were negligibly formed in the presence of PP2 (Fig. 3A). This inhibitory effect of PP2 on the Nef-3-induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia was confirmed by SU6656, another inhibitor of Src family kinases (34Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of PP2 was not rescued by GFP-V12Rap1 or C3G-CA, a constitutively active mutant of Rap1-GEF (24Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S.

https://openalex.org/W2033085629,"The ability of a cell to move requires the asymmetrical organization of cellular activities. To investigate polarized cellular activity in moving endothelial cells, human endothelial cells were incubated in a Dunn chamber to allow migration toward vascular endothelial growth factor. Immunofluorescent staining with a specific antibody against caveolin-1 revealed that caveolin-1 was concentrated at the rear of moving cells. Similarly, monolayer scraping to induce random cell walk resulted in relocation of caveolin-1 to the cell rear. These results suggest that posterior polarization of caveolin-1 is a common feature both for chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Dual immunofluorescent labeling showed that, during cell spreading, caveolin-1 was compacted in the cell center and excluded from nascent focal contacts along the circular lamellipodium, as revealed by integrin β1 and FAK staining. When cells were migrating, integrin β1 and FAK appeared at polarized lamellipodia, whereas caveolin-1 was found at the posterior of moving cells. Notably, wherever caveolin-1 was polarized, there was a conspicuous absence of lamellipod protrusion. Transmission electron microscopy showed that caveolae, similar to their marker caveolin-1, were located at the cell center during cell spreading or at the cell rear during cell migration. In contrast to its unphosphorylated form, tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1, upon fibronectin stimulation, was associated with the focal complex molecule phosphopaxillin along the lamellipodia of moving cells. Thus, unphosphorylated and phosphorylated caveolin-1 were located at opposite poles during cell migration. Importantly, loss of caveolin-1 polarity by targeted down-regulation of the protein prevented cell polarization and directional movement.

Endothelial cell migration is a key step toward angiogenesis, a process that is required in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, such as embryonic development, wound healing, tissue regeneration, and tumor growth and metastasis. A clear understanding of how endothelial cells sense chemoattractants, organize signaling asymmetry, and make a directional movement is of pivotal importance in the biology of normal cells, as well as tumor angiogenesis. Like other types of crawling cells, migrating endothelial cells acquire a series of spatially polarized features. The front of a migrating cell generates protrusive force associated with lamellipod or filopod protrusion coupled with the development of new cell adhesions to the extracellular substrates. Cell contractility is required to allow the retraction of the body and rear of the cell. Apart from the surface features, such as lamellipodia and microspikes, relatively little is known about the “directional sensing” machinery that orients locomotion machinery in endothelial cells. Caveolae (also termed plasmalemmal vesicles) are specialized microdomains on the plasma membrane with a size of 50–100 nm (1Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). In addition to transcytosis and endocytosis, a good body of evidence has shown that caveolae compartmentalize and integrate signaling events at the cell surface (2Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These observations suggest a potential role of caveolae in mediating signal transduction involved in cell migration. The major structural proteins of caveolae are the caveolins. Four caveolins encoded by three different genes have been identified. Endothelial cells abundantly express caveolin-1 and -2 (but not caveolin-3, which is muscle-specific) (10Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z-L. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 interacts with a number of signaling proteins, including Src family kinases, Gα subunits, H-Ras, protein kinase C, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, PI 3-kinase, integrins, and epidermal growth factor receptor (11Okamoto T.

In general, interaction between caveolin via the caveolin scaffolding domain and signaling proteins leads to inactivation of the target proteins (11Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolin may function as an endogenous negative regulator of many signaling molecules. Given this view, one would predict that down-regulation of caveolins may lead to an increase in basal activity of signaling pathways and subsequent cellular activity, such as cell motility. In accordance with this, an attractive hypothesis would be that mere translocation of caveolin (i.e. caveolin polarization), without a substantial change in the expression level, would reinforce an inhibitory effect on one part of the cell (i.e. the cell rear) but release its inhibitory activity on the other side (i.e. the leading edge). This hypothesis is supported by recent studies showing caveolae and caveolin-1 asymmetry during cell migration (15Isshiki M. Ando J. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 475-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Parat M.O. Anand-Apte B. Fox P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Folkman J. Semin.

However, whether caveolin-1 polarity affects endothelial cell lamellipod protrusion and migration is not known. In the present study, we demonstrated that caveolin-1 and caveolae were excluded from the leading edge and directed toward the rear of migrating cells. Interestingly, a subpopulation of caveolin-1 that was phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 specifically moved to focal adhesions at the leading edge of migrating cells. Importantly, loss of caveolin-1 polarity by targeted knockdown of the protein prevented endothelial cell polarization and impeded cell directional movement. Materials—Reagents and other supplies were obtained from the following commercial sources: antibodies against caveolin-1, phosphocaveolin-1, and FAK from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Phalloidin-TRITC and fibronectin were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against integrin β1, green fluorescent protein, and c-Myc were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat serum, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Antibodies against paxillin, phosphopaxillin (pTyr-31), and phospho-FAK (pTyr-397) were obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Slow-Fade reagent was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Cell Culture—Primary cultured endothelial cells from the human umbilical vein (HUVECs) were obtained as described previously (19Ashton A.W. Yokota R. John G. Zhao S. Suadicani S.O. Spray D.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35562-35570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) from consenting healthy, term patients according to institutional guidelines. HUVECs were grown in Medium 199 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated human serum, 20% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum and endothelial cell growth supplement. Construction of siRNA—The sequence (AAGAGCTTCCTGATTGAGATT) was selected as the targeting region of caveolin-1, which corresponds to nucleotides 403–423 of the coding region of human caveolin-1 (GenBank™ accession number BC009685). Caveolin-1 siRNA primers (5′-AATCTCAATCAGGAAGCTCTT-3′ and 5′-GAGCTTCCTGATTGAGATTTT-3′) were used for synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Control siRNA was also obtained from Qiagen. The target sequence of the control siRNA was the DNA sequence AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT, which contains a 16-base overlap with Thermotoga maritimia (GenBank™ accession number AE001709) section 21 of 136 of the complete genome, with no other BLAST matches. The level of caveolin-1 expression was determined by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry using specific antibody against caveolin-1. The specific down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression by caveolin-1 siRNA was assessed using control siRNA. Transfection of Endothelial Cells with siRNA—Endothelial cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. For each transfection, 1.0 μg of dsRNA was diluted into 200 μl of serum-free medium in a tube. In another tube, 6 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) were mixed with 54 μl of serum-free medium. The two solutions were combined, mixed gently, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by the addition of 400 μl of serum-free medium. The cells were washed once with serum-free medium and incubated with dsRNA mixtures or Oligofectamine medium (mock transfection) for 4 h at 37°Cina humidified CO2 incubator. At the end of incubation, 2 ml of growth medium were added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 20 h. The medium was replaced with growth medium 24 h after transfection. Forty-eight h post-transfection (which resulted in an ∼80% reduction in caveolin-1 level), the cells were used for a migration assay. Scratch Motility Assay—Confluent endothelial cells were wounded by scraping of the monolayer with a 200-μl pipette tip (20Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28704-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cultures were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with growth medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 h to allow migration toward the gap and then fixed, permeabilized, and stained for caveolin-1. Dunn Chamber Assay—Endothelial cells were seeded on fibronectincoated coverslips and starved for 24 h prior to assay. To set up gradient experiments, both concentric wells of the chamber were filled with starvation medium (medium 199 with 0.5% fetal bovine serum), and a coverslip seeded with cells was inverted onto the chamber in an offset position leaving a narrow slit at one edge for refilling the outer well. The coverslip was sealed in place using hot wax mixture around all the edges except for the filling slit. The medium of the outer well was drained and replaced with medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml VEGF. The slit was then sealed with hot wax mixture. When the inner circular well of the chamber was filled with control medium and the outer annular well with medium containing chemoattractant, a radially directed linear diffusion gradient was established in the diffusion gap within 10–30 min, which had a half-life of 10–30 h (21Zicha D. Dunn G.A. Brown A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 769-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For control experiments in which cells were subjected to uniform concentrations of chemoattractant, both wells were filled with medium containing VEGF (10 ng/ml). At the end of each migration assay, the coverslip was carefully removed from the Dunn chamber, and the cells were processed for immunocytochemistry analysis. Immunocytochemistry—Endothelial cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% goat serum, and stained with specific antibody against caveolin-1 or other signaling molecules. Bound primary antibodies were detected using fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immunostained cells were mounted in the presence of Slow-Fade reagent. Immunostaining was visualized and photographed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins of the subcellular fractions were solubilized with SDS sample buffer containing 0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol in double-distilled water. After boiling for 4 min, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (5–15% gradient gels) and electro-transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Endothelial cells were either sparsely seeded onto gelatin-coated plates for 1 h or seeded near confluence, scratched multiply with a 200-μl pipette tip, and incubated to allow cell migration. The cells were then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and scraped into a microcentrifuge tube. The cells were pelleted and post-fixed with osmium tetroxide. After fixation, the cells were infiltrated with a propylene oxide/epon mixture and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Thin sections of samples were examined under a JEOL 1220 transmission electron microscope. On randomly taken photographs, the number of caveolae at the leading edge and the cell center of spreading cells or at the leading edge and the cell posterior of migrating cells was determined. Caveolin-1 Is Located at the Rear of Migrating Cells—Previous studies have shown that caveolin-1 displays polarization in migrating cells. For instance, caveolin-1 accumulated at the trailing edge of scratch-induced migrating bovine aortic endothelial cells or shear stress-stimulated bovine aortic endothelial cells (15Isshiki M. Ando J. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 475-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Parat M.O. Anand-Apte B. Fox P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On the other hand, caveolin-1 was concentrated at the leading edge of fibroblast growth factor-stimulated migrating bovine aortic endothelial cells (16Parat M.O. Anand-Apte B. Fox P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To assess whether the discrepancy of caveolin-1 polarization resulted from chemotactic gradient, we employed two kinds of cell migration systems: chemokinesis to measure random walk using monolayer denudation (also termed scratch motility assay) and chemotaxis to measure directional movement using the Dunn chamber. Six hours after scraping, the endothelial cells began to migrate into the wound gap. The closure of wound gaps took ∼24 h. Immunofluorescent staining with a specific antibody against caveolin-1 showed that the majority of caveolin-1 was located at the rear of most moving cells (Fig. 1, b and c, green arrowheads) opposite the lamellipodium of the leading edge (Fig. 1c, green arrows). Similarly, when cells were exposed to a linear gradient of VEGF, caveolin-1 was concentrated at the rear or trailing edge of moving cells (Fig. 1d, green arrowheads). These results indicate that caveolin-1 polarization at the cell posterior is a common feature of both directional and random movements. Mutual Exclusion Between Caveolin-1 and Focal Contacts at the Leading Edge—The migration-activated posterior relocation of caveolin-1 is intriguing and suggests that when cells are stimulated to migrate, caveolin-1 (along with caveolae; see Fig. 3) moves to the rear of the migrating cell as a mechanism to sequester it away from signaling proteins that direct cell motility at the leading edge. Here, we focused on nascent focal adhesions at the leading edge revealed by immunostaining with specific antibody against integrin β1 and FAK. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Within 1 h after seeding, most cells spread radially. As shown in Fig. 2, caveolin-1 was localized compactly in the center of the spreading cells (Fig. 2, a and g) and was excluded from nascent focal contacts along the circular lamellipodium revealed by FAK or integrin β1 staining (Fig. 2, b and h). After incubation for several hours, focal contacts appeared in the polarized lamellipodia at the leading edge of migrating cells (Fig. 2, e and k). Caveolin-1 signal was now relocated at the rear of most moving cells (Fig. 2, d and j). These data confirm that caveolin-1 moves to the opposite pole of a migrating cell, compared with FAK and β1 integrin at the leading edge.Fig. 2Mutual exclusion between caveolin-1 and focal contacts at the leading edge. HUVECs were seeded on fibronectin-coated coverslips and incubated at 37 °C either for cell spreading assay or cell migration assay. After incubation, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and subjected to dual immunofluorescent staining with caveolin-1 (a, d, g, and j) and either FAK (b and e) or integrin β1 (h and k). Composite images (c, f, i, and l) resulting from the superimposition of caveolin-1 signal and FAK or integrin β1 are shown. Note that during cell spreading, caveolin-1 was excluded from nascent focal contacts, revealed by FAK and integrin β1 staining along the leading edge and located compactly in the cell center. When cells were migrating, focal contacts localized to one or sometimes two polarized lamellipodia, whereas caveolin-1 appeared at the body and rear of moving cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Exclusion of Caveolae from Lamellipodia—Like many other terminally differentiated cells, such as adipocytes, fibroblasts, and skeletal muscle cells, endothelial cells possess a large number of caveolae (1Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 22Peters K-R. Carley W. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2233-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Rapid freeze, deep etch images show that caveolae have a striated coat and contain the integral 22-kDa membrane protein, caveolin (23Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The coat protein is a reliable marker for tracing caveolae trafficking in live cells (24Mundy D.I. Machleidt T. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4327-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Based on our results described above demonstrating that caveolin-1 was centrally concentrated in spreading cells, we predicted that caveolae may be centrally localized as well. To assess the location of caveolae, endothelial cells were seeded for 1 h to allow spreading and then fixed and processed for electron microscopy analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, caveolae were localized abundantly at the cell center of spreading cells (Fig. 3A, b, arrowheads; Fig. 3B). Few, if any, caveolae were found at the lamellipod protrusion (Fig. 3B). When cells were migrating, caveolae, like their marker caveolin-1, were now concentrated at the cell rear (Fig. 3A, d, arrowheads; Fig. 3C), opposite the lamellipodium. In contrast, few, if any, caveolae were found at the leading edge of migrating cells (Fig. 3A, e; Fig. 3C). Again, these results indicate that caveolae, along with caveolin-1, were excluded from the leading edge of migrating cells. Phosphocaveolin-1 Is Co-localized with Focal Complex Molecules at the Leading Edge of Migrating Cells—Caveolin is one of the major v-Src substrates in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (25Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Stimulation of A431 cells with EGF or NIH 3T3 cells with hyperosmotic stress leads to phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14, and the phosphorylation events are associated with focal adhesions (26Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To assess whether phosphorylation of caveolin-1 occurred and where the phosphorylation took place during cell migration, endothelial cells were treated with fibronectin and dually stained with specific antibodies against phosphocaveolin-1 and either phosphopaxillin or caveolin-1. Dual immunolabeling revealed that phosphocaveolin-1 co-localized with the focal adhesion marker, phosphopaxillin, at the leading edge of migrating cells (Fig. 4, a–c), indicating that caveolin-1 was associated with focal complexes along the lamellipodium concomitant with tyrosine 14 phosphorylation. In contrast, a significant population of caveolin-1 that was not immunoreactive with Tyr-14 phosphospecific antibodies localized to the rear of migrating cells (Fig. 4, e and f). These data indicate that when tyrosinephosphorylated, caveolin-1 associated with focal complex molecules at the leading edge of a migrating cell. Targeted Knockdown of Caveolin-1 Impedes Cell Polarity— Our results demonstrated that caveolin-1 was directed to the posterior of either directionally or randomly moving cells, suggesting that caveolin-1 may play an important role in cell movement. We reasoned that during migration, caveolin-1 together with caveolae move to the rear of a migrating cell as a mechanism to sequester it away from signaling proteins that direct cell motility at the leading edge and that loss of caveolin-1 asymmetry by down-regulation of the protein would impede cell polarity and hence, cell migration. To test this hypothesis, we employed RNA interference to knock down caveolin-1 and examine its effect on cell polarity and migration. HUVECs were transfected with either caveolin-1 siRNA or control siRNA for 48 h and then seeded on fibronectin and incubated to allow migration. As shown in Fig. 5C, transfection with caveolin-1 siRNA specifically knocked down caveolin-1 levels by >80%. Notably, knockdown of caveolin-1 dramatically impeded the ability of endothelial cells to polarize, which instead maintained a near-circular lamellipodium (Fig. 5A, b), whereas control siRNA- or mock-treated cells were able to polarize as normal (Fig. 5A, a and c). A comparison of Cav-1 siRNA-treated with control siRNA- or mock-treated cells revealed a significant reversal of the ratio of circular to polarized cells in the Cav-1 siRNA group, with caveolin-1 knockdown inhibiting the polarization of endothelial cells (Fig. 5B). Knockdown of Caveolin-1 Inhibits Endothelial Cell Directional Movement—Given the nature of caveolin-1 as a scaffolding protein to organize and sequester signaling molecules, caveolin-1 may coordinate cellular activities between the leading edge and rear of a moving cell. In response to environmental stimulation, cells exclude caveolin-1 from the leading edge by an unknown mechanism and eliminate its inhibitory action on signaling molecules that are involved in lamellipod protrusion. At the same time, caveolin-1 concentrates and reinforces its inhibitory action at the posterior of a polarized cell. Hence, a cell may sense and move directionally by exclusion of caveolin-1 from the leading edge. In accordance with this, loss of caveolin polarity would inhibit directional cell movement. To test this hypothesis, HUVECs were transfected with caveolin-1 siRNA and subjected to chemotactic response to serum using a well characterized microchemotaxis chamber system (28Segall J.E. Tyerech S. Boselli L. Masseling S. Helft J. Chan A. Jones J. Condeelis J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, loss of caveolin-1 polarity by knockdown of the protein dramatically reduced the number of migrating endothelial cells by >3-fold over mock or control siRNA-treated cells. Thus, our results indicate that loss of caveolin-1 asymmetry impeded endothelial cell directional movement. We have demonstrated that caveolin and caveolae polarized regardless of VEGF-induced directional movement or monolayer scraping-induced random walk. Polarization was found at the rear of moving cells in both models. Notably, during cell spreading or migration, extension of the leading edge and protrusion of lamellipodia were not observed in the area with higher caveolin-1 signal. Although caveolin has an intimate relationship with the cytoskeleton, little is known about the function of the protein in cell migration. In the present study, we have shown that loss of caveolin polarity by knockdown of the protein dramatically inhibited cell polarization and impeded cell directional movement. Our results indicate an essential role of caveolin polarity in lamellipod protrusion and in orienting directional movement in endothelial cells. Fig. 7 depicts a model of cell polarization in which caveolin-1 is located at the rear of a moving cell, where it prevents lamellipod protrusion. Upon phosphorylation at tyrosine 14, caveolin-1 is released from caveolae and associated with focal adhesion sites at the leading edge, where it may mediate the recruitment of Csk and affect the formation of focal adhesions (29Cao H. Sanguinetti A.R. Mastick C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our present results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating caveolin and caveolae polarization in bovine aortic endothelial cells in response to shear stress (15Isshiki M. Ando J. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 475-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), monolayer scraping, or fibroblast growth factor stimulation (16Parat M.O. Anand-Apte B. Fox P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our result of growth factor-induced caveolin relocation at the cell posterior stands in contrast to a recent report that caveolin is located to the leading edge of fibroblast growth factor-stimulated transmigrating bovine aortic endothelial cells (16Parat M.O. Anand-Apte B. Fox P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the leading edge accumulation of caveolin-1 requires phosphorylation of the protein at tyrosine 14, which is consistent with our finding that tyrosine-phosphorylated endogenous caveolin-1 associated with focal adhesion molecules at the leading edge (see Fig. 4). This study did not determine whether the polarized endogenous caveolin-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated; therefore, it is not clear whether they were observing forward relocation of non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated caveolin-1. Manes et al. (30Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R.A. Keller P. Labrador J.P. Martinez A.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) showed recently the relocation of lipid rafts to the leading edge of insulin-like growth factor-I-stimulated MCF-7 denocarcinoma cells. Because the study did not examine the location of caveolin-1, a marker of caveolae, it is unclear that the relocation of lipid rafts represents caveolae or noncaveolae rafts. Thus, caveolin and caveolae relocation depends on the modes of cell migration and is cell-type-specific. Nonetheless, the observation that different stimulations lead to caveolin and caveolae relocation suggests that it is a general mechanism for cells to spatially organize subcellular activities that direct cell motility. The majority of caveolin-1 is found at the cell surface and associated with caveolae (23Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 31Das K. Lewis R.Y. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18721-18726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Some Golgi-associated caveolin-1 is in transit from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface (32Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The recycling of surface caveolin-1 through the Golgi apparatus involves the directional movement of the molecule from caveolae to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and onto the Golgi apparatus (33Smart E. Ying Y-S. Conrad P. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 34Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism that directs caveolae and caveolin-1 polarization is that recycling caveolar vesicles accumulate at the cell rear during migration. Another possibility is that caveolin-1 and caveolae accumulate at the cell posterior as a result of differential movement of other organelles. The experimental observation that cell polarization signals are upstream and independent of those triggering cell motility suggests that asymmetric caveolin redistribution is not the consequence of cell movement (35Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R.A. Martinez C. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Meili R. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 was first identified as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (25Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Microsequencing of Src-phosphorylated caveolin-1 revealed that phosphorylation occurs within the extreme N-terminal region of the full-length of caveolin-1 (37Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that tyrosine 14 is the principal substrate for Src kinase (37Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that caveolin-1 undergoes phosphorylation at tyrosine 14 in response to a number of stimulations, such as insulin, EGF, and osmotic stress. Tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 provides a docking site recruiting SH2 domain-containing proteins, such as Grb7 and Csk, and augments EGF-stimulated cell migration (26Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F.

Because Grb7 contains an SH2 domain and a phosphotyrosine-interacting region (38Kasus-Jacobi A. Bereziat V. Perdereau D. Girard J. Burnol A.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it may function as a bridge linking phosphorylated caveolin-1 to other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, such as FAK (39Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed a rapid phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at tyrosine 14 upon fibronectin stimulation. Importantly, unlike the unphosphorylated caveolin-1, tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 was co-localized with focal complex molecules at the leading edge of migrating cells. The discovery that tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 and unphosphorylated caveolin-1 polarize at two opposing poles of moving cells is intriguing, although the mechanism underlying this is unclear. Therefore, during cell migration, phosphorylated caveolin-1 located at focal complexes along the leading edge might couple integrin to non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Src, Fyn, and FAK, whereas unphosphorylated inhibitory caveolin-1 is relocated to the cell rear. Our present results demonstrated that loss of caveolin polarity impede endothelial cell polarity and directional movement and suggest that caveolin may play an important role in angiogenesis. This idea is supported by a variety of studies showing that caveolin-1 affects capillary formation. We and others have shown recently that antisense-mediated down-regulation of caveolin-1 inhibits capillary tubule formation (40Griffoni C. Spisni E. Santi S. Riccio M. Guarnieri T. Tomasi V. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2037954317,"The lipid second messenger diacylglycerol acts by binding to the C1 domains of target proteins, which translocate to cell membranes and are allosterically activated. Here we report the crystal structure at 3.2 Å resolution of one such protein, β2-chimaerin, a GTPase-activating protein for the small GTPase Rac, in its inactive conformation. The structure shows that in the inactive state, the N terminus of β2-chimaerin protrudes into the active site of the RacGAP domain, sterically blocking Rac binding. The diacylglycerol and phospholipid membrane binding site on the C1 domain is buried by contacts with the four different regions of β2-chimaerin: the N terminus, SH2 domain, RacGAP domain, and the linker between the SH2 and C1 domains. Phospholipid binding to the C1 domain triggers the cooperative dissociation of these interactions, allowing the N terminus to move out of the active site and thereby activating the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2111254987,"Stimulation of purinergic receptors inhibits amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport in epithelial tissues by an unknown mechanism. Because previous studies excluded the role of intracellular Ca2+ or protein kinase C, we examined whether purinergic regulation of Na+ absorption occurs via hydrolysis of phospholipid such as phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphates (PIP2). Inhibition of amiloride-sensitive short-circuit currents (Isc-Amil) by adenine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in native tracheal epithelia and M1 collecting duct cells was suppressed by binding neomycin to PIP2, and recovery from ATP inhibition was abolished by blocking phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase or diacylglycerol kinase. Stimulation by ATP depleted PIP2 from apical membranes, and PIP2 co-immunoprecipitated the beta subunit of ENaC. ENaC was inhibited by ATP stimulation of P2Y2 receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Mutations in the PIP2 binding domain of betaENaC but not gammaENaC reduced ENaC currents without affecting surface expression. Collectively, these data supply evidence for a novel and physiologically relevant regulation of ENaC in epithelial tissues. Although surface expression is controlled by its C terminus, N-terminal binding of betaENaC to PIP2 determines channel activity."

Kinetoplastida are early diverged flagellates that differ from other eukaryotes by a number of features. They contain a remarkable single mitochondrion, within which is a large mass of circular DNA molecules that are intercatenated in a unique arrangement (1Lukeš J. Guilbride D.L. Votýpka J. Zíková A. Benne R. Englund P.T. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Moreover, their mitochondrial RNA processing is also highly unusual. The majority of mitochondrial mRNAs are extensively changed by RNA editing, which is the extensive insertion and less frequent deletion of uridines (Us) at multiple sites. Small guide RNA (gRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: gRNA, guide RNA; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; MRP, mitochondrial RNA-binding protein; REL, RNA-editing ligase; PPE, poisoned primer extension; ND, NADH-dehydrogenase; REAP1, RNA editing-associated protein 1. molecules direct the pattern of U insertions and deletions by base pairing between the pre-edited mRNA and gRNA. The editing process occurs via a series of “cut-and-paste” steps, and several of the enzymes that catalyze this process, including RNA ligases and terminal uridylyl transferases, have now been identified (for recent reviews see Refs. 2Madison-Antenucci S.

In anticipation of further knowledge this complex was termed the “editosome”; its existence has recently been confirmed by a number of approaches including electron microscopy (5Stuart K.

In addition, a complex of similar size and protein composition (termed the ligase-containing complex or L-complex) was identified in Leishmania tarentolae (4Simpson L. Aphasizhev R. Gao G.G.

The low efficiency of the in vitro editing assays and the low abundance of editing components have hampered, thus far, a full characterization of the editing machinery. In an attempt to identify other T. brucei proteins involved in RNA editing, several proteins have been characterized with affinity for pre-mRNAs and/or gRNAs. The 45-kDa protein REAP1 preferentially binds to poly(G) and single-stranded guanosine-rich regions of pre-mRNAs and has been proposed to bring preedited mRNAs into the editing complex (12Madison-Antenucci S. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 879-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 75-kDa TbRGG1 protein, which is rich in arginines and glycines, binds gRNAs with a preference for poly(U) (13Vanhamme L. Pérez-Morga D. Maréchal C. Speijer D. Lambert L. Geuskens M.

Read L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12067-12074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Pelletier M. Miller M.M. Read L.K.

Another protein that binds gRNAs is T. brucei gBP21, which was identified by specific cross-linking (17Read L.K. Göringer H.U. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2629-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and shown to bind RNA with high affinity (18Köller J. Müller U. Schmid B. Missel A. Kruft V. Stuart K. Göringer H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3749-3757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that gBP21 can act as a matchmaker, promoting the annealing of gRNAs to cognate pre-mRNA in vitro (19Müller U.F. Lambert L. Göringer H.U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), after which it dissociates from the RNA duplex (20Müller U.F. Göringer H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Its involvement in editing was suggested by its association with editosomal complexes (21Allen T.E. Heidmann S. Reed R. Myler P.J. Göringer H.U. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), albeit RNA-mediated and perhaps transient (4Simpson L. Aphasizhev R. Gao G.G. Kang X.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Stuart K. Panigrahi A.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against gBP21 inhibited editing activity in vitro (22Lambert L. Müller U.F. Souza A.E. Göringer H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1429-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but in vivo confirmation of a role in editing was lacking. Bloodstream form T. brucei cells in which both gBP21 alleles are knocked-out by homologous recombination are viable, with only minor changes in the levels of some edited and unedited mRNAs. Hence gBP21 is not essential in bloodstream forms. However, these gBP21 null mutants did not transform into the insect forms (22Lambert L. Müller U.F. Souza A.E. Göringer H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1429-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). gBP21 homologues have been identified in Crithidia fasciculata (gBP29;23) and L. tarentolae (Ltp28; 11). Importantly, a second gRNA-binding protein gBP27 was found in C. fasciculata that co-purified and co-immunoprecipitated with gBP29, the gBP21 homologue (23van den Blom D. Burg J. Breek C.K. Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Benne R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2950-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A similar tight association was observed for the homologous proteins in L. tarentolae, in which Ltp28 and Ltp26, the gBP27 homologue, form a 100-kDa heterotetrameric complex (11Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Simpson A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This complex may contain several other as yet unidentified proteins and was shown to bind to gRNA and catalyze the annealing of complementary RNAs (10Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Fallick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Simpson A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that it could have a role in the initiation of RNA editing by stimulating gRNA:pre-edited RNA duplex formation (11Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Simpson A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A gBP27 homologue, gBP25, has also been identified in T. brucei (23van den Blom D. Burg J. Breek C.K. Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Benne R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2950-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). C. fasciculata gBP27 and gBP29 have weak but significant similarity (23van den Blom D. Burg J. Breek C.K. Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Benne R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2950-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is conserved between the homologous pairs in the other two trypanosomatids. This homology, together with their almost identical hydrophilicity profiles, suggests that these proteins may have at least partially overlapping functions and hence molecular redundancy, a possible explanation for the viability of the gBP21 null bloodstream forms (3Simpson L. Sbicego S. Aphasizhev R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 41-53Google Scholar, 23van den Blom D. Burg J. Breek C.K. Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Benne R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2950-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, the observation has been made that these proteins bind RNA rather nonspecifically, and it was suggested to label these proteins mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins (MRPs) (4Simpson L. Aphasizhev R. Gao G.G. Kang X.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, this designation has been used throughout the remainder of this article. The functions of individual proteins involved in RNA editing in vivo have been examined by genetic methods that employ homologous recombination. Knock-out of both alleles has been accomplished when a gene is not essential, as with gBP21 in bloodstream form T. brucei, but cannot be used for essential genes, which may be the case with gBP21 procyclic forms. Both essential and non-essential genes have been examined by knock-out of endogenous alleles in cells that contain an ectopic allele under the control of a regulatable promoter. This approach has shown that one of the two RNA-editing ligases (REL), REL1, is essential for editing and cell viability (24Schnaufer A. Panigrahi A.K. Panicucci B. Igo Jr., R.P. Salavati R. Stuart K. Science. 2001; 291: 2159-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, the knock-out technique identified TbMP44 as critical for the structural integrity of the 20 S editing complex and essential for editing (25Wang B.B. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. Panigrahi A.K. Salavati R. Stuart K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RNA interference (RNAi) represents a less laborious approach, in which a DNA sequence that generates a double-stranded RNA under the control of a regulatable promoter is inserted in the genome by homologous recombination. For this reason RNAi has become the method of choice for high through-put functional analysis of trypanosomatid proteins. So far, RNAi has been used to study the function of a large number of editing (complex-associated) proteins: the two RNA ligases (26Gao G. Simpson L. J. Biol.

In the work described here, we have applied the RNAi technology to analyze the function of MRP1 (gBP21) and MRP2 (gBP25) in T. brucei procyclic forms. To this end, we have constructed RNAi strains in which the expression of either MRP1 or MRP2, or both, can be blocked inducibly. The results suggest that the MRPs function in regulating the extent of editing of specific transcripts in procyclic trypanosomes, with roles that differentially affect various mRNAs. In addition, these proteins seem to play a role in other aspects of RNA metabolism. Plasmid Constructs, Transfection, Cloning, and RNAi Induction— The 5′ part of the MRP1 gene spanning nucleotides 1–615 (the A of the AUG initiation codon being number 1) was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides g21-F (5′-CACCTCGAGATGAT TCGACTCGCATGCC TG-3′) and g21-R (5′-CCCAAGCTTGGTATCGCGATGTGTC ACTTA-3′) (added XhoI and HindIII restriction sites are underlined). The amplified fragment was cloned in pCR2.1 TOPO® (Invitrogen) and subcloned in pZJM (34Wang Z. Morris J. Drew M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), resulting in the construct MRP1-I (Fig. 1A). Similarly, nucleotides 1–675 of the MRP2 gene were amplified with the g25-F (5′-CACCTCGAGATGCTCCGACTGATCATCAGCCAG-3′) and g25-R1 oligonucleotides (5′-CCCAAGCTTGCCACATCAAACTCTACAGTCCAC-3′) (added XhoI and HindIII restriction sites are underlined) and cloned using the same vectors, creating the construct MRP2-I (Fig. 1A). The double knock-down construct was prepared as follows. First, a smaller 5′-fragment of the MRP2 gene (nucleotides 1–480) was amplified with oligonucleotides g25-F and g25-R2 (5′-AAACTGCAGGATTCGGTGTGAAGGTG GCGTTAG-3′) (the PstI restriction site is underlined) and cloned into pZJM, yielding MRP2-II. Next, we ligated a gel-purified, XbaI-PstI MRP2-II fragment into the MRP1-I plasmid linearized with the same enzymes. This generated the MRP1+2 construct containing the gene fragments in a head-to-tail orientation (Fig. 1A). All constructs were checked by sequence analysis. The procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13, transgenic for T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor (50), was grown at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of hygromycin (50 μg/ml) and G418 (15 μg/ml). Exponentially growing cultures (about 5 × 107 cells/ml) were used for transfection, following the protocol of Wang et al. (34Wang Z. Morris J. Drew M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Electroporation with 10 μg of linearized plasmid DNA was performed in 2-mm cuvettes using a BTX electroporator with the settings of 1500 V, 50 microfarads, and 500 ohms. After transfection, cells were transferred into fresh medium to which 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin was added 24 h after electroporation. After 2 weeks of cultivation, only cells resistant to phleomycin survived, which were cloned using limiting dilution in 96-wells plates at 27 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. After 3 weeks, several clones were transferred into larger volumes of SDM-79, and the synthesis of dsRNA was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The MRP1 and MRP2 protein levels were analyzed in total cell lysates of bloodstream and procyclic stages of T. brucei and dyskinetoplastic cells EATRO164Dk (35Domingo G.J. Palazzo S.S. Wang B. Panicucci B. Salavati R. Stuart K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Growth and Morphological Analysis—Following Northern blot analysis, one of three clones was used for further experiments (see “Results”). Growth curves obtained over a period of 11 days after the induction of RNAi were established using the Beckman X2 Cell Counter. One hundred cells from non-induced and tetracycline-induced cultures were measured using the ocular micrometer at several time points upon RNAi induction, and cell morphology was analyzed under the light microscope and by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Southern and Northern Blotting—Total DNA from the RNAi cells was isolated, digested with selected restriction enzymes, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted, and hybridized with DNA probes labeled by random priming (Fermentas) with [32P]dATP (ICN). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 5 μg of RNA/lane was loaded on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel, blotted, and cross-linked following standard protocols. After prehybridization in Church-Gilbert solution (0.5 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 60 °C, hybridization was performed overnight in the same solution at 55 °C. A wash in 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min was followed by two washes in 0.2 × SSC + 0.1% SDS for 20 min each at 55 °C. Glycerol Gradients—A total of 6 × 108 log-phase procyclic cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm Mg(OAc)2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mm pefabloc, 2 μg of leupeptin, and 1 μgof pepstatin. The lysate was loaded on a 10–30% glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 5 h at 4 °C. Individual 0.5-ml fractions were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for further use. Preparation of Antibodies and Western Blotting—The coding region of MRP1 and MRP2 was PCR-amplified, cloned into the pQE9 vector, and transfected into E. coli SG13009 cells, and the resulting clones were verified by sequencing. The cells were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin (MRP1) or 50 μg/ml carbenicillin (MRP2) at 27 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. They were resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl) and lysed by the addition of 1 mg/ml lysozyme followed by four cycles of sonication for 30 s at 16 mA. The suspension was centrifuged, and the overexpressed protein was purified from the supernatant by the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelate resin as specified by the manufacturer (recombinant MRP1 and MRP2 were eluted with 200 and 400 mm imidazole, respectively). Polyclonal antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits at 2-week intervals with four subcutaneous injections of 0.5 mg of purified recombinant MRP1 or MRP2 protein emulsified with complete (first injection) and incomplete (following injections) Freund's adjuvant. Sera were collected 7 days after the fourth injection and were tested by Western blotting. Antibodies were affinity-purified on immobilized antigen columns by standard protocols. The antibody-containing fractions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and stored with 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C. Cell lysates were prepared from 1 × 107 cells/10 μl, analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted, and probed with polyclonal anti-MRP1 (MRP2) antisera (1:2000). The secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000) coupled to alkaline phosphatase or horse-radish peroxidase was visualized according to the manufacturer's protocols using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The preparation of polyclonal rabbit antisera against REAP1 and RBP16 and mouse monoclonal antibodies against TbMP81, TbMP63, TbMP42, REL1, and α-phosphoglucokinase has been described elsewhere (7Panigrahi A.K.

Immunoprecipitation—Immunomagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 or M-450, Dynal) were coupled with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-MRP1 or anti-MRP2 antibodies and affinity-purified monoclonal anti-MRP1 antibody MAb56 (21Allen T.E.

Coupling was performed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 200 mm KCl. Immunoprecipitation of mitochondrial proteins was performed by incubating the pooled glycerol gradient fractions 3–7 (see “Glycerol Gradients”) of mitochondrial lysates from 29-13 cells generally following the protocol of Allen et al.

The immunoprecipitated proteins were isolated from the beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Western blotting. Poisoned Primer Extension—Two protocols were performed for poisoned primer extension (PPE). For A6, Cox3, ND4, ND5, ND7, RPS12, and α-tubulin, the PPE protocol was according to Estévez et al. (39Estévez A.M. Kierszenbaum F. Wirtz E. Bringaud F. Grunstein J. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with 50 μg of total RNA and 0.1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled (ICN) oligonucleotides. The PPE on transcripts of Cox1, Cox2, CyB, and 12 S rRNA was performed generally following the protocol of Lambert et al. (22Lambert L. Müller U.F. Souza A.E. Göringer H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1429-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for RNAs that are edited were derived from un-edited regions, enabling the simultaneous analysis of edited and pre-edited RNA versions; the coordinates given refer to the pre-edited and never edited transcripts (Table I). Routinely, PPEs for individual mRNAs were performed at least three times. The amount of signal was measured using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The nuclear-encoded α-tubulin mRNA, which does not undergo RNA editing, was used as an internal control.Table IOligonucleotides used in poisoned primer extensionRNASequenceCoordinatesA6 (ed)aed, edited.5′-CTTATTTGATCTTATTCTATAACTCC-3′367-392Cox3 (ed)5′-AACTTCCTACAAACTACC-3′446-463ND45′-ATAGACTTTCGAAGGCTATC-3′303-322ND55′-CAAACGCGCTAACACACAAC-3′1097-1116ND7 (ed)5′-CACATAACTTTTCTGTACCACGATGC-3′122-147RPS12 (ed)5′-AAAAACATATCTTAT-3′207-221α-tubulin5′-GGGGGTCGCAGTTTGTC-3′906-922Cox15′-TTCAGTCAAAAACCCACTTACTAAG-3′342-366Cox2 (ed)5′-AAATTATTTCATTACACCTACCAGG-3′516-540CyB (ed)5′-TATATAAACAACCTGACATTAAAAG-3′54-7812 S rRNA5′-AAATAAATATAGTATTGCCCCAATC-3′905-929a ed, edited. Open table in a new tab In Vitro Editing—The in vitro precleaved insertion editing assay was performed with a tripartite RNA substrate with a 5′-fragment (5′CL18), a 3′-fragment (3′CL13pp), and gRNA (gPCA6–2A), which specifies the addition of 2 Us as described previously (40Igo Jr., R.P.

The precleaved deletion assay was performed with a tripartite RNA substrate with a 5′-fragment (U5–5′CL), a 3′-fragment (U5–3′CL), and gRNA (gA6[14]PC-del), which specifies the removal of 4 Us as described previously (41Igo Jr., R.P. Weston J. Ernst N.L. Panigrahi A.K. Salavati R. Stuart K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions contained 25 fmol of radiolabeled 5′-fragment, 1 pmol of 3′-fragment, and 0.5 pmol of gRNA with 15 μl of glycerol gradient purified material in a total volume of 30 μl in HHE buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and were incubated for 3 h at 28 °C. The reaction products were phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, run on 11% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, and visualized by phosphorimaging. Full-round in vitro deletion editing was assayed using the A6short/TAG.1 pre-mRNA substrate and the D33 gRNA, which forms a duplex with pre-mRNA and contains 3 Cs opposite the editing site (42Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A. Rusché L.N. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), following the protocol published by Seiwert et al. (43Seiwert S.D.

Loss of MRP1 and/or MRP2 Is Lethal to Procyclic Form T. brucei—5′-Fragments of the MRP1 and the MRP2 genes were cloned into the pZJM RNAi vector, both separately and together, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see Fig. 1A). Transfection of the constructs into procyclic trypanosomes resulted in their stable integration into the intergenic region of the rRNA gene region (data not shown). The morphology of non-induced cells appeared normal by both light and electron microscopy. Growth of the cloned cell lines was inhibited upon RNAi induction with tetracycline, to a different extent in individual cell lines. Growth of the MRP2 and MRP1+2 knock-downs was inhibited by 51 and 69%, respectively, after 1 week, and the inhibition rose to 97% for both cell lines by 11 days post-induction (Fig. 1B). After 7 days of induction, growth of the MRP1 knock-down was inhibited by about 26%. However, the extent of inhibition increased eventually to 70% and showed no recovery.

In mice, disruption of yolk sac cell secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins results in embryonic lethality. In humans, the yolk sac is vestigial. Nutritional functions are instead established very early during pregnancy in the placenta. To examine whether the human placenta produces lipoproteins, we examined apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) mRNA expression in placental biopsies. ApoB and MTP are mandatory for assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Both genes were expressed in placenta and microsomal extracts from human placenta contained triglyceride transfer activity, indicating expression of bioactive MTP. To detect lipoprotein secretion, biopsies from term placentas were placed in medium with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 3–24 h. Upon sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of the labeled medium, fractions were analyzed by apoB-immunoprecipitation. 35S-labeled apoB-100 was recovered in d ∼1.02–1.04 g/ml particles (i.e. similar to the density of plasma low density lipoproteins). Electron microscopy of negatively stained lipoproteins secreted from placental tissue showed spherical particles with a diameter of 47 ± 10 nm. These results demonstrate that human placenta expresses both apoB and MTP and consequently synthesize and secrete apoB-100-containing lipoproteins.

Placental lipoprotein formation constitutes a novel pathway of lipid transfer from the mother to the developing fetus. Lipids from the maternal circulation are vital to sustain fetal growth and brain development. In addition to essential fatty acids, fetal development is dependent on cholesterol, glycolipids, and lipid-soluble vitamins. Although fatty acids can passively diffuse across the placental barrier (1Herrera E. Amusquivar E. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2000; 16: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), specific mechanisms for delivery of other lipids, including cholesterol, remain to be determined (1Herrera E. Amusquivar E. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2000; 16: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the molecular machinery involved in lipid transport to the fetus will potentially help understand states of fetal overgrowth (e.g. in maternal diabetes) or intrauterine growth restriction. The most efficient system for delivery of lipids from a tissue to the blood is the formation and secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) 1The abbreviations used are: apoB, apolipoprotein B; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein.1The abbreviations used are: apoB, apolipoprotein B; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein.-containing lipoproteins. The apoB-containing lipoproteins can contain large amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides and also serve as carrier of essential lipids such as lipophilic vitamins and glycolipids (2Havel J.H.

The importance of apoB-containing lipoprotein secretion is evident in the liver and intestine, where both apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) are needed to export large amounts of lipids for usage in peripheral tissues (2Havel J.H.

In rodents, the yolk sac plays an essential role in lipid transport to the fetus during the major part of pregnancy. The yolk sac of mice and rats express the apoB gene (7Terasawa Y. Cases S.J.

Graham C.F. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1986; 97: 177-187PubMed Google Scholar). However, the human yolk sac is a rudimentary organ and looses its nutritional functions early in embryogenesis (14Sadler T.W. Coryell P. Langman's Medical Embryology. 7th Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1995: 82Google Scholar). Instead, the substrate transfer from the maternal to the fetal circulation occurs in placenta. We speculated that even though rodent placentas express only very low levels of apoB and MTP (7Terasawa Y. Cases S.J. Wong J.S. Jamil H. Jothi S. Traber M.G. Packer L. Gordon D.A. Hamilton R.L.

This hypothesis was addressed by characterizing human term placental biopsies with respect to mRNA and protein expression of MTP and apoB and secretion of newly formed apoB-containing lipoproteins. Tissues and Cells—Biopsies from human term placenta (∼0.3 g) were obtained after elective cesarean section in healthy women with nonpathological pregnancies. Biopsies were placed in medium on ice (for metabolic labeling studies and electron microscopy) or frozen in liquid N2 (for mRNA and MTP activity studies) within 7–15 min after childbirth. All mothers gave informed, written consent, and the local ethics committee approved the study protocol (KF 01–048/01). Mouse hearts were taken from three 6-month old male C57Bl/6 mice (M&B, Ry, Denmark) that had been housed at the Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen and fed standard laboratory chow (Altromin no. 1314; Altromin, Rugaarden, Denmark). HepG2 cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air and 10% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with GlutaMAX-I, 4500 mg/l glucose, and pyridoxine and without sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were split 1:4 or 1:5 twice a week. Labeling experiments were carried out with subconfluent monolayered HepG2 cells in 6-well Multi-dishes (9.6 cm2/well) (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark). mRNA Expression—Total RNA was isolated from human placental biopsies and HepG2 cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and used for cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of apoB and MTP mRNA expression with a Lightcycler (Roche A/S, Hvidovre, Denmark) (15Bartels E.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27014-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The primers used for MTP and apoB mRNA amplification have already been described (17Nielsen L.B. Perko M. Arendrup H. Andersen C.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For amplification of β-actin the primers were: h-β-actin-31 (5′-GAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3′) and h-β-actin-51 (5′-TCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT-3′). Placental Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Activity—Extracts of microsomal proteins were prepared from biopsies of two human placentas, pig heart, and pig liver by homogenization of ∼100 mg of each tissue separately in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor; Roche A/S) with a PT 1200 Polytron homogenizer (Buch & Holm A/S, Herlev, Denmark). The total protein concentration in each homogenate was determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce, Copenhagen, Denmark) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1.75 mg/ml, and placental homogenates were centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 g in a Beckman Optima LE-80K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). The supernatant (i.e. the microsomal fraction) was added to 1/10 volume of 0.54% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.5, and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by overnight dialysis at 4 °C against 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. Triglyceride transfer activity in the microsomal protein fraction was measured at 37 °C as the transfer of 14C-labeled triglycerides from labeled donor vesicles to acceptor vesicles that contained unlabeled triglycerides (18Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The donor vesicles contained 40 nmol of phosphatidylcholine, 0.08 nmol of [14C]triglyceride, 3.0 nmol of cardiolipin, and 100 cpm/nmol [3H]phosphatidylcholine. The acceptor vesicles contained 240 nmol of phosphatidylcholine, 0.48 nmol of triolein, and 100 cpm/nmol [3H]phosphatidylcholine. We measured the triglyceride transfer activity in human placentas by incubating the microsomal protein fraction corresponding to 100 μg of total placental or pig heart protein or 10 μg of pig liver with donor and acceptor vesicles for 6 h (19Christoffersen C.

The triglyceride transfer activity in both placental extracts was corrected for the transfer activity in a heat-inactivated (incubation at 65 °C for 10 min) aliquot of the same extracts (18Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and for the spontaneous transfer between donor and acceptor vesicles in a test tube without microsomal extract. Metabolic Labeling Studies—Each human placental biopsy (∼0.3 g) was placed in a 2.0-ml Eppendorf tube, minced into ∼1-mm3 pieces with scissors, and washed three times with 1.0 ml of incubation medium [methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (Sigma) with 7% fetal bovine serum, 2.0 mm GlutaMAX-I (Invitrogen), 2.0 mm sodium pyruvate and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche A/S)] before adding 1.4 ml of incubation medium with 0.59–0.86 mCi of [35S]Promix (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, the incubation media also contained 0.81 mm oleic acid complexed with bovine serum albumin (molar ratio 2:1) (Sigma) or 0.41 mm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The tube was placed at 37 °C on a shaking table at 250 rpm. The time from child delivery to incubation of the placental tissue with labeling medium was 45–65 min. After 3–24 h, the tissue was pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C), and the medium was collected. HepG2 cells were pre-incubated for 1 h with incubation medium without Complete Mini followed by incubation for 22–24 h with 1.5 ml of incubation medium, with or without 0.81 mm oleic acid, and with 0.23 mCi [35S]Promix in each well. Cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation. Labeled medium from placenta or HepG2 cells was subjected to discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The sucrose gradient (20Boren J. Veniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was formed by layering from the bottom of 13.2 ml of Ultra-Clear tubes (Beckman Coulter Inc.); 2 ml of 50% sucrose, 2 ml of 25% sucrose, 5 ml of 12.5% sucrose containing 1 ml of the sample and 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Complete Mini (1 tablet/7 ml) was added to all solutions in experiments with placental medium. After ultracentrifugation (35,000 rpm for 70–71 h at 12 °C with a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor in a Beckman Optima LE-80K ultracentrifuge), the gradients were unloaded from the top of the tube into six fractions: 1 ml (top fraction), 4 × 1.5 ml, and 5 ml (bottom fraction), and the density of each fraction was determined by weight. ApoB was recovered by immunoprecipitation from 500 μl of each fraction and the unfractioned labeling medium. At first, each sample was pre-cleared by incubation with 20 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (0.5 ml agarose/2.0 ml; Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min followed by pelleting of the beads by centrifugation (2 min at 13,000 × g). A polyclonal human apoB-100 antibody (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) was added to the supernatant and the mixture was incubated for 12–16 h before Protein A/G PLUS Agarose (20 μl) was added. All incubations were carried out at 4 °C on a rocking-type mixer. After 2 h further, the tubes were centrifuged (2 min at 13,000 × g), and the pellet was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline before being subjected to SDS-PAGE with Novex 4–20% tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). After drying of the gels, 35S-labeled proteins were visualized with a FUJIX BAS2000 Bioimaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Electron Microscopy—Medium containing placental lipoproteins was prepared by incubating placental tissue with oleic acid for 24 h as described for the metabolic labeling studies; however, no fetal bovine serum was added, and instead of Promix, non-radioactive methionine (100 μg/ml; Sigma) and cysteine (500 μg/ml; Sigma) were used. The medium was adjusted to a density of 1.100 g/ml with NaBr. 5 ml of density-adjusted medium was overlayered with a d = 1.063 g/ml NaBr solution in a 13.2-ml Ultra-Clear tube and ultracentrifuged in the Beckman SW41 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm and 20 °C for 20 h. Thereafter, formvar-coated copper grids (400 mesh, Ref. 25Ellsworth J.L. Erickson S.K. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 858-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Ax-Lab, Copenhagen, Denmark) were placed on the liquid surface of each tube for 3 min. Lipoproteins were visualized using negative staining with 2% phosphotungstate, pH 7.0 (22Maunsbach A.B. Afzelius B. Biomedical Electron Microscopy: Illustrated Methods Interpretations. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999Google Scholar, 23Tranum-Jensen J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Hamilton R.L. Williams M.C. Fielding C.J. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1976; 58: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope with a Mega View camera system. To compare placental and plasma lipoproteins, we isolated VLDL (d < 1.019 g/ml), LDL (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml), and HDL (1.063 < d < 1.21 g/ml) from human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation and visualized them as described above. MTP and apoB Expression in the Human Placenta—Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses were used to establish whether the genes necessary for lipoprotein secretion, apoB and MTP, are expressed in human placenta. Both gene products were present in biopsies from human placentas (Fig. 1A). Placental biopsies taken adjacent to the umbilical cord, at the periphery of the placenta, or between the two showed no systematic regional variation in apoB and MTP mRNA expression levels and the levels of apoB and MTP mRNA expression in three placentas were similar to those in human hearts (17Nielsen L.B. Perko M. Arendrup H. Andersen C.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (data not shown). MTP catalyzes triglyceride transfer during assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (5Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To examine whether bioactive MTP is present in human placenta, we measured the triglyceride transfer activity in microsomal extracts of placental biopsies. Placental extracts catalyzed the transfer of triglyceride between vesicles more efficiently than extracts from pig heart but less efficiently than extracts from pig liver (Fig. 1B). Lipoprotein Secretion by Placenta—To investigate whether placenta synthesizes and secretes lipoproteins, we performed metabolic labeling studies with placental biopsies. At first, we incubated placental biopsies with 35S-labeled amino acids and immunoprecipitated apoB directly from the labeled medium. SDS-PAGE and Bioimaging Analyzer analyses of immunoprecipitates revealed [35S]apoB-100, but not [35S]apoB-48 in the medium (data not shown). To assess the density of the [35S]apoB-100-containing lipoproteins, we subjected the labeled medium to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and immunoprecipitated [35S]apoB in six different density fractions. [35S]apoB-100 appeared in fractions with densities of 1.02–1.04 g/ml (Fig. 2B)(i.e. corresponding to particles with the same buoyancy as plasma LDL (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml)). The addition of oleic acid induces the secretion of lipoproteins with a density similar to VLDL (d < 1.019 g/ml) in HepG2 cells and causes a reduction in the amount of lipid and protein in the LDL and HDL density range (25Ellsworth J.L. Erickson S.K. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 858-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether oleic acid has the same effect in placenta was investigated by adding oleic acid complexed to bovine serum albumin to the placental incubation medium. The density decreasing effect of oleic acid on apoB-100-containing lipoproteins from HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, C and D) was not seen in placenta (Fig. 2, A and B). Placenta expresses lipase activity (26Mallov S. Alousie A.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1965; 119: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that lipoproteins from placenta might in fact be secreted as VLDL and subsequently converted to LDL as a result of hydrolysis of the triglyceride moieties. To examine the extent of lipolytic conversion of VLDL to LDL, medium containing 35S-labeled VLDL was harvested from HepG2 cells and incubated with human placenta or mouse heart tissue (which expresses high levels of lipoprotein lipase (27Enerback S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)) for 24 h. The incubation with mouse heart tissue lead to disappearance of the [35S]apoB-100 VLDL particles; only a faint band corresponding to [35S]apoB-100 LDL was seen (Fig. 3C). In contrast, incubation with placental tissue only produced partial redistribution of [35S]apoB-100 from VLDL to LDL (Fig. 3B). This supports the conclusion that placenta, both with and without oleic acid supplementation, mainly secretes apoB-100 in particles with LDL density. However, it also indicates that some newly formed VLDL may have been converted to LDL upon secretion and therefore escaped detection as [35S]VLDL in our analysis of the medium. To see placental lipoproteins, placental biopsies were incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h before isolation of d < 1.063 g/ml lipoproteins. Electron microscopy of negatively stained placental lipoproteins showed spherical lipoproteins of 47 ± 10 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 65) (Fig. 4A). This result was seen in two independent experiments. The placental lipoproteins were unexpectedly larger than plasma LDL (mean diameter, 23 ± 7 nm) on similarly prepared grids (Fig. 4B). The diameter of the plasma d < 1.019 g/ml lipoproteins varied considerably and was on average 78 ± 64 nm. This study shows that human term placenta produces and secretes apoB-100-containing lipoproteins. The maternal lipoprotein profile changes with an increase of triglyceride and cholesterol levels in all lipoprotein fractions during pregnancy (1Herrera E. Amusquivar E. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2000; 16: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 28Herrera E. Bonet B. Lasunción M.A. Polin R.A. Fox W.W. Fetal Neonatal Physiology. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1998: 447-458Google Scholar). This makes the mother the obvious donor of lipid moieties to placenta. The quadruplication of the fetal weight from the 26th gestational week to delivery is caused mainly by lipid accumulation (29Van Aerde J.E. Feldman M. Clandinin M.T. Polin R.A. Fox W.W. Fetal Neonatal Physiology. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1998: 458-477Google Scholar). We therefore suspect that the fetus is on the receiving end of placental lipoprotein production. In support of this idea, Parker et al. (30Parker C.R. Deahl T. Drewry P. Hankins G. Early Human Development. 1983; 8: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) found that the LDL-cholesterol concentration was ∼10% higher in the umbilical artery than in the umbilical vein. The present results add placenta to a growing list of organs that produce apoB-containing lipoproteins. In addition to liver and intestine, recent data suggest that cardiac lipoprotein formation plays an integrated role in cardiac lipid metabolism (16Nielsen L.B. Bartels E.D. Bollano E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27014-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Nielsen L.B. Perko M. Arendrup H. Andersen C.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Williams D.L. Hamilton R.L. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 467S-472SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also detected apoB mRNA in the mouse kidney 2Emil D. Bartels and Lars B. Nielsen, unpublished data. and would not be surprised if the kidney was found to secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins in mammals. However, it is unlikely that lipoprotein synthesis is important in all cells (e.g. as a generally expressed pathway for removal of excess triglycerides) simply because the apoB expression levels are extremely low or undetectable in tissues other than those discussed above, including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, lung, and spleen (7Terasawa Y. Cases S.J. Wong J.S. Jamil H. Jothi S. Traber M.G. Packer L. Gordon D.A. Hamilton R.L. Farese Jr., R.V. J.

Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 695-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that placenta may produce apoB-containing lipoproteins with an efficacy per gram tissue that is 2% of that in the adult liver (a rough estimate based on the relative MTP activity and MTP mRNA contents in placenta versus pig liver and cultured human liver cells). Because the placenta weighs ∼4 times more than the fetal liver, this result implies that ∼8% of the apoB-containing lipoproteins in fetal plasma might be derived from the placenta. This estimate is, of course, rather speculative. Nevertheless, it illustrates that lipoproteins synthesized in placenta may contribute significantly to the plasma pool of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the fetus. As expected, oleic acid increased the buoyancy of newly secreted apoB-containing lipoproteins from HepG2 cells (25Ellsworth J.L. Erickson S.K. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 858-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, oleic acid failed to increase the buoyancy of the apoB-containing lipoproteins from placental biopsies. It is interesting that a similar lack of effect of oleic acid has been observed when studying the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins from oleic acid-perfused mouse hearts (31Bjorkegren J. Veniant M. Kim S.K. Withycombe S.K. Wood P.A. Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38511-38517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, the present data suggest that the density of placental lipoproteins was only mildly affected by postsecretional lipolysis (or preferential uptake of newly secreted VLDL), because the buoyancy of HepG2-cell derived VLDL changed only partially after incubation with placental biopsies. Ultrastructural analyses have shown that the size of nascent VLDL particles in mouse yolk sac cells diminishes in the late stages of pregnancy (from embryonic day 13.5) (7Terasawa Y. Cases S.J. Wong J.S. Jamil H. Jothi S. Traber M.G. Packer L. Gordon D.A. Hamilton R.L. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1967-1977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the present experiments were carried out with term placentas, we cannot exclude the possibility that the placenta produces larger and more buoyant lipoproteins at earlier time points during gestation. It is puzzling that the size of placental lipoproteins was similar to that of plasma VLDL remnants, whereas the density resembled that of plasma LDL. Because we saw no 35S-labeled proteins other than apoB-100 after immunoprecipitation of the apoB-containing lipoproteins, we suspect that the high density might reflect differences in the lipid composition of placental and plasma LDL. Although similarly sized placental lipoproteins were seen in two independent experiments, the apparent discrepancy could also reflect an artifact of the preparation of placental lipoproteins for electron microscopy (34Hamilton Jr., R.L. Goerke J. Guo L.S. Williams M.C. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 981-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What is the importance of placental lipoprotein in the fetus? Perhaps the function as vehicle is not so much for triglycerides as it is for other lipid soluble molecules, e.g. cholesterol, glycolipids, and lipid soluble vitamins. Comprehensive studies of knock-out mouse models for the two genes involved in apoB-containing lipoprotein synthesis and secretion (MTP and apoB) have shown that homozygous embryos in both cases die in utero and manifest severe neurodevelopmental abnormalities (11Farese Jr., R.V. Ruland S.L. Flynn L.M. Stokowski R.P. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1774-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Veniant M.M.

At least two arguments support that a defect α-tocopherol (vitamin E) delivery plays an important role in these lethal phenotypes (7Terasawa Y. Cases S.J. Wong J.S. Jamil H. Jothi S. Traber M.G.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). First, plasma transport and tissue distribution of vitamin E relies to a great extent on apoB-containing lipoproteins (35Berriot-Varoqueaux N. Aggerbeck L.P. Samson-Bouma M. Wetterau J.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 663-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Second, dietary or genetically induced vitamin E deficiency in pregnant rats and mice (36Urner J.A. Anat. Rec. 1931; 50: 175-187Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 37King D.W. Verma K. J. Nutr. 1967; 91: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 38Cheng D.W. Chang L.F. Bairnson T.A. Anat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1669-1672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) confers fetal resorption and embryonic exencephalus similar to the phenotypes in MTP and apoB knock-out mice. The principal role of α-tocopherol transfer protein is to mediate the incorporation of α-tocopherol into newly formed apoB-containing lipoproteins (4Kayden H.J. Traber M.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 343-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting that, in humans, the placenta shows the second highest tissue expression of the α-tocopherol transfer protein gene (surpassed only by the liver) (40Muller-Schmehl K. Beninde J. Finckh B. Florian S. Dudenhausen J.W. Brigelius-Flohe R. Schuelke M. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite this, persons with mutations in the α-tocopherol transfer protein gene (which causes severe vitamin E deficiency after birth) or with apoB deficiency (i.e. abetalipoproteinemia or familial hypobetalipoproteinemia) have been reported to develop symptoms only postnatally (35Berriot-Varoqueaux N.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that pathways other than LDL formation also can convey lipid and vitamin E transport into the developing human fetus. Another mechanism could involve the APT-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABC-AI), which is highly expressed in the placenta (43Christiansen-Weber T.A. Voland J.R. Wu Y. Ngo K. Roland B.L. Nguyen S. Peterson P.A. Fung-Leung W.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and mediates efflux of both cholesterol and vitamin E to HDL (44Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39898-39902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed, vitamin E in the fetal circulation is found both in HDL and LDL lipoproteins (45Acuff R.V. Dunworth R.G. Webb L.W. Lane J.R. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the present findings cast light on a new aspect of transplacental lipid transport, it also undeniably highlights unanswered questions such as: what is the lipid composition of placental lipoproteins and is the secretion regulated? Some of these questions could be conveniently addressed in cell culture studies. Real time-PCR studies of apoB and MTP expression in isolated placental trophoblast cells suggested that the trophoblasts are capable of making lipoproteins (data not shown). However, when we cultured two trophoblast-derived cancer cell lines (BEWO and JAR), we found only very low expression levels of apoB and MTP mRNA in those cells. Thus, future studies of human placental lipoprotein production most likely will have to employ primary cultures of trophoblast cells (46Staun-Ram E. Goldman S. Gabarin D. Shalev E. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2004; 2: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) or ex vivo dual perfusion of isolated cotyledons (47Schneider H. Dancis J. Am. J. Obstet.

As the first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the drought tolerance of this desert plant, we have isolated a dozen genes encoding transcription factors, including LtWRKY21 that encodes a protein of 314 amino acid residues.

LtWRKY21 interacts synergistically with ABA and transcriptional activators VP1 and ABI5 to control the expression of the HVA22 promoter. Co-expression of VP1, ABI5, and LtWRKY21 leads to a much higher expression of the HVA22 promoter than does the ABA treatment alone. In contrast, the Lt-WRKY21-mediated transactivation is inhibited by two known negative regulators of ABA signaling: 1-butanol, an inhibitor of phospholipase D, and abi1-1, a dominant negative mutant protein phosphatase.

In addition, the mutant studies also suggest that RNA processing plays an important role in the regulation of ABA signaling (27Kuhn J.M. Schroeder J.I. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) because several ABA response mutants are impaired in a double-stranded RNA-binding protein (28Lu C. Fedoroff N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2351-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), a mRNA CAP-binding protein (29Hugouvieux V. Kwak J.M. Schroeder J.I.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1971-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In line with these reports, an ABA-induced maize glycine-rich protein can bind to uridine- and guanosine-rich RNA fragments (30Freire M.A. Pages M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 797-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several types of cis-acting elements are involved in ABA responses, such as the 10-bp element containing an ACGT core (ACGT box, also referred as G box or ABRE), CE, RY/Sph, AT-rich elements, and Myb and Myc-binding sites (reviewed in Refs. 6Finkelstein R.R. Gampala S.S. Rock C.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S15-S45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 7Himmelbach A. Yang Y. Grill E. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In a series of mutational analyses of two ABA-responsive barley genes, HVA1 and HVA22, it was shown that in addition to the ACGT box (A3, GCCACGTACA, or A2, CCTACGTGGC), a coupling element (CE1, TGCCACCGG, or CE3, ACGCGTGTCCTC) is also necessary for the ABA response (31Shen Q. Ho T.H.D. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 32Shen Q. Zhang P. Ho T.H.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The combination of the ACGT box and the CE forms an ABA response complex, which has been shown to be the smallest ABA-responsive promoter unit (32Shen Q. Zhang P. Ho T.H.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently, the ACGT box is further narrowed down to be ACGTGGC, and CE1 and CE3 are narrowed down to be CCACC and GCGTGTC, respectively (33Shen J.Q. Casaretto J.A. Zhang P. Ho T.H.D. Plant Mol.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). WRKY genes have either one or two WRKY domains, each containing a 60-amino acid region with a core sequence, WRKYGQK, at its N-terminal end and a novel zinc finger-like motif. The WRKY domain binds specifically to the DNA sequence motif (T)(T)TGAC(C/T), which is known as the W box. Despite the strong conservation of their DNA-binding domain, the overall structures of WRKY proteins are highly divergent and can be categorized into distinct groups, which might reflect their different functions (67Eulgem T. Rushton P.J. Robatzek S. Somssich I.E. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 199-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). In this work, we identified and characterized a WRKY family transcription factor, LtWRKY21, from creosote bush. We then co-expressed an ABA-regulated reporter construct with effector constructs encoding LtWKYR21 and other known ABA signaling regulators, such as ABI1, VP1, and ABI5, in barley aleurone layers to better define the signal transduction pathways mediating ABA signaling. Our results indicate that LtWRKY21 activates ABA-regulated transcription by interacting with VP1 and ABI5 and acting downstream of ABI1. Construction of Creosote Bush cDNA Libraries—Total RNA was isolated from creosote bush leaves from the Nevada Desert research center (www.unlv.edu/Climate_Change_Research/) with the TRIzol® reagents (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA was synthesized via priming of the poly(A) tail with the primer 5′-GACTAGTTCT AGATCGCGAG CGGCCGCCCT TTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′. This primer contains four restriction sites: SpeI, XbaI, NruI, and NotI. Once the double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized, their ends were polished with Klenow. This was followed by digestion with NotI, leaving a sticky NotI site at the 3′ end and a blunt end at the 5′ end. The digested fragments were then cloned into EcoRV and NotI cut pCMVSport6 vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing of the expression sequence tags was done using Applied Biosystems Prism 3730 DNA analyzer at the Nevada Genomics Center (www.ag.unr.edu/genomics/). RNA Gel Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from creosote bush seeds with the LiCl precipitation method as described (72Zhang Z.L. Xie Z. Zou X. Casaretto J. Ho T.H. Shen Q.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was separated in a 1.2% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nylon membrane as described (73Shen Q. Uknes S.J. Ho T.H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23652-23660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene-specific fragment of LtWRKY21 was amplified by PCR using two primers: CCTCTTAGGG CATCTAATGA AGCTTCACC and CTCTTATCGT CTTTGTCGGT TCGGACATAA TC. The gene-specific fragment of the 18 S rRNA from creosote bush was amplified by PCR using GTGGTGCATG GCCGTTCTTA GTTG and ACTCGTTGGA TACATCAGTG TAGC. The membrane was probed with digoxigenin-labeled DNA using a digoxigenin probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and then twice with 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 50 °C. The signal was detected using a digoxigenin chemiluminescent detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Genomic DNA Isolation—Creosote bush seeds were germinated on wet Whatman paper saturated with imbibing solution (20 mm CaCl2 and 20 mm sodium succinate) in the dark at 26 °C. Genomic DNA was isolated from 10-day-old seedlings. Briefly, sterile shoots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a powder. The frozen tissue was suspended in CTAB extraction buffer (55 mm hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, 1.4 m NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA) plus 2% β-mercaptoethanol. The homogenate was incubated at 55 °C for 30-45 min, cooled to room temperature, and extracted twice with an equal volume of chloroform. The DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and then redissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) plus RNase A (20 μg/ml). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the DNA was precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol and then dissolved in TE buffer. Effector Construct Preparation—Three types of DNA constructs were used in the transient expression experiments: reporter, effector, and internal control (32Shen Q. Zhang P. Ho T.H.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Plasmid HVA22-GUS (73Shen Q. Uknes S.J. Ho T.H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23652-23660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the reporter construct. Plasmid pAHC18 (UBI-Luciferase), which contains the luciferase reporter gene driven by the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter (74Bruce W.B. Christensen A.H. Klein T. Fromm M. Quail P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9692-9696Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was used as an internal control construct to normalize GUS activities of the reporter construct. LtWRKY21 effector construct was prepared as follows: The LtWRKY21 effector gene was amplified from a cDNA clone by PCR using two primers: TTAGGCGCGC CATGGCATAT CCTTCTTGG and TTAGGCGCGC CTCACCAATT TCCTCCAGG, which contain an AscI site to facilitate cloning. The PCR product was confirmed by sequencing and then cloned into the AscI site of the intermediate construct containing the UBI promoter and NOS terminator (72Zhang Z.L. Xie Z. Zou X. Casaretto J. Ho T.H. Shen Q.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), generating UBI-LtWRKY21. The deletion and substitution mutants were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the method of Kunkel et al. (75Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA from plasmid UBI-LtWRKY21 was used as template. The primer CTGGCCATAT TTTCTCTAG GATATCCATCT TTAAC was used to introduce a stop codon (TAG) upstream from the WRKY domain; the primer GCCCTAAGAG GATTAAGGAC TCGAGCCAAT GACGTATCTA CCC was used to mutate the EAR motif of LtWRKY21. The UBI-ABI5, 35S-VP1, and 35S-abi1-1 effector constructs have been described (19McCarty D.R. Hattori T. Carson C.B. Vasil V. Lazar M. Vasil I.K.

Particle Bombardment and Transient Expression Assays—Transformation of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) aleurone cells by particle bombardment was carried out as described previously (73Shen Q. Uknes S.J. Ho T.H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23652-23660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, deembryonated half-seeds of Himalaya barley were imbibed for 2.5-3 days before the pericarp and testa were removed. The DNA mixture (in 1:1 molar ratio) of HVA22-GUS and UBI-Luciferase, along with or without an effector construct, was bombarded into barley embryoless half-seeds (four replicates/test construct). For each bombardment, eight prepared half-seeds were arranged in a small circle (about 1.8 cm in diameter) to maximize the bombarded surface area. After bombardment treatments, GUS and luciferase assays were performed as published before (32Shen Q. Zhang P. Ho T.H.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Preparation of GFP Fusion Constructs and Confocal Microscopy—The coding region of LtWRKY21 was inserted into the AscI site of UBI-GFP (72Zhang Z.L. Xie Z. Zou X. Casaretto J. Ho T.H. Shen Q.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) to generate UBI-GFP-LtWRKK21. Barley aleurone cells were bombarded with UBI-GFP-LtWRKY21 fusion constructs. After incubation at 24 °C for 24 h, the aleurone layers were peeled from barley half-seeds and soaked in a 5 μm SYTO17 solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The stained samples were observed and images of GFP fluorescence and SYTO17 staining were obtained simultaneously through a laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) with 488-nm excitation and 505-530-nm emission wavelengths for the green fluorescence and 633-nm excitation and 650-nm emission wavelengths for the red fluorescence in separate channels. The acquired images were processed using Paint Shop Pro 7. Northern Blot Analysis of the LtWRKY21 Gene Expression in Response to ABA Treatment—In an effort to identify creosote bush stress response genes, 43 Arabidopsis stress-inducible genes (77Seki M. Narusaka M. Ishida J. Nanjo T. Fujita M. Oono Y. Kamiya A. Nakajima M. Enju A. Sakurai T. Satou M. Akiyama K. Taji T. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Carninci P. Kawai J. Hayashizaki Y. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2002; 31: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar) were collected and searched against the creosote bush expression sequence tag database. Ten creosote bush genes encoding putative stress-inducible transcription factors of different families were identified (data not shown). We focused on WRKY proteins because they regulate plant response to various stresses (60Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J.

One of these genes, LtWRKY21, was studied in more detail. To study the expression pattern of the LtWRKY21 gene, RNA was isolated from creosote bush seeds without or with different ABA treatments for Northern analyses. The mRNA level of LtWRKY21 was abundant in the seeds at onset of the ABA treatment. ABA treatments for 12 or 24 h had little effect on the abundance of the LtWRKY21 mRNA level (Fig. 1), suggesting that ABA has little effect on regulating LtWRKY21 at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Protein Sequence Alignment of LtWRKY21 with Its Homologues—To identify the open reading frame of LtWRKY21, both strands of the cDNA clone was sequenced. The full-length of this cDNA is 945-bp, encoding a protein of 314 amino acid residues with a hydrophilic N terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence of LtWRKY21 and its homologues, including Arabidopsis WRKY40 (accession number At1g80840) (67Eulgem T. Rushton P.J. Robatzek S. Somssich I.E.

Genet. 2000; 263: 30-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and grapevine WRKY4 (accession number AY484579.1) were aligned with the ClustalW program at the default settings. LtWRKY21 shares 44-48% identity and 57-62% chemical similarity at the amino acid level with these WRKY proteins (Fig. 2). The WRKY, zinc finger motif, nucleus targeting signal sequence, and putative leucine zipper domain are highly conserved. Interestingly, among this group of homologues, only LtWRKY21 contains an EAR motif, with a consensus sequence of (L/F)DLN(L/F)XP. In LtWRKY21, this motif is LDLNLNP (Fig. 2). EAR resides in the 59-amino acid ERF domain of ERFs (80Hao D. Ohme-Takagi M. Sarai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26857-26861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, there are five ERFs, all of which bind to the GCC box (GCCGCC). AtERF1, AtERF2, and AtERF5 function as activators of GCC box-dependent transcription in Arabidopsis leaves, whereas AtERF3 and AtERF4 act as repressors (81Fujimoto S.Y. Ohta M. Usui A. Shinshi H. Ohme-Takagi M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Both AtERF3 and AtERF4 contain the EAR motif, which is also present other unrelated proteins such as SUPERMAN that regulates flowering (82Hiratsu K. Ohta M. Matsui K. Ohme-Takagi M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A related motif, LXLXLX, is necessary for the activity of some Aux/IAA repressors mediating auxin signaling (83Tiwari S.B.

https://openalex.org/W2002612346,"Nitric-oxide reductase (NOR) of a denitrifying bacterium catalyzes NO reduction to N2O at the binuclear catalytic center consisting of high spin heme b3 and non-heme FeB. The structures of the reaction intermediates in the single turnover of the NO reduction by NOR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated using optical absorption and EPR spectroscopies combined with an originally designed freeze-quench device. In the EPR spectrum of the sample, in which the fully reduced NOR was mixed with an NO solution and quenched at 0.5 ms after the mixing, two characteristic signals for the ferrous FeB–NO and the penta-coordinated ferrous heme b3–NO species were observed. The CO inhibition of its formation indicated that two NO molecules were simultaneously distributed into the two irons of the same binuclear center of the enzyme in this state. The time- and temperature-dependent EPR spectral changes indicated that the species that appeared at 0.5 ms is a transient reaction intermediate prior to the N2O formation, in good agreement with the so-called “trans” mechanism. It was also found that the final state of the enzyme in the single turnover cycle is the fully oxidized state, in which the μ-oxo-bridged ligand is absent between the two irons of its binuclear center, unlike the resting form of NOR as isolated. On the basis of these present findings, we propose a newly developed mechanism for the NO reduction reaction conducted by NOR.

Since the NO reduction reaction involves the N–O bond cleavage and the N–N bond formation, it is chemically interesting to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the NO reduction catalyzed by the metal enzymes.2NO+2H++2e−→N2O+H2O(Eq. 1) So far, two types of NOR have been isolated from bacteria and fungi (1Averill B.A. Chem.

In contrast, NOR in the bacterial system is a membrane-bound hemoprotein containing a catalytic binuclear center (1Averill B.A. Chem.

Karlin K.D. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1201-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The most studied bacterial NOR is the cytochrome bc complex, which is composed of two subunits, NorC (17 kDa) and NorB (53 kDa) (1Averill B.A. Chem.

NorC contains a low spin c-type heme (heme c) and acts as an electron mediator from the soluble cytochrome c to the catalytic subunit, NorB. The metal centers of NorB consist of a low spin b-type heme (heme b) and a catalytic binuclear center containing a high spin b-type heme (heme b3) and a non-heme iron (FeB). Since the amino acid sequence of NorB is homologous to that of the largest subunit (Subunit I) of cytochrome c oxidases, it is believed that NOR 2The abbreviation NOR implies the cytochrome bc-type NOR from the denitrifying bacteria at the following text. belongs to the superfamily of heme-copper oxidases and the two enzymes share a common ancestor (16Saraste M.

To understand the molecular mechanism of the NO reduction by NOR, the coordination and electronic structures of the binuclear center of NOR in the intermediate state must be well characterized with time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Recent optical and electrometric flow-flash experiments indicated that NO binds to heme b3 in the fully reduced NOR within 2 μs (a rate constant of 5 × 105 s–1), and the first N2O formation is completed at ∼1 ms (a rate constant of ∼103 s–1) (29Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To follow such fast reactions, we can utilize the recently developed ultra-rapid freeze-quench system, which has minimally ∼200 μs of the mixing-to-freezing time interval (37Tanaka M. Matsuura K.

Ishimori K. Mogi T. Hori H. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2288-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), in sharp contrast with conventional freezing devices having a longer mixing-to-freezing time (5∼10 ms). In the present study, we freeze-trapped the reaction intermediates of NOR that accumulate in the submillisecond time domain of the single turnover cycle of the NO reduction reaction and investigated the structure and time evolution of the trapped intermediates using optical absorption and EPR spectroscopies. Protein Purification—All purifications were carried out at 4 °C. NOR was purified from membranes of anaerobically grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. 3H. Kanagawa, S. Takase, H. Kumita, and Y. Fukumori, submitted for publication. The membrane was suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) to be the concentration of 10 g pellet/30 ml. Triton X-100 (Sigma) was added dropwise to the membrane suspension to a final concentration of 1%. The mixture was gently stirred at 4 °C overnight and then centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was layered on top of a 10–30% linear sucrose gradients (60 ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged at 125,000 × g in a Hitachi ultracentrifuge (rotor type: RP45AT) for 20 h at 4 °C. The brown fractions were collected manually and applied to anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose (fast flow, Amersham Biosciences) column (volume: 60 ml), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The proteins absorbed on the column were eluted with a linear gradient produced from 200 ml each of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and the buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. The eluates were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and subjected to a second anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose column (volume: 20 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The proteins absorbed on the column were washed with ∼5-fold volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.05% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM; Dojindo Co.) and eluted with the buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. The eluates were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% DM and applied to ceramic hydroxyapatite Type II (40 mm, Bio-Rad) column (volume: 40 ml), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% DM. The eluates were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.05% DM. Purified protein was concentrated up to 250 μm and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The biochemical analysis of this purified NOR practically reproduced the results reported for NOR from other denitrifying bacteria such as Paracoccus denitrificans and Pseudomonas stutzeri. 3H.

Sample Preparation by the Ultra-rapid Freeze-Quench Device—Some of the authors reported previously on the novel freeze-quench device, which has the time interval of 0.2 ms from mixing to freezing (37Tanaka M.

Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Mogi T. Hori H. Morishima I.

Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Mogi T. Hori H. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2288-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In brief, two solutions continuously supplied from a syringe pump are mixed in the T-shaped micro-channel and form a jet that flushes against rotary silver disks cooled at 77 K by liquid nitrogen. Special care was taken to maintain the anaerobic condition of the device. The sample inlet was designed to attach a septum, through which the fully reduced enzyme could be transferred anaerobically. Before the introduction of the sample solution, the sample loop was washed twice with the degassed buffer and once with the buffer containing 10 mm dithionite, which was prepared anaerobically with the nitrogen-saturated buffer. The interval between the sample introduction and the freeze-quench procedure was kept within a few minutes. The stock solution containing 250 μm NOR in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 0.05% DM was degassed and fully reduced with dithionite (100 mm) at a final concentration of ∼1 mm. The fully reduced enzyme was introduced anaerobically into the sample loop and pushed toward the mixer by the dithionite buffer introduced in one of the syringes. The other syringe was filled with the NO-saturated (1.9 mm at 20 °C) buffer. The fully reduced enzyme and the NO-saturated buffer were mixed with a volume ratio of 1 to 1 at room temperature (∼20 °C) and freeze-quenched using the device. The frozen powder in liquid nitrogen was manually collected and transferred to quartz EPR tubes (5 mmϕ) or optical cells (path length: 1 mm) for the spectroscopic measurements. The frozen powder was packed with ∼1.5 cm high in the EPR tubes, the volume of which was comparable with ∼100 μl of the frozen solution. To remove the large excess of dissolved NO in the frozen powder, the EPR tubes were immersed in a methanol bath cooled by dry ice at 193 K, evacuated, filled with nitrogen gas, and sealed. Measurements of EPR Spectroscopy—The X-band (9.45 GHz) EPR spectrum was obtained with a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 910 continuous flow cryostat system, in which the temperature was monitored with an Oxford instruments ITC503 intelligent temperature controller. The measurements were carried out at 5, 11, and 35 K. The microwave power and 100-kHz field modulation were 5 mW and 1 mT at 5 and 11 K, and 2.5 mW and 0.5 mT at 35 K, respectively. To estimate the signal intensities for Fe–NO species of the frozen powdery samples, the double integrations of those signals were compared with the corresponding ones of the g = 4.0 signal from the non-heme Fe–NO species of soybean lipoxygenase (Sigma) (39Galpin J.R.

The set of intensity standards were measured at the three different concentrations, and the linear relationship with the protein concentrations and the double integrations of those signals was observed. The signal intensity of the high spin heme b3 was similarly estimated using met-myoglobin as a standard. The intensity data for all sample was the average of two to four independent experiments. The error of the quantification for those signal intensity was estimated at most ± 10%. Measurements of Low Temperature Absorption Spectroscopy of Powdery Frozen Sample—The absorption spectra of the powdery frozen samples were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda19 spectrophotometer, which was modified to incorporate an Oxford instruments DN1704 cryostat and frosted quartz windows (37Tanaka M.

The intensity of the reference beam was adjusted using a black block to compensate for the intensity decrease of the sample beam. The sample temperature (∼120 K) was monitored by a thermocouple inserted directly in the cell. The slit width and the scan rate were 2 nm and 120 nm/min, respectively. Since it is difficult to obtain accurate absorbance from the absorption spectra for the powdery frozen samples, the intensity scales for the spectra presented in Fig. 5 were arbitrary. Trace a of Fig. 1 shows the X-band EPR spectrum for the oxidized (resting) form of NOR isolated from Ps. aeruginosa, which was measured at 11 K. In this spectrum, the signals derived from ferric low spin heme b (gz = 3.00, gy = 2.26, gx ∼ 1.4) and heme c (gz = 3.56) were stoichiometrically observed, while the ferric high spin heme b3 and non-heme FeB in the binuclear center was EPR-silent, due to an antiferromagnetic coupling through the μ-oxo bridge ligand between the two iron atoms, as was studied previously (18Girsch P. de Vries S.

The non-stoichiometric signals observed at g =∼6 and 4.3 would be derived from a trace amount (∼3% by our estimation) of the uncoupled heme b3 and FeB, respectively. These EPR spectral features for NOR from Ps. aeruginosa were essentially the same as those reported for the enzymes from denitrifying bacteria Pa. denitrificans and Ps. stutzeri (18Girsch P. de Vries S.

Before examining the NO reduction reaction by NOR, we tested our freeze-quench device, by which the resting enzyme was mixed with an N2-saturated buffer and then frozen at 0.5 ms after the mixing. In the EPR spectrum of the resultant powdery sample (trace b of Fig. 1), the positions and the relative intensities of the signals arising from ferric low spin hemes b and c are exactly the same as those of the corresponding signals in the static spectrum (trace a), but their absolute intensities were uniformly reduced to approximately ∼15%. The observation indicated that the powdery sample prepared by the freeze-quench device was diluted to ∼40 μm from the NOR stock solution (250 μm), probably because the stock solution in the sample loop was diluted with the buffer that pushed the sample solution into the mixer. This recovery rate (∼15%) was independent of the mixing-to-freezing time intervals in the range of 0.5 ∼ 10 ms. We also measured the EPR spectrum of the fully reduced enzyme mixed with an N2-saturated buffer (trace c of Fig. 1), in which no EPR signal was observed, except for the signals from the uncoupled heme b3 and FeB. Time-dependent EPR Spectral Change—To follow the NO reduction reaction catalyzed by NOR, the fully reduced enzyme was mixed with an NO-saturated buffer and then freeze-trapped at 0.5 ms after the mixing. In the resultant EPR spectrum (trace d of Fig. 1), two EPR signals were newly observed at g = 4.0 and ∼2, suggesting formation of a new species. The signal at g = 4.0 was enhanced at 5 K, while it was invisible in the spectrum measured at 35 K (data not shown). The g value and line width of this signal were the same as those previously reported for the {Fe–NO}7 system with the S = 3/2 ground state of non-heme iron proteins and their model complexes, which is formed by the NO coordination to the ferrous non-heme iron (40Nelson M.J.

In the S = 3/2 {Fe–NO}7 complex, the bound NO is formally reduced by the ferrous iron to yield NO– and a ferric iron that are antiferromagnetically coupled (48Jackson T.A. Yikilmaz E. Miller A-F. Brunold T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8348-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we could assign the signal at g = 4.0 to the FeB–NO complex of the binuclear center of NOR. On the other hand, the signals around g ∼2 in the spectrum at 11 K seemingly consisted of a mixture of two components. The broad signal at g < 2.0 would be caused by an excess amount of free NO molecule included in the frozen powder, since the signal was not observed in the spectrum measured at 35 K, as shown in trace d of Fig. 1B. In this spectrum at 35 K, another signal at g ∼ 2 was enhanced and clearly exhibited a set of three lines, which can be assigned to the hyperfine splitting by the 14N atom (I = 1) of the bound NO to a low spin ferrous heme (gz = 2.012, gx,y ∼ 2.08, NOAz = 1.6 mT).

Recently, increasing evidence indicated a crucial role of JNKs in mitochondrial dysfunctions with subsequent initiation of neuronal apoptosis. These findings are particularly relevant because mitochondrial dysfunctions are central to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or Huntington's disease (19Cash A.D. Perry G. Ogawa O. Raina A.K. Zhu X. Smith M.A. Neuroscientist. 2002; 8: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and are important for neuronal excitotoxicity in general (20Nicholls D.G.

First, JNKs associate with the mitochondria, e.g. following ionizing radiation (21Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.N. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z.M.

This study analyzes the contribution of different JNK isoforms to 6-OHDA-induced death of PC12 cells. Neurotoxicity caused by 6-OHDA is widely used as an experimental model for the neuronal pathology of Parkinson's disease; it involves mitochondrial dysfunction (38Cohen G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and activation of the MAP kinase kinase (MKK)/JNK/c-Jun pathway (11Choi W.S. Yoon S.Y. Oh T.H. Choi E.J. O'Malley K.L. Oh Y.J. J.

Activation of JNKs might be particularly relevant for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Under experimental conditions, inhibition of MKK4, JNKs, and their nuclear substrate c-Jun has a significant protective effect against the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the decay of dopaminergic fibers in the striatum (10Luo Y. Umegaki H. Wang X. Abe R. Roth G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3756-3764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Crocker S.J. Lamba W.R. Smith P.D. Callaghan S.M.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In consequence, the indirect JNK inhibitor CEP-1347, an antagonist of the mixed lineage kinases, currently undergoes phase II/III trial as add-on for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in humans. We used the model system of PC12 cells, because these cells express only JNK1 and JNK2, but not JNK3 (43Butterfield L. Zentrich E. Beekman A. Heasley L.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 44Mielke K. Damm A. Yang D.D. Herdegen T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), allowing a subtractive evaluation of the functions of JNK1 and JNK2. Here we provide evidence that JNK2, but not JNK1, is a central mediator of cytochrome c release following 6-OHDA-induced death of PC12 cells. In contrast to the JNK1 isoform, JNK2 translocates to the nucleus and the mitochondria where it acts downstream of MKK4. Thus, the difference in activation and translocation of JNK isoforms suggests the existence of separate apoptotic JNK signalosomes. These findings have considerable implications for therapeutic strategies targeting JNK signaling in neurodegenerative diseases. Cell Culture and Treatment of Cells—PC12 cells were cultured as described previously (45Klettner A. Herdegen T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transfected cell clones were kept in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 to maintain selection. Subconfluent cells were incubated with 25 μm and 50 μm 6-OHDA, respectively, for the indicated times. One or 2 μm SP600125 (in Me2SO) were added 30 min before 6-OHDA stimulation, if not indicated otherwise. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—cDNA of JNK2α1 (SAPKA/SAPK αI; GenBank™ accession number L27111) from rat brain was mutated by replacing Thr183 with an alanine and Tyr185 with a phenylalanine, using PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting dominant-negative (dn)JNK2 was inserted into the expression vector pEGFP-C3 as a HindIII/SalI fragment. Transfection of the dnJNK2-EGFP construct or the EGFP vector was performed using the TransFast transfection system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Individual stable clones that expressed the dnJNK2-EGFP construct or EGFP were selected and used for experiments as described recently (46Waetzig V. Herdegen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 567-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative JNK1 was kindly provided by Dr. Tuula Kallunki (Danish Research School in Molecular Cancer Research, Copenhagen, Denmark). Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay—Cell viability was investigated by trypan blue exclusion in combination with cell counting as described previously (45Klettner A. Herdegen T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At least 4 sets of independent experiments were conducted. If not indicated otherwise, cells were counted 24 h post-stimulus. Cell counting was in part performed by investigators blinded to the identity of the samples in order to avoid bias. Whole Cell Extracts and Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Whole cell lysates were generated from subconfluent cells. Before harvesting, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. For whole cell extracts, cells were resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2% SDS, 1% phosphatase inhibitor, and 1% protease inhibitor), incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, briefly sonicated, and centrifuged to remove insoluble material (15,000 × g for 15 min). To obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, cells were lysed as described previously (46Waetzig V. Herdegen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 567-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as standard. The purity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was tested with an antibody directed against activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2). Preparation of Mitochondria—For mitochondria preparation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. All the following steps were conducted at 4 °C. Cells were washed and resuspended in sucrose buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor), stored for 1 h on ice, and lysed by aspirating cells through a 27-gauge syringe. The lysate was centrifuged at 750 × g, and supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. The pellet was washed in sucrose buffer and lysed in denaturing lysis buffer (see “Whole Cell Extracts and Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts”). The absence of relevant cytoplasmic contamination was confirmed by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase activity (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions was tested with an antibody directed against GRP75. Western Blot—Whole cell lysate, nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates, or mitochondrial lysate were separated on a 15 (cytochrome c) or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Western blot was conducted as described previously (45Klettner A. Herdegen T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (cleaved caspase-3, JNK/SAPK, PARP-1, and phospho-c-Jun), Chemicon (caspase-8), Pharmingen (cytochrome c, JNK1), Promega (phospho-JNK), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (ATF2, caspase-3, JIP-1, JNK2, MKK4, MKK7, and phospho-MKK4), Sigma (β-actin), and Stressgen (GRP75). The MKP7 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Alan Whitmarsh (University of Manchester, UK). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from PC12 cells 18 and 24 h after addition of 25 μm 6-OHDA using Trizol (Invitrogen). 0.2 volume of chloroform was added to the Trizol extract, and both were mixed and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. Samples were then centrifuged (15 min; 16,000 × g; 4 °C), and the upper phase was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube. The RNA was precipitated with 2-propanol and washed with 75% ethanol. Pellets were air-dried and dissolved in RNase-free (diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated) water. After quantification and quality validation, the remaining RNA was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. The RT reaction was performed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) for RT-PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions with 0.5 μg of RNA for each sample. The subsequent PCR was carried out with the PCR reagent system (Invitrogen) by using 2 μl of cDNA, 2 μm MgCl2, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 0.2 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase. For normalization, the histone H2A variant H2A.z was used. The absence of contamination was checked by negative control assays, in which RNA in the RT reaction or cDNA in the PCR were replaced by diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Amplification was performed with the following primer sets: 1) H2A.z: sense 5′-CGTATTCATCGACACCTGAAA-3′, and antisense 5′-CTGTTGTCCTTTCTTCCCAAT-3′; 2) bim: sense 5′-CAACACAAACCCCAAGTCCT-3′, and antisense 5′-TCTTCCGCCTCTCGGTAAT-3′. The specificity of the primer pairs was verified by comparative alignment using the BLAST data base (NCBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All amplicons were cloned and sequence-verified. Statistics—All experiments were carried out independently 3–6 times. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPrism software using one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Means were compared using the post-hoc Bonferroni test, and significance was defined for p < 0.05. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Activation of JNK and c-Jun—In the initial experiments, we analyzed the effect of 6-OHDA on the distribution and/or activation of JNKs and their nuclear substrate, the transcription factor c-Jun. To test the purity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, we performed Western blots with an antibody directed against the nuclear protein ATF2 (Fig. 1A). Twenty-five and 50 μm 6-OHDA dose-dependently induced a distinct phosphorylation of JNKs in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1B), whereas 10 μm 6-OHDA was less effective (Fig. 1C). Concomitantly, the N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun dose-dependently increased in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). Compared with other strong JNK stimuli, 6-OHDA evoked a more delayed time course of JNK activation with maximal activation after 4 h in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1B). According to this time course, the majority of experiments was performed at the time point of maximal JNK activity, i.e. 4 h after 6-OHDA stimulation (see below). The concentration of 6-OHDA also affected the distribution of JNK isoforms. Whereas the constitutive presence of JNK1 and JNK2 did not change in the cytoplasm following 6-OHDA, the amount of JNK2 dose-dependently increased in the nucleus between 10 and 50 μm 6-OHDA (Fig. 1C). Thus, the augmentation in total phospho-JNK in the nucleus paralleled the increase of JNK2. Most interestingly, the pattern of the JNK isoforms did not only differ among each other but also between different compartments with a prominent JNK1 band at 46 kDa and a prominent JNK2 band at 54 kDa in the nucleus, whereas the 54- and the 46-kDa bands, respectively, were more pronounced in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of JNK Protects against 6-OHDA-induced Death— For inhibition of JNK activity, the direct and specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 was added to the cell culture medium 30 min prior to 6-OHDA. To demonstrate the SP600125-mediated inhibition of catalytic JNK activity, we determined the phosphorylation of the nuclear JNK substrate c-Jun. Application of 1 or 2 μm SP600125 substantially reduced or completely prevented the N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas the phosphorylation of JNKs by upstream kinases was not affected (Fig. 2A). By application of SP600125 we could demonstrate to what extent JNKs contributed to cell death induced by 6-OHDA. As analyzed in trypan blue exclusion assays, addition of 25 μm 6-OHDA caused substantial cell death (36%) after 24 h (Fig. 2B). The preincubation with 1 or 2 μm SP600125 rescued 51 and 68% of the otherwise dying PC12 cells (Fig. 2B). The time window for SP600125-mediated protection is smaller than 4 h, because JNK inhibition was still effective when applied 2 h but not 4 h after 6-OHDA stimulation (Fig. 2C). The inhibition of JNKs, however, does not provide a permanent protection. Seventy two hours after 25 μm 6-OHDA (without change of the medium), the survival rates did not differ between the SP600125-treated cells and controls (data not shown). Finally, SP600125 could not prevent cell death induced by 50 μm 6-OHDA at any time point investigated (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Protection of PC12 cells by JNK inhibition depends on the 6-OHDA dose. Trypan blue exclusion assays 24 h after stimulation showed that JNK inhibition, either by pretreatment with 2 μm SP600125 (30 min) or transfection with dnJNK2, significantly reduced cell death in response to 25 μm 6-OHDA, whereas transfection of PC12 cells with dnJNK1 had no protective effects. Cell death triggered by 50 μm 6-OHDA, however, could not be prevented by JNK inhibition. Controls = 100%. +++, p < 0.001, refers to JNK inhibition versus 6-OHDA. Data represent six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Protection by Dominant-negative JNK2—The translocation of JNK2 into the nucleus, which paralleled the increase of nuclear JNK activity, raised the question whether JNK2 is responsible for 6-OHDA-mediated death rather than the more “physiological” or even “protective” JNK1 (16Chang L. Jones Y. Ellisman M.H. Goldstein L.S. Karin M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 35Sanna M.G. da Silva Correia J. Luo Y. Chuang B.

For this purpose, PC12 cells were stably transfected with EGFP-tagged dnJNK1 and dnJNK2. Dominant-negative JNK2, but not dnJNK1, protected PC12 cells from cell death induced by 25 μm 6-OHDA (Fig. 3). However, similar to SP600125, dnJNK2 did not protect against 50 μm 6-OHDA, and its protective effect was also lost after 72 h (see above). Transfection of dnJNK2 interfered with the activation of JNKs. Most importantly, dnJNK2 reduced the pool of phosphorylated total JNK in the nucleus after stimulation with 6-OHDA to a much higher extent than in the cytoplasm, whereas dnJNK1 had no such effect (Fig. 4A). Vector controls neither affected cell death (Fig. 3) nor the activation of endogenous JNKs (Fig. 4A). Transfection with dnJNK2 strongly reduced the 6-OHDA-induced translocation of endogenous JNK2 to the nucleus in contrast to the findings in wild type (Fig. 1C) or vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). The construct itself was almost completely excluded from the nucleus because it was barely detectable in nuclear preparations but was clearly visible in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). Translocation of JNK2, but Not JNK1, to the Mitochondria— Because JNK2 translocated to the nucleus after 6-OHDA treatment, we investigated whether JNK2 also translocates to the mitochondria, the central target organelles of 6-OHDA-mediated pathology. We prepared mitochondrial preparations devoid of cytoplasmic contaminations. To test the purity of our mitochondrial preparations, we performed Western blots with an antibody directed against the mitochondrial heat shock protein GRP75 (Fig. 5A). In untreated PC12 cells, mitochondrial preparations contained a substantial amount of JNK1, and this pool did not change following 6-OHDA treatment (Fig. 5B). Most interestingly, we observed a translocation of dnJNK1 to the mitochondria after addition of 6-OHDA (Fig. 5B). In contrast to JNK1, the amount of JNK2 present at the mitochondria increased at the mitochondria between 1 and 2 h and reached its maximal level at 4 h (Fig. 5C). Dominant-negative JNK2 could not be detected at the mitochondria. Moreover, dnJNK2 did not interfere with the increase of endogenous JNK2 at the mitochondria following 25 μm 6-OHDA (Fig. 5C) or with the mitochondrial pool of JNK1 (Fig. 5B). A 30-min preincubation with the direct JNK inhibitor SP600125 (2 μm) prevented the translocation of JNK2 to the mitochondria"
https://openalex.org/W1967681616,"The function of protein and RNA molecules depends on complex epistatic interactions between sites. Therefore, the deleterious effect of a mutation can be suppressed by a compensatory second-site substitution1,2. In relating a list of 86 pathogenic mutations in human tRNAs encoded by mitochondrial genes to the sequences of their mammalian orthologs, we noted that 52 pathogenic mutations were present in normal tRNAs of one or several nonhuman mammals. We found at least five mechanisms of compensation for 32 pathogenic mutations that destroyed a Watson-Crick pair in one of the four tRNA stems: restoration of the affected Watson-Crick interaction (25 cases), strengthening of another pair (4 cases), creation of a new pair (8 cases), changes of multiple interactions in the affected stem (11 cases) and changes involving the interaction between the loop and stem structures (3 cases). A pathogenic mutation and its compensating substitution are fixed in a lineage in rapid succession, and often a compensatory interaction evolves convergently in different clades. At least 10%, and perhaps as many as 50%, of all nucleotide substitutions in evolving mammalian tRNAs participate in such interactions, indicating that the evolution of tRNAs proceeds along highly epistatic fitness ridges."
https://openalex.org/W2073560608,"It is established that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from bone marrow are a source of osteoblast progenitors in vivo and under appropriate conditions, differentiate into osteoblasts ex vivo. Because hMSCs are recovered by iliac crest aspirate and enriched by virtue of their adherence to tissue culture plastic, the cells provide a convenient ex vivo model for the study of osteogenic tissue repair in an experimentally accessible system. Recent advances in the field of skeletal development and osteogenesis have demonstrated that signaling through the canonical wingless (Wnt) pathway is critical for the differentiation of progenitor cell lines into osteoblasts. Inhibition of such signals can predispose MSCs to cell cycle entry and inhibit osteogenesis. Here, we report that synthetic peptides derived from the second cysteine-rich domain of the canonical Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) have utility in controlling the growth and recovery of hMSCs from bone marrow stroma. Three peptides corresponding to residues 217–269 in Dkk-1 were each found to enhance the proliferation of hMSCs in culture over 2 days. The most active peptide exhibited agonistic characteristics in that it ablated the proliferation lag observed when cultures of hMSCs receive fresh medium. It also reduced the expression of endogenous Dkk-1 (Gregory, C. A., Singh, H., and Prockop, D. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 28067–28078). When the cytosolic level of β-catenin was elevated by addition of LiCl to cultures of hMSCs, the peptide also accelerated degradation of β-catenin on withdrawal of lithium. A second peptide, corresponding to residues 184–204 had preferential and high affinity for hMSCs in the log phase of proliferation. Peptide overlay assays on hMSC lysates confirmed that the peptide bound to a 184-kDa protein corresponding to the molecular mass of LRP6. Cells recovered by this peptide had enhanced osteogenic potential but less chondrogenic potential compared with controls. Because Wnt antagonists increase the number of non-committed hMSCs in culture, they may be of use in increasing the rate of osseous wound healing in vivo by increasing the level of systemically migrating hMSCs. Therefore, such molecules could contribute to the development of a novel family of pharmaceutical agents for the improvement of the healing process in humans.

Science. 1997; 276: 263-272Crossref Scopus (4157) Google Scholar). In previous studies on secreted factors that regulate the growth of hMSCs, we found that synthesis of the canonical Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) was required before the cells entered the cell cycle (10Gregory C.A. Singh H. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28067-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we investigated the role of canonical Wnt signaling in hMSC growth and differentiation into osteoblasts. In addition to its proliferative properties, canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in a variety of developmental processes (11Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Gene Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). More specifically, Wnt signaling apparently plays an essential role in the differentiation of pluripotent cell lines into osteoblasts (12Bain G. Muller T. Wang X. Papkoff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13Rawadi G. Vayssiere B. Dunn F. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1842-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) and natural inhibitors of Wnt signaling can inhibit osteogenesis (13Rawadi G. Vayssiere B. Dunn F. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1842-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 14Tian E. Zhan F. Walker R. Rasmussen E. Ma Y. Barlogie B. Shaughnessy J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that a high systemic level of Dkk-1 is likely to contribute to the persistence of osteolytic lesions in cases of multiple myeloma (14Tian E. Zhan F. Walker R. Rasmussen E. Ma Y. Barlogie B. Shaughnessy J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Conversely, mutations in the LRP6 receptor that prevent the binding of the canonical Wnt inhibitor cause abnormally high bone density (15Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Canonical Wnt signaling is activated by binding of some forms of the Wnt ligands to the receptors, Frizzled and LRP6, that in turn recruit the cytoplasmic bridging molecule, Dishevelled. In the active form, Dishevelled inhibits the action of glycogen synthetase kinase 3, which in turn, reduces the phosphorylation of β-catenin (16Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6 (Correction (1997) Curr. Biol.7, 196): 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Because only phosphorylated β-catenin is degraded by the ubiquitin-mediated pathway (18Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 19Kikuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the levels of unphosphorylated β-catenin in the cytosol are raised. There are two known fates for cytosolic β-catenin: one is that the protein may be localized to the membrane where it contributes to the formation of adherens junctions that mediate intercellular contacts and may play a role in transducing external signals into the cell (20Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The other fate is that stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it complexes with transcription factors that either promote differentiation or proliferation (21Van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Pandur P. Maurus D. Kuhl M. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Dkk-1 apparently acts to prevent the coalescence of LRP6 and Frizzled by binding to LRP6 via its carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich (Cys2) domain (23Brott B.K. Sokol S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6100-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 24Li L. Mao J. Sun L. Liu W. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5977-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether peptide derivatives of Dkk-1 can agonize or antagonize Dkk-1, we synthesized seven biotinylated 21-mer peptides corresponding to the Cys2 domain of the protein. The peptides were assessed for hMSC bioactivity in ex vivo assays of hMSC binding, osteogenic differentiation, β-catenin localization, and proliferation. Three peptides corresponding to residues 217–269 in Dkk-1 were each found to enhance the proliferation of hMSCs in culture over 2 days. The most active peptide exhibited agonistic characteristics in that it ablated the proliferation lag observed when cultures of hMSCs receive fresh medium. It also reduced the expression of endogenous Dkk-1 (10Gregory C.A. Singh H. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28067-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). When the cytosolic level of β-catenin was elevated by addition of LiCl to cultures of hMSCs, the peptide also accelerated degradation of β-catenin on withdrawal of lithium. A second peptide, corresponding to residues 184–204, had a preferential and high affinity for hMSCs in the log phase of proliferation. Peptide overlay assays on hMSC lysates confirmed that the peptide bound to a 184-kDa protein corresponding to the molecular mass of LRP6. Magnetic activated cell sorting using the peptide as an affinity ligand allowed the enrichment of hMSCs from human bone marrow aspirates with ∼50% efficiency. To test whether positive canonical Wnt signaling affected differentiation of hMSCs to osteoblasts, we mimicked the effect of Wnt by the addition of LiCl to cultures of differentiating hMSCs. In the presence of LiCl and osteo-inductive medium, the expression of alkaline phosphatase by hMSCs was activated and reached maximal expression in 1 week compared with 3 weeks in controls. The results suggest the use of agents that regulate the canonical Wnt pathway for control and recovery of hMSCs. Peptides corresponding to Dkk-1, other Wnt inhibitors, or the Wnt ligands themselves could contribute to the development of a novel class of pharmaceutically active compounds for the control of tissue repair in humans. Furthermore, previously described agents that affect the canonical Wnt pathway may be useful for controlling hMSCs in the treatment of bone fractures and skeletal lesions such as those observed in multiple myeloma (14Tian E. Zhan F. Walker R. Rasmussen E. Ma Y. Barlogie B. Shaughnessy J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Tissue Culture of hMSCs—Bone marrow aspirates of ∼2 ml were drawn from healthy donors ranging in age from 19 to 49 years under an Institutional Review Board approved protocol. The adherent nucleated cells were separated from the aspirate and cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum as described previously (8Sekiya I. Vuoristo J.T.

J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). After 14 days in culture, adherent cells were recovered by incubation with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin and 1 mm EDTA (Fisher) for 5 to 7 min at 37 °C (Fisher). For the analysis of hMSCs at the log phase of growth, the cells were re-plated in 54-cm2 plates (Costar, Fisher) at a density of 100 cells per cm2 and allowed to adhere for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing various concentrations (4–15 mm) of tissue culture grade LiCl or KCl (Fisher) and allowed to proliferate for 7 days prior to recovery and cell counting or Western blotting. For osteogenesis assays, the cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells per cm2 and allowed to form a confluent monolayer for 14 days with changes of medium every 3–4 days. For Alizarin Red S staining, the cultures were established in 6-well plates (Costar, Fisher) and for RNA extraction, the cultures were established in 54-cm2 plates (Costar). Peptides—Seven peptides (21 residues long) were synthesized by Tufts University Medical School Core Facility (Boston, MA) using an ABI 431 Peptide synthesizer employing FastMoc chemistry. To facilitate the synthesis of some of the peptides, some cysteine residues were substituted by serine residues. The peptides were biotinylated at the amino terminus and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. To confirm purity and identity, the peptides were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Ciphergen Chip Reader, Ciphergen Biosystems, Freemont, CA) as described previously (10Gregory C.A. Singh H. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28067-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—hMSCs were seeded at 1000 cells per cm2 in 4-cm2 chamber slides (Nunc, Fisher). When the hMSCs established a monolayer of the appropriate density, the slides were washed in PBS and the cells fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were washed, then incubated for 1 h in a block buffer consisting of PBS containing 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). After block, the slides were incubated in anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1 in 800 (clone 5H10, Chemicon) for 2 h. The slides were then washed 3 times in block buffer and incubated in Alexa Fluor 594-(red) or 486 (green)-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). In some cases, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to stain actin filaments at a concentration of 1:1000 in PBS. Slides were dried and mounted with 4′,6-diaminido-2-phenylindole containing mounting reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized on an upright epifluorescent microscope (Eclipse 800, Nikon). For peptide binding assays, the hMSCs were grown to a density of ∼3000 cells per cm2 (log phase) or 20,000 cells per cm2 in 10-cm2 6-well plates (Costar, Fisher). The monolayers were fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for 2 min only. The monolayers were blocked in peptide block buffer consisting of PBS containing 5% (w/v) highly purified BSA (Sigma) for 1 h. Solutions (10 μg ml-1) of biotinylated peptides were prepared in peptide block buffer and incubated with the hMSCs for 1 h. The slides were washed 3 times, and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes). Peptide Overlay Assays—A lysate of hMSCs was prepared from cultures at the log phase of growth. Approximately 3 million hMSCs on six 154-cm2 tissue culture dishes were washed in PBS and scraped into 10 ml of PBS. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and the equivalent of 1 half-tablet of Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). The lysate was sheared by passes through a 18-gauge needle and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min prior to electrophoresis and blotting. Fifteen μl (45,000 cells) were loaded onto a 4–12% NuPage bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride. The filter was washed in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), blocked in PBST containing 5% (w/v) powdered milk, then incubated in PBST containing 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Chemicon) for 15 h at 4 °C to recover some of the structure of the denatured proteins. Each peptide was incubated with one of the blotted lanes at 10 μg ml-1 in PBST for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times in PBS, and then incubated in PBST containing streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:2000 (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBST, the blots were incubated in peroxidase substrate (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 75 μm paracoumaric acid, 500 μm luminol, and 0.006% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide, Sigma) for 5 min prior to exposure to photographic film (Kodak autoradiography, Sigma) or digital imaging (Typhoon Imager, Bio-Rad). Magnetic Cell Sorting—Bone marrow aspirates (about 2 ml) were recovered from the iliac crest. The nucleated cells were enriched by density gradient centrifugation as described previously (8Sekiya I.

Up to 2 million cells were incubated with incubation buffer containing 10 μg ml-1 peptide B for 1 h. After washing in excess wash buffer (PBS containing 1 mm EDTA) the cells were separated by an automated magnetic-activated cell sorter fitted with a column containing streptavidin-conjugated beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). The POSSELS program was used with wash buffer as the mobile phase. Negative controls lacked peptide but were separated using identical protocols. Conditioned medium was prepared by incubating standard fresh hMSC medium with hMSCs at the log phase of growth for 2 days. After 2 days, the medium was filtered through a 0.2-μm2 membrane and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen prior to use. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—FACS sorting was achieved using an automated instrument (Cytomics FC 500, Beckman Coulter). The phycoerythrin-conjugated ABCG2 transporter antibody (clone 5D3) was purchased from eBioScience (San Diego, CA). All other fluorophore-conjugated antibodies used for FACS analysis, including isotype controls, were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Approximately 50,000 hMSCs were incubated in the presence of the manufacturer's recommended concentration of antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature. Prior to FACS analysis, the cells were washed in excess PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 1 mm EDTA. Colony Forming Unit Assay—Colony forming unit assays were carried out as described previously (10Gregory C.A. Singh H. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28067-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, hMSCs were counted by hemacytometer and 100 cells were transferred to a 154-cm2 tissue culture dish (Costar, Fisher) containing 30 ml of culture medium. After 3 weeks, the dishes were washed in PBS and 1% (v/v) crystal violet in 50% methanol was added to stain the colonies. After 15 min, the dishes were washed thoroughly with water and allowed to dry. Colonies over 2-mm diameter were counted. Osteogenic Differentiation and Quantification of Alizarin Red S Staining—For standard osteogenic differentiation, confluent monolayers of hMSCs were incubated in medium supplemented with 10-8 m dexamethasone, 50 μg ml-1 ascorbic acid, and 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate (Sigma) for 21 days with changes of medium every 5 days. For testing the effects of lithium, cultures were incubated under the same conditions but with the addition of 10 mm LiCl or KCl and incubation for up to 30 days. Quantification of staining was carried out using a modified version of a previously described procedure (27Gregory C.A. Gunn W.G. Peister A. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cellular aggregates were washed in PBS, pressed flat with a Tefloncoated spatula, and fixed in formalin for 15 min. The cells were then stained with 40 mm Alizarin Red S for 30 min and washed 4 times with PBS. The stained cells were then transferred to a 2-ml screw-top microcentrifuge tube and incubated at 85 °C for 15 min in 1 ml of 10% (v/v) acetic acid overlaid with 0.5 ml of light mineral oil. The extraction was cooled on ice and then centrifuged at 21,000 × g and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube containing 10% (v/v) 10% ammonium hydroxide. The red solution was then transferred to a 96-well plate and read at 450 nm on a plate reader (Bio-Rad). Adipogenic Differentiation and Quantification of Oil Red O Staining—All reagents were purchased from Sigma. Confluent monolayers of hMSCs in 6-well plates (10 cm2 per well) were incubated in medium supplemented with 10-8 m dexamethasone, 5 × 10-8 m isobutylmethylxanthine, and 5 × 10-7 m indomethacin. After 21 days, the adipogenic cultures were fixed in 10% formalin for 15 min and stained with fresh Oil Red-O solution in 60% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol in PBS for 20 min. The dishes were washed 3 times with excess PBS. Stained dishes were extracted with 2 ml of extraction buffer containing 50% (v/v) ethanol and 2% (w/v) SDS for 15 min at room temperature. Three aliquots (200 μl) of the extracted Oil Red O was transferred to a 96-well plate and quantified by absorbance measurement at 405 nm (Bio-Rad). The linear range of detection was determined by standard solutions of Oil Red O. Chondrogenic Differentiation—Chondrogenic differentiation was carried out in accordance with Sekiya et al. (8Sekiya I. Vuoristo J.T. Larson B.L. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4397-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) on 200,000 cells recovered by either peptide B recovery or standard means. Evaluation of Cell Number—For assay of proliferation, cells were quantified by fluorescent labeling of nucleic acids (CyQuant dye; Molecular Probes) using a described previously method (10Gregory C.A. Singh H. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28067-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and a microplate fluorescence reader (FLX800; Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) set to 480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission. Data from 3 separate assays were statistically analyzed using the two-tailed Student's t test. Experiments were repeated using hMSCs from two donors. Extraction of Cytoskeletal Fractions and Western Blotting—Triton-insoluble fractions were prepared using a protocol by Ko et al. (26Ko K. Arora P. Lee W. McCulloch C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C147-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications (10Gregory C.A. Singh H. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28067-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, one million cells were suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma). Lysis proceeded for 10 min on ice followed by a 60-s centrifugation at 800 × g to remove particulate bodies. The cytoskeletal pellet was separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% SDS. The concentration of protein was measured by Bradford assay (Sigma) prior to Western blotting. Electrophoresis was carried out using commercial reagents and systems (Novex; Invitrogen). Approximately 10 μg of protein were added to the appropriate volume of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The samples were heated at 100 °C for 2 min and electrophoresed on a 4–12% NuPage bis-Tris gel using the MES buffering system followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride for 1 h. Filters were blocked in PBST containing 5% (w/v) powdered milk (Bio-Rad) for 1 h. For detection of β-catenin, blots were probed with an anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1 in 1000 (clone 5H10, Chemicon). For detection of actin, blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1 in 1000 (clone AC-10, Sigma). For detection of GAPDH, blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1 in 1000 (clone 6C5, Chemicon International). For secondary detection, a rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase was used at a dilution of 1:1500 (Sigma). After three washes in PBST, the blots were incubated in peroxidase substrate for 5 min prior to exposure to photographic film (Kodak autoradiography, Sigma) or digital imaging (Typhoon Imager, Bio-Rad). RT-PCR Analysis—Total mRNA was prepared from 1 million cells using a commercially available kit (High Pure; Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were briefly centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove excess matrix protein prior to RNA purification. A one-tube RT-PCR reaction (Titan; Roche Diagnostics) was employed for the synthesis of cDNA and PCR amplification. Reactions were carried out on a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems 9700; PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For amplification of GAPDH, the following primers were used: ccccttcattgacctcaact (sense) and cgaccgtaacgggagttgct (antisense) with the following conditions: initial cDNA synthesis, 50 °C for 45 min; denaturation 95 °C for 1 min; annealing 52 °C for 1 min; and extension 72 °C for 1 min for 28 cycles. For amplification of collagen X, the following primers were used: ggtaacaggaatgcctgtgtctg (sense) and tcacattggagccactaggaa (antisense) using the following conditions: initial cDNA synthesis, 50 °C for 45 min; denaturation 95 °C for 1 min; annealing 55 °C for 1 min; and extension 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles. For amplification of osteonectin, the primer sequences and conditions of Bilbe et al. (28Bilbe G. Roberts E. Birch M. Evans D.B. Bone. 1996; 19: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were used; for alkaline phosphatase, the primers and conditions of Fromigué et al. (29Fromigué O. Marie P.J. Lomri A. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were used; and for connexins 43 and 45, the primers and conditions of Oviedo-orta et al. (30Oviedo-Orta E. Hoy T. Evans W.H. Immunology. 2000; 99: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were used. For amplification of Dkk-1 the primers and conditions of Gregory et al. (10Gregory C.A. Singh H. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28067-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) were used. Histochemistry—Micromass pellets were fixed in phosphate-buffered formaldehyde (10% v/v) overnight and set in liquid paraffin. Sections (10 μm) were prepared using a microtome (Microm International, Walldorf, Germany) and placed on microscope slides (Fisher). The slides were processed for staining as follows. The slides were de-paraffinized in Clear-Rite (Microm) and gradually hydrated to 95% (v/v) ethanol. Slides were rinsed in dH2O, and stained with 1% (v/v) Alizarin Red S (pH 4.1), Toluidine Blue, or Safranin O (Sigma) for 10 min. After washing in dH2O, the sections were counterstained in 1% (v/v) light green solution (Sigma) for 1 min, washed in dH2O, and dehydrated to 100% ethanol. The sections were finally cleared with Clear-Rite and coverslipped in Permount mounting medium (ProSciTech, Queensland, Australia).

https://openalex.org/W2066168326,"The homeostatic abundance of the proteasome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by a feedback circuit in which transcriptional activator Rpn4 up-regulates the proteasome genes and is destroyed by the assembled, active proteasome. Remarkably, the degradation of Rpn4 can be mediated by two independent pathways. One pathway is independent of ubiquitin, whereas the other involves ubiquitination on internal lysines. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Rpn4. We demonstrated, through in vivo and in vitro assays, that Rpn4 is a physiological substrate of the Ubr2 ubiquitin ligase, which was originally identified as a sequence homolog of Ubr1, the E3 component of the N-end rule pathway. The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6, which directly interacts with Ubr2, is also required for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Rpn4. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of UBR2 exhibited a strong synthetic growth defect with a mutation in the Rpt1 proteasome subunit when Rpn4 was overexpressed. This study not only identified the ubiquitination apparatus for Rpn4 but also unveiled the first physiological substrate of Ubr2. The biological significance of Ubr2-mediated degradation of Rpn4 is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2116446688,"The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is part of the active site of all molybdenum (Mo)-dependent enzymes, except nitrogenase. Moco consists of molybdopterin (MPT), a phosphorylated pyranopterin with an enedithiolate coordinating Mo and it is synthesized by an evolutionary old multistep pathway. The plant protein Cnx1 from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzes with its two domains (E and G) the terminal step of Moco biosynthesis, the insertion of Mo into MPT. Recently, the high-resolution MPT-bound structure of the Cnx1 G domain (Cnx1G) has been determined (Kuper, J., Llamas, A., Hecht, H. J., Mendel, R. R., and Schwarz, G. (2004) Nature 430, 803–806). Besides defining the MPT-binding site a novel and unexpected modification of MPT has been identified, adenylated MPT. Here we demonstrate that it is Cnx1G that catalyzes the adenylation of MPT. In vitro synthesized MPT was quantitatively transferred from Escherichia coli MPT synthase to Cnx1G. The subsequent adenylation reaction by Cnx1G was Mg2+- and ATP-dependent. Whereas Mn2+ could partially replace Mg2+, ATP was the only nucleotide accepted by Cnx1G. Consequently the formation of pyrophosphate was demonstrated, which was dependent on the ability of Cnx1G to bind MPT. Pyrophosphate, either formed in the reaction or added externally, inhibited the Cnx1G-catalyzed MPT adenylation reaction. Catalytically inactive Cnx1G mutant variants showed impaired MPT adenylation confirming that MPT-AMP is the reaction product of Cnx1G. Therefore Cnx1G is a MPT adenylyltransferase catalyzing the activation of MPT, a universal reaction in the Moco synthetic pathway because Cnx1G is able to reconstitute also bacterial and mammalian Moco biosynthesis.

Science. 1996; 272: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). With the exception of nitrogenase, Mo is activated and chelated by the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) (3Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moco consists of Mo covalently bound via the dithiolate moiety of a conserved tricyclic pterin referred to as molybdopterin (MPT), which is highly conserved in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and Archaea (4Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 317-368PubMed Google Scholar). Mo enzymes are essential for diverse metabolic processes like nitrate assimilation in autotrophs and phytohormone synthesis in plants (5Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Crossref Google Scholar) or sulfur detoxification and purine catabolism in mammals (6Enemark J.H. Cosper M.M. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 621-654PubMed Google Scholar). Human Moco deficiency is a rare but severe hereditary disease characterized by the pleiotropic loss of sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase activity (7Johnson J.L. Waud W.R.

Affected patients die early because no therapy was available. Very recently we have described a first substitution therapy of Moco deficiency in an animal model (8Schwarz G. Santamaria-Araujo J.A.

The conservation of Moco is also reflected by a conserved biosynthetic pathway that can be divided into three steps (3Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol.

In the second step the heterotetrameric MPT synthase transfers two sulfur atoms to the C1′ and C2′ carbons of the precursor Z pyrano ring thus forming the MPT ene-dithiolate (14Gutzke G. Fischer B.

In the final and so far most enigmatic step of Moco biosynthesis, a Mo atom is attached to one (in pro- and eukaryotes) or two MPT dithiolates (in prokaryotes). Furthermore, in bacteria nucleotides are linked via a pyrophosphate bond to MPT forming the so-called MPT dinucleotide cofactors that are found either in mono-MPT (16Dobbek H. Gremer L. Meyer O.

Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). After completion of biosynthesis the mature cofactor has to be inserted into the Mo enzymes. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii a Moco carrier protein that protects and transfers Moco to nitrate reductase has been identified (18Witte C.P. Igeno M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernandez E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and participates in the Mo insertion reaction (21Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Cnx1G active site was mapped by structure-based mutagenesis and functional analysis to a large surface depression with a clear discrimination between MPT binding and catalysis (22Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 405-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, we have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of Cnx1G in complex with MPT (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that confirmed previous functional assignments (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One unexpected observation was the identification of copper bound to the MPT dithiolate sulfurs in two different Cnx1G-MPT complex structures, which might have a function in protecting the MPT dithiolate and/or presenting a suitable leaving group for Mo insertion (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, the structure of the fully active Cnx1G variant S583A revealed the existence of adenylated MPT (MPT-AMP), a novel mechanistically important intermediate of Moco biosynthesis (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Based on this finding a magnesium-dependent in vitro synthesis of Moco was demonstrated that was dependent on the Cnx1 E domain (Cnx1E). Therefore we concluded that the Mo insertion reaction, catalyzed by Cnx1E, is associated with the cleavage of the MPT adenylate. Based on the analysis of catalytically inactive Cnx1G variants, the synthesis of MPT-AMP has been proposed (Fig. 1). We show here that Cnx1G catalyzes adenylation of MPT in a reaction dependent on Mg2+ and ATP. Mn2+ could substitute for Mg2+ but with decreased activity. The synthesis of MPT-AMP was accompanied by the formation of pyrophosphate, which inhibited the adenylation reaction. Cnx1G variants previously shown to be catalytically inactive turned out to be defective in the MPT adenylation step. Because of its catalytic properties Cnx1G will be named MPT adenylyltransferase. Materials—All chemicals used were of highest quality available. Inorganic E. coli pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1; 1.09 units/mg) was obtained from Sigma. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow matrix was from Qiagen. Prepacked NICK columns were used as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids, Expression, and Purification of Cnx1G Domain Variants— The previously described expression plasmids of Cnx1G domain (pQE60cnx1g628) and its variants were used (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of Cnx1G domain variants was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3) as described (22Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 405-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Proteins were concentrated (Centricon; Amicon) to 5 mg/ml and stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Cnx1E was purified as C-terminal His-tagged protein as described (20Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Purification of Precursor Z, E. coli MPT Synthase, and in Vitro Synthesis of MPT—Precursor Z was purified as described (12Santamaria-Araujo J.A. Fischer B. Otte T. Nimtz M. Mendel R.R. Wray V. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15994-15999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). E. coli thiocarboxylated MPT synthase was in vitro assembled from its subunits according to Gutzke et al. (14Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Standard in vitro synthesis of MPT was performed in a 100-μl reaction volume (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2) containing 340 pmol of MPT synthase and 335 pmol of precursor Z. The reaction was anaerobically incubated for 2 min at room temperature until completion (12Santamaria-Araujo J.A. Fischer B. Otte T. Nimtz M. Mendel R.R. Wray V. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15994-15999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using the HR30/10 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Proteins (3.3–10 μm) were loaded in a total volume of 100 μl and separated with 0.2 ml/min flow rate. Fractions of 500 μl were collected and the MPT content was determined by HPLC FormA analysis. The molecular weight was determined using a calibration curve obtained from the retention times of standard proteins (Amersham Biosciences). Adenylation of MPT—For quantitative transfer of MPT to Cnx1G the MPT synthase reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h with 1 nmol of Cnx1G. If not stated otherwise, the adenylation reaction was performed with 10 μl of MPT synthase reaction mixture containing 10 μm Cnx1G. The reaction was started immediately or after 1 h preincubation with MPT synthase by adding MgCl2 or any other bivalent cation and ATP or any other nucleotide. The standard adenylation reaction was performed with 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP for 2 h. In some experiments the adenylation was performed with 25 μm Superdex 200-purified Cnx1-MPT complex (with 10 μm MPT bound). In other cases 1–5 units of pyrophosphatase was added to the reaction. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 390 μl of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and 50 μlof1%I2, 2% KI, 1 m HCl. Determination of MPT and AMP-MPT—MPT was detected by HPLC FormA analysis as described (20Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1). To separate MPT and MPT-AMP, oxidation was performed at room temperature overnight. By this procedure MPT-AMP was converted into FormA-AMP (Fig. 1) that was separated from FormA by QAE anion exchange chromatography and subsequently treated with pyrophosphatase and alkaline phosphatase (25Guse A. Stevenson C.E. Kuper J. Buchanan G. Schwarz G. Giordano G. Magalon A. Mendel R.R. Lawson D.M. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25302-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) thus yielding FormA-dephospho that was quantified as described above (20Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Determination of Moco—In vitro conversion of MPT into Moco was determined by the nit-1 reconstitution assay using freshly desalted nit-1 extract that was passed twice through NICK columns equilibrated with nit-1 buffer (19Schwarz G. Schulze J. Bittner F. Eilers T. Kuper J. Bollmann G. Nerlich A. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2455-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In vitro Moco synthesis was performed in 20 μl containing 10 μl of nit-1 protein extract, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.4–1.2 pmol of in vitro synthesized MPT according to the linear range of the assay, 1 μm Cnx1G, and when required 1 μm Cnx1E. Other additives are indicated. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by the determination of reconstituted NADPH-nitrate reductase activity. Nitrite formed in a final volume of 125 μl was quantified by the absorbance at 540 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Versa max, Molecular Devices). One unit of Moco activity was defined as reconstituted nit-1 nitrate reductase activity sufficient to produce an increase of 1.0 absorbance unit at 540 nm per 25-min reaction time and nmol of Cnx1G. Determination of Pyrophosphate (PPi)—PPi released during the adenylation reaction of MPT was detected by the PiP™ Pyrophosphate Assay Kit (Molecular Probes). PPi was detected in 50 μl of adenylation reaction mixtures containing 25 μm Cnx1G with or without 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 10 μm MPT. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °Cina microtiter plate, afterward the absorbance at 565 nm was measured using a microtiter plate reader. Cnx1G Sequesters MPT from MPT Synthase—It has been demonstrated previously that Cnx1G binds MPT with high affinity (20Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of Cnx1G in a defined in vitro system we have synthesized MPT using in vitro assembled thiocarboxylated E. coli MPT synthase (14Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and purified precursor Z (12Santamaria-Araujo J.A. Fischer B. Otte T. Nimtz M. Mendel R.R. Wray V. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15994-15999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Co-incubation of 340 pmol of MPT synthase with 335 pmol of precursor Z revealed its quantitative conversion into MPT (data not shown). Size exclusion chromatography of this reaction mixture (Fig. 2A, thin line) showed a co-elution of 85 pmol of MPT (detected as FormA, Fig. 2B, black bars) with the heterotetrameric MPT synthase. This finding indicates that upon completion of the MPT synthase reaction the product MPT remains partially bound to the enzyme. After co-incubation of similar amounts of MPT synthase and precursor Z with 1000 pmol of Cnx1G, a total of 300 pmol of MPT was recovered in the Cnx1G-containing fraction indicating the tight binding of MPT to Cnx1G. The facts that (i) MPT elution was shifted from MPT synthase-containing fractions to Cnx1G-containing fractions and (ii) that the total recovery of MPT was dramatically higher with Cnx1G than with MPT synthase demonstrates that MPT binding to Cnx1G is stronger than to the MPT synthase. The recovery of 300 pmol of MPT indicates the quantitative conversion of 335 pmol of precursor Z. These experiments were performed with full-length Cnx1G domain (residues 460–670) (21Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to separate the Cnx1G trimer (72 kDa) from the MPT synthase tetramer (54 kDa). Because of the efficient transfer of MPT to Cnx1G all following experiments, if not stated otherwise, were performed without the separation of both proteins by using the truncated version of Cnx1G (residues 460–628) (22Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 405-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Adenylation of MPT by Cnx1G—In the high-resolution molybdopterin-bound structure of the Cnx1G S583A variant MPT-AMP has been identified (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Whereas Cnx1G also showed MPT-AMP, but somewhat less than S583A, the catalytically inactive variant D515H contained only MPT and no MPT-AMP. This finding suggested a function of Cnx1G in the adenylation of MPT. After probing the quantitative transfer of MPT from MPT synthase to Cnx1G we investigated the in vitro formation of MPT-AMP. In the presence of MPT synthase, precursor Z, and Cnx1G the in vitro formation of MPT-AMP was detected when MgCl2 (10 mm) and ATP (1 mm) were present (Fig. 3B). The de novo synthesis of MPT-AMP was accompanied by a depletion of free (non-modified) MPT (Fig. 3A). The remaining FormA peak in Fig. 3A is probably because of a partial hydrolysis of MPT-AMP during the oxidation procedure resulting in FormA-dephospho. Our result shows that Cnx1G is indeed able to catalyze the adenylation of MPT, a reaction that is magnesium- and ATP-dependent. Next we performed MPT-AMP synthesis experiments with different MgCl2 (0–10 mm) and ATP (0–10 mm) concentrations (Fig. 4, A and C) demonstrating maximal activity with 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP. Already with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP or 10 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm ATP 75% of maximal activity was obtained. Interestingly, 10 mm ATP resulted in less MPT adenylation than with 1 mm, indicating an inhibition of Cnx1G function. ATP inhibition might be either because of (i) unspecific and competitive binding of the nucleotide to the MPT binding site of Cnx1G or (ii) because of pyrophosphate (PPi) that might be formed by spontaneous ATP hydrolysis and would be therefore increased at higher ATP concentrations. Therefore we investigated both substrate specificity and the effect of PPi on the Cnx1G-mediated MPT adenylation. Substrate Specificity of MPT Adenylation Reaction—Nucleotide hydrolysis is dependent on divalent metal ions with Mg2+ as the most prominent co-substrate. We investigated other metal ions such as Mn2+, Ca2+, Li2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ (each 10 mm) for their ability to promote MPT adenylation in the presence of 1 mm ATP and MPT (Fig. 4B). With Mg2+ the highest activity was obtained suggesting this ion as native co-substrate for MPT-AMP synthesis. The only other metal that was able to promote MPT adenylation was Mn2+ with about 50% of the magnesium-dependent MPT-AMP production under experimental conditions. Regarding the specificity for the nucleotide that is transferred to MPT by Cnx1G we investigated the acceptance of either ADP and AMP or other nucleotides such as GTP, CTP, TTP, and UTP (Fig. 4D). The results show that ATP is the only acceptable substrate of Cnx1G suggesting a structural preference to bind the adenosine in the negatively charged surface depression of Cnx1G (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of excess AMP (10 mm) had no effect on the ATP-dependent MPT adenylation (data not shown), which excludes an unspecific binding of the adenine. Formation of Pyrophosphate during MPT Adenylation and Pyrophosphate Inhibition—So far we have demonstrated the in vitro synthesis of MPT-AMP. However, during ATP hydrolysis a second product, inorganic PPi, should be released. To detect PPi formation we first purified the Cnx1G-MPT complex as shown in Fig. 2. In total, 1250 pmol of Cnx1G containing 500 pmol of MPT (detected as FormA) were used for each adenylation experiment. MPT-AMP synthesis was performed in the presence or absence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm ATP (5000 pmol in total). Reactions that contained ATP either without Mg2+ or without MPT (negative control) showed 200 pmol of pyrophosphate, which supports our previous assumption that PPi is present in the ATP batch derived from spontaneous hydrolysis (Fig. 5A). However, the highest level (500 pmol) of PPi production was detected when MPT, MgCl2, and ATP were simultaneously present in the reaction mixture demonstrating the MPT- and Mg-dependent formation of 300 pmol of PPi. This result further demonstrates that MPT binding to Cnx1G is a prerequisite for ATP hydrolysis. After showing the formation of PPi we tested the effect of externally added PPi (0–10 mm) onto the synthesis of MPT-AMP (Fig. 5B). In the presence of 1–10 mm PPi an almost complete inhibition of the Cnx1G-mediated MPT adenylation was observed (Fig. 5B, black bars), which was completely overcome by the addition of inorganic pyrophosphatase (Fig. 5B, white bars). These data demonstrate that increasing concentrations of PPi inhibit the formation of MPT-AMP, probably because of a shift in the reaction equilibrium from ATP hydrolysis toward ATP synthesis as it was found in several enzymes involved in adenylation processes (26Fresquet V. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the observed inhibition with a high ATP concentration (10 mm) was completely reverted by pyrophosphatase treatment (data not shown) confirming the presence of PPi. Reaction Rates and Kinetic Parameters of MPT Adenylation—We have shown that Cnx1G catalyzes the adenylation of MPT, a reaction that is dependent on Mg2+, ATP, and release PPi. Next we investigated the reaction rates under “standard conditions” using 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP. When precursor Z conversion and MPT-AMP synthesis were started simultaneously MPT adenylation reached saturation after a 1-h reaction time (Fig. 6A) corresponding to an reaction rate of 0.4 pmol of MPT-AMP/min. However, when Cnx1G was first preincubated for 1 h with MPT synthase and precursor Z, allowing the efficient transfer of synthesized MPT to Cnx1G, the subsequent MPT adenylation was significantly faster (Fig. 6A) with 0.8 pmol of MPT-AMP/min. Under those conditions saturation started after 30 min. Based on this observation we propose a relatively slow transfer of MPT from MPT synthase as one rate-limiting factor. Conclusively, when using purified Cnx1-MPT complex (see Fig. 2A) an MPT-AMP synthesis rate (Fig. 6B, 1.2 pmol of MPT-AMP/min) was observed similar to that seen with preincubation (Fig. 6A). When reaching saturation all free (non-adenylated) MPT was converted into MPT-AMP (data not shown, compare also Fig. 3). We have shown that PPi is released during MPT adenylation and that increasing amounts of PPi inhibit Cnx1G. As PPi is formed during the synthesis it should also inhibit the reaction resulting in a decreased reaction rate with time. Therefore adenylation was performed in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase resulting in a significantly increased MPT adenylation rate (Fig. 6B, 2.5 pmol of MPT-AMP/min). Almost complete saturation of MPT-AMP synthesis was reached after 10–15 min. To obtain catalytic parameters MPT adenylation was performed with MPT-bound Cnx1G at different ATP concentrations (50–1000 μm). A clear ATP-dependent reaction rate was observed as indicated by the resulting double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 6C). The calculated kcat of 0.0012 s–1 indicates that the adenylation reaction is relatively slow. The Km value for ATP of 62 μm is almost 1000-fold higher than the Kd value of MPT (100 nm) (20Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This finding supports our previous observation that first MPT binds to Cnx1G before ATP can be hydrolyzed. The Active Site of Cnx1G—Previous studies have described different Cnx1G variants with modifications in highly conserved surface residues (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some of those residues are located in the MPT-binding site (Thr-542, Ser-573) and others are part of or in close proximity to the adenosine-binding site (Ser-476, Asp-486, Asp-515, Arg-547) (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The latter are able to bind MPT but are catalytically inactive (21Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed these Cnx1G variants for their ability to catalyze MPT adenylation. In the absence of pyrophosphatase (Table I) all variants with a complete loss of MPT binding (S573A, T542D, T542N) showed no detectable MPT-AMP synthesis, confirming our finding that MPT binding is essential for nucleotide transfer. Two other variants with partially impaired MPT binding (T542S, T542A) were able to synthesize MPT-AMP but with significantly reduced rates corresponding well to their reduced levels in MPT binding (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cnx1G variants impaired in catalysis (D515H, S476A, D486A) showed also no MPT adenylation. One variant (R547E) with wild type-like MPT binding and slightly reduced activity (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) showed a clear reduction in MPT adenylation. Finally, we investigated the fully active S583A variant, which was even more active than Cnx1G. This increased adenylation rate explains why MPT-AMP was trapped in the crystal structure (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Table IMPT adenylation rates of different Cnx1G variantsPyrophosphatasea5 units in each reaction.AbsentPresentRater 2Rater 2Increasebx-Fold increased reaction rate in the presence of pyrophophatase.pmol/minpmol/minCnx1G0.8240.9701.8190.9432.21S467ANDcND, not detectable.NDD486ANDNDD515HNDNDT542S0.0820.9970.1270.9991.55T542A0.0410.1150.9812.80T542DNDNDR547E0.1360.9980.2410.9981.77S573AND0.0560.996S583A1.5730.9672.0800.9741.37a 5 units in each reaction.b x-Fold increased reaction rate in the presence of pyrophophatase.c ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab MPT-AMP synthesis in the presence of pyrophosphatase showed an overall increase in activity for all variants examined before (Table I). Furthermore, a detectable activity for the MPT binding-deficient S573A variant was found. When comparing the rates of reaction with and without pyrophosphatase an 2.2-fold increase has been observed for Cnx1G in the presence of pyrophosphates. Except for T542A all other detectable mutant activities were less sensitive to pyrophosphatase indicating no major reduction in the pyrophosphate release. However, in the case of T542A the 2.8-fold increased reaction rate might indicate a functional role of this residue in product release, which is not surprising as it is located in close proximity to the pyrophosphate bond in MPT-AMP. In Vitro Moco Synthesis from Precursor Z—So far we have demonstrated that in vitro synthesized MPT is converted by Cnx1G into MPT-AMP. Finally we could demonstrate that in vitro synthesized MPT-AMP can be further converted into active Moco, which was detected by reconstitution of the aponitrate reductase in desalted Neurospora crassa nit-1 protein extract. Moco synthesis was dependent on Mg2+ and ATP in a similar way as the synthesis of MPT-AMP (data not shown) demonstrating that the amount of in vitro synthesized Moco is directly related to the rate of MPT-AMP synthesis. Moco biosynthesis is highly conserved between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, a fact that is illustrated by the efficient reconstitution of E. coli Moco synthesis by the plant protein domain Cnx1G (21Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have chosen Cnx1 as the representative protein to investigate the last step of Moco biosynthesis. Although MPT binding to Cnx1 has been shown (20Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) the mechanism of Mo insertion remained enigmatic. For Cnx1G, besides its MPT binding, a second function in Mo insertion was shown and both properties were mapped onto the structure of Cnx1G (22Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 405-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) thus defining its active site (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the MPT-bound structure of Cnx1G that confirmed the proposed MPT binding site and revealed a novel mechanistically important intermediate, MPT-AMP (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated in this study the synthesis of MPT-AMP. First we transferred de novo synthesized MPT from MPT synthase to Cnx1G providing the basis for a fully defined in vitro system to investigate MPT adenylation. In previous studies Cnx1G-MPT complexes were obtained by co-purification from E. coli (21Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cnx1G showed Mg2+- and ATP-dependent in vitro synthesis of MPT-AMP. This reaction was highly specific as Mg2+ and ATP were the preferred substrates. Only Mn2+ was able to replace Mg2+ partially, which is seen in many reactions that are depend on ATP hydrolysis (26Fresquet V. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Upon MPT-AMP synthesis an almost equimolar release of PPi has been demonstrated. Because of the equilibrium nature of ATP hydrolysis/synthesis, increasing amounts of PPi resulted in the inhibition of MPT-AMP synthesis that could be completely suppressed by pyrophosphatase. As PPi is continuously formed during MPT adenylation the addition of pyrophosphatase showed a significant increase in the reaction rate. Furthermore, PPi release is dependent on the presence of MPT supporting the hypothesis that MPT binding is essential for ATP binding and subsequent hydrolysis. Large conformational changes in Cnx1G might be excluded as no differences were seen between the apo- and MPT-bound structure of Cnx1G (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G.

However, MPT binding was one rate-limiting factor of adenylation as the reaction rates were increased upon preincubation of Cnx1G with MPT synthase. The fact that MPT binding is prerequisite to ATP hydrolysis is also supported by the large discrepancy between the Kd of MPT (0.1 μm) and the kM of ATP (62 μm). The adenylation catalyzed by Cnx1G is relatively slow. However, the kM for ATP is within the physiological range and similar to other enzymes that catalyze AMP transfer reactions like the malonyl-CoA synthetase (27An J.H. Lee G.Y. Jung J.W. Lee W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 159-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under optimal conditions adenylation rates were not comparable with MPT synthase, which converts stoichiometric amounts of precursor Z into MPT within 1 min (12Santamaria-Araujo J.A. Fischer B. Otte T. Nimtz M. Mendel R.R. Wray V. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15994-15999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) corresponding to a reaction rate of about 100 pmol of MPT/min. However, the rate-limiting step of MPT synthesis seems to be the regeneration of the thiocarboxylated small subunit MoaD (14Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which is also dependent on the adenylation of MoaD, a stoichiometric reaction that was completed within 30 min (28Leimkühler S. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34695-34701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Catalytic conversion of MPT into MPT-AMP was not observed (data not shown), which might be because of the tight binding of MPT-AMP to Cnx1G (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and/or the missing E domain as the second domain of holo-Cnx1. In terms of overall reaction rates of Moco synthesis our and other data (28Leimkühler S. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34695-34701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) indicate a relatively slow production of Moco. At least in eukaryotes only low-level induction of Moco synthesis has been observed, 2G. Schwarz, unpublished data. a fact that might indicate a functional importance of a Moco carrier protein (18Witte C.P. Igeno M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernandez E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After demonstrating that Cnx1G synthesizes MPT-AMP the question remained whether or not this activity is impaired in those Cnx1G variants that are unable to promote Mo insertion (21Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Indeed, all mutants either deficient in MPT binding or catalysis were defective in the adenylation of MPT suggesting that MPT-AMP synthesis is the exclusive function of Cnx1G. Variants with partial activity (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) showed dramatically decreased adenylation rates. For example, Arg-547 is bridging the loop between β3 and α4 to α3 (22Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 405-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) thus maintaining the conformation of Asp-515 and Asp-548 essential for MPT adenylation. Based on the structural comparison of the MPT-AMP-bound S583A structure (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) with the homologous fold of the magnesium-bound MoeA structure (29Schrag J.D. Huang W. Sivaraman J. Smith C. Plamondon J. Larocque R. Matte A. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), both Asp-515 and Asp-548 might participate in the coordination of the catalytic Mg2+ ion. S476D and D486A, also impaired in catalysis (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), are probably essential rather for adenosine binding than being directly involved in catalysis. Finally, Thr-542 is in direct contact to the MPT phosphate (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and was shown to be essential for MPT binding (23Kuper J. Winking J. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As T542A and T542S show different activities in the absence of pyrophosphatase but similar adenylation rates in its presence one might conclude that Thr-542 is involved in pyrophosphate-bond formation and/or PPi release. The results presented here show that Cnx1G is a MPT adenylyl transferase. As Cnx1E is needed for the subsequent magnesium-dependent Mo insertion reaction (data not shown) (24Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) this activity might be called Mo insertase. We propose that Cnx1G and Cnx1E act sequentially during Moco synthesis to promote efficient product/substrate channeling, which explains the evolutionary pressure for the domain fusion in eukaryotes. The reaction product MPT-AMP might be transferred to or directly processed by Cnx1E. Both cases would explain the weak but detectable binding of MPT to Cnx1E (20Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as the structural similarity observed between both domains (30Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure. 2001; 9: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As Mo insertion is dependent on MPT-AMP cleavage, one might conclude that the absence of molybdate would result in the accumulation of MPT-AMP. This hypothesis is supported by the observation in Hansenula polymorpha where Mo-depletion resulted in the loss of MPT cytosine dinucleotide formation, which is the essential cofactor of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (31Hänzelmann P. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Under these conditions Moco synthesis would be completely arrested in the MPT-AMP state.

The ligand that binds to the homodimers of HER2 has not yet been identified. Rather, HER2 functions as a preferred co-receptor to form heterodimers with HER1 (epidermal growth factor receptor), HER3, or HER4. Of these heterodimers, HER2-HER3 is particularly important for intracellular signaling (1Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). HER2 signaling has been linked to a variety of cellular responses to growth factors under both normal and pathophysiological conditions. HER2 signaling is required not only during normal development of the mammary gland but also during development of the glia, neurons, and heart (1Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 2Stern D.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Amplification of the HER2 gene and overexpression of HER2 protein have been documented in ∼30% of breast and 15% of ovarian cancers (3Pegram M.D. Konecny G. Slamon D.J. Cancer Treat. Res. 2000; 103: 57-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In many (but not all) reports, HER2 overexpression has been associated with a more aggressive course of disease. Although the underlying mechanisms for this association are still not well characterized, HER2 overexpression has been linked to increased proliferation and invasiveness (4Holbro T. Civenni G. Hynes N.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). HER2 is currently one of the best defined targets for specific therapy. The substantially greater expression of HER2 on cancer cells than on normal epithelial tissues permits selective targeting of malignant cells. HER2 is expressed on the cell surface where it can interact with ligands and antibodies (1Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 2Stern D.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 3Pegram M.D. Konecny G. Slamon D.J.

Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of HER2, is therapeutically active in HER2-positive breast carcinomas (3Pegram M.D. Konecny G. Slamon D.J. Cancer Treat. Res. 2000; 103: 57-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Clinical trials in HER2-positive patients with breast cancer have demonstrated that targeted therapy with trastuzumab in conjunction with cytotoxic chemotherapy (such as platinum compounds, taxanes, and anthracyclines) improves time to disease progression and overall survival (3Pegram M.D. Konecny G. Slamon D.J. Cancer Treat. Res. 2000; 103: 57-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Arteaga C.L. Breast Cancer Res. 2003; 5: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Clinical trials have also documented an increased risk for cardiotoxicity when trastuzumab is combined with anthracyclines, suggesting that HER2 signaling may contribute to normal heart function. The mechanisms by which trastuzumab affects growth of HER2-positive cancer cells and enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy are not fully understood. Anti-HER2 antibody can down-regulate the HER2 receptor and prevent cleavage of the extracellular domain of the receptor (13Baselga J. Albanell J. Molina M.A. Arribas J. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 4-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors are, however, generally re-expressed within a matter of hours, and binding of anti-HER2 antibody can also alter intracellular signaling by enhancing kinase activity and preventing heterodimer formation. Our group and others have demonstrated that anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies exert inhibitory effects on HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells through induction of G1 cell cycle arrest associated with induction of p27Kip1 and reduction of CDK2 (6Le X.-F.

Arteaga C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4132-4141PubMed Google Scholar). We have further shown that post-translational regulation of p27Kip1 plays a critical role in the anti-HER2 antibody-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest and tumor growth inhibition (12Le X.-F. Claret F.X. Lammayot A. Tian L. Deshpande D. LaPushin R. Tari A.M. Bast Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3441-3450Google Scholar). Of the post-translational mechanisms, we have shown that modulation of the phosphorylation of p27Kip1 protein is the mechanism by which anti-HER2 antibody up-regulates the protein (12Le X.-F.

Anti-HER2 antibodies that inhibit tumor growth also prevent HER2-HER3 interaction and inhibit the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (6Le X.-F. McWatters A. Wiener J. Mills G.B. Bast Jr., R.C. Clin.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7551-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As the PI3K-AKT pathway is critically important to cell survival signaling, inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway may explain, in part, the ability of trastuzumab to enhance paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (20Lee S. Yang W. Lan K.H. Sellappan S. Klos K. Hortobagyi G. Hung M.C. Yu D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5703-5710PubMed Google Scholar). Trastuzumab also suppresses DNA repair capacity (18Pietras R.J. Pegram M.D. Finn R.S. Maneval D.A. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2235-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) through as yet unknown pathways, contributing to the ability of the antibody to enhance the anti-tumor effect of DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin (18Pietras R.J. Pegram M.D. Finn R.S. Maneval D.A. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2235-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and radiotherapy (19Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). In vivo, trastuzumab inhibits angiogenesis and induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (13Baselga J. Albanell J. Molina M.A. Arribas J. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 4-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kono K. Takahashi A. Ichihara F. Sugai H. Fujii H. Matsumoto Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5813-5817PubMed Google Scholar), potentially contributing to its activity. Loss or blockade of the FcγRIII receptor on leukocytes has been shown to severely impair the anti-tumor effect of trastuzumab in vivo (15Clynes R.A. Towers T.L. Presta L.G. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar), indicating involvement of Fc-receptor-dependent mechanisms. Of the several mechanisms proposed for the action of anti-HER2 antibodies, interruption of the PI3K-AKT pathway may be critical for enhancing sensitivity to docetaxel and other cytotoxic drugs. Our current study explored the mechanisms of action of the anti-HER2 antibody and the impact of the antibody on activation of AKT as well as on sensitivity to docetaxel. Anti-HER2 antibody alone inhibited HER2-HER3 association, decreased PDK1 activity, reduced Thr-308 phosphorylation of AKT, and reduced AKT enzymatic activity. We have used a pharmacogenomic approach to compare the global changes that occur after treatment with anti-HER2 antibody and after treatment with the chemical inhibitor of PI3K. Treatment with anti-HER2 antibody decreased the expression of 16 genes. Fourteen of these 16 genes contribute to the following three different areas of cell function: cell cycle regulation, DNA repair/replication, and modification of chromatin structure. Direct inhibition of PI3K markedly decreased the expression of 14 genes regulated by the anti-HER2 antibody. Conversely, dominant active AKT prevented cell cycle G1 arrest and down-regulation of cell cycle genes induced by anti-HER2 antibody. A combination of anti-HER2 antibody and docetaxel exerted additive growth inhibition against breast cancer cell lines that overexpressed HER2. The combination did not increase the fraction of apoptotic cells induced with docetaxel alone but markedly down-regulated two genes that participate in cell cycle regulation, HEC and DEEPEST, required for passage through G2-M. Cell Culture—The human breast cancer cell lines, SKBr3 and BT474, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). SKBr3 cells were grown in complete medium that contained RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. BT474 cells were grown in complete medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For all experiments, cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. For cell culture, 2–6 × 105 exponentially growing cells were plated into 100-mm tissue culture dishes or 3 × 103 into 96-well plates in complete medium. After culture overnight in complete medium, cells were treated with anti-HER2 antibody 4D5 at 5–10 μg/ml (for SKBr3) or trastuzumab at 10 μg/ml (for BT474) in complete medium at 37 °C for 24 (for SKBr3) or 48 h (for BT474). Monoclonal antibody MOPC21 served as control antibody for 4D5 and was used at 5–10 μg/ml in SKBr3 cells. Human IgG served as control antibody for trastuzumab and was used at 10 μg/ml in BT474 cells. Reagents—Anti-HER2 murine monoclonal antibody 4D5 and humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®) were kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). MOPC21 murine myeloma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). MOPC21 cells were grown in the peritoneal cavities of BALB/c mice to produce ascites fluid, and the immunoglobulin was purified as reported previously (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). A control IgG1 was purchased from Calbiochem and further dialyzed against sterile cold PBS to eliminate sodium azide. Antibodies reactive with phospho-Ser-473 AKT, phospho-Thr-308 AKT, and total AKT as well as an AKT kinase assay kit were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). A monoclonal antibody to PCNA was purchased from BioGenex (San Ramon, CA). An antibody to AKT1 and a PDK1 kinase assay kit were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). An antibody reactive with HER2 (for Western blotting) was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). An antibody to HER3 (for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody to β-actin was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human heregulin β1 (hereafter named heregulin) was obtained from NeoMarkers, Inc. (Fremont, CA). Affymetrix Human Genome U95Av2 Gene Chips that permitted measurement of the expression of 12,000 human genes were purchased from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Preparation of Total RNA—SKBr3 cells were treated with 4D5 (10 μg/ml) or MOPC21 (10 μg/ml) for 24 h. BT474 cells were treated with trastuzumab (10 μg/ml) or hIgG (10 μg/ml) for 48 h. Total RNA was then extracted from the treated SKBr3 or BT474 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Procedures were performed according to the manufacturers' recommendation. The purity of RNA was assessed by absorption at 260 and 280 nm (values of the ratio of A260/A280 of 1.9–2.1 were considered acceptable) and by ethidium bromide staining of 18 S and 28 S RNA on gel electrophoresis. RNA concentrations were determined from the A260. Only samples of intact RNA were used for subsequent Affymetrix and RT-PCR analysis. Preparation of Fragmented cRNA for Affymetrix Analysis—A total of 15 μg of total RNA were used in the first-strand cDNA synthesis with T7-(dT)24 primer (GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24) (Proligo, Boulder, CO) by Superscript II (Invitrogen). The second-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out at 16 °C by adding Escherichia coli DNA ligase, E. coli DNA polymerase I, and RNase H into the reaction. This was followed by the addition of T4 DNA polymerase to blunt the ends of newly synthesized cDNA. Double-stranded cDNA was then purified by phase lock gel (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) with phenol/chloroform extraction. The purified cDNA was then used as templates in an in vitro transcription to produce cRNA labeled with biotin using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit from Enzo Diagnostics, Inc. (Farmingdale, NY). The procedure was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendation, and cRNA was further purified with a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Valencia, CA). Approximately 15 μg of cRNA was fragmented by incubating in a buffer containing 200 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.1), 500 mm potassium acetate, and 150 mm magnesium acetate at 95 °C for 30 min. Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed before the synthesis of cRNA and after the fragmentation of cRNA to ensure the quality of the samples. Only intact, high quality cRNA samples were used for subsequent array hybridization. Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Array Hybridization and Data Acquisition—cRNA hybridization to the human U95A arrays was performed at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Gene Microarray Facility by using an Affymetrix GeneChip System (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The fragmented cRNA was hybridized with pre-equilibrated Affymetrix chips at 45 °C for 16 h. Hybridized chips were then washed in a fluidic station with nonstringent buffer (6× SSPE (1× SSPE is 0.18 mol/liter NaCl, plus 0.015 mol of sodium citrate), 0.01% Tween 20, and 0.005% antifoam) for 10 cycles and with stringent buffer (100 mmol/liter MES, 0.1 mol/liter NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20) for 4 cycles, and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. This was followed by incubation with biotinylated mouse anti-avidin antibody. The chips were scanned in an Agilent ChipScanner to detect hybridization signals. Average target intensity was set at 500 arbitrary units. Each array was assessed for quality and stability by examining replicate copies of the same gene at different locations on the array. To ensure the quality of the cRNA samples and of the Affymetrix GeneChips, quality control experiments were performed using test chips, and the same cRNA sample before the test samples were processed. Further details are available from the CCSG shared resources web site (www.mdanderson.org/departments/dnamicroarray). The raw data (hybridization data) generated by MAS 5.0 were imported into Microsoft Excel and transferred to our Department of Biostatistics for analysis. Statistical Analysis of Affymetrix Array Data—Before analyzing the Affymetrix array data, every Affymetrix Hu95Av2 Gene Chip from our experiments underwent the following quality control checks: 1) scanner alignment and the proper dicing of images into correct cells; 2) overall chip brightness; and 3) spatial variation. Scanner alignment was checked by using the alternating pattern of positive and negative control cells on the border of each GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The intensities of positive and negative controls were plotted as a function of border position to obtain visual confirmation that each image had been correctly aligned. Brightness was examined by looking at the histograms of detection p values (provided by Affymetrix MAS 5.0) for each array. Detection p values measure how likely a transcript was expressed at a level to be called present on the array. As a general rule, chips are flagged if less than 10% of probe sets are detected at the p = 0.01 level. Spatial variation is not easily detected one chip at a time, so we compared the log transformed median corrected ratio (Z) for each cell between each combination of chips A and B (Z = log2(A/B) – median (log2(A/B)). The range in Z was additionally constrained to enhance visual artifacts on the slide. All checks were passed for each chip. Two array methods were used to analyze differential gene expression. A standard Affymetrix MAS 5.0 statistical analysis tool package was used for each probe set to measure fold change (FC) on the log2 scale, a 95% confidence interval for FC on the log2 scale, a p value for detection used to make the presence or absence calls for each gene, and a p value for detecting change or differential expression between samples. The default standard Affymetrix change calls were not used. Here a probe set was considered differentially expressed if the change p value was very small, the detection p value in at least one sample being compared was small, and the absolute lower bound of log2(FC), the log ratio, exceeded 0.8, corresponding to at least a 1.75-fold change. A second method designated the position-dependent nearest neighbor model was developed by Dr. Li Zhang at the Department of Biostatistics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (17Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7551-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The position-dependent nearest neighbor model (available at the following web site: odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~zhangli/PerfectMatch/) relies on a relationship between DNA base pair stacking energies and probe binding efficiencies. Only a perfect match is used to estimate the intensity of probe set. Cross-hybridization is accounted for in model estimation. Remarkable reproducibility between replicate samples has been attained at our Gene Microarray Core Facility (21Zhang L. Miles M.F. Aldape K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Zhang et al. (21Zhang L. Miles M.F. Aldape K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) recommend using as criteria for differential expression between two chips a |log2 ratio| >0.8 and mean log2 signal >7.9. The contrasts were limited to comparison between treated versus untreated samples in each cell line. Subsequently, a comparison of gene expression was made between methods and cell lines. The results of contrasts with Affymetrix software include the following: 1) detection p values; 2) log ratios with 95% confidence intervals; and 3) change p values (one-sided). The p values are from one-sided tests of up-regulation in expression. The results of contrasts with Zhang's Perfect Match software include the following: 1) mean Log2 signal and 2) log2 ratio. The results for the four contrasts described above were exported to Excel spreadsheets. Although log ratio >0.8 produced some consistency, we have used log ratio >1.0, corresponding to a 2-fold change, as the final selection criteria for the differentially expressed genes in this study. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—To verify the analysis results (Table I) from Affymetrix chip hybridization, total RNA was reversetranscribed with a random hexamer or T7-(dT)24 primer (Invitrogen). An aliquot (50 ng of total RNA) of the first strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR. Two genes (DEEPEST and H4FG listed in Table I) that lacked the validated primer sets and probes for real time PCR were examined in this study with regular RT-PCR. Oligonucleotide sequences of the primer sets used in this study are as follows: mitotic spindle coiled-coil protein (DEEPEST), sense (S)-AGCTGGAACAGGACCTAGCA and antisense (AS)-TCTGGGTAAGCTGGCAGAGT; H4 histone family, member G (H4FG), S-TAAGGTGCTCCGGGATAACA and AS-CCCTGACGTTTTAGGGCATA; and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), S-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT and ASTTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG. To monitor better the amplification efficiency and to control experimental errors, a duplex PCR that simultaneously amplified two genes, one internal control GAPDH and one gene of interest (DEEPEST or H4FG) in the same tube, was adopted. Duplex PCR was carried out in 50 μl containing 50 ng of cDNA, 50 pmol of each primer (25 pmol for H4FG primer set), 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, using 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The following conditions were used: 95 °C, 3 min followed by 25 (H4FG) or 35 (DEEPEST) cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (59 °C (DEEPEST) or 62 °C (H4FG), 30 s), and extension (72 °C (DEEPEST) or 68 °C (H4FG), 45 s). The reaction was incubated at 72 °C for 10 min at the conclusion of the PCR cycle. The resulting PCR product was analyzed by ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands were subjected to densitometric analysis and were normalized to expression of the internal control GAPDH. All validation experiments using duplex PCR were performed by two independent technicians and confirmed in both SKBr3 and BT474 cell lines. Two end cycle numbers were used for DEEPEST (35 (better) and 40) and H4FG (25 (better) and 30). To exclude any possible contamination or errors, a positive control and a negative control were included in each experiment.Table IDifferential expression of genes that are induced by anti-HER2 antibodyGene nameGene symbolFold changeaFold change represents expression ratio of anti-HER2 antibody-treated sample over control antibody-treated sample in average sample.FunctionSKBr3BT474Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family APHLDA2-2.42-2.44Fas expressionKIAA0186 gene productKIAA186-2.93-2.67UnknownCDC28 protein kinase 2CKS2-2.01-2.72Cell cycleHigh mobility group protein 2HMG2-2.46-2.73ChromatinMitotic spindle coiled-coil related proteinDEEPEST-2.21-3.00Cell cycle, spindleTopoisomerase (DNA) II αTOP2A-2.01-3.01DNA replicationUbiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2CUBE2C-2.05-3.36Cell cycle, mitosisFlap structure-specific endonuclease 1FEN1-2.18-3.36DNA repair and synthesisProliferating cell nuclear antigenPCNA-2.02-3.41DNA replication and repairReplication factor C (activator 1) 4RFC4-2.01-3.46DNA replication and repairMitotic checkpoint kinase Mad3LMAD3L-2.24-3.57Cell cycle, mitosisThymidylate synthetaseTYMS-2.21-3.77DNA replicationZW10 interactantZWINT-2.32-3.92Cell cycle, spindleSerine/threonine kinase 15STK15-2.42-4.28Cell cycle, spindleHighly expressed in cancerHEC-2.56-4.72Cell cycle, spindleH4 histone family, member GH4FG-2.60-4.88Chromatina Fold change represents expression ratio of anti-HER2 antibody-treated sample over control antibody-treated sample in average sample.

Membrane binding is a consequence of prenylation of PDE6 catalytic subunits, whereas soluble PDE6 is purified with a 17-kDa prenyl-binding protein (PDEδ) tightly bound. This protein, here termed PrBP/δ, has been hypothesized to reduce activation of PDE6 by transducin, thereby desensitizing the photoresponse. To test the potential role of PrBP/δ in regulating phototransduction, we examined the abundance, localization, and potential binding partners of PrBP/δ in retina and in purified rod outer segment (ROS) suspensions whose physiological and biochemical properties are well characterized. The amphibian homologue of PrBP/δ was cloned and sequenced and found to have 82% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian PrBP/δ. In contrast to bovine ROS, all of the PDE6 in purified frog ROS is membrane-associated. However, addition of recombinant frog PrBP/δ can solubilize PDE6 and prevent its activation by transducin. PrBP/δ also binds other prenylated photoreceptor proteins in vitro, including opsin kinase (GRK1/GRK7) and rab8. Quantitative immunoblot analysis of the PrBP/δ content of purified ROS reveals insufficient amounts of PrBP/δ (<0.1 PrBP/δ per PDE6) to serve as a subunit of PDE6 in either mammalian or amphibian photoreceptors. The immunolocalization of PrBP/δ in frog and bovine retina shows greatest PrBP/δ immunolabeling outside the photoreceptor cell layer. Within photoreceptors, only the inner segments of frog double cones are strongly labeled, whereas bovine photoreceptors reveal more PrBP/δ labeling near the junction of the inner and outer segments (connecting cilium) of photoreceptors. Together, these results rule out PrBP/δ as a PDE6 subunit and implicate PrBP/δ in the transport and membrane targeting of prenylated proteins (including PDE6) from their site of synthesis in the inner segment to their final destination in the outer segment of rods and cones.

Together, these results rule out PrBP/δ as a PDE6 subunit and implicate PrBP/δ in the transport and membrane targeting of prenylated proteins (including PDE6) from their site of synthesis in the inner segment to their final destination in the outer segment of rods and cones. Sensory transduction of light stimuli begins in the rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the vertebrate retina. The extensive membrane system in the outer segment is where proteins involved in visual excitation are located. Activation of the visual receptor, opsin, by light causes it to catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, transducin (Tα). 1The abbreviations used are: Tα, transducin; PDE6, phosphodiesterase; PrBP, prenyl-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IPL, inner plexiform layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer; ROS, rod outer segment. Upon dissociation of Tα-GTP from Tβγ, the effector enzyme, photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is activated by displacement of its inhibitory γ-subunit (Pγ) by Tα-GTP. As activated PDE6 lowers cytoplasmic cGMP levels, cGMP-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane are closed, causing membrane hyperpolarization (for reviews, see Refs. 1Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar and 2Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh Jr., E.N. Molecular Mechanisms in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2002Google Scholar). Rod photoreceptor PDE6 is a catalytic heterodimer of very similar α and β catalytic subunits (Pαβ) to which two identical inhibitory γ-subunits (Pγ) are tightly bound. Each catalytic subunit has a catalytic domain responsible for cGMP hydrolysis and two regulatory GAF domains, one of which binds cGMP with high affinity. Pγ interacts allosterically with both the catalytic and regulatory domains. Each catalytic subunit is post-translationally modified at its C terminus with an isoprenyl group (either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl) that is responsible for its high affinity association with outer segment disk membrane (for review, see Ref. 3Cote R.H. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2003: 453-458Google Scholar). A significant fraction of the total rod PDE6 (and all cone PDE6) extracted from bovine retina is found in a soluble form. What distinguishes this soluble PDE6 from membrane-associated PDE6 is the binding of a 17-kDa protein that was originally named the “δ-subunit” of PDE6 (4Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

It should be noted that soluble PDE6 is derived from a retinal extract containing broken rod and cone outer segments, and therefore the cellular origin of the 17-kDa protein binding to PDE6 is uncertain. The primary site of interaction of this 17-kDa protein (referred to in this report as prenyl-binding protein/δ (PrBP/δ)) with PDE6 is at the prenylated, carboxymethylated C terminus of the catalytic subunits (6Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 7Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13516-13523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on peptide competition experiments, PrBP/δ binding to PDE6 requires not only the prenyl moiety but also the modified, carboxymethylated C-terminal amino acids of rod PDE6 α or β (7Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13516-13523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, the rod and cone opsin kinases (GRK1 and GRK7) can be prevented from binding to PrBP/δ by preincubation with prenyl compounds altogether lacking the C-terminal peptide sequence (8Zhang H.B. Liu X.H. Zhang K. Chen C.K. Frederick J.M. Prestwich G.D. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 407-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This suggests that the affinity and/or specificity of PrBP/δ for individual prenylated proteins may depend not only on prenyl binding, but also on interactions with amino acids in the C-terminal domain of the prenylated protein. The crystal structure of PrBP/δ-subunit (9Hanzal-Bayer M. Renault L. Roversi P. Wittinghofer A. Hillig R.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) is structurally similar to a known prenyl-binding protein, RhoGDI (10Nancy V. Callebaut I. El Marjou A. de Gunzburg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Comparison of the two structures reveals that practically the entire sequence of PrBP/δ is an immunoglobulin-like domain that forms a highly hydrophobic prenyl binding pocket. The outer surface of PrBP/δ also forms a complex with Arl2 (9Hanzal-Bayer M. Renault L. Roversi P. Wittinghofer A. Hillig R.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but this interaction shows no structural homology to the binding site of Cdc42 on the surface of RhoGDI (11Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Hence, this family of prenyl-binding proteins (which also includes the homologous unc119/RG4 protein (10Nancy V. Callebaut I. El Marjou A. de Gunzburg J. J. Biol.

Unlike most phototransduction proteins, PrBP/δ is also expressed outside the retina in numerous other tissues that are not known to express photoreceptor PDE6 (6Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J.

This suggests that PrBP/δ may have different functions and/or biological activities depending upon the tissue in which it is expressed. Previous biochemical studies in retinal photoreceptors have shown that exogenous bovine PrBP/δ can bind to rod PDE6 with high affinity and cause release of PDE6 from the disk membrane (6Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Interaction of bovine PrBP/δ with rod PDE6 also alters cGMP binding to the regulatory GAF domains, converting a non-exchangeable cGMP binding site to one that readily exchanges bound and free nucleotide (20Mou H. Grazio H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The solubilization of PDE6 by PrBP/δ is accompanied by a decrease in its activation by transducin (21Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5248-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These in vitro results are all consistent with the hypothesis that PrBP/δ allosterically regulates PDE6, perhaps serving as a desensitization mechanism during light adaptation (21Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5248-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To critically examine the role of PrBP/δ in phototransduction, we have studied the binding properties, regulation, abundance, and subcellular localization of PrBP/δ in both bovine and frog photoreceptors. Having cloned, sequenced, and expressed the frog homologue of PrBP/δ, we confirm that it binds to PDE6 in vitro, releases it from the disk membrane, and effectively uncouples transducin activation of PDE6, similarly to its bovine counterpart. However, purified frog ROS containing a full complement of soluble and membrane proteins (22Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) lacks sufficient PrBP/δ to bind and solubilize more than a few percent of the PDE6 that is present in ROS. Furthermore, ∼90% of total PrBP/δ immunoreactivity in frog or bovine retinal samples does not co-purify with intact ROS. We conclude that PrBP/δ is not a genuine subunit of the PDE6 holoenzyme, and is unlikely to regulate PDE6 during phototransduction. Immunocytochemical examination of the localization of PrBP/δ reveals that most PrBP/δ is found outside the photoreceptor cells of the retina. Of the PrBP/δ immunoreactivity seen in the photoreceptor layer, careful examination of its subcellular distribution refines previous observations (6Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy places PrBP/δ distal to the connecting cilium, associated with axonemes extending into bovine rod and cone outer segments. Together, these results indicate that PrBP/δ is most likely functioning in the intracellular trafficking of newly synthesized prenylated proteins from the inner to the outer segment of retinal photoreceptors. Materials—Frogs (Rana catesbeiana) were obtained from Niles Biologicals Co. or Charles D. Sullivan Co. and maintained on a 12-h dark-light cycle for 2 weeks before use in experiments (23Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen bovine retinas were obtained from W. L. Lawson Inc., and fresh bovine eyes were kindly provided by Lemay & Sons (Goffstown, NH). Sucrose- and Ficoll-purified bovine ROS from freshly isolated retinas (24Schnetkamp P.P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 81: 110-116Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were a kind gift of Dr. Paul Schnetkamp (University of Calgary). [3H]cGMP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Supplies for immunoblotting were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell, Pierce, or Bio-Rad. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The bovine recombinant GST-PrBP/δ fusion protein was a kind gift of Drs. Terry Cook and Joe Beavo (University of Washington). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the PrBP/δ protein was raised in rabbits by immunization with the full-length recombinant bovine protein and was affinity-purified on PrBP/δ-Sepharose (FL antibody). Other rabbit polyclonal antibodies used in this study and raised in our laboratory include a PDE6 anti-peptide antibody directed to the GAFb domain that is conserved in all PDE6 catalytic subunit sequences (NC) and an affinity-purified antibody to the C terminus of the Pγ-subunit of PDE6 (CT-9710) (23Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Commercial antibodies to other proteins included the following: rod transducin α-subunit (K-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rhodopsin (1D4, Chemicon) (25Molday R.S. MacKenzie D.

Other antibodies to phototransduction proteins were generously provided by the following individuals: rod and cone PDE6 catalytic subunits (ROS1, Dr. R. L. Hurwitz (27Hurwitz R.L. Beavo J.A. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 17: 239-248PubMed Google Scholar)), cone arrestin (7G6, P. R. MacLeish) (28Zhang H. Cuenca N. Ivanova T. Church-Kopish J. Frederick J.M.

Szel A. Papermaster D.S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 290: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blotting were from Pierce, whereas fluorochrome-conjugated or biotinylated secondary antibodies (Alexa-350, Alexa-488, or fluorescein isothiocyanate) and the tyramide amplification kit for immunohistochemistry were from Molecular Probes. Cloning and Expression of Frog PrBP/δ—A frog (Rana pipiens) retinal cDNA library was prepared as described elsewhere (30Pittler S.J. Fliesler S.J. Baehr W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Frog PrBP/δ was cloned by screening the cDNA library with the bovine PrBP/δ nucleic acid sequence. The resulting clone, fpded1, contained a 2.7-kb cDNA insert in pBluescript SK. The 450-bp coding region of PrBP/δ was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-GGATCCATGTCTAGTA-ATGAGCGA and 5′-GAATTCTCAAACATAAAACAGCCTG, containing BamH1 and EcoR1 restriction sites. This PCR product was inserted into the TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) and then transferred into the pGEX-KG expression plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing of both strands confirmed that the coding region contained the authentic nucleotide sequence. The GenBank™ accession number for the frog PrBP/δ sequence is AY044177. The pGEX-KG/PrBP/δ construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Frog PrBP/δ expression was induced by addition of 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside to log phase cultures. Growth continued for 1 h at 37 °C prior to extraction of the recombinant fusion protein by sonication and centrifugation. GST-PrBP/δ was purified on a glutathione-agarose column. Following thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein from PrBP/δ and subsequent removal of thrombin with the Thrombin Cleavage Capture Kit (Novagen), PrBP/δ was separated from GST by glutathione-agarose chromatography, and the flow-through fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore BioMax 5K MWCO filter). Recombinant protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric protein assay (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar), which agreed with spectrophotometric estimates. Purity of the protein was >95%, as judged by SDS-PAGE. Bovine GST-PrBP/δ was expressed and purified in an identical manner. Preparation of Retinal Extracts and Purified ROS—To prepare retinal extracts, frog or bovine retinas were placed in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and homogenized with a motor-driven pestle in a glass mortar. Detergent-solubilized proteins were separated from particulate matter by centrifugation for 5 min at 100,000 × g in an Airfuge. The concentrations of protein (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were determined. Under these conditions, >90% of the visual pigment was solubilized, indicating extraction of most intrinsic membrane proteins. For immunoblotting, the retinal homogenate was added to SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer. For Fig. 2B, freshly isolated retinas were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized with a liquid nitrogen-cooled ceramic mortar and pestle, and directly transferred to boiling gel sample buffer to minimize sample degradation.Fig. 7Immunohistochemical localization of PrBP/δ in frog retina.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified ROSs were then homogenized in a pseudo-intracellular medium containing 77 mm KCl, 35 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin. Bovine ROSs were purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient as previously described (33McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Bovine ROSs were homogenized as described for frog ROSs above, except that complete disruption of ROS structure required trituration through a 26-gauge syringe needle. Subcellular fractionation of ROS homogenates, where carried out, was accomplished by centrifugation at 110,000 × g in an Airfuge. Greater than 95% of the rhodopsin was recovered in the ROS membrane pellet under these conditions. Purification of PDE6 followed established procedures in our laboratory (23Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pentia D.C. Hosier S. Collupy R.A. Valeriani B.A. Cote R.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). PDE6 cGMP Binding and Activity Assays—The PDE6 concentration of frog ROS homogenates was measured by the known ability of PDE6 to bind 2.0 mol of [3H]cGMP per mole of holoenzyme under defined assay conditions (PDE6 being the sole high affinity cGMP-binding protein in ROS (23Cote R.H.

In brief, PDE6-containing samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μm [3H]cGMP, 200 μm zaprinast, and a 2-fold molar excess of Pγ. Samples were filtered onto pre-wet nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore HAWP25) and immediately washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold intracellular medium (23Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of transducin-activated PDE6 hydrolysis of cGMP was measured by a coupled-enzyme phosphate release assay (23Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GTPγS (equal in concentration to the amount of rhodopsin) was added to the PDE6 sample for 1 min prior to the addition of 10 mm cGMP. For each experiment, rate measurements were obtained at a minimum of three individual time points, during which <30% of substrate was consumed. Measurements of the activity were made in the following buffer: 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. This PDE6 activity assay was also used to estimate the bovine PDE6 concentration under assay conditions where the enzyme was fully activated by trypsin-induced proteolysis of its inhibitory Pγ-subunits (20Mou H.

Transmembrane proteoglycans such as CD44 and syndecans make important contributions to communication between the exterior and interior of the cell (1Thorne R.F. Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. J.

The fundamental importance of these pathways in cell physiology underscores the potential significance of elucidating the specific contributions of NG2 to transmembrane communication. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are recognized as critical aspects of intracellular signaling. By altering protein conformation and by creating docking sites for protein-protein interaction, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues provide an extremely versatile means of regulating signaling pathways (19Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar, 20Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T. Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Although the NG2 cytoplasmic domain contains several threonine residues that might serve as phosphorylation sites (21Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Prince J.T. Johnstone S.R. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), to date we have had no experimental verification of this type of modification in NG2 and no information about potential functional consequences. The current work sheds initial light on these questions by identifying Thr2256 as the primary site for NG2 modification by PKC-α. In addition, we show that phosphorylation at this site changes the distribution of NG2 on the cell surface. Whereas non-phosphorylated NG2 is localized to small membrane protrusions distributed over most of the cell surface, Thr2256-phosphorylated NG2 is largely associated with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery. This redistribution of NG2 and the resulting polarization of cells are accompanied by significant increases in cell motility. Reagents—PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), GF109203X, and Gö6976 were purchased from Calbiochem. Calyculin A was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). G418 (Geneticin) and Lipofectamine were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies—Affinity-purified rabbit and guinea pig antibodies against rat NG2 were prepared in our laboratory (22Ozerdem U.

Rabbit antibodies specific for the XTpX(K/R) phosphothreonine motif and for phosphorylated ezrin (Thr567) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal antibody against PKC-α was from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal antibody against the human α3 integrin subunit was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Rabbit antibodies against ezrin and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were generous gifts from Dr. Heinz Furthmayr (Stanford University) and Dr. Elena Pasquale (The Burnham Institute), respectively. Fluorochome-coupled second antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin coupled to 6-nm colloidal gold was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture and Stable Transfections—U251MG human astrocytoma cells (23Ponten J. Westermark B. Med. Biol. 1978; 56: 184-193PubMed Google Scholar) transfected with cDNA for rat NG2 have been previously described (24Nishiyama A. Lin X.H. Stallcup W.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1819-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals, Tulare, CA). Mutant NG2 constructs (in pcDNA/ampI, Invitrogen) in which specific threonine residues were replaced by either valine or glutamic acid were made using Stratagene's QuikChange mutagenesis kit. For this purpose, overlapping pairs of oligonucleotide primers containing appropriately altered codons were purchased from FisherOligos. The resulting mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Stable transfection of U251MG cells with these mutant NG2 cDNAs was accomplished as described by Stallcup and Dahlin-Huppe (25Stallcup W.B. Dahlin-Huppe K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2315-2325PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, cell populations used for our experiments contained >85% NG2-positive cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation and chondroitinase treatment of NG2 were performed according to Stallcup and Dahlin-Huppe (25Stallcup W.B. Dahlin-Huppe K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2315-2325PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Novex gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against NG2, GST, PKC-α, or the XTpX(K/R) phosphothreonine motif. After washing, membranes were treated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), and immunoreactive proteins were detected with a chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). NG2 Cytoplasmic Fusion Proteins—The cytoplasmic region of NG2 was amplified by PCR from a rat NG2 cDNA template, cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), and used to transform Escherichia coli BL21. The resulting fusion protein was purified from bacterial extracts using glutathioneagarose beads (Sigma). Mutant forms of the NG2 cytoplasmic fusion protein, in which individual threonines were replaced by glutamic acid, were constructed using the strategy described for full-length NG2 mutants. In Vitro Phosphorylation of NG2 Cytoplasmic Domain by PKC-α—10 μg of wild type or mutant fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with 500 ng of recombinant PKC-α (Upstate, NY) for 30 min using the [γ-32P]ATP assay described by Ng et al. (26Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Following this reaction, the protein beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound material was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and labeled components were detected by autoradiography using BioMax MR film (Kodak). Metabolic 32P Labeling, Phosphoamino Acid Analysis, and Tryptic Peptide Mapping—Cells were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37 °C and then labeled for 4 h with 4 mCi of 32Pi/ml in phosphate-free medium. Cells were incubated with or without 30 nm calyculin A or 1 μm PMA within the last 15 min of labeling. NG2 immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gels, transferred to Immobilon P membranes, localized by autoradiography, and excised for further analysis. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of excised NG2 was performed as described previously (27Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled amino acids were detected by autoradiography and identified on the basis of co-migration with ninhydrinstained standards. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping was carried out according to the method of Luo et al. (28Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 921-923PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—In a few cases live cells were immunostained at 4 °C to evaluate the presence of NG2 on the cell surface. In most cases cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature prior to immunofluorescence labeling. Labeling was carried out as described by Stallcup and Dahlin-Huppe (25Stallcup W.B. Dahlin-Huppe K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2315-2325PubMed Google Scholar). All specimens were viewed using a Nikon Optiphot microscope (Garden City, NY) equipped for epifluorescence and phase contrast. A Nikon 40× PlanApo objective (oil immersion, 1.0 numerical aperture) was used for all imaging. Images were acquired using Kodak TMAX 400 film and printed on Kodak F5 paper. Electron Microcopy—Cells were prepared and processed as described for immunofluorescence, except that fluorochrome-labeled second antibodies were replaced by goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to 6-nm colloidal gold. Following the labeling procedure, cells were processed as described by Garrigues et al. (29Garrigues H.J. Lark M.W. Lara S. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Wight T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and embedded in Pelco Eponate 12T (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). Ultrathin sections (50–70 nm) were cut on an Ultracut E ultramicrotome (Reichert-Jung) and double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Samples were examined at 75 kV using a Hitachi-600A electron microscope. Cell Motility Assays—Confluent cell monolayers were established in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and “wounded” with a series of parallel scratches using a blue Eppendorf tip (26Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Old medium and loose cells were aspirated and replaced with fresh medium, either with or without 20 nm PMA. After a 20-h incubation, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and double stained for NG2 and rhodamine phalloidin. Motility was quantified by counting NG2-positive cells that had clearly migrated into the wound, as judged by separation from the bulk of phalloidin-positive cells in the monolayer. The total number of migratory cells in a given culture was divided by the total length of the wounds to obtain a value for motile cells per millimeter. At least 60 mm of total wound length in each of three replicate cultures was examined for each cell type under each experimental condition. NG2 Is Phosphorylated on Threonine—The cytoplasmic domain of rat NG2 contains one serine and seven threonine residues (21Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Prince J.T. Johnstone S.R. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To determine possible utilization of these residues as phosphorylation sites, phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on NG2 immunoprecipitated from transfected U251 cells (U251/NG2) metabolically 32Pi-labeled in the presence of the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor calyculin A (30 nm). Under these conditions NG2 contains only phosphothreonine (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the cytoplasmic sequence of rat NG2 using a phosphorylation prediction program (PhosNet version 2.0 (30Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar)) identifies Thr2256, Thr2265, and Thr2278 as potential phosphorylation sites, based on the presence of the consensus sequence XTX(R/K). An algorithm for sequences involved in protein-protein interaction (Scansite ver 2.0; 31) further identifies the 2252KRNKTGK2258 sequence (consensus (K/R)XXTX(K/R)) as a potential recognition site for PKC. This sequence surrounding Thr2256 is conserved in the human (32Pluschke G. Vanek M. Evans A. Dittmar T. Schmid P. Itin P. Filardo E.J. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9710-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), mouse (33Schneider S. Bosse F. D'Urso D. Muller H. Sereda M.W. Nave K. Niehaus A. Kempf T. Schnolzer M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 920-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chicken (GenBank™ accession number XP_425058), and pufferfish (GenBank™ accession number CAF98402) homologs of the proteoglycan, consistent with the idea that the motif may have functional importance. The Thr2256 site therefore appears to be a prime candidate for cytoplasmic phosphorylation of NG2. Protein Kinase C Is a Potential Mediator of NG2 Phosphorylation—To further characterize threonine phosphorylation of NG2, the proteoglycan was immunoprecipitated from U251/NG2 cells and immunoblotted using a phosphothreonine antibody specific for the XTX(K/R) motif. Treatment of cells with PMA (Fig. 1B, lane 2) significantly increased the phosphorylation level of NG2 over the basal level (CT, Fig. 1B, lane 1), suggesting that activated PKC could be responsible for NG2 phosphorylation. Because serine/threonine phosphatases can inactivate PKC (34Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P. Prevostel C. Whelan R.D. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and may possibly dephosphorylate NG2, an additional experiment was performed in the presence of the PP1/PP2A phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (35Kita A. Matsunaga S. Takai A. Kataiwa H. Wakimoto T. Fusetani N. Isobe M. Miki K. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 715-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in highly elevated threonine phosphorylation of NG2 (Fig. 1B, lane 3). PKC comprises an 11-member family of phospholipid-dependent serine-threonine kinases with important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis (36Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37Gutcher I. Webb P.R. Anderson N.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We utilized two PKC inhibitors to implicate specific PKC isoforms in NG2 phosphorylation. GF109203X is an inhibitor of PKC isoforms α, β1, β2, γ, δ, and ϵ, whereas Gö6976 is a highly selective inhibitor of the classic PKC isoforms α, β1, β2, and γ (38Thorp K.M. Verschueren H. De Baetselier P. Southern C. Matthews N. Immunology. 1996; 87: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both basal and stimulated levels of NG2 threonine phosphorylation were significantly reduced or abolished when U251/NG2 cells were treated with these agents (Fig. 1C), suggesting mediation of NG2 phosphorylation by a classic PKC isoform. Significantly, PKC-α is the sole member of the classic PKC family expressed in U251 cells (39Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In support of the possibility that PKC-α is responsible for NG2 phosphorylation, we used co-immunoprecipitation to demonstrate the existence of an NG2/PKC-α complex during the first 20 min after treatment of U251/NG2 cells with PMA (Fig. 1D). In Vitro Phosphorylation of the NG2 Cytoplasmic Domain by PKC-α—To obtain more direct evidence that PKC-α mediates NG2 phosphorylation, a GST fusion protein containing the full cytoplasmic region of NG2 (GST-NG2c, Fig. 2A), was used as the substrate for in vitro [γ-32P]ATP kinase modification by recombinant PKC-α. SDS-PAGE analysis of phosphorylated products from this reaction reveals a radiolabeled 34-kDa band corresponding to GST-NG2c (Fig. 2B). In contrast, GST itself is not a substrate for PKC-α phosphorylation under identical conditions. In addition, immunoblotting of reaction products with the XTX(R/K)-specific antibody reveals phosphorylated components at 80 and 34 kDa (Fig. 2C). The 34-kDa band corresponds to GST-NG2c, confirming that threonine is phosphorylated by PKC-α in the in vitro system. The 80-kDa band is PKC-α itself, autophosphorylated at Thr631 within the kinase domain (40Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Along with the data on NG2 phosphorylation in U251/NG2 cells, these in vitro results lend support to the idea that PKC-α mediates threonine phosphorylation in the NG2 cytoplasmic domain. The co-elution of phosphorylated PKC-α and GST-NG2c from glutathione-agarose beads corroborates our earlier observation that activated PKC-α directly binds to NG2. Thr2256 Is the Major PKCα Phosphorylation Site in NG2—To determine the site of NG2 threonine phosphorylation by PKC-α, we prepared three additional GST fusion proteins containing NG2 cytoplasmic domains in which Thr2256, Thr2265, and Thr2278 were mutated to glutamic acid residues. These mutant fusion proteins were used along with the wild type fusion protein GST-NG2c as substrates for in vitro [γ-32P]ATP phosphorylation by recombinant PKC-α. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping reveals that phosphorylation of the T2256E mutant differs significantly from the other three species (Fig. 3). The T2256E map lacks the major phosphopeptide (spot 1) present in the other species. Persistence of a lesser phosphopeptide (spot 2) suggests that the cytoplasmic domain may contain a secondary atypical PKC-α phosphorylation site. Nevertheless, the dramatic reduction of phosphorylation in the T2256E mutant demonstrates that Thr2256 is the major site for PKC-α phosphorylation of NG2. As an additional means of evaluating Thr2256 as the site of NG2 phosphorylation, we also performed phosphopeptide mapping of full-length NG2 before and after treatment of U251/NG2 cells with PMA in the presence of 32Pi (Fig. 4). These phosphopeptide maps are more complex than those obtained with the isolated NG2 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 3). This may be due in part to incomplete tryptic digestion of the full-length protein, leading to the occurrence of different sized fragments containing the same phosphorylated residue. For example, the immediate juxtaposition of the basic cytoplasmic sequence 2251RKR2253 to the hydrophobic transmembrane domain (residues 2226–2250) might adversely affect trypsin cleavage at these sites (41Wu C.C. Yates 3rd., J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In the absence of PMA treatment several tryptic phosphopeptides are visible on the chromatogram of wild type NG2. PMA treatment leads to the appearance of two new phosphopeptides (1 and 2), indicative of PMA-dependent phosphorylation at a new site (or sites) in the proteoglycan. In contrast, PMA treatment of U251 cells expressing an NG2 variant in which the threonine at position 2256 is replaced by valine (U251/NG2T2256V) did not lead to appearance of these new phosphopeptides (arrows), consistent with the idea that Thr2256 is the key site of threonine phosphorylation in NG2. PMA-dependent Alteration of Cell Morphology and Redistribution of NG2—In untreated U251/NG2 cells, NG2 is associated with a meshwork of plasma membrane protrusions widely distributed over the apical cell surface (Fig. 5a). NG2 is highly co-localized in these protrusions with the ERM protein ezrin (Fig. 5b) and with α3β1 integrin (data not shown). The localization of this meshwork of processes to the cell surface is confirmed by their accessibility to NG2 antibody when immunostaining is performed at 4 °C on living cells (Fig. 5c). The presence of NG2 on cell surface membrane protrusions can be clearly seen in electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled U251/NG2 cells (Fig. 5d). Extensive arrays of phalloidin-stained stress fibers (Fig. 5f) suggest that these cells with abundant NG2-positive membrane protrusions (Fig. 5e) are quiescent and firmly attached to the substratum. In PMA-treated cells NG2 localization is shifted to prominent newly formed lamellipodia (Fig. 6a). If treated cells are returned to PMA-free culture conditions for 24 h, lamellipodia disappear and NG2-positive membrane protrusions reappear, demonstrating the reversibility of the process. In PMA-induced lamellipodia there is excellent co-localization of NG2 with ezrin (Fig. 6b) and α3β1 integrin (not shown). Immunostaining with a phosphospecific antibody (26Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) shows that phosphorylated ezrin (Thr567) is present in the lamellipodia of PMA-treated cells, as well as in the membrane protrusions of untreated cells (not shown). Phalloidin staining also demonstrates abundant filamentous actin in PMA-induced lamellipodia and reveals significantly reduced levels of actin-containing stress fibers in cells with polarized morphologies (Fig. 6d). Cells in the transfected U251 population routinely lose NG2 expression over a period of several weeks in culture. These NG2-negative cells are much less likely to form lamellipodia in response to PMA treatment, often retaining their arrays of stress fibers under these conditions (Fig. 6, c and d). A quantitative assessment of PMA-induced lamellipodia formation was made using a culture in which 55% of the cells had lost NG2 expression. Extensive phalloidin-positive lamellipodia were observed in 79% of the NG2-positive cells. In contrast, only 12% of the NG2-negative cells exhibited lamellipodia, suggesting a functional role for NG2 during lamellipodia extension in response to PMA. PMA-induced redistribution of NG2 to lamellipodia is blocked by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (Fig. 6, e and f). The ability of this inhibitor to block PKC-stimulated phosphorylation of NG2 (Fig. 1B) suggests that phosphorylation of the proteoglycan could be a factor in its redistribution to lamellipodia. This possibility was further examined utilizing U251 cells expressing mutant versions of NG2 in which Thr2256, Thr2265, and Thr2278 were replaced by valine residues. Under control conditions the localization of these three NG2 species to cell surface protrusions is indistinguishable from that seen with wild type NG2 (Fig. 7A, panels a, c, and e). The response of the T2265V and T2278V mutants to PMA treatment also resembles that of wild type U251/NG2 cells (Fig. 7A, panels b and f): in each case NG2 is redistributed to prominent lamellipodia. In contrast, T2256V transfectants are relatively resistant to the effects of PMA (Fig. 7A, panel d). Although some formation of NG2-positive lamellipodia occurs, NG2 remains associated with apical protrusions in most cells. These data are quantified in Fig. 7B by determining the percentage of cells in each population that display NG2 in lamellipodia as opposed to apical membrane protrusions. PMA treatment shifts NG2 expression from membrane protrusions to lamellipodia in each case except for the T2256V mutant, consistent with the idea that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Thr2256 is required for this molecular redistribution. Like wild type NG2, the T2256V species is co-localized with ezrin and α3β1 integrin in membrane protrusions. Phosphorylation of ezrin appears to be unaffected in these sites, as judged by immunostaining with a phosphospecific antibody. Because substitution of a negatively charged amino acid can mimic the conformational effects of phosphorylation (42Zisch A.H. Pazzagli C. Freeman A.L. Schneller M. Hadman M. Smith J.W. Ruoslahti E. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we transfected U251 cells with NG2 constructs in which glutamic acid residues replaced threonines 2256, 2265, and 2278. The T2265E and T2278E transfectants (Fig. 7A, panels i and j) proved to be indistinguishable from the valine mutants and the wild type transfectants. These mutant NG2 species were primarily localized to apical protrusions in untreated cells and were redistributed to lamellipodia following PMA treatment. In contrast, T2256E transfectants prominently displayed NG2 in lamellipodia both in the absence and presence of PMA (Fig. 7A, panels g and h). Replacement of Thr2256 with glutamic acid thus mimics the effects of NG2 phosphorylation. Ezrin and α3β1 integrin are co-localized in lamellipodia along with the T2256E species. PMA-dependent Increases in Cell Motility—The polarized morphology, ruffling lamellipodial membranes, and lack of stress fibers seen in PMA-treated U251/NG2 cells are reminiscent of characteristics exhibited by motile cells. We used monolayer scratch assays to quantify PMA-dependent changes in cell motility. Panels a–c of Fig. 8 s"

This prediction comes from biochemical studies of the mammalian epithelial sodium channels where glycosylation mutants identified the extracellular regions of the channel and a combination of antibody sensitivity and protease action substantiated the intracellular nature of the amino and carboxyl termini. However, although there are highly conserved regions within the different cation channel family members, membrane topology prediction programs provide several alternative structures for the ASICs. Thus, we used glycosylation studies to define the actual membrane topology of the ASIC2a subtype. We deleted the five predicted endogenous asparagine-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)) at Asn-22, Asn-365, Asn-392, Asn-478, and Asn-487 to map the extracellular topology. We then introduced exogenous asparagine-linked glycosylation sites at Lys-4, Pro-37, Arg-63, Tyr-67, His-72, Ala-81, Tyr-414, Tyr-423, and Tyr-453 to define the transmembrane domain borders. Finally, we used cell permeabilization studies to confirm the intracellular amino termini of ASIC2a. The data show that Asn-365 and Asn-392 are extracellular and that the introduction of asparagine-linked glycosylation sites at His-72, Ala-81, Tyr-414, and Tyr-423 leads to an increase in molecular mass consistent with an extracellular apposition. In addition, heterologous expression of ASIC2a requires membrane permeabilization for antibody staining.

Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). There are eight ASIC subtypes encoded by four genes: ASIC1α, ASIC1b, ASIC-β, ASIC-β2, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4 (2Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. De Weille J.R. Heurteaux C.

McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, ASICs act analogous to neurotransmitter receptors that respond to marked, local fluctuations in the extracellular pH that accompanies normal synaptic activity (8Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). ASICs also contribute to learning and memory (9Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M. Price M.P. Nolan B.C. Yoder P.G. Lamani E. Hoshi T. Freeman Jr., J.H. Welsh M.J.

Although studies suggest that degenerins/epithelial Na+ channels act as mechanosensors (11Welsh M.J. Price M.P. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), recent studies suggest that ASIC2 and ASIC3 do not contribute to mechanosensation (12Drew L.J.

Lazdunski M. Waldmann R. J. Physiol. 2004; 558: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, ASICs are implicated in taste (14Ugawa S. Yamamoto T. Ueda T. Ishida Y. Inagaki A. Nishigaki M. Shimada S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3616-3622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and retinal function (15Ettaiche M. Guy N. Hofman P. Lazdunski M. Waldmann R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).ASICs are members of the amiloride-sensitive cationic channel superfamily that includes the Caenorhabditis elegans degenerins (DEGs), the Helix aspersa Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amidegated sodium (Na+) channel, and the mammalian epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) (16Darboux I.

The amino acid identity between the different ENaC/DEG subfamilies is ∼15–20%, whereas the primary amino acid identity between the four ASIC genes is ∼45–60% (3Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The membrane topology of these channel proteins is predicted to consist of intracellular amino and carboxyl termini with two transmembrane domains connected by a large extracellular loop (Fig. 1a). This prediction comes from hydrophobicity analysis, correlation with in vivo structure-function analyses of the C. elegans DEG mutant MEC-4 (17Hong K. Mano I. Driscoll M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2575-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and correlation with biochemical studies of the α-rENaC (rat) subunit where glycosylation mutants identified the extracellular regions of the channel; a combination of antibody sensitivity and protease action substantiated the intracellular nature of the amino and carboxyl termini (18Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, although there are highly conserved regions within the different cation channel families, to depict the membrane topology of the ASIC family based on homology with ENaCs or hydrophobicity analysis alone may prove erroneous. For example, analysis of each ASIC subtype using four server-based membrane topology prediction programs (PredictProtein (19Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R.

Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar)) resulted in several possible structural outcomes. For seven of the eight ASIC subtypes analyzed, PredictProtein predicted one structure consistent with the DEG/ENaC topology of an intracellular amino and carboxyl termini with two transmembrane domains connected by a large extracellular loop (Fig. 1a). However, the other topology prediction programs did not consistently predict this structure. For the ASIC2a subtype, TopPred analysis predicted four possible outcomes (Fig. 1b), ConPred analysis predicted two structures, each with three transmembrane domains (Fig. 1c), and HMMTOP analysis predicted one structure with a single transmembrane domain (Fig. 1d). Thus, we used biochemical studies and antibody permeabilization studies to unambiguously define the membrane topology of the ASIC2a protein. These data definitively show the membrane topology of ASIC2a to consist of intracellular amino and carboxyl termini with two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular domain.MATERIALS AND METHODSSite-directed Mutagenesis—The ASIC2a cDNA clone was a gift from Professor Michel Lazdunski, Institut de Pharmacologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut Paul Hamel, Sophia Antipolis, Valbonne, France. The ASIC2a cDNA was subcloned into the pCI vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). For the glycosylation studies, five endogenous consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (NX(S/T)) were deleted individually (N22S, N365S, N392S, N478S, and N487S) whereas nine separate glycosylation sites were introduced (K4N, P37N, R63N, Y67N, H72N, A81N, Y414N, Y423N/V425S, and Y453N/Y455S). Each mutant was generated with the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol using high pressure liquid chromatography-purified or PAGE-purified oligonucleotide primers (Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). Individual mutants were verified by DNA sequence analysis, and the predicted amino acid sequences were determined by computer analysis.ASIC2a Transfection and Immunoblot Analysis—The wild type and mutant ASIC2a cDNAs were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were collected after 48 h and lysed for immunoblotting using lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture). All samples were resuspended in SDS loading buffer (1× 0.0625 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and heated to 95 °C for 2 min. The proteins were separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Billerica, MA). The resultant protein blot was incubated with 5% (w/v) milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween (TBST) for 1.5 h at room temperature followed by incubation with the anti-ASIC2 antibody (Alomone; Jerusalem, Israel) diluted in 5% (w/v) milk in TBST for 1.5 h at room temperature. The blot was rinsed four times for 5 min each in TBST without milk and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was rinsed one time in TBST and four times in TBS, and the proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.).ASIC2a Transfection and Immunocytochemistry Analysis—The wild type ASIC2a cDNA was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Systems). The cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips and fixed after 48 h using 2% paraformaldehyde. Permeabilized cells were incubated with 3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. All cells were blocked with 2% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and then incubated with 1.2 μg/ml anti-ASIC2a antibody (Alomone) and 15 μg/ml anti-α-tubulin antibodies overnight at 4 °C (Oncogene Research Products; Boston, MA). Cells were rinsed three times in PBS and then incubated with 1:200 goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody and goat anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated second antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in PBS containing 2% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS, mounted on glass slides with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and viewed on a Leica microscope.Electrophysiological Recording of ASIC2a Current—Mutant and wild type ASIC2a cDNAs were transcribed to produce sense strand cRNA using the mMessage mMachine® kit (Ambion; Austin, TX). Manually defoliculated stage V Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 50 nl (50 ng) of cRNA using an INJECT+MATIC system (INJECT+MATIC; Genéva, Switzerland) and stored at 18 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, 5mm sodium pyruvate, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) for 3–7 days with fresh solution changes daily. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made from the oocytes using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier with a Digidata 1322 analog-to-digital converter and pClamp 8.2 acquisition software (Axon Instruments; Union City, CA). ND96 adjusted to varying pH concentrations was applied to the oocytes via a U-tube perfusion system, and reproducible responses were recorded with a 5-min interval between applications. All data are shown as means ± S.E. of the mean with significant differences calculated using the Student's t test where n is the number of oocytes. Using Origin 6.0 (MicroCal; LLC, Northampton, MA) concentration-response curves for pH sensitivity were fitted with the Hill equation Y = [(X)nH × M]/[(X)nH + (pH50)nH] where Y is response, X is pH, nH is the Hill coefficient, M is maximum response, and pH50 is the acidity that evokes 50% of the maximum response.RESULTSASIC2a Is a Glycoprotein—The ASIC2a cDNA encodes a protein of 512 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 58 kDa. Immunoblot analysis of HEK293 cells transiently expressing ASIC2a identified a protein of ∼63 kDa that was absent from non-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2a). This difference in molecular mass suggests that the protein is post-translationally modified by mechanisms such as phosphorylation, acetylation, farnesylation, and glycosylation. Proteins that are at least in part located in the extracellular space can be glycosylated on asparagine (N-linked), serine/threonine (O-linked), or tryptophan (C-linked) residues as they pass through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi during their biosynthesis. The enzymes responsible for this process are restricted to the lumen of these organelles and, thus, only parts of the protein that ultimately will have an extracellular disposition will be glycosylated. There are five conserved N-linked glycosylation sites (NX(S/T)) in the ASIC2a sequence (Asn-22, Asn-365, Asn-392, Asn-478, and Asn-487). We used enzymatic deglycosylation to determine the extent of the post-translational modification of ASIC2a by glycosylation. Endoglycosidase H removes N-linked chains that have been added in the ER, whereas N-glycosidase F (PNGase) will remove N-glycans that have been added both in the ER and the Golgi. Treatment of HEK293 cells expressing ASIC2a with endoglycosidase H and PNGase reduced the apparent molecular mass of the receptor by ∼5 kDa (Fig. 2a). As one individual glycosylation adds ∼2–3 kDa of mass to a protein, these results suggest that the ASIC2a channel has two natural N-linked glycosylation sites.Fig. 2Immunoblot analysis of endogenous ASIC2a glycosylation sites. a, the effect of Endo H and PNGase on ASIC2a receptor protein. HEK293 cells transiently expressing the ASIC2a protein were prepared and treated with either Endo H or PNGase. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and the resultant blot was probed with ASIC2a primary antibody (Alomone). The immunoblot shows that both Endo H and PNGase reduced the molecular mass of ASIC2a by ∼5 kDa, implying that two glycosylation sites may exist for ASIC2a. b, ASIC2a contains two N-linked glycosylation sites. Mutations N365S and N392S produced ASIC2a channels with a reduced molecular mass, indicating they are both sites for N-linked glycosylation. A double mutant of N365S/N392S produced a reduced molecular mass equal in size to that of PNGase-treated ASIC2a wild type, indicating that only these two sites are required for full glycosylation of ASIC2a. c, the three remaining predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are not glycosylated. Immunoblot analysis of N22S, N478S, and N487S showed no reduction in molecular mass; thus, these ASIC2a proteins are not glycosylated in HEK293 cells. NT, non-transfected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the identity of the sites for N-linked glycosylation and the functional consequences of this glycosylation, we generated individual point mutants (N22S, N365S, N392S, N478S, and N487S) to remove endogenous asparagine residues in the consensus sequence (NX(S/T)). As glycosylation only occurs on the extracellular face of the protein, we predict, based on a hydrophobicity analysis and a putative membrane topology similar to that of the ENaCs, that residues Asn-365 and Asn-392 are glycosylated. If an asparagine residue is involved in glycosylation, the respective mutant should result in a reduction of the molecular mass of the protein detected by the anti-ASIC2a antibody. Of the mutants, only N365S and N392S resulted in a decrease in mass of the ASIC2a protein, whereas the double mutant N365S/N392S gave a further decrease in size, and the band identified by the anti-ASIC2a antibody was indistinguishable from WT ASIC2a treated with PNGase (Fig. 2b). The double mutant N365S/N392S also had a reduced level of receptor expression. These results confirm that amino acid residues Asn-365 and Asn-392 are in the extracellular domain of the protein and are glycosylated. In contrast, the mutants N22S, N478S, and N487S did not show any change in mass compared with WT ASIC2a, consistent with an intracellular localization for these amino acids (Fig. 2c).The effects of glycosylation on the properties of ASIC2a were determined in electrophysiological studies. For WT ASIC2a expressed in Xenopus oocytes, acidification of the ND96 buffer resulted in an inward current that was dependent on the concentration of protons and had a pH50 of 3.58 ± 0.07 (n = 3) (Fig. 3, a and b). The individual mutants N365S and N392S that removed natural glycosylation sites on the protein had no effect on the proton sensitivity of the channel (pH50 of 3.50 ± 0.25 (n = 4) and pH50 of 3.96 ± 0.25 (n = 4), respectively). However, although mutant N365S had no effect on current amplitude relative to control WT ASIC2a, mutant N392S had reduced amplitude responses (49.5% ± 12, n = 6, p < 0.05). In addition, removal of both glycosylation sites (N365S/N392S) altered pH sensitivity (pH50 of 2.90 ± 0.14, n = 7, p < 0.01) and resulted in a significant reduction in the peak current amplitude (70.1% ± 5, n = 5, p < 0.01), consistent with a reduction in protein expression. An accurate determination of the pH sensitivity curve was not possible, as the current did not saturate at pH 2, and treatment with pH 1 resulted in cell death.Fig. 3Effect of removing the glycosylation site on pH sensitivity. a, pH has a decreased effect at double mutant N365S/N392S. Wild type ASIC2a and double mutant N365S/N392S receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and two-electrode voltage clamp analysis (–60mV) was carried out by comparing current with decreasing pH. Trace data shows that an increasing level of acidity is required for double mutant activation as compared with wild type ASIC2a. b, only the double mutant N365S/N392S has altered affinity for increased acidity. Predicted glycosylation site mutants N365S (closed box, dash-dot line) and N392S (closed circle, dotted line) are similar to wild type ASIC2a (open box, solid bold line), exhibiting increased inward currents with increasing pH. N365S/N392S (closed diamond, solid line) shows a significant difference (pH50, 2.90 ± 0.14) compared with wild type (pH50, 3.58 ± 0.07).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Introduction of Potential N-Linked Glycosylation Sites—To investigate further the membrane topology of ASIC2a, we generated a series of mutant channels to introduce consensus sequences for glycosylation. We generated mutants first to investigate the regions that are predicted to be in the intracellular domains (K4N and P37N of the amino terminus compared with N478S and N487S of the carboxyl terminus) and second, to define the regions post-TM1 (R63N, Y67N, H72N, and A81N) and pre-TM2 (Y414N and Y423N/V425S) that can be glycosylated (Fig. 4). The mutants K4N and P37N did not result in any change in the molecular mass of the ASIC2a protein, consistent with the effect of mutating N478S and N487S and supporting the prediction that these amino acids are located intracellularly (Fig. 4a). The post-TM1 mutants H72N and A81N showed an increase in molecular mass compared with WT channels, demonstrating that these residues are glycosylated, whereas R63N and Y67N had no effect on the molecular mass of the ASIC channel (Fig. 4b). Similarly, the pre-TM2 mutants Y414N and Y423N/V425S both resulted in a doublet of bands corresponding to the WT channel and an additional extra-glycosylated form, whereas the post-TM2 mutant Y453N/Y455S did not result in any change in molecular mass of the ASIC2a protein (Fig. 4c). These results help to define the boundaries of the extracellular domain of the channel, as depicted in Fig. 6.Fig. 4Immunoblot analysis of exogenously introduced N-linked glycosylation sites. a, amino terminus Lys-4 and Pro-37 are not glycosylated. Carboxyl terminus Asn-478 and Asn-487 are not glycosylated. Also, Tyr-453 is not glycosylated (see panel c). b, extracellular loop-predicted start region is localized around residue Ala-81; the introduced NQS at Ala-81 is glycosylated. c, the extracellular loop end region is localized around residue Tyr-423; the introduced NES at Tyr-423 is glycosylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Summary of glycosylation studies. The model depicts the membrane topology of ASIC2a based on glycosylation and antibody permeabilization studies. The ASIC2a consists of two TM domains (TM1 and TM2, with amino acid numbers corresponding to the boundaries of the TM domains), intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, and a large extracellular loop. Consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation are shown in black, mutants to introduce consensus N-linked glycosylation sites are shown in gray, and glycosylated residues (H72N, A81N, N365, N392, Y414N, and Y423N/V425S) are shown with the addition of a sugar group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To gain additional independent evidence for the intracellular location of the amino-terminal domain, we performed permeabilization studies on ASIC2a-transfected cells. The epitope of the ASIC2a antibody (Alomone) is directed against amino acids 1–20 of the intracellular amino terminus; thus, we compared ASIC2a expression in permeabilized versus non-permeabilized cells. The data show that ASIC2a expression is detected in cells permeabilized with 3% Triton X-100 prior to staining, whereas there is no ASIC2a expression in non-permeabilized cells (Fig. 5). These data provide additional support for an intracellular localization of the amino-terminal domain.Fig. 5Permeabilization studies support an intracellular amino terminus. The anti-ASIC2a epitope is directed against amino acids 1–20. a, ASIC2a-expressing HEK293 cells permeabilized with 3% Triton X-100 are positive for ASIC2a and tubulin. b, ASIC2a-expressing HEK293 cells that are not permeabilized with Triton X-100 show a low level of ASIC2a staining that overlaps with tubulin; thus, these cells are compromised and are permeable to the antibodies. c, wild type HEK293 cells permeabilized with 3% Triton X-100 show no ASIC2a staining but are positive for tubulin. d, ASIC2a-expressing HEK293 cells permeabilized with 3% Triton X-100 but not exposed to the ASIC2a or tubulin antibodies show no ASIC2a or tubulin staining.

These sugar modifications of the channel were removed by treatment with Endo H that cleaves high mannose oligosaccharides added in the ER from glycoproteins (28Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation can also occur in the Golgi, and this modification is sensitive to PNGase that removes N-glycans added in both the ER and the Golgi. Compared with Endo H treatment, the lack of an additional effect of PNGase on the molecular mass of ASIC2a shows that glycosylation is complete upon exit from the ER before transit to the Golgi. Removal of the Asn-365 glycosylation site had no measurable effect on the pH sensitivity or expression of the ASIC2a channels, whereas removal of Asn-392 resulted in ∼50% reduction in expression relative to WT ASIC2a. Removal of both glycosylation sites resulted in a marked reduction in channel expression and pH sensitivity. These results suggest that the ASIC2a site requires glycosylation at either Asn-365 or Asn-392 for normal channel expression and trafficking. The change in decreased sensitivity to pH upon the removal of both glycosylation sites also indicates that glycosylation contributes to binding or gating of the ASIC2a receptor channel. This is in contrast to studies on ENaC channels (18Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that have six glycosylation sites, and these sites can be removed with no obvious effect on channel function.Examination of the exogenously added N-linked glycosylation sites (H72N, A81N, Y414N, and"
https://openalex.org/W1996380677,"The Rho family GTPase Rac acts as a molecular switch for signal transduction to regulate various cellular functions. Mice deficient in the hematopoietic-specific Rac2 isoform exhibit agonist-specific defects in neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production, despite expression of the highly homologous Rac1 isoform. To examine whether functional defects in rac2–/– neutrophils reflect effects of an overall decrease in total cellular Rac or an isoform-specific role for Rac2, retroviral vectors were used to express exogenous Rac1 or Rac2 at levels similar to endogenous. In rac2–/– neutrophils differentiated from transduced myeloid progenitors in vitro, increasing cellular Rac levels by expression of either exogenous Rac1 or Rac2 increased formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine- or phorbol ester-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity. Of note, placement of an epitope tag on the N terminus of Rac1 or Rac2 blunted reconstitution of responses in rac2–/– neutrophils. In rac2–/– neutrophils isolated from mice transplanted with Rac-transduced bone marrow cells, superoxide production and chemotaxis were fully reconstituted by expression of exogenous Rac2, but not Rac1. A chimeric Rac1 protein in which the Rac1 C-terminal polybasic domain, which contains six lysines or arginines, was replaced with that of the human Rac2 polybasic domain containing only three basic residues, also reconstituted superoxide production and chemotaxis, whereas expression of a Rac2 derivative in which the polybasic domain was replaced with that of Rac1 did not and resulted in disoriented cell motility. Thus, the composition of the polybasic domain is sufficient for determining Rac isoform specificity in the production of superoxide and chemotaxis in murine neutrophils in vivo."

Here we investigated the role of DLC1 phosphorylation by Pak1 upon the process of macropinocytosis. We found that Pak1 associates with dynein motor and that Pak1-DLC1 interaction starts at the initiation of pinosome formation and persists in early and late endosomes. Pak1 phosphorylation of DLC1 on Ser-88 controls vesicle formation and trafficking functions, as Ser-88 substitution for alanine prevents macropinocytosis. A peptide spanning the C-terminal 19-amino acid region of DLC1 efficiently blocked Ser-88 phosphorylation and macropinocytosis.

Furthermore, growth factor stimulation of macropinocytosis has been implicated in directional locomotion, because regulation of membrane flux via pinocytosis may contribute to the membrane flow, therefore generating force of cell locomotion (24Dharmawardhane S. Schurmann A. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Schmid S.L. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3341-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 29Thompson C.R. Bretscher M.S. Development. 2002; 129: 4185-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bretscher M.S. Aguado V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Despite the widely acknowledged roles of Pak1 in macropinocytosis and of macropinocytosis in pathogen entry, the nature of the responsible molecular mechanism remains unknown. Cytoskeleton remodeling-dependent cellular processes, such as vesicle transport and membrane transport, are influenced by dynein, a multiprotein complex originally shown to regulate chromosome movement, assembly, and orientation of mitotic spindles and nuclear migration (31Holzbaur E.L. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Dynein light chain-1 (DLC1), an 8-kDa component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, is a minus end-directed microtubule-based motor that transports cargo along microtubules (32Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies identified DLC1 as a stoichiometric subunit of myosin V motor, essential for short-range transport of vesicles in the actin-rich cortex of the cells (33Espindola F.S. Suter D.M. Partata L.B. Cao T. Wolenski J.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 269-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel K. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20929-20935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). DLC1 is highly conserved among species and widely expressed in a number of tissues. In addition to its essential role in dynein motor function, DLC1 interacts with a number of regulatory proteins with diverse functions. For example, DLC1 associates with neuronal nitric oxide synthase and inhibits pro-apoptotic function (35Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). DLC1 also interacts and interferes with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BimL (36Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that DLC1 is also a Pak1-interacting substrate with binding sites mapped to amino acids 61-89 of DLC1 and phosphorylation at Ser-88 (37Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yaramand R. Yang Z. Seethraman B. Nguyen D. Sahin A. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because DLC1 is a physiologic interacting substrate of Pak1 and because previous studies have implicated Pak1 in macropinocytosis, here we investigated the role of DLC1 phosphorylation upon the process of macropinocytosis. Cell Cultures, Reagents, and Transfections—MCF-7 and ZR75 breast cancer cells (38Mazumdar A. Wang R. Misra S. Adam L. Bagheri-Yaramand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies to Pak1 and DLC1 were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Inc. (San Francisco, CA) and Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA). Antibody to T7 was purchased from Novagen (Milwaukee, WI). Antibody to EEA1, LAMP1, and dynein intermediate chain (DIC) were purchased from ABCAM (Cambridge, UK). FITC-dextran, Lucifer yellow, and streptavidin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Orlando, FL). Transient transfection studies were performed using a FuGENE-6 kit (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Pak Assay—In vitro kinase assays using myelin basic protein or glutathione S-transferase (GST)-DLC1 protein (4 μg each) were performed in HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 ng of purified bacterially expressed GST-Pak1 enzyme, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 25 μm cold ATP (2Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Adam L. Nguyen D. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In some experiments, DIC immunoprecipitates were used as a substrate in lieu of myelin basic protein. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Studies—The cellular location of proteins was determined using indirect immunofluorescence (2Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Adam L. Nguyen D. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on glass cover slips were fixed in methanol at -20 °C for 6 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with 546Alexa (red)-, 633Alexa (blue)-, or 488Alexa (green)-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The DNA dye Topro-3 was used to co-stain the DNA, which gives an emission in the far red segment of the light spectrum, and color-coded in blue (Molecular Probes). Confocal analysis was performed with a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope using established methods of processing of the same section for each detector (the two excitations corresponding to 546 and 488, or 633 nm), comparing the sections pixel by pixel. Quantitation of vesicle-like structure was done in some experiments as follows. Ten randomly selected fields were analyzed for each condition. The experiment was repeated two to three times. Quantitation of vesicle formation was done using the following scoring system: -, cells containing 0-9 vesicles; +, cells containing 10-20 vesicles; ++, cells containing >20 vesicles. Emerging data suggest that the functions of DLC1 are regulated by its phosphorylation on Ser-88 by its upstream kinase Pak1 that also interacts with the penultimate C-terminal 19 amino acids of DLC1 (37Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yaramand R. Yang Z. Seethraman B. Nguyen D. Sahin A. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because DLC1 was shown to be an essential component of dynein motors (31Holzbaur E.L. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 32Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the process of macropinocytosis might utilize cellular motor. To explore the potential role of DLC1-Pak1 pathway in the process of macropinocytosis, we asked whether DLC1 (and also Pak1) colocalizes with macropinocytosis markers. Consistent with the earlier findings (25Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we found Pak1 colocalization with detectable endocytosed FITC-dextran (Fig. 1, a and b) and also with endocytosed Lucifer yellow (Fig. 1c), the two commonly used markers of macropinocytosis, in NIH3T3 cells pretreated with either lysophosphatidate (LPA) or serum for 30 min using scanning confocal microscopy. To show the association of DLC1 with macropinocytotic markers, NIH3T3 cells transfected with red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged DLC1 were treated with LPA for 30 min in the presence of FITC-dextran. The colocalization of RFP-DLC1 (red) with dextran (green) can be seen as a yellow color in merged images (Fig. 1d). Similarly, we further examined the colocalization of DLC1 with macropinocytic markers and found that RFP-DLC1 was colocalized with FITC-dextran in more than 85% of transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells stimulated with serum (Fig. 1e), suggesting a role of DLC1 in macropinocytosis of stimulated epithelial cells. The colocalization of Pak1 with DLC1 in ZR75 breast cancer cells stimulated with serum (Fig. 1f) indicated the potential regulatory role of DLC1-Pak1 pathway in the process of macropinocytosis. To clarify the role of DLC1 in macropinocytosis, using the ZR75 breast cancer cell line we generated two stable clones expressing either RFP vector only or RFP-DLC1. We found that RFP-DLC1 clone is much more active in uptake of FITC-dextran and also that RFP-DLC1 colocalizes with FITC-dextran upon epidermal growth factor treatment (Fig. 2a). The colocalization was found of transient transfected RFP-DLC1 (red) and FITC-dextran (green), as well as endogenous Pak1 (blue), in ZR75 breast cancer cells (Fig. 2b), suggesting that the DLC1-localized dextran vesicles also contain Pak1. To show the dependence of DLC1-mediated endocytosis on Pak1 activation, we expressed kinase-dead K299RLL-Pak1 (5Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) into ZR75 breast cells with stable expression of RFP-DLC1 and analyzed internalization of FITC-dextran by confocal microscopy. Inhibition of the Pak1 pathway completely blocked the internalization of FITC-dextran (green) as well as RFP-DLC1 (red)-containing vesicle formation in more than 90% of the cells expressing Myc-K299RLL Pak1 (blue) (Fig. 2c), suggesting a role of Pak1 activity in DLC1-associated macropinocytosis. To delineate the potential involvement of Pak1 in vesicle trafficking, we next examined whether Pak1 association is limited to the early process of macropinosome formation and/or whether it has any role in subsequent steps such as formation and movement of early and late endosomes. To test these possibilities, we colocalized Pak1 and DLC1 with EEA1, a well established marker of early endosome (39Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele M. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Because both Pak1 and EEA1 antibodies are of rabbit origin, we used GFP-tagged Pak1 and RFP-tagged DLC1 and anti-EEA1 antibodies to detect endogenous EEA1. Results showed the presence of DLC1, Pak1, and EEA1 on small vesicle-like structures. Analysis of merged images showed colocalization (pink) of DLC1 with EEA1 and colocalization (yellow) of DLC1 with GFP-Pak1. Further analysis of the merged image of three colors (white) showed Pak1 and DLC1 colocalization with early endosome marker EEA1 (Fig. 3a). Because dynein is also known to participate in the transport of late endosomes, we used a late endosomal marker LAMP1 (40Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) to analyze whether Pak1-DLC1 interaction also occurs on late endosomes. As expected, RFP-DLC1 colocalized with LAMP1 on vesicular structures (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, GFP-Pak1 colocalized with late endosomal marker LAMP1; colocalization of GFP-Pak1, RFP-DLC1, and LAMP1 was observed as well (Fig. 3b, white color). The presence of Pak1 and DLC1 on macropinocytic markers, such as FITC-dextran, and their continued presence on early and late endosomes suggested that Pak1-DLC1 interaction may have multiple roles, including formation, maturation, and trafficking of macropinosomes. Because DLC1-containing dynein motors have been implicated in vesicle transport using microtubules (32Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 33Espindola F.S. Suter D.M. Partata L.B. Cao T. Wolenski J.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 269-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Schliwa M. Woehlke G. Nature. 2003; 422: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) and because we noticed colocalization of Pak1 and DLC1 with the early and late endosomes, we next examined whether Pak1 also colocalizes with DLC1 in the context of dynein motor, using DIC as a marker of the dynein complex. Confocal analysis revealed colocalization of GFP-Pak1 with RFP-DLC1 (Fig. 4a) and, as expected, DIC was colocalized with DLC1. In some areas, triple colocalization of GFP-Pak1, RFP-DLC1, and DIC (shown by white color) was observed (Fig. 4a). To confirm physiologic interaction of Pak1 with dynein motors, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using antibodies specific to DIC to precipitate dynein motor complex. Pak1 was found in epidermal growth factor-activated DIC immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4b), suggesting that Pak1 associates with the dynein motor complexes. Furthermore, wild-type Pak1, but not kinase-dead K299R Pak1 enzyme, could phosphorylate DLC1 as a part of native dynein complex precipitated from MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4c). To delineate the underlying mechanism by which DLC1-Pak1 interaction might regulate macropinocytosis, we next explored the potential involvement of DLC1 phosphorylation by Pak1. We cotransfected SKBR3 breast cancer cell line cells with GFP-Pak1 either together with RFP-DLC1 or with RFP-DLC1-S88A, which lacks the Pak1 phosphorylation site. Vesicle formation and localization of GFP and RFP proteins were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Ten randomly selected fields were analyzed under microscope for quantitation of vesicle-like structure. As compared with the cells transfected with wild-type DLC1, the vesicle-like structures were reduced 90% in cells transfected with DLC1-S88A (Fig. 5a). To further clarify whether Pak1-mediated macropinocytosis requires Pak1-DLC1 interactions, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with RFP-DLC1, RFP-DLC1-S88A, and RFP-DLC1-S88E. The expression of RFP-DLC1-S88A substantially interfered with the macropinocytosis of FITC-dextran (Fig. 5b). In contrast, expression of RFP-DLC1-S88E, which mimics the phosphorylated form because of a negative charge, profoundly enhanced the macropinocytosis of FITC-dextran as compared with RFP-DLC1 (Fig. 5b). Quantitative analysis of macropinocytic uptake showed that the DLC1-S88E mutant substantially enhanced macropinocytosis compared with that of wild-type DLC1-transfected cells, whereas the DLC1-S88A mutant showed 50% less uptake of FITC-dextran compared with that of wild-type RFP-DLC1-expressing cells (Fig. 5c). In addition, DLC1-S88A blocked macropinocytosis in the presence of active Pak1 (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that Pak1 binding and phosphorylation of DLC1 participates in macropinocytosis. Because the Pak1 binding region and phosphorylation site are localized to the C-terminal 19 amino acids of DLC1 (37Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yaramand R. Yang Z. Seethraman B. Nguyen D. Sahin A. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and because mutants of DLC1 lacking a Pak1 binding/phosphorylation site effectively inhibited macropinocytosis (Fig. 5), we hypothesized that the C-terminal peptide of DLC1 containing the Pak1 interaction site may interfere with Pak1 functions and act as a potent inhibitor of macropinocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a peptide consisting of the C-terminal 19 amino acids of DLC1 fused to the TAT protein polybasic sequence (Fig. 6a) to facilitate entry into cells (17Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar). To detect the cellular uptake of this peptide, it was biotinated at the N terminus. Initially, we used in vitro kinase assays to determine whether the DLC1 peptide interferes with Pak1 phosphorylation of wild-type DLC1. Addition of DLC1 peptide inhibited Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type DLC1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the control TAT peptide had no significant effect (Fig. 6b). Pak1 also efficiently phosphorylated the synthetic DLC1 C-terminal peptide in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 6c). The TAT-DLC1 peptide disrupted Pak1-DLC1 complex formation in GST pulldown assay (Fig. 6d). These results suggested that the DLC1 peptide we synthesized contained the Pak1 binding region and phosphorylation site. Next we visualized entry of the DLC1 peptide into the cells and determined its colocalization with Pak1. Biotin-labeled DLC1 peptide was added into the medium of NIH3T3 cells. 60 min later, cells were fixed and costained for biotin with streptavidin (red) and endogenous Pak1 (blue). The DLC1 peptide efficiently entered cells (Fig. 7, a and b) and colocalized with endogenous Pak1 (Fig. 7a). Confocal analysis revealed that DLC1 peptide treatment prevented interaction of Pak1 with dynein complex (data not shown). We next tested whether the DLC1 peptide would inhibit macropinocytosis by interfering with Pak1-DLC1 interaction. NIH3T3 cells were stimulated with 10% serum to accelerate the process of macropinocytosis. Cells were pretreated with control peptide (Fig. 7c) or DLC1 peptide (Fig. 7d) for 30 min, and then FITC-dextran was added into the medium. Uptake of FITC-dextran by macropinocytosis was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Quantitation of macropinocytosis by counting the cellular uptake of FITC-dextran showed a 75% reduction in bead uptake in DLC1 peptide-treated cells compared with bead uptake in control peptide-treated cells (Fig. 7e). Together, these results suggested that the C-terminal DLC1 peptide is a potent inhibitor of macropinocytosis. In brief, results presented here suggested that DLC1 regulation by Pak1 might represent an essential step in the process of macropinocytosis. In this study we showed that Pak1 associates with dynein motor and that Pak1-DLC1 interaction starts at the initiation of pinosome formation and persists in early and late endosomes. Pak1 phosphorylation of DLC1 on Ser-88 controls vesicle formation and trafficking functions, as Ser-88 substitution for alanine prevents macropinocytosis. A peptide spanning the C-terminal 19-amino acid region of DLC1 efficiently blocked Ser-88 phosphorylation and macropinocytosis. These results suggest that the regulation of DLC1 by Pak1 is a novel mechanism by which a signaling kinase might influence macropinocytosis. We thank Liana Adam for partial confocal microscopy.

The activity of the enzyme that synthesizes SAM, methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), increases 2.5-fold at night in the pineal gland. In this study, we found that pineal MAT2A mRNA and the protein it encodes, MAT II, also increase at night, suggesting that the increase in MAT activity is caused by an increase in MAT II gene products. The night levels of MAT2A mRNA in the pineal gland were severalfold higher than in other neural and non-neural tissues examined, consistent with the requirement for SAM in melatonin synthesis. Related studies indicate that the nocturnal increase in MAT2A mRNA is caused by activation of a well described neural pathway that mediates photoneural-circadian regulation of the pineal gland. MAT2A mRNA and MAT II protein were increased in organ culture by treatment with norepinephrine (NE), the sympathetic neurotransmitter that stimulates the pineal gland at night. NE is known to markedly elevate pineal cAMP, and here it was found that cAMP agonists elevate MAT2A mRNA levels by increasing MAT2A mRNA synthesis and that drugs that block cAMP activation of cAMP dependent protein kinase block effects of NE. Therefore, the NE-cAMP dependent increase in pineal MAT activity seems to reflect an increase in MAT II protein, which occurs in response to cAMP→protein kinase-dependent increased MAT2A expression. The existence of this MAT regulatory system underscores the importance that MAT plays in melatonin biogenesis. These studies also point to the possibility that SAM production in other tissues might be regulated through cAMP.

MAT exists in three forms, designated MAT I, MAT II, and MAT III. These three isoforms are the products of two genes (MAT1A and MAT2A) (4Mudd S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1372-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAT I and MAT III are expressed only in adult liver and are encoded by the MAT1A gene (5Kotb M. Mudd S.H. Mato J.M. Geller A.M. Kredich N.M. Chou J.Y. Cantoni G.L. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 51-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). MAT I is a tetramer and MAT III is a dimer of a single α1-subunit. In contrast to the restricted distribution of MAT I and III, MAT II is found in fetal hepatic tissue, adult extrahepatic tissues, and some transformed hepatocytes. Encoded by MAT2A, the α2 subunit plays the role of catalysis; the entire enzyme comprises only α2 or is constructed with regulatory β-subunits (6Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The function of the β-subunit seems to be to down-regulate MAT II activity (7Halim A.B. LeGros L. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29720-29725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); however, the precise nature of the interaction between the α2- and β-subunits is still not clear. MAT in the pineal gland is of special interest because synthesis of the hormonal product of this tissue, melatonin, requires SAM at the last step (i.e. the O-methylation of N-acetyl 5-hydroxytryptamine by hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase) (8Guchhait R.B. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, 9Guchhait R.B. Grau Jr., J.E. J. Neurochem. 1978; 31: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Sugden D. Cena V. Klein D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Melatonin synthesis in the pineal increases at night by ∼10-fold in response to stimulation by a neural pathway that includes the central oscillator in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (11Ganguly S. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 309: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Signals from the SCN are transmitted to the pineal gland by a pathway that passes through central and peripheral neural structures to a subset of cells in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG); the final link is made by projections from these cells that pervade the pineal perivascular space. Release of norepinephrine (NE) from these projections at night leads to an increase in melatonin production (11Ganguly S. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 309: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Light acts on this system in mammals via the eyes to synchronize the SCN clock to environmental lighting cycles, which in turn synchronizes all circadian rhythms. In addition, light acts downstream of the clock to gate SCN stimulation of the pineal gland; as a result, prolonged light exposure or a pulse of light at night prevents NE release from SCG projections in the pineal perivascular space, thereby blocking adrenergic stimulation of pinealocytes (11Ganguly S. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 309: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Stimulation of melatonin production is known to reflect changes in several elements of melatonin synthesis; the most dramatic are large night/day differences in the activity of the next-to-last enzyme in melatonin synthesis, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) (12Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Baler R. McCune S.K. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These control large changes in melatonin synthesis by controlling the production of N-acetyl 5-hydroxytryptamine. During the day, low levels of AANAT probably limit melatonin synthesis. At night, however, when the activity of this enzyme is high, maximal levels of melatonin synthesis probably reflect other elements in melatonin synthesis, including SAM production. Studies of pineal SAM and MAT indicate that SAM levels decrease at night, apparently reflecting increased turnover and net consumption; in addition, MAT activity increases (13Guchhait R.B. Monjan A.A. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 2092-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Sitaram B.R. Sitaram M. Traut M. Chapman C.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1887-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which may reflect a coordinated increase in SAM production in response to an increased requirement for melatonin synthesis. Our interest in MAT was stimulated by results of cDNA microarray analysis studies indicating that the expression of MAT2A mRNA increases at night in the pineal gland. 2MAT2A mRNA in the rat pineal gland was 5-6-fold higher at night relative to day in spotted cDNA array (n = 3) analysis (S. Blackshaw, S. L. Coon, J.-S. Kim, C. L. Cepko, and D. C. Klein, unpublished data). This was subsequently confirmed using an oligonucleotide array (Affymetrix; S. L. Coon, D. Carter, R. Baler, and D.

In this study, we focused on the factors controlling pineal MAT activity by measuring MAT activity, MAT II protein, and MAT2A mRNA. These results are of interest because they provide details of the regulation of pineal MAT activity and, by inference, SAM production; they are of broader interest because they provide a clue to understanding how SAM synthesis is regulated in other tissues and how it might be manipulated pharmacologically. l-[methyl-3H]Methionine and [32P]αdCTP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. l-(-)-Norepinephrine, R-(-)-phenylephrine, 8-bromo-cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP, (-)-isoproterenol, forskolin, actinomycin D, puromycin, MgCl2, KCl, 2-mercaptoethanol, ATP, KT5720, Rp-8-PIP-cAMP, and methionine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

(Germantown, NY) (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9); Panum Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark (Fig. 4); and Zivic-Miller Laboratories (Allison Park, PA) (Fig. 5). Surgical decentralization and removal of superior cervical ganglia (SCGX) were performed by Zivic-Miller Laboratories. Animals were housed for 2 weeks in lighting cycles of light/dark 14:10 (or 12:12 in the case of in situ hybridization studies). Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and decapitated. For biochemical studies, glands were immediately placed on solid CO2 and stored at -80 °C until use. “Day” pineal glands and tissues were removed at ∼ZT7 or at the time indicated in the figures or text; “night” pineal glands and tissues were obtained at ∼ZT19 or at the time indicated in the figures or text. Animals were killed in the “dark” using dim red light. For cytochemical studies, pineal gland or intact brain (with the pineal gland) were removed and frozen before sectioning. Animal use and care protocols were in accordance with NIH guidelines.Fig. 2Daily rhythm in rat pineal MAT2A mRNA and of MAT II protein and activity.

Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Neuropharmacology. 1976; 15: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The glands were transferred to fresh media after 24, 36, and 48 h. At 48 h, the glands were transferred into a top-loading tabletop incubator, which allows direct access to wells through ports with minimal disturbance to temperature or gas phase. The glands were incubated under control conditions for 30 min and then transferred into medium containing drugs of interest. At the end of treatment, glands were placed in microtubes on solid CO2 and stored at -80 °C until use. In experiments for which mRNA levels, protein levels, and enzyme activities are reported, each analysis was performed on separate sets of pineal glands treated in culture on the same day. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the guanidine-HCl/phenol procedure (TRIzol reagent; Invitrogen). RNA was separated on a 1.5% agarose/0.7 M formaldehyde gel, transferred to a charged nylon membrane (Nytran; Schleicher and Schuell) by passive capillary transfer, and cross-linked to the membrane using ultraviolet light. The MAT hybridization probes used were based on the 3′ untranslated region of MAT1A (nucleotides 1283-1837; GenBank™ accession number X15734) or the 3′ untranslated region of MAT2A (nucleotides 2827-3348, GenBank™ accession number BC062394); the AANAT probe has been described previously (12Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Baler R. McCune S.K. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Probes were 32P-labeled by random priming using a DNA Labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped and reprobed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (12Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), 18 S rRNA (nucleotides 484-1080; GenBank™ accession number M11188) or ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32) (nucleotides 1-408; GenBank™ accession number NM_013226) (16Kim J-S.

Brain Res. 1997; 51: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) to monitor the quality of the RNA and equal loading. Blots were hybridized at 68 °C for 1.5 h in QuikHyb buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The final wash was in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 20 min. Blots were visualized and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences); values were normalized against the signals generated by 18 S rRNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or RPL32. In Situ Hybridization of Brain Sections—15-μm sagittal cryostat sections of rat brains were cut and thaw mounted on Superfrost Plus glass slides. The slides were kept at -80 °C until processed. The sections were hybridized, as described previously (18Møller M. Phansuwan-Pujito P. Morgan K.C. Badiu C. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 288: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with an 35S-labeled 32-mer oligonucleotide probe based on rat MAT2A sequence (5′-GCGTAACCAAGGCAATGTGCCATTGCGGCGTA; antisense strand, nucleotides 610-641; GenBank™ accession number BC062394). The probe was diluted in sterile diethyl pyrocarbonate-water to a concentration of 5.0 pmol/μl. Probe in 5 μl was then labeled with 35S-ATP and terminal transferase (Roche) to a specific activity of 1 × 1018 dpm/mol. Frozen tissue sections were then thawed, fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice for 1 min each in PBS, and acetylated (0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.9% NaCl containing 0.1 m triethanolamine for 10 min). The sections were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols and delipidated in 100% chloroform (5 min). They were partially rehydrated in 100 and 95% ethanol (1 min each) and allowed to dry. For hybridization of the cryostat sections, labeled probe was diluted in the hybridization buffer (10 μl of labeled probe/ml hybridization buffer) consisting of 50% (v/v) formamide, 4× SSC (150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0,02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll) 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA. An aliquot of 200 μl of the labeled probe was pipetted onto each section. The sections were then covered with Parafilm and incubated in a humid chamber overnight at 42 °C. After hybridization, the slides were washed in 1× SSC four times for 15 min each at 55 °C, twice for 30 min each at room temperature, and rinsed twice in distilled water. The sections were dried and either exposed to an x-ray film for 1-2 weeks or dipped into an Amersham LM-1 emulsion and exposed for 2-4 weeks at 4 °C. The pineal hybridization signals in autoradiographs of sagittal sections were quantified using “Image 1.42” (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). Optical density was converted to disintegrations per minute per milligram of tissue using simultaneously exposed 14C-labeled standards calibrated by comparison with 35S-labeled brain-paste standards. Results are based on the analysis of pineal glands from four animals killed at night and four during the day. Four sections from each pineal gland were used to determine the strength of the signal; signals from different animals were normalized using a standard processed with the tissue. In Situ Hybridization of Pineal Sections—The analysis of pineal sections was performed as described previously (19Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8074-8082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using expressed sequence tags corresponding to MAT2A (GenBank™ accession number AI849149) and AANAT (GenBank™ accession number AW047378) as templates for generating cRNA probes, which were labeled with digoxigenin. SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis—To prepare samples, two glands were homogenized by brief sonication (three 1-s pulses) using a Biosonik sonicator (Bronwill Scientific, Rochester, NY) in 50 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 4 °C; the homogenate was centrifuged (13,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was used for analytical procedures. Protein was measured by a dye binding method using a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad protein assay) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Samples containing 60 μg of protein were resolved on pre-formed 10% Tris/glycine (1 mm) gels using the manufacturer's protocol (Novex, San Diego, CA). Rainbow standards (Amersham Biosciences) were used to determine the molecular mass of the proteins. Electroblots—The proteins were electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P (0.45 μm) transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a semi-dry blotting system (Investigator Graphite Electroblotter System; Genomic Solutions, Chelmsford, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The proteins were equilibrated (5 min) and transferred using 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 20% methanol and 0.01% SDS. The conditions for electrical transfer were 400 μA/cm2 (20 min), 600 μA/cm2 (20 min), 800 μA/cm2 (20 min), followed by 1200 μA/cm2 (45min). Immunodetection—Membranes were air-dried and then blocked for 2 h in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad), 0.2% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad), and 0.05% thimerosal (Sigma). An anti-MAT (6765) polyclonal was raised in New Zealand White rabbits against conjugated mouse MATII95-119 (GenBank™ accession number A47151). Antiserum was diluted (1:10,000) in PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin fraction V and 0.05% thimerosal. The membranes were incubated (18 h, room temperature) with antiserum and washed (twice for 5 min each in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then twice for 5 min each in PBS). The washed"

Because PYY and NPY also alter the expression of intestine-specific differentiation marker proteins and the tetraspanin CD63, which is involved in cell adhesion, we investigated whether intestinal cell differentiation could be linked to mucosal cell adhesion and migration through these peptides. PYY and NPY significantly decreased cell adhesion and increased cell migration in a dose-dependent manner prior to cell confluency in our model system, non-tumorigenic small intestinal hBRIE 380i cells. Both peptides reduced CD63 expression and CD63-dependent cell adhesion. CD63 overexpression increased and antisense CD63 cDNA decreased intestinal cell adhesion. In parallel, both PYY and NPY increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) to a level sufficient to induce cell migration by activating the Rho GTPase Cdc42. The effects of both peptides on cell migration were blocked in cells constitutively overexpressing dominant-negative Cdc42. PYY and NPY also significantly induced the expression of the differentiation marker villin, which could be eliminated by an MMP inhibitor at a concentration that inhibits cell migration. Increased MMP-3 activity, which enhanced cell migration, also induced villin mRNA levels. Therefore, these data indicate that the alteration of adhesion and migration by PYY and NPY occurs in part by synchronous modulation of three proteins that are involved in extracellular matrix-basolateral membrane interactions, CD63, MMP-3 and Cdc42, and that PYY/NPY regulation of expression of mucosal proteins such as villin is linked to the process of cell migration and adhesion.

The maintenance of mucosal epithelial cells in a structure of well regulated spatial organization of specific cell phenotypes likely requires the coordination of events that are sensitive to a feedback regulation involving luminal signals (at the apical cell surface), signals derived from the mesenchyme, the extracellular matrix (ECM 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; NPY, neuropeptide Y; PYY, peptide YY; I-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBD, p21-binding domain; NNGH, N-isobutyl-N-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)glycylhydroxamic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MT, matrix type; LPH, lactase phlorizin hydrolase. ; at the basolateral surface), and receptosecretory cells. Receptosecretory cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa are endocrine cells in contact with the luminal surface that synthesize and secrete bioactive peptides, many of which are found both in neuronal cells of the central and peripheral nerves and in endocrine cells in the mucosa of the anterior and posterior intestine. These peptides are responsive, either directly or indirectly, to the nutritional status of the organism and act to modify a number of responses ranging from behavior (neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide YY (PYY), ghrelin, and cholecystokinin) (1Batterham R.L.

Like many growth factor receptors, the receptors for these peptides are found in both neuronal tissues and epithelial cells, where these peptides act as paracrine, neurocrine, and/or endocrine agents. Thus, these bioactive peptides are uniquely positioned to be part of a mechanism of feedback regulation coordinating mucosal homeostasis, such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, in response to environmental (luminal) signals as well as neuronal (central and peripheral nerves) signals. How signals from these peptides are coordinated with those originating from exogenous sources, such as the diet, is still unclear. Two peptides that are responsive to nutrient cues are PYY and NPY. PYY and NPY are 36-amino acid peptides that share 50% amino acid identity as well as a hairpin-like three-dimensional structure (PP-fold) with an amidated C terminus (8Tatemoto K. Carlquist M. Mutt V. Nature. 1982; 296: 659-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). PYY is synthesized in enteroendocrine cells of the mucosa of the distal small intestine and colon. It is released from the gastrointestinal tract in response to a meal and is directly released in response to free fatty acids (9Aponte G.W. Taylor I.L. Soll A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G829-G836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its classical effects include the inhibition of intestinal motility, gall bladder and pancreatic exocrine secretion, peripheral inhibition of fluid and electrolyte secretion in the intestinal tract (10Eto B. Boisset M. Anini Y. Voisin T. Desjeux J.F. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and vasoconstriction (11Malmstrom R.E. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). PYY is also localized to neurons (12Ekblad E. Sundler F. Peptides. 2002; 23: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), where it may have not only peripheral action, but also action affecting the central nervous system and behavior such as food intake (1Batterham R.L. Bloom S.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 994: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). NPY is widely distributed throughout both the central nervous system and sympathetic peripheral nerves and is particularly abundant in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex (13Dumont Y. Martel J.C. Fournier A. St-Pierre S. Quirion R. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 38: 125-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 14Palkovits M. CIBA Found. Symp. 1992; 168 (Discussion 10-15): 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). NPY induces food intake in several species when injected intracerebroventricularly and decreases feeding when its hypothalamic expression is reduced (15Loftus T.M. Jaworsky D.E. Frehywot G.L.

Both PYY and NPY bind to PP-fold receptors called the neuropeptide Y receptors, which are members of the rhodopsin-like receptor family belonging to the heterogeneous superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Five subtypes of Y receptors have been cloned from mammals (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and Y6) (23Berglund M.M. Hipskind P.A. Gehlert D.R. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). PYY and NPY have similar binding affinity compared to the Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors (23Berglund M.M. Hipskind P.A. Gehlert D.R.

There have been extensive studies as to the physiological responses of these peptides, but fewer studies characterize their effects on gene regulation (27Garcia de Yebenes E. Li S. Fournier A.

We previously reported that PYY and NPY induce the expression of a late marker of intestinal cell differentiation, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) (31Halldén G. Aponte G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12591-12600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the tetraspanin CD63, a putative integrin-associated adhesive molecule (32Halldén G. Hadi M. Hong H.T. Aponte G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27914-27924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), in non-migrating differentiated small intestinal hBRIE 380i cells (33Aponte G.W. Keddie A. Halldén G. Hess R. Link P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Reduction of CD63 transcript levels delays the expression of I-FABP (32Halldén G. Hadi M. Hong H.T. Aponte G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27914-27924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because CD63 has been implicated as necessary for β integrin-associated cell adhesion and motility in breast carcinoma cells (34Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PYY and NPY regulation of CD63 affects the expression of differentiation-dependent proteins such as villin before the cells develop a fully differentiated phenotype and whether this process involves modulation of cell adhesion and/or migration. We present data demonstrating for the first time that, in non-tumorigenic intestinal epithelial cells, both PYY and NPY decrease cell adhesion and induce cell migration and that these occur through the interaction of three protein families: tetraspanins, Rho GTPases, and matrix metalloproteinases. We show that, in pre-confluent cells, PYY and NPY decrease the expression of CD63 and cell adhesiveness, the opposite of what occurs when cells have been confluent for several days. Thus, the regulation of gene expression by these neuroregulatory peptides in enterocytes can be bimodal, dependent on cell state or age. In parallel, PYY and NPY induce intestinal cell migration mediated by Rho GTPase Cdc42 activation and induction of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 (stromelysin) transcript. PYY/NPY-induced villin mRNA is blocked upon inhibition of MMP activities, and the villin transcript increases with constitutive elevated expression of MMP-3. These data suggest that expression of proteins specific to a mucosal cell phenotype in situ might be regulated differentially by a peptide hormone depending on the cell's position along the crypt-to-villus axis and that this expression can be modulated through the process linked to cell migration. Cell Culture Conditions—The cell line utilized in this study was a well characterized subclone of the Berkeley rat intestinal epithelial hybrid cell line expressing PYY/NPY-binding sites and the enterocyte differentiation-dependent marker I-FABP (hBRIE 380i cells) (31Halldén G.

Cells were at pre-confluency 24 h after being laid down at a density of 3 × 105 cells/flask, at near confluency 48 and 72 h after seeding, and at post-confluency 3 days after reaching confluency. Cells grown in T25 flasks coated with collagen type I were treated with or without 100 nm PYY(1-36) or NPY(1-36) (human sequences; American Peptide Co. Inc.) for 6 h in limiting medium (IMDM containing 0.1% bovine calf serum and 4 μg/ml transferrin) before total RNA was isolated for semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis. Preceding affinity precipitation of Cdc42, cells in collagen type I-coated T75 flasks were pre-starved for 15 h in limiting medium and starved in serum-free IMDM for 2 h before treatment with or without PYY or NPY at 100 nm. The peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); therefore, in the experiments involving peptide treatment, the same amount of PBS was added for the control. RT-PCR Analysis and PCR Cloning—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a 20-μl reaction under the conditions described previously (32Halldén G. Hadi M.

One μl of the RT mixture was used for semiquantitative PCR analysis in a 25-μl reaction using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) with the primers (Qiagen, Inc.) listed in Table I. The cycling parameters for PCR were denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 58 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The numbers of cycles listed in Table I were chosen for when the amplification was still at the exponential phase. Control RT-PCR was done to detect possible interference from genomic DNA contamination. The level of 18 S RNA expression in each sample was also analyzed for normalization of RNA content between samples. The specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and/or DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, University of California, Berkeley, CA).Fig. 10PYY and NPY increase the level of activated Cdc42 in hBRIE 380i cells.

The fragments were purified and quantitated on agarose gel using a 100-bp DNA mass ladder (New England Biolabs Inc.) as a standard. The purified fragments were serially diluted and PCR-amplified with the corresponding number of cycles as listed in Table I to determine the appropriate concentration range for a standard curve for a given RT-PCR result. The band intensity on agarose gel was scanned densitometrically and quantitated using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). PCR amplification to isolate rat CD63, Cdc42, PAK3 Cdc42-binding domain (PBD), and MMP-3 cDNAs was carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with the primers listed in Table I. DNA sequencing was performed to verify sequences of the amplified fragments and the orientation of the isolated cDNA for expression relative to the driving promoter of the vector. Plasmid DNA Construction for CD63 and Antisense CD63 Overexpression, MMP-3 Overexpression, and Dominant-negative and Constitutively Active Cdc42—The open reading frame of rat CD63 cDNA was PCR-amplified (38 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 59 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min) and cloned into the SmaI site of the pCI-neo mammalian expression vector (Promega) for CD63 overexpression. Antisense CD63 experiments utilized the plasmid construct described previously (32Halldén G. Hadi M. Hong H.T. Aponte G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27914-27924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which contained the full CD63 open reading frame inserted into the expression vector in the antisense orientation. The expressed fragment of rat MMP-3 cDNA was isolated by two-step PCR amplification. The first step was five cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 68 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 10 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 64 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. After 100-fold dilution, 1 μl of the PCR mixture was used as the template of the second amplification, comprising 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 58 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified MMP-3 cDNA was then cloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNA6/V5-HisA (Invitrogen). The dominant-negative and constitutively active Cdc42 mutants constructed had mutations T17N and G12V, respectively. The open reading frame of rat Cdc42 cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). The mutation was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Ten ng of pBluescript II SK(+) containing Cdc42 cDNA was PCR-amplified for 12 cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s; annealing at 55 °C for 1 min; and extension at 68 °C for 3 min, 40 s) using two primers overlapping at the nucleotides to be mutated. The primers used to synthesize dominant-negative Cdc42 were 5′-GTTGGTAAAAACTGTCTCCTGATATCCTACACAAC-3′ and 5′-ATCAGGAGACAGTTTTTACCAACAGCACCATCACC-3′ (with the nucleotides mutated shown in boldface, conferring mutation T17N). The primers for constitutively active Cdc42 were 5′-TTGGTGATGTTGCTGTTGGTAAAACATGTCTCCTG-3′ and 5′-ACCAACAGCAACATCACCAACAACAACACACTTAA-3′ (with the nucleotides mutated shown in boldface, conferring mutation G12V). The native (methylated) plasmid template was eliminated by DpnI digestion. After transformation into Escherichia coli and purification, the mutated Cdc42 cDNA was excised by HindIII and XbaI digestion and subcloned into the same restriction enzyme sites of pcDNA6/V5-HisA.

Within an open burst, it was possible to distinguish three distinct conductance states referred to as the full conductance, subconductance 1, and subconductance 2 states. Amino acid substitutions in transmembrane segment 6 altered the duration and probability of occurrence of these subconductance states but did not greatly alter their relative amplitudes. Results from real time measurements indicated that covalent modification of single R334C-CFTR channels by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate resulted in the simultaneous modification of all three conductance levels in what appeared to be a single step, without changing the proportion of time spent in each state. This behavior suggests that at least a portion of the conduction path is common to all three conducting states. The time course for the modification of R334C-CFTR, measured in outside-out macropatches using a rapid perfusion system, was also consistent with a single modification step as if each pore contained only a single copy of the cysteine at position 334.

Although it is well known that CFTR functions as a chloride channel, the composition of the minimal functional unit remains unclear; neither the number of CFTR polypeptides required nor the number of pores per functional channel is known.

Although the channel spends the majority of its time shuttling between the main (full) conductance level and the closed level, careful inspection of the fine structure of open-channel bursts led to the observation of one or two other levels of intermediate conductance (4Yue H.

These subconductance levels could represent permeation through completely separate pores (which, when summed, comprise the full conductance level) or permeation through a single pathway that may reside in multiple configurations differing in conductance. In this study, we made use of mutants containing cysteines engineered at putative pore-lining positions in TM6 to determine the minimal functional unit of the CFTR channel. These mutants were readily covalently modified by the sulfhydryl modifying reagent MTSET+ from the extracellular side (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J.

First, we used the inside-out single-channel recording configuration to study the amplitude and distribution of subconductance and full conductance states of channels before and after modification in single- and double-site mutants. Second, we used the outside-out macropatch configuration to study the kinetics of modification in real time. The results of this study are consistent with a model for the CFTR protein in which a single pore is formed from a single CFTR polypeptide. Preparation of Oocytes and cRNA—For mutant R334C, site-directed mutagenesis used a nested PCR strategy in which the mutation was designed into antiparallel oligomers (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). R334C was prepared from a construct carrying the full coding region of CFTR in the pBluescript vector. The rest of the mutants used in this study were prepared with the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA) using oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. All mutant constructs were verified by sequencing across the entire open reading frame before use. WT-CFTR cRNA was prepared from a construct carrying the full coding region of CFTR in the pAlter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For macropatch recordings, cRNAs were prepared from a construct encoding CFTR in the pGEMHE vector, which was kindly provided by Dr. D. Gadsby (Rockefeller University). Oocytes were injected in a range of 5–100 ng of CFTR cRNAs; for experiments using a two-electrode voltage clamp, CFTR cRNAs were injected along with 0.4 ng of cRNA for the β2-adrenergic receptor, allowing activation of CFTR by exposure to isoproterenol in the bathing solution. Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Liebovitz's L-15 medium with the addition of HEPES (pH 7.5), gentamicin, and penicillin/streptomycin. Recordings were made 24–72 h after the injection of cRNAs. Electrophysiology—For single-channel recording, CFTR channels were studied in excised, inside-out patches at room temperature (22–23 °C). Since preliminary experiments showed that the full single channel conductance of unmodified R334C-CFTR was very low (1.5 pS) compared with that of WT-CFTR (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Zhang Z-R. McCarty N.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 240Google Scholar), most single-channel experiments in this study used asymmetrical [Cl-] in order to increase the single channel amplitude at VM = -100 mV. Oocytes were prepared for study by shrinking in hypertonic solution (200 mm monopotassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) followed by manual removal of the vitelline membrane. Pipettes were pulled in four stages from borosilicate glass (Sutter Instrument Co.; Novato, CA) and had resistances averaging ∼10 megaohms when filled with low chloride pipette solution: 30 mm NMDG-Cl, 270 mm NMDG-aspartate, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES (pH 7.4). MTSET+ (100–200 μm) was back-filled into the pipettes before seal formation and allowed to diffuse to the tip during and after seal formation; solution lacking MTSET+ was used to fill the very tip of the pipette. Typical seal resistances were 200 gigaohms or greater. Channels were activated by excision into intracellular solution containing 300 mm NMDG-Cl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Tris-EGTA, 1 mm MgATP, 10 mm TES (pH 7.4), and 50 units/ml PKA. CFTR currents were measured with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments; Union City, CA) and were recorded at 10 kHz to DAT tape. For subsequent analysis, records were filtered at a corner frequency of 100 Hz and acquired using a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon) and computer at 2.5 ms/point with pClamp 8.0. For outside-out macropatch recordings, electrode tips were filled with a modified intracellular solution (150 mm NMDG-Cl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Tris-EGTA, 10 mm TES, pH 7.4) and then back-filled with the same solution containing 1 mm MgATP and 100 units/ml PKA. Through time, MgATP and PKA diffused to the intracellular face of the outside-out patch; CFTR channels were fully activated in ∼75 min. The normal extracellular solution (150 mm NMDG-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, pH 7.4) served as bath solution, to which we added MTSET+ to reach final concentrations of 5–50 μm. The pipette potential was held at 0 mV and then stepped to +80 mV during exposure to MTSET+. A fast perfusion system (model SF-77B; Warner Instruments; Hamden, CT) controlled by pClamp software was employed for this set of experiments; the time resolution of this system is ∼30 ms as judged by activation of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels (data not shown). Outside-out macropatch recordings were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier operated by pClamp 8.0 software; data were filtered at 100 Hz, acquired at 2 kHz with pClamp, and analyzed using Clampfit 9.0. For two-electrode voltage clamp experiments, electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl; individual oocytes were placed in the recording chamber and continuously perfused with ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5). For those experiments in which the bath pH was modified, HEPES was replaced by MES (for pH 6.0) or TAPS (for pH 9.0). The different extracellular buffers produced no discernible changes in the macroscopic conductance of WT-CFTR. Two-electrode voltage clamp data were generated using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon) and pClamp 8.0 at room temperature (21–24 °C). The volume of the perfusion chamber used in this study was about 100 μl, and the flow rate to the chamber was ∼10 ml/min. The membrane potential was held at -30 mV and then ramped from -80 to +60 mV in a period of 200 ms in order to construct whole cell I-V plots (see Fig. 6, A and B). Conductance was calculated from the slope of the I-V plot at the reversal potential (Erev) (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Fig. 6R334C-CFTR was not accessible to protons after modification by MTSET+. A and C, oocytes expressing R334C-CFTR and β2-adrenergic receptor were first activated by ND96 plus 5 μm isoproterenol at pH 7.5 for 6 min. Following activation, bath pH was then changed to either pH 6.0 or pH 9.0 and then to pH 7.5. On average, the macroscopic conductance of R334C-CFTR increased 22 ± 3% (p = 0.02, n = 3) in pH 6.0 and decreased 50 ± 5% (p = 0.01, n = 3) in pH 9.0. B and D, oocytes expressing R334C-CFTR and β2-adrenergic receptor were first activated by ND96 plus 5 μm isoproterenol at pH 7.5 for 6 min and then followed by the same solution containing 200 μm MTSET+ for 4 min; the macroscopic conductance was increased by ∼2.5-fold upon application of MTSET+. Modification by MTSET+ prevented the pH-induced response seen in R334C-CFTR macroscopic conductance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of Single Channel and Macropatch Experiments—The Fetchan and pSTAT programs of pClamp 8.0 were used to calculate open probability (Po) and to make all-points amplitude histograms for R334C-CFTR channels before and after modification. Referenced to a midpoint between the last unmodified and the first modified channel openings, paired records lasting ∼240 s were analyzed for both unmodified and modified channels in order to avoid errors due to the effects of dephosphorylation. Prior to analysis, the single channel traces were further filtered to 75 Hz in pClamp 8.0 or 9.0. Open and closed current levels were first identified manually, and then transition analysis using a 50% cut-off between open and closed levels was employed during formation of all-points amplitude histograms. The apparent number of channels in the patch was estimated by determining the maximum number of simultaneous open levels. Only records from patches that had low noise and apparently contained only one active channel were used for amplitude analysis. The all-points amplitude histograms were fit using a Gaussian/Simplex function. As described below, R334C channels exhibit multiple conductance levels, with s1 representing subconductance level 1, s2 being subconductance level 2, and f being full conductance level, as well as the closed level (c). The proportion of time spent in each conductance state was determined from the fit results (see Fig. 2G). For the purpose of this study, Po was defined according to Equation 1 as follows, Po=A(s1)+A(s2)+A(f)A(T)(Eq. 1) where each term is the fraction of the total (T) area contributed by each open level (s1, s2, and f) to the Gaussian curves fit to amplitude histograms generated before and after modification. All single channel records presented in this study, before and after modification by MTSET+, were paired experiments. It is noteworthy that because the single channel amplitude of R334C is very small, we transferred the all-points histogram data for R334C-CFTR channels to PeakFit version 4.11 (SYSTAT Software Inc., Chicago, IL) to verify the result of fits in pClamp 8.0. For outside-out macropatch data, we used pClamp 9.0 to fit the time course of covalent modification of CFTR currents using an exponential function to obtain the time constant, τ, which was converted to a rate coefficient with units of s-1m-1 by dividing by [MTSET+]. For those outside-out macropatch experiments where CFTR channels were exposed to MTSET+ twice (see Fig. 5), we determined the relationship between the magnitude of the fractional increase in current upon first exposure (fractional ΔI) and the rate coefficient for MTSET+ modification during the second exposure (k2). Fractional ΔI upon first exposure was calculated as A/(A + B), where A represents the macroscopic current increment resulting from the first MTSET+ modification, and B is the macroscopic current increment from the second MTSET+ modification. Source of Reagents—Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. MTSET+ was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. MTSET+ was first suspended in deionized water at a concentration of 100 mm, frozen in aliquots at -20 °C, and thawed and diluted into recording solution immediately before use. L-15 medium was from Invitrogen. PKA was from Promega. Statistics—Unless otherwise noted, values given are mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test for unpaired or paired measurements by Sigma Stat 2.03 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA), with p < 0.05 considered indicative of significance. Wild-type and Mutant CFTRs Exhibit Comparable Subconductance States with Differing Stability and Probability of Occurrence—CFTR channels have been reported to exhibit subconductance states (4Yue H.

In our recordings of WT-CFTR single-channel currents from detached inside-out patches, subconductance states, although clearly discernible, were rare events, occurring in only 18% of bursts. For the purposes of this study, we defined a subconductance state as a conductance level that was visited during open-channel bursts and that was sufficiently stable to be recognized in an all-points histogram (16Fox J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 97: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Laver D.R. Peter W.G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 99-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By careful, manual evaluation of the fine structure of open-channel bursts, multiple conductance levels of wild-type and mutant CFTRs were easily identified in patches containing 1–2 channels. Conductance levels thus identified were then confirmed using all-points amplitude histogram analysis; sojourns at these current levels are readily detectable by pClamp so that this operational definition permits an unambiguous separation of subconductance events from other small, non-CFTR single-channel events that contaminate some records. Fig. 1 contains an example of the subconductance behavior of WT-CFTR recorded in a detached patch bathed by asymmetrical [Cl-]. Three states that differ in conductance are discernible: 7.6 pS, referred to here as the full conductance state (f), and two subconductance states of 5.4 and 3.1 pS, referred to as s2 and s1, respectively. The dominant single-channel current in WT-CFTR is the full conductance state (i.e. transitions between c and f levels in Fig. 1A). The majority of WT-CFTR openings exhibit transitions from c directly to f and back again without sojourns in subconductance states. Fig. 1 also contains records illustrating the subconductance behavior of two mutant CFTRs: R334C and T338A. The former exhibits a full conductance that is less than that of WT-CFTR under comparable conditions (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the latter exhibits an increased full conductance (9.8 pS in T338A-CFTR). Despite these differences in full conductance, however, the relative amplitudes of the three conductance states for WT-CFTR and the two mutants are quite similar (i.e. s1 is ∼40% of f, and s2 is ∼70% of f). The s2 subconductance of WT-CFTR was previously reported by Gunderson and Kopito (10Gunderson K.L. Kopito R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) to reflect ∼84% of the full conductance level, measured under conditions different from ours; they did not identify other subconductance levels in their data, perhaps because their data were filtered even more heavily (10 Hz). This result suggests that neither the R334C nor T338A mutation, although they involve residues reputed to lie within the CFTR pore (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18McCarty N.A. Zhang Z-R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L852-L867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), greatly altered the relative magnitude of the subconductance states. The subconductance states seen in the mutant channels, however, differed markedly in their stability and probability of occurrence from that seen in WT-CFTR. In a longer record of single-channel currents from oocytes expressing R334C-CFTR (Fig. 2, A and B), the most prominent state is discernible as a conductance of ∼1.2 pS that was reported previously (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although upon closer examination of the fine structure of the open bursts, it is found that within nearly every burst there are transitions to three conductance states: one lower in conductance than that of the most frequent state and one higher in conductance. These results suggest that amino acid substitutions in TM6 alter the relative occurrence of subconductance states but not their relative amplitude in relation to the full conductance state, as if at least some portion of the conduction path for the three states (s1, s2, and f) is shared. Deposition of a Positive Charge at 334 Amplifies All Conductance States Proportionately—We reasoned that if the three conductance states reflect different behaviors of a shared portion of the conduction path, which includes the amino acid at position 334 in TM6, it would be possible to use the properties of the R334C mutant to investigate the architecture of the functional CFTR pore. We showed previously that covalent modification of R334C-CFTR channels with MTSET+ increased the amplitude of the most prominent single-channel conductance (referred to here as s2) without altering gating (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In our previous experiments, we assayed the impact of MTSET+-induced chemical modification in two ways, by comparing single-channel amplitudes in patches detached from different oocytes, either untreated or exposed to MTSET+ prior to recording, and by monitoring the modification of single channels in real time using recording pipettes back-filled with MTSET+ (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the present experiments, we monitored modification in real time to increase the likelihood that we would be able to observe the consequences of the reaction while in progress (19Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The record in Fig. 2A is representative of such experiments. Electrode tips for these inside-out recordings were back-filled with solution containing 200 μm MTSET+. R334C-CFTR chloride channels were modified in ∼15 min by MTSET+ diffusing down the electrode tip, as reflected by an increment of s1, s2, and f conductance levels ∼2.1–2.3-fold (Fig. 2, B–F). We analyzed eight paired, inside-out single channel records (both pre- and postmodified channels included in the same patch) that contained only one R334C-CFTR channel per patch, as shown in Fig. 2A. In every case, only a single modification event was ever observed. Furthermore, all of the subconductance states appeared to be modified simultaneously. We maintained the patches that contained modified R334C-CFTR channels for up to 45 min in some experiments and found that following modification by MTSET+, the amplitudes of the s1, s2, and f conductance states consistently stayed at the same level, with no further modification observed. The all-points histograms in Fig. 2, D and E, compiled by analyzing periods of 4 min immediately before and after the single modification event, confirm that the amplitudes of all three conductance states were increased by chemical modification. Furthermore, the mean values indicate that the amplitude of each conductance state increased in approximately the same proportion, between 2- and 2.3-fold (see Fig. 2F). Covalent modification by MTSET+ did not change the apparent reversal potential for either subconductance state or the full conductance state but only increased the slope conductance of each state (Fig. 3, A–C). Hence, the shared impact of covalent modification by MTSET+ on the amplitude of all conductance states exhibited by R334C-CFTR channels was also consistent with the hypothesis that the three conductance states have at least a portion of the conduction path in common. Covalent Modification of R334C-CFTR Did Not Alter Gating—We previously reported that modification of R334C-CFTR by MTSET+ did not alter gating as defined by comparing open probability in patches from treated and untreated oocytes as well as that of channels monitored during the process of modification (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Analysis of the subconductance behavior of R334C-CFTR provided an opportunity to reexamine the question of possible gating effects by asking whether modification of R334C-CFTR channels by MTSET+ altered the prevalence or duration of the three conductance states. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we calculated values for Po according to the distribution of the times spent in each conductance state derived from the amplitude histograms. The overall Po of R334C-CFTR channels before and after MTSET+ modification was 0.24 ± 0.04 and 0.23 ± 0.04, respectively (p = 0.91; see Fig. 3D). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2G, the fractional abundance of the s1, s2, and f conductance states did not change upon MTSET+-induced modification in R334C-CFTR channels. These results confirm and amplify our previous findings that covalent modification at the 334 locus alters the conduction properties of CFTR but is without effect on channel gating or the number of channels at the plasma membrane (14Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Liu X. Smith S.S. Sun F. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, modification of engineered cysteines in ClC-0 channels affected both conduction and gating (21Lin C-W. Chen T.-Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation in R334C-CFTR that the amplitudes of the s1, s2, and f states increased by an equivalent proportion, and apparently simultaneously, upon modification by MTSET+ suggests that each of these states reflects the activity of a single pore, or a portion of a shared conduction pathway rather than the activity of two separate pores. Miller and co-workers (22Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), in contrast, showed that modification of cysteines substituted in ClC-0 channels occurred in two steps, as predicted for a dimeric, two-pore structure containing multiple targets for cysteine modification.

For example, a recent study indicated that neomycin would allow insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and glucose transport in the presence of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, a known inhibitor of Akt activation (James, D. J., Salaün, C., Brandie, F. M., Connell, J. M. C., and Chamberlain, L. H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 20567–20570). To better understand this observation, we examined a number of downstream targets of Akt. As previously reported, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with neomycin prevented the wortmannin inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. However, in the presence of neomycin, wortmannin did not inhibit the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of several downstream targets of Akt including a proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa, ribosomal protein S6, and glycogen synthase kinase-3. In addition, neomycin did not prevent the ability of a structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, to inhibit the insulin-stimulated activation of glucose uptake. Moreover, neomycin reversed the inhibitory effect of wortmannin but not LY294002 on insulin stimulation of Akt kinase activity. Finally, neomycin was found to inactivate in vitro the PI 3-kinase inhibitory actions of wortmannin but not LY294002. These results indicate that the effects of neomycin in adipocytes are not mediated via its ability to sequester phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate but are instead caused by the ability of neomycin to inactivate wortmannin.

The first step in insulin action is ligand stimulation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase leading to the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of various endogenous substrates including insulin receptor substrates IRS-1 and IRS-2 (1Pirola L.

This binding results in the membrane localization and activation of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, leading to the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate.

However, other data indicate that Akt activation is not required for insulin stimulation of glucose transport and instead indicate that distinct signal cascades stimulated by insulin may be responsible for eliciting this response (10Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 11Baumann C.A.

Most recently a study indicated that neomycin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes would allow insulin-stimulated glucose transport in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase and Akt activation (12James D.J. Salaun C. Brandie F.M. Connell J.M. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20567-20570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because neomycin binds and sequesters PI 4,5-P2 (13Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), it was proposed that insulin-stimulated glucose transport may occur in part via the “masking” of PI 4,5-P2 (12James D.J. Salaun C. Brandie F.M. Connell J.M. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20567-20570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism whereby neomycin reverses wortmannin inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, we first investigated downstream targets of Akt in insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In the presence of wortmannin, neomycin allowed the insulin-stimulated uptake of glucose as reported previously (12James D.J. Salaun C. Brandie F.M. Connell J.M. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20567-20570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, it also allowed the insulin-stimulated increase in phosphorylation of several downstream targets of Akt including the direct substrate PRAS40 (14Kovacina K.S. Park G.Y. Bae S.S.

Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), as well as allowing insulin-stimulated activation of Akt itself. In addition, neomycin was found incapable of preventing the inhibition of a structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (17Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, neomycin was found to inactivate in vitro the inhibitory actions of wortmannin. These results indicate that the effects of neomycin in adipocytes are not mediated via its ability to sequester PI 4,5-P2, but is instead caused by the ability of neomycin to inactivate wortmannin.

Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and treated with 1 μg/ml human insulin, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 0.25 μm dexamethasone to induce differentiation. Adipocytes were used between 10–12 days post-differentiation. CHO cells stably overexpressing human insulin receptor (CHO-T cells) (19Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% calf serum. All cells were serum-deprived for 12–18 h before experimentation. Glucose Uptake—Serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes in either 24- or 12-well plates were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 mm neomycin in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 105 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 10 mm NaHCO3) for 2 h. Either wortmannin, LY294002, or Me2SO was then added as indicated. After 10 min, 100 nm insulin was added and then after an additional 20 min, 0.2 mm 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (1 μCi/ml) was added. After a further 10 min of incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 0.5% SDS, and the amount of labeled glucose taken up was determined by scintillation counting. Immunoblotting—Serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 mm neomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. Either wortmannin, LY294002, or Me2SO was then added as indicated. After 20 min, 100 nm insulin was added and then after an additional 10 min cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, membranes were incubated with specific antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified using a Kodak Work Station and Kodak 1D v.3.5.3 software. Akt Kinase Activity Assay—3T3-L1 adipocytes and CHO-T cells were treated as described above for immunoblotting. After centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with anti-Akt antibodies prebound to protein A-agarose. Akt kinase activity was assessed essentially as described previously (5Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Following the kinase reaction, the phosphorylated peptide was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP on 40% polyacrylamide gels containing 6 m urea. The phosphopeptide bands were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant v1.2 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In Vitro Treatment of Wortmannin and LY294002 with Neomycin— Twenty μl of wortmannin or LY294002 (in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer) were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mm neomycin for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were then diluted 1:5 and added to immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase and assayed for enzymatic activity essentially as described previously (20Endemann G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactive spots on the TLC plates were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant v1.2 software. Neomycin Restores the Insulin Stimulation of Glucose Uptake and Downstream Targets of Akt in Wortmannin-treated 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—As reported previously (12James D.J. Salaun C. Brandie F.M. Connell J.M. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20567-20570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), inclusion of 10 mm neomycin in the media of 3T3-L1 adipocytes partially restored (by ∼60%) the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in cells treated with 100 nm wortmannin (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the ability of 1 μm wortmannin to inhibit insulin stimulation of glucose uptake was not reversed by the presence of neomycin in the media (Fig. 1A). To determine under the same conditions whether the ability of insulin to stimulate Akt was effected, PRAS40 phosphorylation was first examined because this protein is likely to be directly phosphorylated by activated Akt (14Kovacina K.S. Park G.Y. Bae S.S. Guzzetta A.W. Schaefer E. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10189-10194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As expected, the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PRAS40 was almost completely inhibited by prior treatment of the cells with 100 nm wortmannin (Fig. 2, A and B). However in the presence of 10 mm neomycin insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PRAS40 was almost unaffected by this concentration of wortmannin (Fig. 2, A and B). After activation of Akt, mTOR and S6 kinase are stimulated, resulting in increased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (5Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Thus, as expected, the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is almost completely inhibited by 100 nm wortmannin. However, in the presence of 10 mm neomycin, the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on insulin-stimulated S6 phosphorylation was to a large extent reversed (Fig. 2, C and D). Finally, we looked at another downstream target of Akt, GSK3β (16Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Again, the inhibition of the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3β observed with 100 nm wortmannin was partially reversed by prior treatment of the cells with 10 mm neomycin (Fig. 3, A and B). These studies suggested that in the presence of neomycin and wortmannin, Akt may still be activated. To directly test this, we measured both the phosphorylation of Akt (because its phosphorylation is the primary mechanism for regulating its activity) as well as its enzymatic activity after immunoprecipitation. As expected, 100 nm wortmannin completely inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 as well as the insulin-stimulated increase in its enzymatic activity (Fig. 3, C and D). However, inclusion of 10 mm neomycin in the media of the cells partially restored (by ∼60%) the ability of insulin to stimulate Akt kinase activity in cells treated with 100 nm wortmannin. Neomycin Restores the Insulin Stimulation of Akt in CHO-T Cells Treated with Wortmannin but Not Those Treated with LY294002 Nor Does It Restore Insulin Signaling in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Treated with LY294002—To investigate whether the ability of neomycin to restore insulin signaling after wortmannin treatment was limited to 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we examined insulin activation of Akt in CHO cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (CHO-T cells) (19Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). As previously reported, 100 nm wortmannin almost completely inhibits insulin activation of Akt in these cells (2Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Inclusion of neomycin in the media of these cells results in a recovery of 55% of this response to insulin (Fig. 4A), a value similar to that observed in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3D). To determine whether the ability of neomycin to restore the insulin response was unique to wortmannin, we examined whether this drug could also restore the response in CHO-T cells treated with a structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (17Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with wortmannin, the LY294002 inhibition of insulin stimulation of Akt activity in CHO-T cells was not reversed by inclusion of neomycin in the media of these cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the ability of either 10 or 30 μm LY294002 to inhibit the insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was not reversed by inclusion of 10 mm neomycin in the media of these cells (Fig. 1B). Neomycin Inactivates Wortmannin but Not LY294002 in Vitro—Because neomycin blocked the ability of wortmannin but not LY294002 to inhibit insulin-stimulated signaling in cells, we examined whether in a cell-free system neomycin would effect the PI 3-kinase inhibitory activities of wortmannin and LY294002. A 20-min incubation at 37 °C of 1 mm neomycin with either 60 or 200 nm wortmannin (conditions designed to mimic those in the whole cell experiments) resulted in an 80% decrease in the PI 3-kinase inhibitory activity of the wortmannin (Fig. 5). At 600 nm wortmannin, neomycin treatment caused a 60% decrease in its ability to inhibit PI 3-kinase activity. In contrast, incubation of neomycin with several concentrations of LY294002 did not result in any decrease in its PI 3-kinase inhibitory activity (Fig. 5). Interestingly, addition of neomycin alone to the PI 3-kinase reaction mixture had a biphasic effect, stimulating PI 3-kinase activity by 200% at low concentrations (50 μm) and inhibiting the reaction at higher concentrations (1 mm) (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Although aminoglycosides like neomycin and gentamycin are bactericidal because of their interaction with the prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA of the small ribosomal subunit (21Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Puglisi J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6437-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), they have been known for more than 25 years to also bind with high affinity to PI 4,5-P2 (22Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that some of the side effects (including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity) of these still commonly prescribed antibiotics may be caused by their interactions with these lipids (23Schacht J. Arch. Otorhinolaryngol. 1979; 224: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For example, neomycin may bind to PI 4,5-P2 and inhibit inositol phosphate turnover in response to various agonists, thereby decreasing cell survival (24Guiramand J. Lenoir M. Pujol R. Recasens M. Toxicol. Lett. 1990; 51: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The ability of neomycin to bind PI 4,5-P2 has also been extensively utilized by many investigators to probe the role of this lipid in various cellular responses (13Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In one such recent study, neomycin was found to reverse the ability of wortmannin to inhibit insulin stimulation of glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (12James D.J. Salaun C. Brandie F.M. Connell J.M. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20567-20570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this report, neomycin was not found to effect the wortmannin inhibition of insulin stimulation of Akt activity. However, insulin stimulation of Akt activity was observed in this study in the presence of 100 nm wortmannin (see Fig. 2 of this prior study). The interpretation of these studies was that neomycin was masking the PI 4,5-P2 and that this contributed to the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose transport activity. In the present work, we found that as previously reported the inclusion of 10 mm neomycin in the media was able to restore the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with 100 nm wortmannin. However, neomycin could not restore this response to insulin when the cells were treated with 1 μm wortmannin. Moreover, we found that neomycin also restored the ability of insulin to stimulate the downstream phosphorylation of three targets of Akt including PRAS40 and ribosomal protein S6 as well as GSK3β. In contrast to the prior study, we also observed that neomycin restored the ability of insulin to stimulate the activity and phosphorylation of Akt in both wortmannin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as in another cell type, CHO cells overexpressing the insulin receptor. Although we cannot explain the lack of insulin-stimulation of Akt kinase activity in this prior study when the 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 100 nm wortmannin in the presence of neomycin, it can be observed in Fig. 2 of Ref. 12James D.J. Salaun C. Brandie F.M. Connell J.M. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20567-20570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar that the kinase activity of Akt was elevated after insulin-treatment in the presence of 100 nm wortmannin. This observation is inconsistent with the large body of evidence that 100 nm wortmannin completely inhibits the insulin-induced activation of Akt (2Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). If the recovery of insulin-stimulated glucose transport with neomycin treatment was the result of the masking of PI 4,5-P2, it should also be observed with a structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor. Therefore we tested whether neomycin could also restore insulin responsiveness to cells treated with a structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (17Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with wortmannin, we found that neomycin had no effect on the ability of LY294002 to inhibit the insulin stimulated increase in glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Akt activation in CHO-T cells. These results suggested that the neomycin might be blocking the inhibitory actions of wortmannin. To directly test this hypothesis, we incubated neomycin together with different concentrations of wortmannin under conditions designed to mimic what would occur when wortmannin was added to cells containing neomycin in the media. The wortmannin was then tested for its ability to inhibit PI 3-kinase activity in an in vitro assay. Neomycin at 1 mm was found to inactivate 80% of the PI 3-kinase inhibitory activity of 60 or 200 nm wortmannin after a 20-min incubation at 37 °C. In contrast, a comparable incubation of LY294002 with neomycin had no effect on the inhibitory activity of this compound. These results indicate that it is likely that the effects of neomycin in adipocytes are not mediated via its ability to sequester PI 4,5-P2 but are instead caused by the ability of neomycin to inactivate wortmannin. Intriguingly, we observed that at low concentrations (50 μm) neomycin actually stimulated the enzymatic activity of PI 3-kinase by about 200% (Fig. 5), although at higher concentrations (1 mm) neomycin was found to inhibit this reaction. 2A. Shimaya, K. S. Kovacina, and R. A. Roth, unpublished observations. Increased stimulation of Akt phosphorylation was also observed in some studies when neomycin was added together with insulin to cells. 2A. Shimaya, K. S. Kovacina, and R. A. Roth, unpublished observations. Finally, inhibition of PTEN hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was also observed in vitro by neomycin. 2A. Shimaya, K. S. Kovacina, and R. A. Roth, unpublished observations. This latter finding is consistent with studies of others 3J. Schacht, personal communication. indicating that neomycin can also bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Thus, these results indicate that neomycin can actually stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate pathway in cells and suggest a potential new mechanism for the side effects of aminoglycosides and indicate the need for caution in interpreting the results of studies utilizing neomycin to probe the role of the PI 4,5-P2 in various cellular responses. We thank Dr. Jochen Schacht (University of Michigan) for communication of his results prior to publication, Dr. Jack Dixon (University of California, San Diego) for providing us with PTEN expression constructs, and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical for funding part of this research."
https://openalex.org/W2094759154,"It is known that the actin-binding protein caldesmon inhibits actomyosin ATPase activity and might in this way take part in the thin filament regulation of smooth muscle contraction. Although the molecular mechanism of this inhibition is unknown, it is clear that the presence of actin-bound tropomyosin is necessary for full inhibition. Recent evidence also suggests that the myosin-induced movement of tropomyosin plays a key role in regulation. In this work, fluorescence studies provide evidence to show that caldesmon interacts with and alters the position of tropomyosin in a reconstituted actin thin filament and thereby limits the ability of myosin heads to move tropomyosin. Caldesmon interacts with the Cys-190 region in the COOH-terminal half of tropomyosin, resulting in the movement of this part of tropomyosin to a new position on actin. Additionally, this constrains the myosin-induced movement of this region of tropomyosin. On the other hand, caldesmon does not appear to interact with the Cys-36 region in the NH2-terminal half of tropomyosin and neither alters the position of nor significantly constrains the myosin-induced movement of this part of tropomyosin. The ability of caldesmon to limit the myosin-induced movement of tropomyosin provides a possible molecular basis for the inhibitory function of caldesmon. The different movements of the two halves of tropomyosin indicate that actin-bound tropomyosin moves as a flexible molecule and not as a rigid rod. Interestingly, caldesmon, which inhibits tropomyosin's potentiation of actomyosin ATPase activity, moves tropomyosin in one direction, whereas myosin heads, which enhance potentiation, move tropomyosin in the opposite direction.

Interestingly, caldesmon, which inhibits tropomyosin's potentiation of actomyosin ATPase activity, moves tropomyosin in one direction, whereas myosin heads, which enhance potentiation, move tropomyosin in the opposite direction. Muscle contraction takes place when myosin heads, projecting from the thick filament, cyclically interact with actin protomers in the thin filament, causing the filaments to slide past each other with a resulting muscle shortening. Actin-activated myosin hydrolysis of ATP provides the energy for this process. Tropomyosin, a long coiled-coil dimer, which binds end-to-end on each side of the thin filament, is involved in switching the muscle on. In skeletal muscle, contraction is switched on by Ca2+ binding to actin-bound troponin, which results in the relocation of tropomyosin and thus the exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin (2Kress M.

The fact that each tropomyosin molecule covers seven actin protomers and binds end-to-end to itself endows the switching process with cooperativity (for a review, see Refs. 6Leavis P.C. Gergely J.

Smooth muscle does not contain troponin, and the main regulatory switch is the phosphorylation of myosin light chains (for a review, see Refs. 10Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

However, myosin phosphorylation does not account for all aspects of smooth muscle regulation, i.e. there can be a decoupling between force and myosin phosphorylation levels, and thus it has been put forth that the actin thin filament and its associated proteins also play a role in regulation (for a review, see Refs. 12Chalovich J.M.

Huber P.A.J. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar), both of which are in vitro analogues of contraction. Although there are physiological measurements that suggest that caldesmon may assume such a regulatory role in vivo (15Katsuyama H. Wang C-L.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14555-14558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Earley J.J. Su X. Moreland R.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in general, it is still a highly controversial question. However, in the specific case of myometrial smooth muscle, the caldesmon content increases 3–5-fold during pregnancy (17Word R.A. Stull J.T. Casey M.L. Kamm K.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Li Y. Je H.-D. Malek S. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: R192-R199Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), when the uterus must remain quiescent. During labor, caldesmon becomes phosphorylated (18Li Y. Je H.-D. Malek S. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: R192-R199Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a process that is known to reverse the inhibitory function of caldesmon (19Huang R. Li L. Guo H. Wang C-L.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that caldesmon may play a direct regulatory role in this muscle. Tropomyosin must be present for caldesmon to fully inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity (20Dabrowska R. Goch A. Galazkiewicz B. Osinska H. Biochim. Biophys.

This enhanced ATPase activity is inhibited as a function of caldesmon concentration more steeply than is the activity in the absence of tropomyosin. The molecular mechanism whereby tropomyosin and caldesmon act in concert is unknown. The reported binding between tropomyosin and caldesmon (34Graceffa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 218: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Fujii T. Ozawa J. Ogoma Y. Kondo Y. J.

The understanding of this mechanism is the object of the present work. Early studies of x-ray diffraction on “living” smooth muscles indicated that activation of contraction results in the movement of tropomyosin (37Vibert P.J. Haselgrove J.C. Lowy J. Poulsen F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Tm, tropomyosin; CaD, caldesmon; S1, single-headed chymotryptic subfragment 1 of skeletal muscle myosin; DAB-maleimide, N(4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)-phenyl)maleimide; DDP-maleimide, N-(4-(dimethylamino)-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide; IAEDANS, 5-((((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)-amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; AED, IAEDANS attached to a protein; acrylodan, 6-acryloyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene; CPM, 7-(diethylamino)-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methlycoumarin; FM, fluorescein-maleimide; DAB-A, actin labeled at Cys-374 with DAB-maleimide; DDP-A, actin labeled at Cys-374 with DDP-maleimide; AED190αβTm, Tm αβ-heterodimer labeled with AED at Cys-190 of the α-chain; AED36αβTm, Tm αβ-heterodimer labeled with AED at Cys-36 of the β-chain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Tm, tropomyosin; CaD, caldesmon; S1, single-headed chymotryptic subfragment 1 of skeletal muscle myosin; DAB-maleimide, N(4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)-phenyl)maleimide; DDP-maleimide, N-(4-(dimethylamino)-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide; IAEDANS, 5-((((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)-amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; AED, IAEDANS attached to a protein; acrylodan, 6-acryloyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene; CPM, 7-(diethylamino)-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methlycoumarin; FM, fluorescein-maleimide; DAB-A, actin labeled at Cys-374 with DAB-maleimide; DDP-A, actin labeled at Cys-374 with DDP-maleimide; AED190αβTm, Tm αβ-heterodimer labeled with AED at Cys-190 of the α-chain; AED36αβTm, Tm αβ-heterodimer labeled with AED at Cys-36 of the β-chain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. between donors on tropomyosin and an acceptor on actin, for in vitro reconstituted thin filaments, the binding of myosin heads to actin resulted in the movement of smooth muscle tropomyosin to a new position on actin (38Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17143-17148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40Bacchiocchi C. Graceffa P. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2295-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This movement was more efficient for phosphorylated smooth muscle heads than for unphosphorylated ones (39Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17143-17148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tropomyosin's enhancement of ATPase activity increases from a very low value (under some conditions, inhibition (41Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2070-2072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) up to a plateau level as the number of myosin heads binding to actin increases (41Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2070-2072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43Chacko S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2105-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the postulation that smooth muscle regulation includes the myosin-induced movement of tropomyosin to a position on actin where it can enhance the actomyosin ATPase activity (39Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17143-17148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the myosin must be phosphorylated to promote such a change more easily (39Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17143-17148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this way, myosin phosphorylation and tropomyosin movement would act together to switch on smooth muscle contraction. Similarly, the movement of skeletal muscle tropomyosin by the binding of myosin heads to actin is thought to contribute to the switching on of skeletal muscle contraction (4Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 5Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the cooperativity between myosin phosphorylation levels and force development in smooth muscle tissue is mediated by tropomyosin (44Rembold C.M. Wardle R.L. Wingard C.J. Batts T.W. Etter E.R. Murphy R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C594-C602Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), possibly involving myosin-induced tropomyosin movement (45Dillon P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C590-C591Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). From modeling of this cooperativity, it was concluded that the binding of each myosin head activated seven actin protomers (44Rembold C.M. Wardle R.L. Wingard C.J. Batts T.W. Etter E.R. Murphy R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C594-C602Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The movement of tropomyosin by a double-headed thio-phosphorylated myosin fragment also takes place with a cooperativity of seven actin protomers (39Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17143-17148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consequently, a strong relationship between the myosin-induced tropomyosin movement and myosin phosphorylation-dependent force is reasonable. The general question arises: can proteins or factors, other than myosin, control the position of tropomyosin on actin and thereby affect the regulation of smooth muscle contraction? More specifically, we ask in this study whether the ability of caldesmon to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity could be due to its blocking of the movement of tropomyosin by myosin heads. To address this question, we used FRET to measure the effect of caldesmon on both the position of smooth muscle tropomyosin bound to actin and the movement of tropomyosin by myosin heads. Previous electron microscopy studies have demonstrated that the presence of caldesmon (CaD) changes the position of tropomyosin (Tm) on actin, but these studies showed movement averaged over the entire tropomyosin molecule (46Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 47Hodgkinson J.L. Marston S.B. Craig R. Vibert P. Lehman W. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2398-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since we are specifically placing FRET donors in either half of tropomyosin, we can monitor possible inhomogeneous movements along the molecule. Furthermore, the microscopy studies were conducted on fixed and stained samples, whereas the present work is done in solution, which more closely approximates the dynamic situation that exists in live muscle. All materials, methods, and procedures have been described in detail in our previous works referred to below. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (48Graceffa P. Jancso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20305-20310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CaD (48Graceffa P. Jancso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20305-20310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Tm (49Jancso A. Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5891-5897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared from chicken gizzard smooth muscle. Myosin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle and its single-head subfragment 1 (S1) by chymotryptic digestion (38Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Actin was labeled at Cys-374 with the FRET acceptors DAB-maleimide (39Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17143-17148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or DDP-maleimide (50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which are not fluorescent. The Tm αβ-heterodimer was specifically labeled at either Cys-36 of the β-chain or Cys-190 of the α-chain with the fluorescence probes IAEDANS, acrylodan, or pyrene-maleimide (38Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Tm αα- and ββ-homodimers were similarly labeled at Cys-190 or Cys-36, respectively, with the fluorescence acceptor fluorescein-maleimide (FM), except that FM was added at a ratio of FM/Tm = 6, with a resulting labeling ratio of FM/Tm of about 1.5. CaD was specifically labeled at either Cys-153 or Cys-595 2Our previous publications referred to CaD Cys-595 as Cys-580. However, it has since been confirmed that there are an additional 15 residues in the central region of CaD (1Guo H. Bryan J. Wang C-L.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 725-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). with the fluorescence donors 7-(diethylamino)-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methlycoumarin (CPM) or IAEDANS (50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 51Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30187-30193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All labels, except for DDP-maleimide, which was obtained from Aldrich, were purchased from Molecular Probes. Fluorescence emission or polarization spectra were recorded with either a Spex Fluorolog 2/2/2 or a Varian Eclipse fluorometer (50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 51Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30187-30193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FRET was measured from the change in steady-state fluorescence of the donor corrected for trivial absorption, acceptor fluorescence, incomplete labeling of the acceptor protein (only necessary for FM-Tm), and the effect of unlabeled acceptor protein on donor fluorescence (38Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For the most part, these corrections were small. Distance change was calculated from FRET change (50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) using Ro, the critical transfer distance, of AED-Tm/DAB-actin = 40 Å (38Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), Ro of AED-CaD/DDP-A = 27 Å (50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and Ro of CPM-CaD/FM-Tm = 50 Å (50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The determined distances are apparent, or weighted average, values since it is assumed that each donor transfers energy to a single acceptor. However, in this work, the comparative and relative change in distance, and not the absolute values, are important. The determination of Ro involves the donor probe-acceptor probe orientation factor κ2, which can be assumed to have a value of 2/3 if there is sufficient motion or randomness in the orientation of one or both probes (Ref. 50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar and references therein). There have been arguments attesting to the validity of using a value of 2/3 for the AED-Tm/DAB-A system (52Tao T. Lamkin M. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and to the fact that the value of κ2 does not change upon binding of myosin heads to the actin (38Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17143-17148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the energy transfer from each donor on tropomyosin appears to be to multiple actin acceptors (40Bacchiocchi C. Graceffa P. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2295-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 53Bacchiocchi C. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1524-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which will add to the randomness of the system and give further support to the use of κ2 = 2/3 (54Censullo R. Martin J.C. Cheung H.C. J. Fluorescence. 1992; 2: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For the CPM-CaD/FM-Tm complex bound to actin, κ2 = 2/3 also appears to be a reasonable assumption based on the rather high mobility of the FM probe. The steady-state polarization of FM attached to Tm, for FM-Tm both free and bound to CaD-actin, is very low at about 0.06, as compared with the rigid limit of 0.43 for this probe (55Chen R.F. Bowman R.L. Science. 1965; 147: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus although FM-Tm is immobilized on actin filaments (+CaD), the probe has the same low polarization, and thus mobility, as for free FM-Tm, indicating that the probe has significant motion independent of the protein to which it is attached. Similar conclusions for κ2 = 2/3 for the AED-CaD/DDP-A system have also been made (50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements in the presence of actin were conducted at 0.3–0.6 μm Tm with actin/Tm = 8/1 – 7/1 and actin/CaD = 15/1 – 5/1 in a solution containing 40 mm NaCl, 2–5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, at 20 °C. FRET between CPM-CaD and FM-Tm in the absence of actin was conducted at the same solution conditions but with an 8.3-fold molar excess of FM-Tm over CPM-CaD, which was present at about 0.15 μm. Excess FM-Tm maximized the binding of CPM-CaD. The AED and pyrene labels were excited at 340 nm, the acrylodan label was excited at 385 nm, and the CPM label was excited at 396 nm. The binding of proteins to actin was determined by densitometry of SDS-PAGE, following actin filament sedimentation (38Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Caldesmon-Tropomyosin Interaction on Actin Filament—To investigate the interaction of Tm and CaD bound to actin, we measured both the effect of CaD on the fluorescence of probes attached to Tm and the FRET between donor and acceptor probes attached to CaD and Tm, respectively. Native smooth muscle Tm is an αβ-heterodimer with the α-chain containing a single cysteine at position 190 in the COOH-terminal half of the molecule and the β-chain with a single cysteine at position 36, near the NH2 terminus. Both chains contain 284 residues. The heterodimer or homodimers were specifically labeled at either of these cysteines with IAEDANS (AED), acrylodan, pyrene-maleimide, or FM. CaD is a long (about twice the length of Tm (56Graceffa P. Wang C-L.A. Stafford W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14196-14202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), thin molecule, which binds to actin with an actin/CaD stoichiometry of roughly 14/1 on sections of native actin filaments (57Lehman W. Craig R. Lui J. Moody C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 58Mabuchi K. Li Y. Carlos A. Wang C-L.A. Graceffa P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Either of the cysteines of CaD, Cys-153 in its NH2-terminal region or Cys-595 in its COOH-terminal domain with a total of 771 amino acids in the molecule, was specifically labeled with CPM. Fig. 1 shows the effect of CaD on the fluorescence of AED attached to either Cys-190 (AED190αβTm) or Cys-36 (AED36αβTm) of the Tm heterodimer bound to actin. CaD had very little, if any, effect on AED36αβTm fluorescence (Fig. 1B), whereas the fluorescence of AED190αβTm was significantly enhanced and blue-shifted (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that CaD binds close to, and possibly interacts with, the Cys-190 region in the COOH-terminal half of Tm in this ternary protein complex. The enhancement and blue-shifting of the probe fluorescence could be due to CaD shielding the probe from accessibility to the solvent. Such an effect is similar to that which occurs upon the binding of troponin to AED attached to Cys-190 of skeletal tropomyosin bound to actin (38Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 52Tao T. Lamkin M. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Troponin is known to bind close to Cys-190 of tropomyosin (6Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 235-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of two other probes, acrylodan and pyrene-maleimide, was also sensitive to CaD when the probes were attached to Cys-190 but not when the probes were attached to Cys-36 of the Tm heterodimer (not shown). Fluorescence polarization, an indicator of probe mobility, was similarly sensitive to CaD for a probe attached to Cys-190 but not for the probe attached to Cys-36. For example, the polarization of pyrene-maleimide attached to Cys-190 of actin-bound tropomyosin changed from a value of 0.30 to a value 0.34 upon binding of CaD (actin/CaD = 5), whereas the probe at Cys-36 showed no discernable change from a value of 0.21 with the addition of CaD. The proximity between CaD and the Cys-190 region of Tm was also observed from FRET between the two proteins bound to actin (Fig. 2). The addition of FM-labeled Cys-190 of the Tm αα-homodimer (FMααTm) to actin-bound CPM-labeled Cys-595 of CaD resulted in a large decrease in the CPM fluorescence due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the CPM donor to the FM acceptor on Tm (Fig. 2A). The distance between the two probes was calculated to be roughly 51 Å. On the other hand, there was negligible energy transfer from CPM attached to Cys-153 of CaD to FM on Cys-190 of Tm, as evidenced by essentially no change in the CPM donor fluorescence (Fig. 2B). With the FM acceptor on Cys-36 of the ββ-homodimer of Tm, there was negligible energy transfer to CPM on either Cys-595 (Fig. 3A) or Cys-153 (Fig. 3B) of CaD. We can conclude from these experiments that the Cys-595 region of the COOH-terminal domain of CaD is close to the Cys-190 region of the COOH-terminal half of Tm when both are bound to actin. The fact that CPM on Cys-153 of CaD is not close to FM attached to either Cys-36 or Cys-190 of Tm is consistent with previous work which has shown that, whereas the COOH-terminal domain of CaD is bound to actin/Tm, the NH2-terminal region is dissociated (50Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 51Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30187-30193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As regards the proximity of the NH2-terminal half of Tm to some part of CaD, we can only conclude that there is a lack of evidence in the experiments that we have performed.Fig. 1Fluorescence of AED-labeled Tm ± CaD. Fluorescence spectrum of the AED probe attached to Tm αβ-heterodimer at Cys-190 (A) of the α-chain or Cys-36 (B) of the β-chain, in the presence or absence of CaD, all in the presence of actin, are shown. AED excitation is at 340 nm. Actin/Tm and actin/CaD molar ratios are 8/1 and 5/1, respectively. Solution conditions are: 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, 20 °C.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2078896362,"Replacement of L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit residue Thr-1066 in segment IIIS5 by a tyrosine residue conserved in the corresponding positions of non-L-type Ca2+ channels eliminates high dihydropyridine sensitivity through a steric mechanism. To determine the effects of this mutation on phenylalkylamine interaction, we exploited the availability of Cav1.2DHP–/– mice containing the T1066Y mutation. In contrast to dihydropyridines, increased protein-dependent binding of the phenylalkylamine (–)-[3H]devapamil occurred to Cav1.2DHP–/– mouse brain microsomes. This effect could be attributed to an at least 2-fold increase in affinity as determined by saturation analysis and binding inhibition experiments. The latter also revealed a higher affinity for (–)-verapamil but not for (–)-gallopamil. The mutation caused a pronounced slowing of (–)-[3H]devapamil dissociation, indicating a stabilization of the drug-channel complex. The increased affinity of mutant channels was also evident in functional studies after heterologous expression of wild type and T1066Y channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. 100 μm (–)-verapamil inhibited a significantly larger fraction of Ba2+ inward current through mutant than through WT channels. Our results provide evidence that phenylalkylamines also interact with the IIIS5 helix and that the geometry of the IIIS5 helix affects the access and/or binding of different chemical classes of Ca2+ channel blockers to their overlapping binding domains. Mutation of Thr-1066 to a non-L-type tyrosine residue can be exploited to differentially affect phenylalkylamine and dihydropyridine binding to L-type Ca2+ channels. Replacement of L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit residue Thr-1066 in segment IIIS5 by a tyrosine residue conserved in the corresponding positions of non-L-type Ca2+ channels eliminates high dihydropyridine sensitivity through a steric mechanism. To determine the effects of this mutation on phenylalkylamine interaction, we exploited the availability of Cav1.2DHP–/– mice containing the T1066Y mutation.

Mutation of Thr-1066 to a non-L-type tyrosine residue can be exploited to differentially affect phenylalkylamine and dihydropyridine binding to L-type Ca2+ channels. Voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) 1The abbreviations used are: LTCC, L-type Ca2+ channels; CCBs, Ca2+ channel blockers; DHP, dihydropyridine; PAA, phenylalkylamine; BTZ, benzothiazepine; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: LTCC, L-type Ca2+ channels; CCBs, Ca2+ channel blockers; DHP, dihydropyridine; PAA, phenylalkylamine; BTZ, benzothiazepine; WT, wild type. are characterized by their high sensitivity toward Ca2+ channel blockers (CCBs; Ca2+ antagonists). High CCB sensitivity is encoded in their pore-forming α1-subunits (Cav1.1–Cav1.4 α1), which contain a number of unique amino acid residues critical for the formation of a binding pocket for different chemical classes of CCBs. Clinically relevant are 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs; e.g. isradipine and nifedipine), phenylalkylamines (PAAs; e.g. verapamil and gallopamil) and benzothiazepines (BTZs; e.g. (+)-cis-diltiazem). These chemical classes affect each other's binding to the α1-subunit through noncompetitive interactions (1Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 108-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A detailed molecular analysis of the distinct drug binding domains was performed, which revealed that DHP, PAA, and BTZ binding residues are located within the same regions on α1 subunits and that some residues even participate in the binding of more than one class of CCBs (1Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 108-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 2Hockerman G.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2629-2633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This suggested that all three binding domains are located in close proximity to each other and even overlap (Fig. 1). Studies with fluorescently labeled DHPs and BTZs supported this model and provided experimental evidence for a steric interference of bound DHPs with the accession pathway for BTZs (4Brauns T. Prinz H. Kimball S.D. Haugland R.P. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A multisubsite domain binding model was therefore proposed in which the apparent noncompetitive interactions observed between different classes of CCBs mainly result from steric interactions rather than drug-induced conformational changes (1Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 108-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This multisubsite binding domain is located in the pore-forming regions of repeats III and IV of the α1-subunit. It allows drug binding to a domain interface, thus facilitating stabilization of closed channel conformations (“domain interface model”) (2Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed molecular analysis of amino acid residues involved in drug binding is available for all three chemical classes of CCBs. Altered sensitivity of currents through mutated channels was tested by electrophysiological means after expression of the channel complex in heterologous systems. However, this analysis is complicated by the fact that the apparent sensitivity of CCBs is critically affected by channel gating in an either voltage- or use-dependent manner (5Peterson B.Z.

Aczel S. Timin E.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutation-induced changes in channel gating can therefore lead to pronounced alterations in drug sensitivity without necessarily changing binding affinity (6Hering S. Berjukov S. Aczel S. Timin E.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Radioreceptor assays with recombinant channels directly allow us to measure changes in binding affinity (i.e. the dissociation constant, KD) and are therefore a valuable addition to confirm electrophysiological findings. In contrast to the successful application of this approach for DHPs, PAA radioligand binding to recombinant LTCCs has not yet been accomplished. This is not only due to their lower affinity for LTCCs as compared with DHPs (7Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also to higher nonspecific binding of suitable radioligands ((–)-[3H]devapamil or [3H]verapamil) to low affinity binding sites on other proteins (8Oeken H-J. Von Nettelbladt E. Zimmer M. Flockerzi V. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Moebius F.F. Burrows G.G. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 139-148PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we exploited a new mouse model in which Thr-1066 in transmembrane segment IIIS5 was mutated to a tyrosine residue (T1066Y) in Cav1.2 α1, the major LTCC isoform expressed in heart and brain (10Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Hetzenauer A. Huber I.G. Renstrom E. Wietzorrek G. Berjukov S. Cavalli M. Walter D. Koschak A. Waldschutz R. Hering S. Bova S. Rorsman P. Pongs O. Singewald N. Striessnig J.J J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mutation serves as a molecular switch that eliminates high DHP sensitivity by steric hindrance of DHP binding (11Wappl E. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These mutant mice provide us with the unique opportunity to directly quantify the consequences of this mutation by radioligand binding in native channels of mouse brain membranes. Here we report that Tyr-1066 unexpectedly increased PAA affinity by stabilization of the PAA-channel complex. This clearly shows that PAAs can also interact with amino acids in repeat IIIS5 and provides an unequivocal example for a residue that is able to control both DHP and PAA interaction. Since a Tyr residue is present in the corresponding position of non-LTCC α1 subunits, this residue must confer some of the known sensitivity of these channels for PAAs. Reagents—(–)-[3H]Devapamil (∼80 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). Unlabeled PAA enantiomers were kindly provided by Dr. Glossmann (Medical University of Innsbruck) and Dr. Traut (Knoll AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany). Animals—The generation and breeding of Cav1.2DHP–/– mice was described recently (10Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Hetzenauer A. Huber I.G. Renstrom E. Wietzorrek G. Berjukov S. Cavalli M. Walter D. Koschak A. Waldschutz R. Hering S. Bova S. Rorsman P. Pongs O. Singewald N. Striessnig J.J J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and was approved by the Austrian Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft, und Kultur. To minimize use and breeding of genetically modified animals, the number of experiments had to be kept to a minimum. Membrane Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—Brain membranes and membranes from tsA201 cells transfected with 4.5 μg of α1, 3.5 μgof α2-δ, 2.5 μgof β, and 4.5 μg of pUC carrier DNA were prepared as described (12Huber I. Wappl E. Herzog A. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Langer T. Striessnig J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Membrane protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Expression of WT and mutant Cav1.2 α1 (α1C) subunits was quantified in immunoblots employing affinity-purified anti-α1C818–835 antibody as described previously (14Liu X. Rusch N.J. Striessnig J. Sarna S.K. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 480-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Prestained molecular mass standards (high range; Bio-Rad) separated on the same gel were used to calculate the apparent molecular masses of immunoreactive bands. Radioreceptor Assay—Binding experiments with the phenylalkylamine (–)-[3H]devapamil were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a final assay volume of 0.5–1 ml, employing membrane protein and radioligand concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 μm unlabeled racemic devapamil and subtracted from total binding to yield specific binding. Binding inhibition (and stimulation) studies were performed in the absence (control) and presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled drugs serially diluted in Me2SO. The maximal Me2SO concentration in the assay did not exceed 1% (v/v), which does not affect DHP and PAA binding. For dissociation kinetic experiments, dissociation of the preformed drug-channel complex was monitored by the addition of 3 μm unlabeled devapamil at different time intervals before determining the concentration of bound complexes. The concentration of bound ligand was determined by rapid filtration of the assay mixture through GF/C Whatman glass fiber filters, pretreated with 0.25% (v/v) polyethyleneimine and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 22 °C (15Pichler M. Cassidy T.N. Reimer D. Haase H. Kraus R. Ostler D. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13877-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Filters were washed three times with ice-cold filtration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), and filter-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (16Ferry D.R. Goll A. Gadow C. Glossmann H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1984; 327: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding inhibition (and stimulation) data were fitted to the general dose-response equation (17DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 4: E97-E102Google Scholar) to obtain IC50 values and slope factors. Biphasic saturation data were subjected to Scatchard transformation. Mutant-induced changes of a high affinity binding site were estimated from the initial slopes of the Scatchard analysis by linear regression analysis of the five or six data points with the lowest free radioligand concentration (see “Results” and corresponding figure legends). Dissociation rate constants (k–1) were determined by nonlinear fitting of the data to equations describing mono- or biexponential dissociation reactions as appropriate. Binding parameters were calculated using GraphPad Prism 4.0®. In Situ Hybridization Experiments—In situ hybridization experiments were carried out as previously described (18Clark N.C. Nagano N. Kuenzi F.M. Jarolimek W. Huber I. Walter D. Wietzorrek G. Boyce S. Kullmann D.M. Striessnig J. Seabrook G.R. Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). [α-35S]dATP endlabeled 45-mer antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized using a terminal transferase kit (Roche Applied Science). The following antisense primers against the mouse Cav1.2 α1 sequence (GenBank™ accession number L01776; positions 1242–1286 and 1361–1405) were used: 5′-GGG AGC AAG TCC TGC AGC TGC ATT GGC ATT CAT GTT GGC ATG AGC-3′ and 5′-TGT GTG GAA CTG ACG GTA GAG ATG GTT GCG TTG CCA GCA GTG CCC-3′. Construction of α1 cDNAs—Nucleotide and amino acid numbering is according to sequence accession no. X15539. An Acc65I (5′ polylinker)-XbaI (3′ polylinker) poly(A+) sequence fragment (210 bp) was coligated with a SalI-Acc65I (5′ polylinker-3′ polylinker) fragment of the rabbit cardiac Cav1.2 α1 subunit cDNA (19Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) inserted into the mammalian expression vector pGFP (a gift from M. Grabner, Medical University of Innsbruck), and the XhoI-XbaI (5′-3′ polylinker) cut mammalian expression vector pCIneo (Invitrogen), yielding Cav1.2pApCIneo. Mutation T1066Y was initially introduced into Cav1.2pGFP by overlap extension PCR using an AflII-Tth111I cassette (nucleotides 2880–3579), yielding Cav1.2TYpGFP. Subsequently, Cav1.2TYpApCIneo was constructed for heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes by transferring an EcoRI-SacII (nucleotides 2405–4307) fragment from Cav1.2TYpGFP to Cav1.2pApCIneo. Electrophysiological Measurements in X. laevis Oocytes—Capped run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts from XbaI-linearized cDNA templates of WT and the T1066Y mutant were synthesized according to Krieg and Melton (20Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). α1 cRNA was coinjected with β1a (21Ruth P. Roehrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and α2δ (22Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. McKenna E. Koch W.J. Hui A. Schwartz A. Harpold M.M. Science. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) subunit cRNAs into stage V-VI oocytes from X. laevis. To avoid bias, the experimenter was blinded to the injected oocytes until data analysis was finished. 2–3 days after cRNA injection, inward barium currents (IBa) through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were measured at room temperature using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (11Wappl E. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To quantify endogenous IBa, X. laevis oocytes injected only with β1a and α2δ were analyzed in parallel. Only oocytes expressing peak IBa through recombinant Ca2+ channels at least 7 times larger than the highest endogenous currents were included in the analysis. Data analysis and acquisition was performed using the pClamp software package (version 6.0; Axon Instruments). Leakage correction was performed by adjusting the current traces by a factor calculated from the difference between the leak at –80 mV and –90 mV, respectively. The extracellular solution contained 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 2 mm CsOH, and 5 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). The voltage recording and current-injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2 m CsOH, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm EGTA (adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl) and had resistances of 0.7–5 megaohms. Before starting an experiment, the oocytes were held at –80 mV until IBa stabilized. Use-dependent modulation of peak IBa by 100 μm (–)-verapamil was measured during 20 consecutive 100-ms pulses applied at a frequency of 0.66 Hz from a holding potential of –80 mV to a test pulse corresponding to the peak potential of the current-voltage relations. Control traces were recorded twice in the absence of drug separated by a 5-min interval to allow for complete channel recovery. The same protocol was then repeated after perfusion of the oocyte with drug-containing solution at the holding potential. Use-dependent block was expressed as the percentage decrease of peak IBa during the last test pulses of the train compared with IBa during the first train. Only cells that showed peak current rundown between control test protocols less than 15% and current decay during trains of pulses in the absence of drug of less then 10% of the peak current were included in the analysis. Statistics—Data are given as mean ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired Student's t test employing GraphPad Prism 4.0®. Fig. 1 illustrates the location of residue Thr-1066 (numbering according to Cav1.2) (10Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Hetzenauer A. Huber I.G. Renstrom E. Wietzorrek G. Berjukov S. Cavalli M. Walter D.

Mutation to tyrosine eliminates high affinity for DHPs as assessed by radioligand binding and functional studies (3He M. Bodi I. Mikala G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2629-2633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Hetzenauer A. Huber I.G. Renstrom E. Wietzorrek G. Berjukov S. Cavalli M.

To test whether IIIS5 mutation T1066Y affects PAA interaction with LTCCs, we measured specific (–)-[3H]devapamil binding to brain microsomes prepared from WT mice, Cav1.2DHP+/– mice heterozygous for the mutation (+/–), and homozygous Cav1.2DHP–/– mice (–/–; Fig. 2). Binding was linearly dependent on membrane protein concentrations (Fig. 2A). In contrast to DHPs (10Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Hetzenauer A. Huber I.G. Renstrom E. Wietzorrek G. Berjukov S. Cavalli M. Walter D. Koschak A. Waldschutz R. Hering S. Bova S. Rorsman P. Pongs O. Singewald N. Striessnig J.J J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), protein-dependent specific binding was significantly higher for heterozygous and mutant mouse brain membranes than for WT at equal radioligand concentrations (Fig. 2, A and B). The observation of a higher specific (–)-[3H]devapamil binding signal for Cav1.2DHP+/– and Cav1.2DHP–/– mice raised the question of whether this effect was due to an increase in binding affinity or resulted from a mutation-induced up-regulation of Cav1.2 channels. We considered the latter possibility unlikely, because we found no evidence of increased immunoreactivity for mutated Cav1.2 α1 in brain and heart membranes of Cav1.2DHP–/– mice in an earlier study (10Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Hetzenauer A. Huber I.G. Renstrom E. Wietzorrek G. Berjukov S. Cavalli M. Walter D. Koschak A. Waldschutz R. Hering S. Bova S. Rorsman P. Pongs O. Singewald N. Striessnig J.J J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); nor did we detect increased expression of recombinant mutant T1066Y channel complexes after heterologous expression in tsA201 cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the mutation did not alter the neuronal expression pattern of Cav1.2 mRNAs as determined by in situ hybridization experiments in whole brain sections (Fig. 3B). Thus, it appeared more likely that the mutation enhanced binding by increasing (–)-devapamil binding affinity. Fig. 4 illustrates the inhibition of specific (–)-[3H]devapamil binding to WT and mutant brain LTCCs by the more potent (–)-enantiomers of devapamil, verapamil, and gallopamil. These PAAs only differ with respect to the number of methoxy substituents at their phenyl rings (7Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For (–)-devapamil and (–)-verapamil a reproducible decrease of the IC50 values was observed in three independent experiments (see the legend to Fig. 4). This increase in affinity was also observed in the presence of a physiologically relevant (1 mm) concentration of CaCl2 (see the legend to Fig. 4), which affects PAA interaction with the extracellularly oriented selectivity filter glutamates (2Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the IC50 was not increased for (–)-gallopamil (Fig. 4). These data confirmed the higher binding signal observed for (–)-[3H]devapamil and suggested that mutation T1066Y increases the affinity of LTCCs for (–)-devapamil and (–)-verapamil.Fig. 4Stereoselective inhibition of (–)-[3H]devapamil binding to brain membranes by PAA enantiomers. (–)-[3H]devapamil (0.57–0.63 nm) was incubated with 0.18–0.20 mg/ml brain membrane protein from WT and Cav1.2DHP–/– mutant mice for 60–90 min at 22 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of different PAA enantiomers. Wild type and mutant membranes were always assayed in parallel within the same experiment under identical conditions. The IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting (see “Experimental Procedures”). The following binding parameters were obtained (parameters obtained in an independent experiment are given in parentheses). A, (–)-devapamil. For WT (•), IC50 = 2.71 (1.01) nm, slope = 0.84 (0.78). For –/– (○), IC50 = 0.82 (0.50) nm, slope = 0.80 (0.88). B, (–)-verapamil. For WT (•), IC50 = 12.8 (22.9) nm, slope = 0.78 (0.83). For –/– (○), IC50 = 2.73 (5.78) nm, slope = 0.73 (0.70). The affinity increase for mutant channels persisted when 1 mm CaCl2 was included in the incubation mixture ((–)-devapamil: for WT (•), IC50 = 5.51 nm, slope = 0.85; for –/– (○), IC50 = 1.57 nm, slope = 0.84; (–)-verapamil, for WT (•), IC50 = 114.5 nm, slope = 0.93; for –/– (○), IC50 = 14.0 nm, slope = 0.80). C, the following binding parameters were obtained for (–)-gallopamil (parameters obtained in two additional independent experiments are given in parentheses): for WT (•), IC50 = 2.13 (4.16, 6.07) nm, slope = 0.55 (0.52, 0.55); for –/– (○), IC50 = 3.48 (6.98, 7.45) nm, slope = 0.86 (0.77, 1.15).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further substantiate this finding, we attempted to determine the KD for (–)-[3H]devapamil in saturation experiments, although the low slope factor in displacement studies (Fig. 4A) suggested that it labeled more than one population of sites in mouse brain membranes. As shown in Fig. 5, this was indeed the case. Such low affinity sites for (–)-[3H]devapamil have previously been reported in mammalian brain (23Reynolds I.J. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 237: 731-738PubMed Google Scholar) and in cardiac muscle (8Oeken H-J. Von Nettelbladt E. Zimmer M. Flockerzi V. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since the affinity for the low affinity binding component was too low to be reliably quantified, we derived estimates for the change in the KD for the high affinity site from the initial slopes of the Scatchard-transformed binding data (see “Experimental Procedures” and the legend to Fig. 5). The apparent KD (1/slope factor) decreased from 1.93 ± 0.39 in WT to 0.53 ± 0.07 (n = 3; p < 0.05) in mutant membranes. Although these data do not rule out changes in maximal binding capacity, they confirm the higher affinity of (–)-[3H]devapamil for the T1066Y mutant. To reveal the mechanism by which the mutation decreased the KD for (–)-[3H]devapamil, we investigated the dissociation kinetics of (–)-[3H]devapamil (Fig. 6). Experiments were performed at low radioligand concentrations to preferentially label LTCCs and minimize occupancy of the low affinity sites detected in saturation studies. After equilibrium binding had been reached, we followed the dissociation of the radioligand by the addition of 3 μm unlabeled devapamil to the reaction mixture. In five independent experiments, we reproducibly observed a significantly slower dissociation from mutant brain membranes as compared with WT (Fig. 6). After 20 min, almost complete dissociation of radioligand occurred from WT channel complexes, whereas more than 50% of specific binding to the mutant channel remained (Fig. 6A). Whereas monophasic dissociation of (–)-[3H]devapamil from mutant channels occurred with a dissociation rate constant (k–1) of 0.0209 ± 0.0023 min–1 (n = 5), k–1 was 5–10-fold higher for WT (see legend to Fig. 6B). This suggests that the mutation stabilizes (–)-[3H]devapamil binding to LTCCs in accordance with the observed decrease in KD. The interesting finding that a single mutation can increase the affinity for PAAs but eliminates high affinity for DHPs in radioligand binding experiments (10Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Hetzenauer A. Huber I.G. Renstrom E. Wietzorrek G. Berjukov S. Cavalli M. Walter D. Koschak A. Waldschutz R. Hering S. Bova S. Rorsman P. Pongs O. Singewald N. Striessnig J.J J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) enabled us to reversibly label WT and mutant LTCCs with (–)-[3H]devapamil and monitor the loss of DHP binding affinity for the T1066Y channel over a broad concentration range. This was possible by exploiting the known noncompetitive inhibition of (–)-[3H]devapamil binding to L-type channels by DHPs. Isradipine partially inhibited (–)-[3H]devapamil binding to WT channels (Fig. 7) in a highly stereoselective manner ((±)-isradipine: IC50 = 0.16 ± 0.02, slope factor = 1.62 ± 0.30; percentage inhibition = 49.1 ± 4.2, n = 5; (–)-isradipine: IC50 = 8.78 ± 2.12, slope factor = 1.06 ± 0.18; percentage inhibition = 37.4 ± 10.3; n = 3). No inhibition was found for mutant channels up to 10 μm concentrations (Fig. 7). Thus, mutation T1066Y dramatically reduces DHP antagonist sensitivity, completely preventing noncompetitive inhibition of PAA binding by both isradipine enantiomers even at micromolar concentrations. To prove the increased PAA affinity also in functional studies, we expressed WT and mutant Cav1.2 α1 subunits in X. laevis oocytes together with β1 and α2δ subunits and measured the inhibitory effect of 100 μm (–)-verapamil on channel currents using Ba2+ as a charge carrier. Verapamil was used, because our binding experiments indicated a slightly higher increase in binding affinity of the (–)-enantiomer for the mutant channel (Fig. 4), and only small amounts of (–)-devapamil were available for our studies. PAAs are use-dependent blockers of LTCCs. PAA sensitivity depends on depolarization frequency and pulse duration (24Hering S. Savchenko A. Strübing C. Lakitsch M. Striessnig J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 820-826PubMed Google Scholar), making it difficult to assess small differences in affinity by generating concentration-response curves. We therefore selected a pulse protocol in which IBa decay during pulse trains was minimal (<7%; see legend to Fig. 8), and thus even a small increase in use-dependent block by (–)-verapamil should be detectable. This was achieved by applying trains of 20 consecutive 100-ms pulses at a frequency of 0.66 Hz from a holding potential of –80 mV to a test pulse corresponding to the peak potential of the current-voltage relations. Under these conditions, 100 μm verapamil inhibited 23.7 ± 2.56% (n = 5) of IBa in WT channels (Fig. 8). A significantly (p < 0.01) larger inhibition (42.94 ± 3.70%; n = 7) was induced in mutant channels. Although the complexity of the use-dependent verapamil inhibition does not allow us to quantitate the apparent sensitivity difference, these functional data nicely confirm our results obtained by radioligand binding studies. By demonstrating that a tyrosine residue in position 1066 increases PAA affinity, we provide novel insight into the organization of the LTCC multisubsite drug binding domain. So far, no interactions of PAAs with segment IIIS5 have been demonstrated. We show that the bound PAA molecule is well within reach of IIIS5 amino acid side chains and that a tyrosine side chain (as present in non-L-type channel α1-subunits) is able to interact both with PAAs and DHPs exerting opposite effects on binding affinity. Our data also provide some indirect evidence concerning the orientation of the Tyr-1066 (numbering according to Cav1.2) side chain with respect to the drug binding pocket. One possibility is that it sterically blocks DHP binding by protruding deep into the multisubsite domain. In this case, we would also expect a steric interference with PAA binding based on the facts that (i) the PAAs examined here are larger than DHPs (such as isradipine) and (ii) the DHP and PAA binding domains must considerably overlap (1Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 108-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 2Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data therefore suggest a model (Fig. 9) in which the tyrosine side chain is oriented more toward the access pathway of DHPs and/or those regions of the multisubsite domain that are preferentially occupied by the DHP molecule. Opposite effects of this residue on DHP and PAA binding are also in agreement with previous electrophysiological studies, which used permanently charged drugs to demonstrate that DHPs and PAAs approach their binding domains from opposite sides of the channel. Whereas DHPs rely on an extracellular access pathway (25Kwan Y.W. Bangalore R. Lakitsh M. Glossmann H. Kass R.S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1995; 27: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Strübing C. Hering S. Glossmann H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), PAAs block the channel through a cytoplasmic approach (24Hering S. Savchenko A. Strübing C. Lakitsch M. Striessnig J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 820-826PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hescheler J. Pelzer D. Trube G. Trautwein W. Pflügers Arch. 1982; 393: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the proposed model, such separate accession pathways would allow the (also more flexible) PAA molecule to still reach its site inside the mutant channel and simultaneously provide a close interaction with the Tyr-1066 side chain, thereby stabilizing binding and decreasing KD. A stabilization of the PAA-channel complex was evident from our kinetic studies, which revealed a pronounced slowing of (–)-[3H]devapamil dissociation from mutant brain membranes. The mutation may not only slow dissociation, but it seems to also slow association of (–)-devapamil, because the slowing of dissociation (5–10-fold) appeared larger than the increase in binding affinity. Because we do not yet know how the S5 and pore-forming S6 helices are packed against each other, it is possible that the IIIS5 mutation affects preferentially the geometry of the binding site for DHPs. However, due to the strong overlap of the two binding domains, we consider this rather unlikely. S6 helices also control the gating and pore properties of the channel, and thus conformational changes may also alter the biophysical channel properties. However, we and others (see Ref. 10Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Hetzenauer A. Huber I.G. Renstrom E. Wietzorrek G. Berjukov S. Cavalli M. Walter D. Koschak A. Waldschutz R. Hering S. Bova S. Rorsman P. Pongs O. Singewald N. Striessnig J.J J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and references cited therein) did not find evidence for gating changes of the mutant channel. Note that our detailed analysis of the PAA interaction of mutation T1066Y was only possible because it was introduced in mice in vivo and accessible to established (–)-[3H]devapamil binding assays in wild type and mutant mouse brain membranes. So far, no binding assay has been established to probe PAA binding to recombinant LTCCs expressed in heterologous systems as described for DHPs (5Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Acheson M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18752-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This is mainly due to a higher nonspecific binding 2I. Huber and J. Striessnig, unpublished observations. and the 4–10-fold lower binding affinity of (–)-[3H]devapamil (KD = 1–2.5 nm) as compared with DHPs ((+)-[3H]isradipine; KD = 0.25–0.5 nm)) (7Glossmann H.

Our data also provide a molecular basis for the finding that N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels exhibit some affinity for PAAs, such as devapamil or verapamil (29Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Dobrev D. Milde A.S. Andreas K. Ravens U. Br. J.

It is known that some drug binding residues of the PAA binding domain are conserved between LTCC and non-LTCC (e.g. Cav2.1 and Cav2.2) α1 subunits. Examples are Tyr-1151, Phe-1172, and Val-1173 in IIIS6. Like our mutant channels, non-LTCCs contain a tyrosine residue in the position corresponding to L-type Thr-1066. Our data provide evidence that this tyrosine together with the other conserved PAA binding residues mediates the weak PAA sensitivity of non-LTCCs. Three-dimensional models of LTCC drug binding domains exist (12Huber I. Wappl E. Herzog A. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Langer T. Striessnig J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Zhorov B.S. Folkman E.V. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 22-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but are not yet suitable for rational drug design because they are based on the crystal structure of structurally related bacterial K+-channels. Based on the rapid progress made in elucidating the three-dimensional structure of large ion channels, it is likely that a higher resolution structure will soon also become available for voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (33Wang M.C. Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7159-7168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). In combination with detailed maps of the interaction sites of LTCC modulators with individual amino acids, this will not only allow the elucidation of the exact molecular mechanism for LTCC block by these drugs but eventually may also facilitate the rational development of selective blockers of other Ca2+ channel α1 subunits or perhaps of other structurally related members of the cation channel family.
