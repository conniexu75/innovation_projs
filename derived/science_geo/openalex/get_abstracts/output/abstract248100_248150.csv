https://openalex.org/W2135178212,"Schrödinger's hypothetical cat was both dead and alive thanks to a paradox of quantum mechanics, in which a system exists in two or more states at once in a ‘superposition’ of entangled states. Creating this situation experimentally is very difficult, especially for systems made up of many particles, as interactions with the environment destroy superposition in a process called decoherence. So far, entangled states of just a handful of atoms or photons have been achieved. Now, two groups have extended the limits of quantum state engineering by creating the largest entangled atomic systems to date. Working with atoms held in an ion trap by an electromagnetic field to limit decoherence, a team from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, has created ‘cat states’ of up to six beryllium atoms. A second group, based at Innsbruck University in Austria, has achieved a similar feat by making a related entangled state, a ‘W state’, containing up to eight particles. As the states are created ‘on demand’ and should be scalable to many more particles, there is hope that this technology will pave the way for building a large-scale quantum computer. The generation, manipulation and fundamental understanding of entanglement lies at the very heart of quantum mechanics. Entangled particles are non-interacting but are described by a common wavefunction; consequently, individual particles are not independent of each other and their quantum properties are inextricably interwoven1,2,3. The intriguing features of entanglement become particularly evident if the particles can be individually controlled and physically separated. However, both the experimental realization and characterization of entanglement become exceedingly difficult for systems with many particles. The main difficulty is to manipulate and detect the quantum state of individual particles as well as to control the interaction between them. So far, entanglement of four ions4 or five photons5 has been demonstrated experimentally. The creation of scalable multiparticle entanglement demands a non-exponential scaling of resources with particle number. Among the various kinds of entangled states, the ‘W state’6,7,8 plays an important role as its entanglement is maximally persistent and robust even under particle loss. Such states are central as a resource in quantum information processing9 and multiparty quantum communication. Here we report the scalable and deterministic generation of four-, five-, six-, seven- and eight-particle entangled states of the W type with trapped ions. We obtain the maximum possible information on these states by performing full characterization via state tomography10, using individual control and detection of the ions. A detailed analysis proves that the entanglement is genuine. The availability of such multiparticle entangled states, together with full information in the form of their density matrices, creates a test-bed for theoretical studies of multiparticle entanglement. Independently, ‘Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger’ entangled states11 with up to six ions have been created and analysed in Boulder12."

https://openalex.org/W2054581136,"Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for immune and inflammatory responses and belong to a network of cells that has been termed the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). However, the origin and lineage of these cells remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the isolation and clonal analysis of a mouse bone marrow progenitor that is specific for monocytes, several macrophage subsets, and resident spleen DCs in vivo. It was also possible to recapitulate this differentiation in vitro by using treatment with the cytokines macrophage colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Thus, macrophages and DCs appear to renew from a common progenitor, providing a cellular and molecular basis for the concept of the MPS."

The most puzzling aspects include the origin of the molecular nitrogen and methane in its atmosphere, and the mechanism(s) by which methane is maintained in the face of rapid destruction by photolysis. The Huygens probe, launched from the Cassini spacecraft, has made the first direct observations of the satellite's surface and lower atmosphere. Here we report direct atmospheric measurements from the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS), including altitude profiles of the constituents, isotopic ratios and trace species (including organic compounds). The primary constituents were confirmed to be nitrogen and methane. Noble gases other than argon were not detected. The argon includes primordial 36Ar, and the radiogenic isotope 40Ar, providing an important constraint on the outgassing history of Titan. Trace organic species, including cyanogen and ethane, were found in surface measurements."

Some of the key themes that are emerging are that membranes are patchy, with segregated regions of structure and function, that lipid regions vary in thickness and composition, and that crowding and ectodomains limit exposure of lipid to the adjacent aqueous regions."

https://openalex.org/W2106912222,"Lens-specific aquaporin-0 (AQP0) functions as a specific water pore and forms the thin junctions between fibre cells. Here we describe a 1.9 Å resolution structure of junctional AQP0, determined by electron crystallography of double-layered two-dimensional crystals. Comparison of junctional and non-junctional AQP0 structures shows that junction formation depends on a conformational switch in an extracellular loop, which may result from cleavage of the cytoplasmic amino and carboxy termini. In the centre of the water pathway, the closed pore in junctional AQP0 retains only three water molecules, which are too widely spaced to form hydrogen bonds with each other. Packing interactions between AQP0 tetramers in the crystalline array are mediated by lipid molecules, which assume preferred conformations. We were therefore able to build an atomic model for the lipid bilayer surrounding the AQP0 tetramers, and we describe lipid–protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2081477031,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1, EGFR) is overexpressed in a variety of human cancer cells. It has been considered as a rational target for drug delivery. To identify novel ligands with specific binding capabilities to EGFR, we screened a phage display peptide library and found an enriched phage clone encoding the amino acid sequence YHWYGYTPQNVI (designated as GE11). Competitive binding assay and Scatchard analysis revealed that GE11 peptide bound specifically and efficiently to EGFR with a dissociation constant of approximately 22 nM, but with much lower mitogenic activity than with EGF. We showed that the peptides were internalized preferentially into EGFR highly expressing cells, and they accumulated in EGFR overexpressing tumor xenografts after i.v. delivery in vivo. In gene delivery studies, GE11-conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI) vectors were less mitogenic, but still quite efficient at transfecting genes into EGFR highly expressing cells and tumor xenografts. Taken together, GE11 is a potentially safe and efficient targeting moiety for selective drug delivery systems mediated through EGFR."
https://openalex.org/W2046945218,"Apicomplexan parasites constitute one of the most significant groups of pathogens infecting humans and animals. The liver stage sporozoites of Plasmodium spp. and tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis, respectively, use a unique mode of locomotion termed gliding motility to invade host cells and cross cell substrates. This amoeboid-like movement uses a parasite adhesin from the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) family and a set of proteins linking the extracellular adhesin, via an actin-myosin motor, to the inner membrane complex. The Plasmodium blood stage merozoite, however, does not exhibit gliding motility. Here we show that homologues of the key proteins that make up the motor complex, including the recently identified glideosome-associated proteins 45 and 50 (GAP40 and GAP50), are present in P. falciparum merozoites and appear to function in erythrocyte invasion. Furthermore, we identify a merozoite TRAP homologue, termed MTRAP, a micronemal protein that shares key features with TRAP, including a thrombospondin repeat domain, a putative rhomboid-protease cleavage site, and a cytoplasmic tail that, in vitro, binds the actin-binding protein aldolase. Analysis of other parasite genomes shows that the components of this motor complex are conserved across diverse Apicomplexan genera. Conservation of the motor complex suggests that a common molecular mechanism underlies all Apicomplexan motility, which, given its unique properties, highlights a number of novel targets for drug intervention to treat major diseases of humans and livestock.

Parasites from the phylum Apicomplexa represent some of the most significant human and agricultural pathogens. Their ranks include Theileria parva and Theileria annulata, parasites that give rise to lymphoproliferative diseases of cattle, the opportunistic pathogens Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum that can cause life-threatening, prolonged infection in immunocompromised patients, and the most lethal of the group, the genus Plasmodium, in particular Plasmodium falciparum, the cause of millions of human deaths and as many as 500 million infections annually (1Snow R.W. Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar).Apicomplexa are a monophyletic group of obligate intracellular parasites that invade a wide range of host cells but lack the classical means of motility such as a flagellum or cilia. Instead, they move by a unique form of actin-based locomotion called gliding motility (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Morrissette N.S. Sibley L.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Efficient motility and invasion requires the release of proteins from secretory organelles located at the apical prominence, the defining structure of the phylum. These organelles, the micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules contain many of the key proteins needed for directional attachment, cell invasion, and establishment of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) 5The abbreviations used are: PV, parasitophorous vacuole; CTRP, circumsporozoite protein- and TRAP-related protein; TRAP, thrombospondin related anonymous protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IFA, immunofluorescence assay; IMC, inner membrane complex; MTIP, myosin tail-interacting protein; MLC, myosin light chain; MyoA, myosin A; TSR, thrombospondin repeat domain; RT, reverse transcription; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; contig, group of overlapping clones. 5The abbreviations used are: PV, parasitophorous vacuole; CTRP, circumsporozoite protein- and TRAP-related protein; TRAP, thrombospondin related anonymous protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IFA, immunofluorescence assay; IMC, inner membrane complex; MTIP, myosin tail-interacting protein; MLC, myosin light chain; MyoA, myosin A; TSR, thrombospondin repeat domain; RT, reverse transcription; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; contig, group of overlapping clones. within the host cell (5Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Much of our understanding of gliding motility comes from studies with the liver stage parasite from Plasmodium spp., the sporozoite, or the morphologically similar tachyzoite of Toxoplasma. Micronemal adhesive proteins are released onto the zoite (motile parasite form) surface prior to invasion and are transported to the posterior end of the cell, being cleaved and released on their way, thus creating a dynamic tread-mill (2Morrissette N.S. Sibley L.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 3Soldati D. Meissner M. Curr. Opin.

Ultimately, the extracellular adhesin is linked internally to an anchor that is attached to a series of membrane structures, underlying the outer plasma membrane of the parasite, called the inner membrane complex (IMC) (6Pinder J.C. Fowler R.E. Dluzewski A.R. Bannister L.H. Lavin F.M. Mitchell G.H. Wilson R.J. Gratzer W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1831-1839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bergman L.W. Kaiser K. Fujioka H.

Between the plasma membrane and IMC lies an internal actin-myosin motor that drives cell motility (2Morrissette N.S. Sibley L.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In addition to driving cell motility in sporozoites and tachyzoites, the same molecular components also appear to be used for host cell invasion (8Kappe S. Bruderer T. Gantt S. Fujioka H.

Reckmann I. Hollingdale M.R. Bujard H. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Key to its adhesive function is the presence of a thrombospondin repeat (TSR) domain (14Muller H.M. Reckmann I. Hollingdale M.R. Bujard H. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a well characterized protein domain that is present on surface proteins across diverse organisms and is implicated in several biological functions such as cell adhesion and cell motility (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Dong Y. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Lawler J. Wang J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Two essential Plasmodium proteins that contain a TSR domain, the aforementioned TRAP and liver stage circumsporozoite protein (CSP) (16Menard R. Sultan A.A. Cortes C. Altszuler R. van Dijk M.R.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and its associated TgGAP45 (20Gaskins E. Gilk S. DeVore N. Mann T. Ward G. Beckers C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A homologue of MLC has been described in both P. yoelii and P. falciparum (7Bergman L.W. Kaiser K. Fujioka H. Coppens I. Daly T.M. Fox S. Matuschewski K. Nussenzweig V. Kappe S.H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), referred to as the MyoA tail-interacting protein (MTIP). The chain of interaction of these components (TRAP-aldolase-actin-MyoA-MLC/MTIP-GAP45-GAP50) constitutes what we refer to as the motor complex.Unlike sporozoites and tachyzoites, merozoites, the blood stage malaria parasites, do not demonstrate gliding motility, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie their invasion of the erythrocyte are still largely unknown. Evidence for the involvement of an actin-myosin motor in merozoites comes from the inhibition of invasion when cultures are pretreated with drugs that target actin (cytochalasin B (21Field S.J. Pinder J.C. Clough B. Dluzewski A.R. Wilson R.J. Gratzer W.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 25: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) or myosin (butane-2,3-dione monoxime (6Pinder J.C.

This suggests that, despite the absence of gliding motility, the merozoite may utilize actin polymerization, myosin, and by inference a homologous molecular motor for efficient erythrocyte invasion.Here we show that the components of the motor complex characterized in sporozoites and tachyzoites are expressed in developing merozoites, localize consistently with their inferred function, and form complexes that support their having a role in erythrocyte invasion. We identify a putatively essential merozoite-specific TRAP homologue (MTRAP) that is localized to the micronemes, released and processed during invasion, and interacts in vitro with aldolase, key features suggesting that it is the blood stage invasion adhesin that links the cell surface to the motor complex.

Primers used were as follows: TRAP-RTfwd (5′-CTAGTTAATGGTAGAGATGTGC-3′) and TRAP-RTrev (5′-CAACTAATTGATTAGCATTCTC-3′); CTRP-RTfwd (5′-CAAGTACAACACACTGTAGCAAC-3′) and CTRP-RTrev (5′-GATGCAGAATTTTCATTTCCATCAG-3′); CSP-RTfwd (5′-GCTAATGCCAACAGTGCTGTA-3′) and CSP-RTrev (5′-GGAACAAGAAGGATAATACC-3′); TRSP-RTfwd (5′-GATATAGGACCGGCTTTATCCGTTC-3′) and TRSP-RTrev (5′-CACTACAATATTAACTACAGAAAAG-3′); PTRAMP-RTfwd (5′-GATTTGTGTTCATGTAATTTGAAGG-3′) and PTRAMP-RTrev (5′-GGAAAGCTCCAGATGATTTACCCAG-3′); MTRAP-RTfwd (5′-CCAGTGAATTTTATACAAG-3′) and MTRAP-RTrev (5′-TTCGAGTGCCCAGAATTCTTCTTCATCCAT-3′); PFF0800w-RTfwd (5′-CCACTCGTGTGTCTTGCTTTGTGG-3′) and PFF0800w-RTrev (5′-CCAAATTTGTAAGAACTATTATTATCC-3′); MAL8P1.45-RTfwd (5′-CAGTTTATATCATGATACAAATCAG-3′) and MAL8P1.45-RTrev (5′-CGATGTTTTTTAAAATACATTTGG-3′).Nucleic Acid and Sequence Analysis—Genomic DNA from the 3D7 parasite (see below) and from parasites BT3, D10, HB3, MCAMP, and PF120 (kindly provided by T. Triglia) were used as template in the PCR of the MTRAP gene using the following primers (MTRAP_GeneF (5′-GGGTGATAATAATTTTTGCATAC-3′) and MTRAP_GeneR (5′-CTCATTCGAGTGCCCAGAA)) and sequenced using these and two additional primers (MTRAP_MidF (5′-CCAGTGAATTTTATACAAG-3′) and MTRAP_MidR (5′-GAAGTACTACTACTTCTAC-3′)). DNA sequencing was performed using BigDye® Terminator Cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Antisera, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblot Analysis—Rabbit and mouse antisera were raised against the TSR domain of MTRAP, the entire PfGAP45 protein, the PfGAP50 ectodomain, and the entire recombinant P. falciparum aldolase (PfAldo) protein from GST fusion proteins expressed from plasmid constructs using the following primers: MTRAP_TSRF (5′-GATCggatccACACATGATACATGCGATGAATGG-3′) and MTRAP_TSRR (5′-GATCctcgagCTCCGCCATTTCATTATTTACATCACATTC-3′); PfGAP45F (5′-GATCggatccGGAAATAAATGTTCAAGAAGC-3′) and PfGAP45R (5′-GATCctcgagGCTCAATAAAGGTGTATCGGA-3′); PfGAP50F (5′-GATCggatccATCTTTATTTCCCATGGGTCC-3′) and PfGAP50R (5′-GATCctcgagCAACTACGCTTTGCGTCTTTG-3′); PfAldoF (5′-GATCggatccATGGCTCATTGCACTGAATATATG-3′) and PfAldoR (5′-GATCctcgagTTAATAGACATATTTCTTTTC-3′). PCR products were treated with BamHI/XhoI (lowercase letters in primers), purified, and cloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse anti-PfMyoA antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide (FMQLVISHEGGIRYG) corresponding to amino acids 251-265 of PfMyoA, following Ref. 6Pinder J.C. Fowler R.E. Dluzewski A.R. Bannister L.H. Lavin F.M. Mitchell G.H. Wilson R.J. Gratzer W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1831-1839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. For immunoblots, saponin-lysed parasite pellets from highly synchronous schizont and ring stage 3D7 parasites (40-48 and 0-8 h, respectively) as well as culture supernatants (post-schizont rupture) were separated in sample buffer on 4-12% SDS-NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Rabbit and mouse antisera were diluted in 0.1% Tween 20-phosphate-buffered saline with 1% (w/v) skim milk. Appropriate secondary antibodies were used, and immunoblots were developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Commercial antibodies against HA (3F-10; Roche Applied Science) and GFP (7.1/13.1; Roche Applied Science) were used for tagged proteins.Parasite Cultures—P. falciparum asexual parasites were maintained in human erythrocytes (blood group O+) at a hematocrit of 4% with 10% Albumax™ II (Invitrogen) (25Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6077) Google Scholar). 3D7 strain parasites were originally obtained from David Walliker at Edinburgh University. Cultures were synchronized as previously described (26Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2793) Google Scholar).Vector Construction and Transfection—The Gateway MultiSite™ system (Invitrogen) was used for C-terminal tagging of MTRAP and PfGAP45 with either GFP or a triple hemagglutinin (3*HA) tag. The destination vector pCHDR-3/4 (27van Dooren G.G. Marti M. Tonkin C.J. Stimmler L.M. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that carries the human dihydrofolate reductase gene, conferring resistance to the antifolate drug WR99210, was recombined with pENTR vectors: pENTR-4/1_pAMA1 containing the AMA1 (apical membrane antigen 1) promoter (28Triglia T.

These last two vectors were generated by cloning PCR products into the pENTR-D/TOPO vector (Invitrogen), using a topoisomerase I-based reaction. Genes were amplified with the 5′ primer containing the CACC motif to facilitate directional cloning using the topoisomerase enzyme (27van Dooren G.G. Marti M. Tonkin C.J. Stimmler L.M. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). MTRAP (PlasmoDB accession number PF10_0281) was amplified using the primers 5′-CACCgaaaaaagATGAAGAAAACAATACTAAATTTATATTTG-3′ and TTCGAGTGCCCAGAATTCTTCTTCATCCAT-3′. PfGAP45 (PlasmoDB accession number PFL1090w) was amplified using the primers 5′-CACCatataataATGGGAAATAAATGTTCAAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCAATAAAGGTGTATCGGATAAATC-3′. Resulting PCR products were incubated overnight at room temperature as per the manufacturer’s instructions with pENTR-D/TOPO (Invitrogen) to yield pENTR-1/2_MTRAP and pENTR1/2_PfGAP45.Final expression vectors were generated by mixing one of each of the four plasmids (pENTR-4/1, pENTR-1/2, pENTR-2/3, and pCHDR-3/4) in the presence of a recombination enzyme mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The three generated plasmids pCHDR-MTRAP-GFP, pCHDR-MTRAP-3*HA, and pCHDR-Pf-GAP45-GFP contained the gene of interest flanked by the AMA1 promoter and either GFP or a 3*HA tag in a destination (transfection) clone containing the human dihydrofolate reductase-selectable marker.3D7 parasites were transfected as recently described (29Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) with 100 μg of purified plasmid DNA (Qiagen). Positive selection for transfectants was achieved using 10 nm WR99210.Microscopy and Immunofluorescence—Light microscopy was performed with synchronized parasites at various life cycle stages. For live GFP fluorescence, parasites were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (ProSciTech) and 0.0075% glutaraldehyde (ProSciTech) as previously described (29Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and labeled with DAPI (1:1,250; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Dual color fluorescence images were captured using a Carl Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope (Thornwood, NY) with a PCO SensiCam (Motion Engineering Co., Indianapolis, IN) and Axiovision 3 software (Carl Zeiss) or using an Apochromat ×100/1.4 oil differential interference contrast lens on a Zeiss AxioVert 200M live cell imaging inverted microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera. The shown single z-stacks were processed using the AxioVision version 4.2 deconvolution software package. For indirect immunofluorescence, air-dried smears of parasites were fixed for 5 min with 100% methanol at -20 °C, blocked for 30 min in 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 1 h with the relevant antisera: rabbit MTRAP-TSR (1:20), rabbit PfGAP45 (1:500), rabbit PfGAP50 (1:500), mouse PfMyoA (1:500), rabbit PfAMA1 (30Healer J.

Holder, manuscript in preparation. (1:200). Following two 5-min washes in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, slides were incubated for 1 h with appropriate Alexa Fluor 488/594 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) and mounted in Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories) with 10 μg/ml DAPI (Roche Applied Science).For electron microscopy, schizont stage 3D7 parasites were enriched by Plasmagel and fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde on ice for 30 min. Embedding, immunolabeling, and contrast staining were performed as described (32Rug M. Wickham M.E. Foley M. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were incubated with affinity-purified rabbit MTRAP-TSR antibody (1:5), IgG-purified rabbit PfGAP45 antibody (1:200), or mouse PfGAP50 serum (1:200) followed by 10- or 25-nm gold-labeled anti-rabbit or mouse IgG. Cells were viewed on a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope.IMC Immunoprecipitation—Trophozoites from synchronized parasites were incubated with 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) until multinucleated schizonts were apparent, and proteins were extracted as described previously (33Baldi D.L.

https://openalex.org/W2035800339,"We present a detailed history of glacial to Holocene radiocarbon in the deep western North Atlantic from deep-sea corals and paired benthic-planktonic foraminifera. The deglaciation is marked by switches between radiocarbon-enriched and -depleted waters, leading to large radiocarbon gradients in the water column. These changes played an important role in modulating atmospheric radiocarbon. The deep-ocean record supports the notion of a bipolar seesaw with increased Northern-source deep-water formation linked to Northern Hemisphere warming and the reverse. In contrast, the more frequent radiocarbon variations in the intermediate/deep ocean are associated with roughly synchronous changes at the poles."

https://openalex.org/W1986103734,"Self-assembling macromolecular machines drive fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, messenger RNA processing, translation, DNA replication and cellular transport. The ribosome, which carries out protein synthesis, is one such machine, and the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome is the preeminent model system for biophysical analysis of large RNA-protein complexes. Our understanding of 30S assembly is incomplete, owing to the challenges of monitoring the association of many components simultaneously. Here we have developed a method involving pulse-chase monitored by quantitative mass spectrometry (PC/QMS) to follow the assembly of the 20 ribosomal proteins with 16S ribosomal RNA during formation of the functional particle. These data represent a detailed and quantitative kinetic characterization of the assembly of a large multicomponent macromolecular complex. By measuring the protein binding rates at a range of temperatures, we find that local transformations throughout the assembling subunit have similar but distinct activation energies. Thus, the prevailing view of 30S assembly as a pathway proceeding through a global rate-limiting conformational change must give way to one in which the assembly of the complex traverses a landscape dotted with various local conformational transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2101203985,"The Huygens probe landed on Titan on 14 January this year, and seven papers published in this issue record the encounter. They describe a world that resembles a primitive Earth, complete with weather systems and geological activity. The ‘Huygens on Titan’ section opens with an overview of the descent and landing and a News and Views piece. Tomasko et al. describe the dry riverbed and drainage channels seen during Huygens' descent, evidence that liquid methane falls as rain or erupts from cryovolcanoes, periodically flooding the surface. This paper includes the images used on the cover to the Huygens section. Niemann et al. measured the abundances of isotopes of argon, nitrogen and carbon in the atmosphere, and conclude that there is no evidence that Titan's methane comes from biological activity. Fulchignoni et al. obtained precise measurements of temperature and pressure from the upper atmosphere right down to the surface. On the way down Huygens recorded evidence for lightning. Zarnecki et al. report that the probe landed on a relatively smooth surface of icy grains with the consistency of wet clay or sand. Isräl et al. report that the aerosols in Titan's clouds have solid cores made from complex organic molecules containing carbon and nitrogen. And Bird et al. found that on average Titan's winds blow in the same direction as the moon rotates, and that close to the surface these winds are very weak, travelling at around walking speed. Aerosols in Titan's atmosphere play an important role in determining its thermal structure1,2,3. They also serve as sinks for organic vapours4 and can act as condensation nuclei for the formation of clouds5,6, where the condensation efficiency will depend on the chemical composition of the aerosols5,7. So far, however, no direct information has been available on the chemical composition of these particles. Here we report an in situ chemical analysis of Titan's aerosols by pyrolysis at 600 °C. Ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) have been identified as the main pyrolysis products. This clearly shows that the aerosol particles include a solid organic refractory core. NH3 and HCN are gaseous chemical fingerprints of the complex organics that constitute this core, and their presence demonstrates that carbon and nitrogen are in the aerosols."

These arguments have their basis in temporal changes in the magnitude of 34S/32S fractionations between sulfate and sulfide. Here, we present a Proterozoic seawater sulfate isotope record that includes the less abundant sulfur isotope 33S. These measurements imply that sulfur compound disproportionation was an active part of the sulfur cycle by 1300 Ma and that progressive Earth surface oxygenation may have characterized the Mesoproterozoic."

Carbonic anhydrases are divided into at least three classes and are believed to share a zinc-hydroxide mechanism for carbon dioxide hydration. β-carbonic anhydrases are broadly spread among the domains of life, and existing structures from different organisms show two distinct active site setups, one with three protein coordinations to the zinc (accessible) and the other with four (blocked). The latter is believed to be inconsistent with the zinc-hydroxide mechanism. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3588c gene, shown to be required for in vivo growth of the pathogen, encodes a β-carbonic anhydrase with a steep pH dependence of its activity, being active at pH 8.4 but not at pH 7.5. We have recently solved the structure of this protein, which was a dimeric protein with a blocked active site. Here we present the structure of the thiocyanate complexed protein in a different crystal form. The protein now forms distinct tetramers and shows large structural changes, including a carboxylate shift yielding the accessible active site. This structure demonstrated for the first time that a β-carbonic anhydrase can switch between the two states. A pH-dependent dimer to tetramer equilibrium was also demonstrated by dynamic light scattering measurements. The data presented here, therefore, suggest a carboxylate shift on/off switch for the enzyme, which may, in turn, be controlled by a dimer-to-tetramer equilibrium.

Tuberculosis is estimated to cause nearly 2 million deaths yearly. Multiple drug treatment for half a year or more can cure over 95% of patients; however, only a minority of patients who develop tuberculosis receive treatment.

In all cases, the monomers combine to make homodimers (denoted essential dimer) to produce an extended β-sheet and complete the active site environment; the β-CA from Porphyridium purpureum constitutes an exception in which an apparent internal gene duplication produces a poly peptide that is twice as long and folds with a pseudo 2-fold symmetry, to mimic the dimer (13Mitsuhashi S.

All dimers and the P. purpureum monomer superimpose very well, and the dimer interaction geometry is conserved (27Covarrubias A.S. Larsson A.M. Högbom M. Lindberg J. Bergfors T. Bjorkelid C.

Most β-CAs adopt even higher multimeric states as observed by biochemical data and indicated by crystal packing. The oligomeric states have been reported to be dimers, tetramers, hexamers, and octamers (7Chegwidden W.R. Carter N.D. Edwards Y.H. The Carbonic Anhydrases: New Horizons.

The proposed CA reaction mechanism depends on the presence of a zinc-coordinated hydroxide as the reactive species. All observations of α-, γ-, and δ-CA active sites are consistent with this as the zinc is coordinated by at least one water molecule (or possibly hydroxide) in the active site structures that are not complexed by non-protein ligands, such as inhibitors. Conversely, the β-CAs display a considerable difference of the zinc ligation within the class. The β-CAs from the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (17Strop P. Smith K.S. Iverson T.M.

The last open zinc coordination position is occupied by a water molecule, or in the case of P. sativum, an acetate ion from the crystallization mother liquor. This active site architecture is thus consistent with the proposed zinc-hydroxide mechanism of the α-class and will be denoted as “accessible” with regard to the protein zinc ligation. In contrast, the β-CAs from the red alga P. purpureum (13Mitsuhashi S. Mizushima T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Miyachi S. Tsukihara T. J. Biol.

This coordination setup (denoted “blocked”) leaves no room for a water or hydroxide ligand and seems incompatible with a zinc-hydroxide mechanism. This apparent inconsistency has led to alternative mechanistic proposals (13Mitsuhashi S. Mizushima T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Miyachi S. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5521-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and also the suggestion that the aspartate may be involved in activity regulation of the enzyme by somehow changing between the accessible and blocked states (34Cronk J.D. Endrizzi J.A. Cronk M.R. O'Neill J.W. Zhang K.Y.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, no β-CA has been observed to be able to adopt both forms of the active site, and a link to activity regulation has not been established. We have recently solved the structures of two β-CAs from M. tuberculosis, Rv1284 and Rv3588c (27Covarrubias A.S. Larsson A.M. Högbom M. Lindberg J. Bergfors T. Bjorkelid C. Mowbray S.L. Unge T. Jones T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18782-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As reported in the previous study, Rv3588c showed carbonic anhydrase activity at pH 8.4 but not at pH 7.5. The crystal structure at pH 7.0 had the blocked active site setup with four protein-derived zinc ligands and a dimeric structure with no tetramers formed in the crystal lattice. Here we present a structure of this protein in complex with the zinc ligand thiocyanate. Interestingly, the protein now displays the accessible active site conformation, providing the first direct evidence that a β-CA active site can change between the two states. Moreover, the complex crystallizes in a different crystal form and forms a distinct 222 symmetric tetramer, arranged as a dimer of the basic dimers. The tetrameric arrangement is also verified in solution by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Based on the results presented here, we propose that the role of the conserved Asp-53 is to provide a carboxylate shift regulation of the enzymatic activity and that its conformation may be controlled by structural changes in the protein induced by a dimer-to-tetramer conversion. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—Cloning, expression, and purification of Rv3588c have been described previously (27Covarrubias A.S. Larsson A.M. Högbom M. Lindberg J. Bergfors T.

In short, the gene was PCR-cloned from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv (35Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K.

The construct was ligated into the vector pCR®T7 and transformed into E. coli BL21/AI, in which protein was overexpressed by induction with 0.02% arabinose at 37 °C for 2 h. The protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and size-exclusion (Hiload™ 16/60 Superdex™ 75, Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 34 mg/ml in Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience) with a molecular mass cut-off of 10 kDa and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. DLS Studies—DLS measurements were performed on a PD2000DLS Plus system (Precision Detectors) and analyzed with the PrecisionDeconvolve software. Buffers were 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, or 25 mm TAPS pH 8.4; both buffers also contained 100 mm sodium sulfate to mimic the activity measurement conditions. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—Rv3588c was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method (36Ducruix A. Giege R. Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins, Second Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Final conditions for crystallization were as follows: 2 μl of stock protein solution (34 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of an unbuffered reservoir solution containing 200 mm NaSCN, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 10% glycerol. Monoclinic crystals grew to a size of about 0.15 × 0.07 × 0.07 mm3 over a period of about 2 months. Crystals were cryo-protected by soaking for a few minutes in the mother liquor but with a total concentration of 20% glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beam line I711 at the MAXII synchrotron in Lund, Sweden. The data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Overall Structure—The structure of the thiocyanate complexed Rv3588c protein displays several interesting local and global differences when compared with the blocked enzyme (27Covarrubias A.S. Larsson A.M. Högbom M. Lindberg J. Bergfors T. Bjorkelid C. Mowbray S.L. Unge T. Jones T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18782-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The most apparent difference is that the protein crystallized as a distinct tetramer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A), the tetramer is arranged as a dimer of dimers, and the essential dimer geometry is the same as in the previous structure, as indeed it is in all β-CA structures solved to date (27Covarrubias A.S. Larsson A.M. Högbom M. Lindberg J. Bergfors T. Bjorkelid C. Mowbray S.L. Unge T. Jones T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18782-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the blocked structure, however, no tetramer was formed in the crystal lattice. There are also large backbone conformational differences throughout the molecule (Fig. 1B). The Cα root mean square deviation between the dimers is surprisingly large, 1.9 Å, for ordered residues. The changes are primarily due to changes within the protein subunits, and to a lesser extent, in dimer interface geometry. Pairwise monomer Cα RMSDs are ∼1.6 Å between ordered residues in both structures. The pairwise differences between the four monomers in the tetrameric structure are much smaller, ∼0.2 Å for all residues (excluding the ordered His tags). The changes between the two structures are concentrated at, but not limited to, the active site and the tetramer-forming interface in which the shifts cooperate to produce a rather flat surface for the interaction between the dimers. In the blocked structure, residues 32-41 are disordered and invisible in the electron density (27Covarrubias A.S. Larsson A.M. Högbom M. Lindberg J. Bergfors T. Bjorkelid C. Mowbray S.L. Unge T. Jones T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18782-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the present tetrameric structure, however, this sequence is ordered and forms an α-helix (Fig. 1B, green) that packs on the other monomer of the essential dimer to help create a cavity and restrict access to the active site. As in the structure of Rv1284 β-CA (27Covarrubias A.S. Larsson A.M. Högbom M. Lindberg J. Bergfors T. Bjorkelid C. Mowbray S.L. Unge T. Jones T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18782-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the active site cavity is very small and almost completely shielded from solvent (Fig. 2, A and B). This is remarkably different from the α-CAs, which display a very open active site.FIGURE 2Stereo images of active site cavities in the accessible forms of the M. tuberculosis β-CAs. A, Rv3588c. B, Rv1284. Chain A is dark gray and contributes the catalytic residues; chain B of the same dimer is shown in light gray. Part of the sequence that is ordered in the accessible form of Rv3588c but not in the blocked is indicated by an arrow in panel A. This structural element as well as others from chain B contribute to the active site and shield it from solvent. Surfaces were generated by the ASA option in O.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ordering of three of the four N-terminal His6 tags is of structural interest but of no biological significance. Each His6 tag coordinates two metal ions, contributing two histidyl side chains per metal. The remaining metal coordinations are provided by surface histidines and carboxylates from a neighboring molecule in the crystal lattice. This type of ordering of His tags is rare but not unprecedented (45O'Neill J.W. Kim D.E. Baker D. Zhang K.Y.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have modeled the metal ions as zinc because they refine to reasonable B-values, and the metals coordinated by the most well ordered His6 tag (chain A) have the same peak height in the electron density as the active site zinc ions. Metal analysis of the protein sample did not reveal any other metals than one equivalent of zinc per protein monomer, corresponding to the active site zinc (27Covarrubias A.S. Larsson A.M. Högbom M.

Active Site—The single most interesting change from the previous, dimeric, structure is the shift of Asp-53 from its zinc-coordinating position to become involved in a salt link with Arg-55 (Fig. 3A). This renders one of the zinc coordination positions open for coordination by exogenous ligands; in the present structure, this position is occupied by a direct coordination of the nitrogen atom of a thiocyanate ion from the mother liquor. This position is the one proposed to be occupied by a hydroxide in the CA zinc-hydroxide catalytic mechanism. The sulfur atom of the thiocyanate ion is located in a small and rather hydrophobic pocket in the larger part of the active site cavity (Fig. 2A, the left part of the cavity). It makes no tight interactions with any part of the protein; the closest atomic distances are on the order of 4 Å. This cavity may be suitable for binding and orienting the carbon dioxide substrate, as suggested previously by Kimber and Pai (14Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the P. sativum enzyme in complex with the substrate analogue acetate. The carboxylate shift of Asp-53 is accompanied by major backbone changes mainly of residues Ser-54 and Val-56 (Fig. 3B). The side chain of Ser-54 flips to point in the opposite direction with atomic shifts of up to 8 Å. In concert, Val-56 undergoes an equally dramatic change, whereas the side chain of Arg-55 undergoes relatively small shifts. The result of these molecular gymnastics is the creation of a salt link between Asp-53 and Arg-55. Quarternary Structure—To verify the relevance of the tetrameric arrangement, we performed DLS measurements of the protein in the same buffers and pH as the activity measurements. At pH 7.5, the majority of the sample (84%) exists as a species slightly larger than 40 kDa, corresponding to the calculated molecular mass for"

Despite an efficient recycling there is some requirement for elimination of brain cholesterol. Conversion of cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol by the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) is the quantitatively most important mechanism. Based on the protein expression and plasma levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, CYP46A1 activity appears to be highly stable in adults. Here we have made a structural and functional characterization of the promoter of the human CYP46A1 gene. No canonical TATA or CAAT boxes were found in the promoter region. Moreover this region had a high GC content, a feature often found in genes considered to have a largely housekeeping function. A broad spectrum of regulatory axes using a variety of promoter constructs did not result in a significant transcriptional regulation. Oxidative stress caused a significant increase in transcriptional activity. The possibility of a substrate-dependent transcriptional regulation was explored in vivo in a sterol-deficient mouse model (Dhcr24 null) in which almost all cholesterol had been replaced with desmosterol, which is not a substrate for CYP46A1. Compared with heterozygous littermates there was no statistically significant difference in the mRNA levels of Cyp46a1. During the first 2 weeks of life in the wild-type mouse, however, a significant increase of Cyp46a1 mRNA levels was found, in parallel with an increase in 24S-hydroxycholesterol level and a reduction of cholesterol synthesis.

The failure to demonstrate a significant transcriptional regulation under most conditions is discussed in relation to the turnover of brain and neuronal cholesterol. Although the brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which it maintains steady-state cholesterol levels (1.Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1375-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 2.Björkhem I. Meaney S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 806-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). This is in marked contrast to the situation in virtually every other tissue or organ. One finding that has been consistently confirmed is that, due to the efficiency of the blood-brain barrier, the brain is unable to take up cholesterol from the circulation and relies on de novo synthesis to meet its substantial cholesterol requirements. However, the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the adult brain is very low, and the bulk of brain cholesterol has a half-life that is at least 100 times longer than that of cholesterol in most other organs (3.Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). One consequence of this “uncoupling” of brain and whole body cholesterol homeostasis has been the evolution of specific mechanisms for maintenance of cerebral cholesterol levels. Two mechanisms for removal of brain cholesterol are currently recognized (1.Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1375-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The first is analogous to classic “reverse cholesterol transport” and is mediated by a flux of cholesterol present in apolipoprotein E containing lipoproteins through cerebrospinal fluid into the circulation (4.Pitas R.E.

The details of this particular mechanism for sterol transport are, however, not known.

This efflux of 24S-OH is believed to be the main mechanism by which the brain facilitates the removal of cholesterol, and, in humans, accounts for the removal of 5–7 mg of cholesterol each day (6.Björkhem I. Lütjohann D. Diczfalusy U. Ståhle L. Ahlborg G. Wahren J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytochrome P-450 species responsible for 24S-hydroxylation of cholesterol, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), has been characterized at the molecular level (9.Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14284-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In normal brain it has been demonstrated to be almost exclusively located in central nervous system neurons (9.Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to these mechanisms there is some experimental evidence for a third mechanism for removal of cholesterol from the brain (13.Xie C. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1780-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that a disruption of the Cyp46a1 gene in mice leads to a reduction in the net sterol flux from the brain by ∼65%, with a parallel decrease in the rate of brain cholesterol synthesis by ∼50%, without alteration of the total brain cholesterol levels (13.Xie C. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1780-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14.Lund E.G. Xie C. Kotti T. Turley S.D.

These mice did not have an obvious phenotype and were biochemically indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. One possible mechanism for elimination of brain cholesterol involves conversion of cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol by sterol 27-hydroxylase, which is similar to 24S-OH in that it is capable of traversing lipophilic membranes (15.Meaney S. Bodin K. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2130-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because we have been unable to demonstrate a net flux of 27-hydroxycholesterol from the human brain into the circulation (7.Lütjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Sidén Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), this mechanism is probably less important from a quantitative point of view. However, because 27-hydroxycholesterol may be metabolized to more polar products in the brain (16.Zhang J. Akwa Y. el-Etr M. Baulieu E.E. Sjövall J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we cannot yet exclude the possibility that there may be a net flux of a metabolite of 27-hydroxycholesterol from the brain. The human CYP46A1 enzyme has been characterized in some detail with respect to substrate specificity and enzymatic properties (10.Mast N. Norcross R. Andersson U. Shou M. Nakayama K. Björkhem I. Pikuleva I.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14284-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At present, however, there are very few data on the regulation of this enzyme. Studies performed when the CYP46A1 was originally cloned demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the CYP46A1 protein in the brain shortly after birth (9.Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Regulated spatiotemporal expression was observed in the Cyp46a1(–/–) mouse, which incorporated a β-galactosidase gene under the control of the endogenous transcriptional regulatory sequences in the Cyp46a1 gene (14.Lund E.G. Xie C. Kotti T. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22980-22988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In accordance with these reports, the levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation are markedly increased during the first months of human life (17.Lütjohann D. Björkhem I. Locatelli S. Dame C. Schmolling J. von Bergmann K. Fahnenstich H. Acta Paediatr. 2001; 90: 652-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, at the age of ∼1 year in humans (and 2–4 weeks in mouse) expression levels of the enzyme reach a steady state, which is maintained during adulthood (9.Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, the levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol are remarkably stable during human adulthood (7.Lütjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Sidén Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 18.Bretillon L. Lütjohann D. Ståhle L. Widhe T. Bindl L. Eggertsen G. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 840-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is, however, some evidence that the expression of CYP46A1 may be affected in the brain of patients with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease, where the gene displays an ectopic expression pattern. Although predominately confined to neurons in the healthy brain, CYP46A1 immunoreactivity has been detected in astrocytes of brain tissues from Alzheimer disease patients (11.Bogdanovic N. Bretillon L. Lund E.G. Diczfalusy U. Lannfelt L. Winblad B. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 314: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12.Brown 3rd, J. Theisler C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34674-34681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). With the exception of some limited studies exploring the liver-X-receptor axis (19.Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Collins J.L. Benson W.G. Stone T.M. Numerick M.J. Tippin T.K. Wilson J.G. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), no data have been presented on the regulation of CYP46A1 by nuclear receptors or hormones. The present study was initiated to define the basal characteristics of the human promoter of CYP46A1 and to investigate if different endogenous or exogenous compounds are able to significantly alter the transcriptional activity. Because the activity of this enzyme is likely to be of importance for cerebral cholesterol homeostasis, it was regarded to be of interest to study if there is a change in the expression of Cyp46A1 during the neonatal phase, in parallel with a rapid expansion of the cholesterol pool in the brain and also in a mouse model with markedly reduced levels of brain cholesterol. Materials—The GeneAmp High Fidelity PCR System is a product of Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). A TA Cloning kit was purchased from Invitrogen. TransFast™ Transfection Reagent, Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System, pGL3-Basic vector, and phRL-TK vector were from Promega (Madison, WI). Human Brain RACE-ready cDNA was from Ambion (Cambridgeshire, UK). SH-SY5Y, HepG2, and HEK293 cell lines were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Oligonucleotides for PCR and sequence analyses were obtained from Cyber Gene (Stockholm). All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Mouse with a Cholesterol Deficiency—Mice with an inactive Dhcr24 gene were generated and maintained as described in detail before (20.Wechsler A. Brafman A. Shafir M. Heverin M. Gottlieb H. Damari G.

Following the suckling period, the animals were provided with a commercial rodent diet (Harlan Teklad Rat/Mouse Diet) ad libitum. Sterol Analysis—Sterol concentrations were determined in the brain of 3-month-old mice as previously described (20.Wechsler A. Brafman A. Shafir M. Heverin M. Gottlieb H. Damari G. Gozlan-Kelner S.

Briefly, the brain tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized mechanically prior to extraction with chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v). Butylated hydroxytoluene (0.5 μg/mg tissue) was added at the time of extraction. To detect both free and esterified sterols a hydrolysis step was included in all cases. Cholesterol and desmosterol were analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry using [2H6]cholesterol as internal standard, whereas the concentration of lathosterol was analyzed by use of [2H3]lathosterol (25.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001Google Scholar). The following ions were monitored: [2H6]cholesterol, m/z 464; cholesterol, m/z 458; and desmosterol, m/z 456. Oxysterols in brain were determined by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry, essentially as described previously (21.Heverin M. Bogdanovic N. Lütjohann D. Bayer T. Pikuleva I. Bretillon L.

Quantification of mRNA Levels by Real-time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from the brains of the wild-type and knock-out mice with the Quick Prep™ Total RNA Extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences), DNase-treated using an RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (Qiagen Gmbh, Hilden, Germany), and quality-checked on a 2.2 m formaldehyde/MOPS 1.2% agarose gel. A maximum of 10 μg was reverse transcribed into cDNA with the SuperScript III RNase H′Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed in triplicate using 5 μl of a 1:10 dilution of each cDNA preparation (25 μl/well) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The primers used for the real-time PCR analysis are shown in Table 1. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by sequencing the PCR product. A final concentration of 250 nm of probes and 900 nm of primers was used for all fluorescence probe assays, whereas in SYBR Green assays a final concentration of 200 nm of primers was used. For all SYBR Green assays a melting curve was obtained to confirm that the signal corresponded to a unique amplification. The relative amount of target mRNA was quantified by singleplex real-time RT-PCR analysis using an ABI PRISMR 7000 Sequence Detection System, with hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase as the internal standard in all cases. Relative mRNA levels were calculated according to the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCT) method according to the manufacturer's instructions with all comparisons performed relative to the situation in the adult brain.TABLE 1Oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers used for quantitative real-time PCR analysisGeneForward (5′-3′)Reverse (5′-3′)ProbeApolipoprotein EGCAGGCGGAGCTCTTCCACCACTGGCGATGCATGTCSyBR GreenSREBP-1cGGAGCCATGGATTGCACATTGGCCCGGGAAGTCACTGTSyBR GreenCYP46TGTCATCGCTGGCTTTTCAGGACGATGGTAGTTGTGGTGATAGCTa5′-Blue 6-carboxyfluorescein.GGTGGGCCCTGCCTGACTCCb3′-4-(4′-dimethylaminophenenylazo)benzoic acid.HMG-CoA reductaseCCGGCAACAACAAGATCTGTGATGTACAGGATGGCGATGCATa5′-Blue 6-carboxyfluorescein.GTCGCTGCTCAGCACGTCCTCTTcTetramethylrhodamine.HMG-CoA synthaseCTCTGTCTATGGTTCCCTGGCTTCCAATCCTCTTCCCTGCCTa5′-Blue 6-carboxyfluorescein.GTCCTGGCACAGTACTCACCTCAGCAb3′-4-(4′-dimethylaminophenenylazo)benzoic acid.HPRTdHypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase.GGTGAAAAGGACCTCTCGAAGTGATAGTCAAGGGCATATCCAACAACACa5′-Blue 6-carboxyfluorescein.CAGACTTTGTTGGATTTGAAATTCCAGACAAb3′-4-(4′-dimethylaminophenenylazo)benzoic acid.a 5′-Blue 6-carboxyfluorescein.b 3′-4-(4′-dimethylaminophenenylazo)benzoic acid.c Tetramethylrhodamine.d Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase.

The default conservation settings of the MULAN and VISTA software (available online at www.dcode.org and gsd.lbl.gov/vista/index.shtml, respectively) were used to examine the regions of interest (22.Couronne O. Poliakov A. Bray N. Ishkhanov T. Ryaboy D. Rubin E. Pachter L. Dubchak I. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Selected sequences were further analyzed for the presence of putative regulatory elements (23.Loots G.G. Ovcharenko I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W217-W221Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) or promoter modules (24.Werner T. Mamm.

Analysis of Transcriptional Start Site—Human brain FirstChoice RACE-ready cDNA (Ambion), which is a library of brain cDNA with complete 5′-ends, was used for amplification of the 5′-end of CYP46 cDNA in two separate RACE experiments. Each experiment used a different combination of primer sets as per the manufacturer's instructions. One RACE experiment was done with the outer primer supplied by the manufacturer and primer R15 (for primers sequences, see Table 2), with a subsequent nested PCR using the kit inner primer and primer R11. The second experiment was conducted with the outer primer and primer R14, followed by the inner primer and reverse primer. A typical PCR reaction consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (58 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min), with a final extension (72 °C, 7 min) using GeneAmp High Fidelity PCR System supplemented with 5% Me2SO in the reaction buffer. The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered using a GenElute Agarose Spin Column. The DNA fragments were cloned into pCR 2.1 by T/A cloning and transformed into Escherichia coli, TOP10F'. A total of 32 clones were randomly selected from the two RACE experiments and the insert DNA were sequenced as described above.TABLE 2Sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in this studyNameSequence (5′ to 3′)PositionUsageF2gcagtctcccaacagatggaaac-2713aPosition indicates the distance of the 5′-end of the indicated primer from the translation start site (where + 1 refers A of ATG).CloningR11ggatgtgctagcggctg+100bThe location of the 5′-end of the primer.Cloning, RACER15cctccaacataagtttcactgc+661bThe location of the 5′-end of the primer.RACER14accgactcaggactcgtgacg+278bThe location of the 5′-end of the primer.RACERevgcacgaaggtgcagcagaggc+70bThe location of the 5′-end of the primer.RACEPA-F2actcgagtctcccaacagatggaaac-2711aPosition indicates the distance of the 5′-end of the indicated primer from the translation start site (where + 1 refers A of ATG).pGL3PA-1aggctcgagtagagatggggtttctccgtg-2102aPosition indicates the distance of the 5′-end of the indicated primer from the translation start site (where + 1 refers A of ATG).pGL3PA-F11ctcgagccctggtcattatttc-988aPosition indicates the distance of the 5′-end of the indicated primer from the translation start site (where + 1 refers A of ATG).pGL3PA-F12ctcgagatgccgttatttggagg-501aPosition indicates the distance of the 5′-end of the indicated primer from the translation start site (where + 1 refers A of ATG).pGL3PA-Rtaagcttagccgactcagctgtcag-65aPosition indicates the distance of the 5′-end of the indicated primer from the translation start site (where + 1 refers A of ATG).pGL3EXP-Fctagaagccaaggcagatgg+502bThe location of the 5′-end of the primer.Reverse transcription-PCREXP-Rctcgtgaccagcaatgaaga+915bThe location of the 5′-end of the primer.Reverse transcription-PCRa Position indicates the distance of the 5′-end of the indicated primer from the translation start site (where + 1 refers A of ATG).b The location of the 5′-end of the primer. Open table in a new tab Cloning of 5′-Upstream Region of Human CYP46 Gene—Standard methods for molecular biology were as described by Sambrook et al. (25.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001Google Scholar). The promoter region of human CYP46 gene was cloned from human genomic DNA (Applied Biosystems) using GeneAmp High Fidelity PCR System supplemented with 5% Me2SO in the reaction buffer. An initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min was followed by 35 cycles of denaturing (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (53 °C, 30 s), and extension (68 °C, 3 min). A final extension at 72 °C, 7 min was applied to ensure the introduction of A overhangs. A primer pair consisting of F2a and R11 (Table 2) was designed to amplify the region between –2713 and + 100 nucleotides of human CYP46 gene (GenBank™ accession number, AL160313; +1 refers to A of the initiating methionine). The amplified fragment was separated on an agarose gel, recovered using GenElute-Agarose Spin Column (Sigma) and subsequently cloned into pCR2.1 via T/A cloning. Nucleotide sequence of insert DNA was determined using a DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmid harboring a region between –2713 and + 100 nucleotides of the human CYP46 gene was designated p10–12. Expression of CYP46A1—Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using the One Step RNA PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc.) and the primers EXP-F and EXP-R. Human fetal and adult brain total RNA were included as a positive control. Reaction conditions were as follows: 52 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (53.8 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 1 min), with a final extension (72 °C, 10 min). Cell Culture—SH-SY5Y (a human neuroblastoma cell line derived from metastatic bone marrow) and HEK293 cells (transformed human embryonic kidney cells) were routinely cultured in minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acid mix (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Construction of Luciferase Vectors—Four fragments of the 5′-upstream region of the human CYP46 gene were amplified with upstream primers (see Table 2) containing an overhanging XhoI site (PA-F2a, PA-1, F11, and F12) and downstream primer overhanging HindIII site (PA-R) using the plasmid p10–12 as a template. PCR conditions were essentially as described above. The amplified fragments were subcloned into pCR 2.1, sequence-verified, and recloned into the XhoI and HindIII site of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). These plasmids were named pG-2700 (5′-end, –2711 bp), pG-2100 (–2102 bp), pG-1000 (–988 bp), and pG-500 (–510 bp), according to the positions 5′-end from the translation start site. pG-1300 (–1280 bp) was created by digestion of the pG-2700 with KpnI, followed by self-ligation of the fragment containing vector, because pG-2700 has two KpnI sites at –1280 bp and upstream of the introduced XhoI site in the multiple cloning site of the vector. Similarly, digestion and self-ligation for pG-1000 with SmaI produced pG-650 (–659 bp). MluI and SacI digestion and self-ligation for pGL-500 were used to create pGL-400 (–410 bp) and pGL-250 (–258 bp), respectively. All reporter constructs shared a common 3′-end 65 bp upstream of translation start site. A schematic drawing of the reporter constructs is shown in Fig. 7. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Plasmids for transfection were prepared using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen). Luciferase assay was performed using a Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) with phRL-TK vector as an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency. Transfection experiments were performed in 96-well culture plates, and luciferase activities were measured using a Victor 1420 Multilabel counter (Wallac). Briefly, 1 day before transfection, recipient cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2–6 × 104 cells/well. After removal of culture medium, the cells were cotransfected with 100 ng of reporter construct DNA and 20 ng of control plasmid (phRL-TK) per well using TransFast reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Three hours later, 200 μl of medium (or medium containing a test agent) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Luciferase activities were measured by the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. In the experiments testing effects of oxidative stress, the cells were transfected with use of 15 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen), 2.5 μgof pGL3 Enhancer plasmid, and 1 μg of phRL-TK vector. The cells were incubated in serum-free media at 37 °C for 3–5 h. The following agents were tested: 22R-hydroxycholesterol (1 and 10 μg/ml), 25-hydroxycholesterol (1 and 10 μg/ml), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (1 and 10 μg/ml), cholesterol (10 and 50 μg/ml), pravastatin (1 μg/ml), testosterone (100 nm), dexamethasone (100 nm), estradiol (100 nm), WY-14643 (50 nm), growth hormone (500 ng/ml), cortisol (1.4 μm), triiodothyronine (2.5 μm), insulin (0.1 IU/ml), rifampicin (12.4 nm), progesterone (0.1 μm), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (0.2 mm), lithocholic acid (25 μm), interleukin-6 (50 pg/ml), chenodeoxycholic acid (25 μm), and tert-butylhydroperoxide (0.05–5 μm).

We undertook an iterative computational and experimental investigation of the dynamic properties of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Surprisingly, we found that the temporal profile of the NF-κB activity is invariant to the TNFα dose. We reverse engineered a computational model of the signaling pathway to identify mechanisms that impart this important response characteristic, thus predicting that the IKK activity profile must transiently peak at all TNFα doses to generate the observed NF-κB dynamics. Experimental confirmation of this prediction emphasizes the importance of mechanisms that rapidly down-regulate IKK following TNFα activation. A refined computational model further revealed signaling characteristics that ensure robust TNFα-mediated cell-cell communication over considerable distances, allowing for fidelity of cellular inflammatory responses in infected tissue.

The transcription factor NF-κB 3The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, Inhibitor of NF-κB; IKK, IκB kinase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast. is a key mediator of physiologic processes such as inflammation and adaptive immunity and has been implicated in numerous pathologic states such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis (1Cheong R. Levchenko A. Meyers H.A. Encyclopedia of Molecular Cell Biology and Medicine. 14. John Wiley & Sons, New York2005: 437-472Google Scholar). Consequently, understanding the mechanisms of NF-κB activation and regulation is of prime importance. One major activator of NF-κB is the potent inflammatory cytokine TNFα. TNFα binds to and trimerizes its receptor, TNFR1, which leads to a receptor-associated signalosome that activates the kinase IKK (2Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). IKK phosphorylates IκB proteins, which normally sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm; phosphorylated IκBs are rapidly polyubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded, releasing free NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus and modulates gene expression (2Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Detailed biochemical and genetic analyses over the past 25 years have helped elucidate the components that connect TNFα to NF-κB. However, relatively little is known about how these molecular players act together as a signaling system, whose complex dynamics control the time-variable activity of NF-κB and subsequent gene expression (3Barken D.

Recently, it has become apparent that analysis of the systems properties of complex biochemical pathways can benefit from an integrated approach combining systematic experimental perturbations with an associated computational analysis of molecular interactions (5Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 7Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R.

A. 2003; 100: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This type of analysis applied to TNFα-induced NF-κB activity demonstrated that the α, β, and ϵ isoforms of IκB cooperate to produce a biphasic NF-κB response (5Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Varying the duration of the TNFα stimulus had no effect on the duration of the initial response, thus ensuring expression of some NF-κB-regulated genes even in response to very short stimuli (5Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). This analysis, however, did not address the question of how other types of signaling inputs are processed. In this study, we analyze in detail a different type of inputs, constant stimulations at different TNFα doses, and experimentally and computationally analyze the resulting pathway characteristics. Surprisingly, we found that both the duration and dose of TNFα stimulus have little effect on the duration of the initial NF-κB response and that NF-κB responds sensitively to an extremely wide range of TNFα concentrations. Analysis of a computational model of the pathway predicts that these signal transduction properties are crucially dependent on the transient nature of IKK activity. The experimental confirmation of this prediction underscores the importance of the mechanisms rapidly down-regulating IKK following its activation. Based on further model analysis, we suggest that the observed dynamic properties of IKK activity are well suited to offset limitations imposed by ligand diffusion, thereby ensuring robust TNFα-induced NF-κB activity in cells of infected tissues. Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—Immortalized 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine calf serum. Confluent, serum-starved (0.5% serum) cells were stimulated with murine TNFα (Roche Applied Science). In the experiments shown in Fig. 3B, cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma Chemicals) for 30 min prior to TNFα stimulation. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—After TNFα stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline + 1 mm EDTA, and were scraped and collected into a microcentrifuge tube and pelleted at 2000 × g. Cells (∼106) were resuspended in 100 μl of CE buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and vortexed for lysis. Nuclei were pelleted at 4000 × g, resuspended in 30 μl of NE Buffer (250 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Nuclear lysates were cleared by 14,000 × g centrifugation and the Bradford assay was used to determine protein concentrations, which rarely varied by more than 30% from sample to sample. Protein concentrations were normalized by diluting the more concentrated samples in NE buffer. 2.5 μl of these samples was reacted at room temperature for 15 min with 0.01 pmol of 32P-labeled 38-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two consensus κB sites (GCTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGG) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 μg/μl poly(dIdC)), for a total reaction volume of 6 μl. Complexes were resolved on a nondenaturing 5% acrylamide (30:0.8) gel containing 5% glycerol and 1× TGE (24.8 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA) and were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The gel images were quantitated by drawing and integrating, for each lane, equally sized boxes around the NF-κB-specific DNA-protein complex, around the background above it, and around the unbound probe. The unbound probe was at >20-fold excess and was used as a loading control by taking the value of the signal minus the background then dividing by the unbound probe value. The resulting specific electrophoretic mobility shift assay signal was multiplied by 1000 or some constant to provide convenient arbitrary units. IKK Kinase Assay—After TNFα stimulation, cytoplasmic extracts were isolated from cells as described above using 200 μl of IKK CE buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Tween 20, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) and were normalized via Bradford assay. Cytoplasmic extracts (100 μl) were incubated with 1 μg of IKKγ monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 2 h at 4°C and then with protein G-agarose-conjugated beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with IKK CE Buffer twice and kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) once, the beads were incubated with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm adenosine 5′-ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 0.5 μg of bacterially expressed GST-IκBα (1-54) substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and was visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager. To normalize kinase activities, a portion of the SDS gel (175-50 kDa) was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Amersham Biosciences) and probed for IKKα (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) using standard immunoblotting techniques. Canonical NF-κB Pathway Model—The basic model (ordinary differential equations, pre-equilibration initial conditions, and parameter values) has been published previously (5Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The model was implemented in Cellerator 1.033 (14Shapiro B.E. Levchenko A. Meyerowitz E.M. Wold B.J. Mjolsness E.D. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Mathematica 4.2 and 5.0 (Wolfram Research). Some parameter values were modified according to Lipniacki et al. (15Lipniacki T. Paszek P. Brasier A.R. Luxon B. Kimmel M. J. Theor. Biol. 2004; 228: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) (see section 1.3 of the supplemental information). For input reconstruction, we assumed an activation rate of the form shown in Equation 1 and a constant inactivation rate. We also assumed that changes in TNFα concentration uniformly and directly affect the activation rate function. The parameter space was exhaustively sampled within biochemically plausible ranges (10-3 ≤ kinit ≤ 10-1 μm/min, 100.25 ≤ kinit/kfinal ≤ 102, 5 ≤ τ ≤ 30 min, 10-2 ≤ kinact ≤ 101 min-1), and results were filtered for resemblance to Fig. 1B, resulting in a unique set of parameters among those tested. See section 2 of the supplemental information for details. TNFα Diffusion Simulation—Denoting C = [TNFα], then the spatiotemporal distribution C(t, r) of TNFα, considering only the processes of diffusion and first-order degradation, is determined by the mass transfer equation ∂C/∂t = D▿2C - kC. We assumed the diffusion constant D = 2 × 10-7 cm2/s, in line with estimates for diffusible factors of similar size (16Francis K. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12258-12262Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Goodhill G.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The parameter k = 0.0275 min-1, corresponding to a half-life of 25 min, and represents loss of TNFα because of degradation and adherence to extracellular matrix proteins. TNFα secretion was modeled as a spherically symmetric flux of TNFα from a sphere of radius 10 μm, with the flux magnitude set so that the concentration at the source surface was ∼10 ng/ml. With respect to time, TNFα secretion was modeled as a rectangular pulse of a 10-min duration. Finally, we imposed the boundary condition that C → 0 as r → ∞. The simulation was performed in Femlab 3.1 (Comsol, Burlington, MA). Simulations were run for different values of D, k, pulse length, and flux magnitude, which did not qualitatively affect any of the conclusions reported in the body of the paper. See section 3 of the supplemental information for extrapolation of the IKK response to arbitrary TNFα time courses. NF-κB Is Sensitive to a Wide Range of TNFα Concentrations—To investigate the response of NF-κB to different TNFα doses, we exposed MEFs to TNFα over a concentration range spanning three orders of magnitude (0.01-10 ng/ml). NF-κB in these experiments was found to respond robustly and sensitively throughout this range, including the lowest dose of TNFα, as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 1A). This experiment, in which the duration of TNFα stimulation is held fixed (chronic) while altering the amplitude, complements our previous work in which the amplitude of TNFα was held fixed (10 ng/ml) while the duration was altered (5Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in both cases, cells show a stereotypical response of an initial peak of NF-κB activity lasting 60-75 min (Fig. 1B). These results show that the NF-κB pathway is sensitive to a wide range of TNFα concentrations, which may help ensure a response to local TNFα signals in innate immune responses (see below). Transient IKK Activity Generates Observed Dynamics in the Computational Model—To investigate the molecular basis underlying the robust dynamics of NF-κB activation, we attempted to recapitulate the dose response in our computational model of the NF-κB pathway. The model included detailed interactions between IKK, IκB, and NF-κB, and reflecting contemporary uncertainty about the mechanisms of IKK regulation (18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3309) Google Scholar), assumed an exponential decay curve for IKK during chronic TNFα stimulation. The model was previously validated for TNFα doses of 10 ng/ml, so to simulate lower TNFα concentrations we decreased the initial level of IKK. However, our simulation results did not adequately fit the measured responses as even a 10-fold reduction in IKK greatly delayed the onset of predicted NF-κB activity (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the model requires modification to recapitulate the experiment. As a control, we first addressed whether the discrepancy between model prediction and experiment is because of a simple misestimation of rate constants described by the parameters in the model. Out of 10,000 parameter sets generated by random sampling within ± 2 orders of the nominal values, none fit the dose response while maintaining previously validated properties of the model (5Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Sampling parameters in a way biased toward producing a fit, such as with evolutionary algorithms (19Banzhaf W. Genetic Programming: an Introduction on the Automatic Evolution of Computer Programs and Its Applications. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, CA1998Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), also generated no fits. The results obtained by these naïve sampling methods were then confirmed by rational analysis of the model. Systematic dissection of how parameters influence key conserved features of the NF-κB temporal profile (peak timing and amplitude) revealed two independent effects, neither of which could be employed to reconcile the model and experiment without sacrificing previously validated properties of the model (see supplemental information, section 1). This rules out simple misestimation in parameter values as the source of discrepancy and suggests that the model should be extended to more fully describe the signaling pathway (20von Dassow G. Meir E. Munro E.M. Odell G.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Because the model has successfully recapitulated several dynamic properties of the pathway (5Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), we surmised that the core model is essentially correct but that interactions with external components should be re-evaluated. One such component is the dynamic profile of IKK activity in response to TNFα stimulation, which serves as the input for the core model of the IκB-NF-κB signaling module (Fig. 2B). Thus we used the computational model to identify the temporal profiles of IKK activity that produce the observed NF-κB dynamics, essentially reverse engineering the input from the known output. To screen for IKK profiles that could produce the NF-κB response, we created a generator of IKK temporal profiles and linked the generator to the model. This is shown schematically in Fig. 2B. Active IKK is generated through new protein synthesis or by activation from an inactive state according to some time-varying activation rate, then removed by protein degradation or inactivation according to some time-varying inactivation rate (Fig. 2B, gray box). One or both of these steps may be dependent on TNF receptor activation by TNFα. Additionally, IKK provides input into the core model (Fig. 2B, yellow box) by interacting with IκB, whose negative feedback to NF-κB is the central feature of the core model. With the IKK profile generator written in this general form, our task is to identify activation and inactivation rate functions that produce the observed NF-κB dynamics. When both functions are temporally constant, no pair of rates can reproduce the response to high TNFα (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the regulation of IKK activity is nonlinear. To understand the nature of this nonlinearity, we examined the distribution of constant rates for which either the peak (Fig. 2C, dark gray) or the trough fit (Fig. 2C, light gray). Because all TNFα doses produce NF-κB temporal profiles that contain a peak between 15 and 45 min followed by a trough between 60 and 90 min (Fig. 1B), we concluded that the IKK activation rate may begin in the regime where the peak fits then decrease in time to the regime where the trough fits (as if to follow the arrow in Fig. 2C). To test this possibility, we assumed a simple functional form (Equation 1) for an activation rate that decreases exponentially from a high initial value (kinit) to low final value (kfinal) in about time τ, while holding the inactivation rate (kinact) constant as seen here. fact(t)=(kinit−kfinal)(kinit/kfinal)−t/τ+kfinal(Eq. 1) This functional form, combined with a simple method for representing different TNFα concentrations (see “Materials and Methods”), allowed us to fully specify the IKK profile in response to a range of TNFα with only four parameters. An exhaustive grid-based search of the parameter space (see supplemental information, section 2) uncovered exactly one parameter set out of 5615 tested that reproduces the response to different TNFα concentrations while maintaining previously validated properties of the model, suggesting that the observed output can only be produced by a very specific IKK activity profile. The activation rate functions thus identified (Fig. 2D) produce transient IKK activity at all TNFα doses (Fig. 2E) and result in NF-κB profiles (Fig. 2F) whose initial duration is fixed but whose amplitude varies with TNFα concentration, as desired. Thus, the model strongly suggests that the IKK activity profile has to be transient at all TNFα doses. Predicted Transient IKK Activity Profile Is Verified Experimentally—The model-based reconstruction of IKK activity gives rise to an experimentally testable prediction: in response to a wide range of TNFα concentrations, IKK activity should peak at around 10 min and decrease over the next 20 min to a low level above basal activity (Fig. 2E). To further gauge the strength of this prediction, we chose other activation and inactivation rate functions to systematically test similarly shaped IKK profiles but with different peak timings and peak widths. The results showed that the specific profiles in Fig. 2E gave a near optimal fit with the experimentally measured NF-κB time courses (data not shown). Therefore, the dynamics of IKK activity are highly constrained. To validate this prediction, we measured the actual IKK activity in MEFs (Fig. 3A), revealing a very close agreement with the model predictions, especially in terms of the timing of the activation peak. Also, consistent with the idea that the IKK profile is highly constrained, IKK profiles display similar shape and timing when measured in multiple other cell types at 10 ng/ml TNFα or higher (21Aupperle K.R.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), although the significance of these IKK kinetics was not previously interpreted. The unexpected insight provided by our model, validated experimentally, is that a rapid decrease in IKK activity is required to explain the dependence of the amplitude, duration, and timing of the initial peak of NF-κB activity in response to a wide range of TNFα concentrations. Given the requirement for fast IKK down-regulation in eliciting NF-κB activity in response to TNFα, we considered the question of what biochemical mechanisms could mediate it. The computational model does not strongly constrain the mechanism, because the activation and inactivation rate functions can be coordinately changed (equivalent to different biochemical mechanisms) without changing the overall IKK activity profile, resulting in the same NF-κB dynamics (data not shown). Instead, we considered this question in the context of known IKK inhibitors. One possible mediator of IKK down-regulation is A20, an inhibitor of RIP (27Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar), which is transcriptionally up-regulated by NF-κB within 30 min (6Zhou A. Scoggin S. Gaynor R.B. Williams N.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), thus potentially forming a negative feedback loop. We explored whether, as previously suggested (15Lipniacki T. Paszek P. Brasier A.R. Luxon B. Kimmel M. J. Theor. Biol. 2004; 228: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), A20 is essential for the control of dynamics of early IKK and NF-κB activation. However, IKK activity is down-regulated at 30 min following onset of stimulation even with very low concentrations of TNFα making it unlikely that feedback via A20 is solely responsible for regulating the dynamics of the IKK activity profile. Consistent with this, in cells exposed to cycloheximide, an inhibitor of new protein synthesis, IKK activity is still high at 10 min and low at 60 min (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, IKK activity in A20-deficient cells still shows a peak at around 10 min, although attenuation at later times is defective (24Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 28Werner S. Barken D. Hoffmann A. Science. 2005; 309: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We also considered that if A20 negative feedback was solely responsible for early down-regulation of IKK, it would be difficult to infer IKK activity profiles from the NF-κB activity profile, as feedbacks generally preclude one-to-one input-output mapping. Although NF-κB-regulated IKK inhibitors like A20 may play a late role in IKK regulation, our results suggest that early IKK inhibition is likely not mediated by NF-κB up-regulation of A20 or similar feedback mechanism. High Sensitivity of NF-κBtoTNFα May Provide Robust Signaling at a Distance—Finally, we attempted to understand the dynamic properties of the pathway in a physiologic context. The primary physiologic function of TNFα is to mediate innate immune responses in response to infection (29Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1992; 200: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The effects of TNFα are local as enforced by multiple mechanisms. TNFα expression by pathogen-activated macrophages is brief and self-limited, because phagocytosis of pathogens rapidly removes the inciting stimulus, and prolonged exposure to TNFα can both lead to quick apoptosis of TNFα-secreting macrophages (30Xaus J. Comalada M. Valledor A.F. Lloberas J. Lopez-Soriano F. Argiles J.M. Bogdan C. Celada A. Blood. 2000; 95: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inappropriately induce systemic responses (31Blander J.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2004; 304: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 32Klein R.D. Su G.L. Schmidt C. Aminlari A. Steinstraesser L. Alarcon W.H. Zhang H.Y. Wang S.C. J. Surg. Res. 2000; 94: 159-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several postinduction repression and autocrine inhibition mechanisms have been described for TNFα expression (33Baer M. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Sedon C. Nedospasov S. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5678-5689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both TNFα mRNA and secreted protein have a short half-life (34Beutler B.A. Milsark I.W. Cerami A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3972-3977PubMed Google Scholar, 35Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 38: 241-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Stoecklin G. Lu M. Rattenbacher B. Moroni C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3506-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). At the same time, the affinity of TNF to its receptors is similar to its affinity to extracellular matrix proteins (37Alon R. Cahalon L. Hershkoviz R. Elbaz D. Reizis B. Wallach D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Lider O. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1304-1313PubMed Google Scholar) and the molecular mass of TNFα is high (51 kDa as active trimer), impeding diffusion and increasing buffering through nonspecific binding. All of these mechanisms serve to limit the effects of TNFα to a local tissue environment. To model the local spread of TNFα in an infected tissue in a way consistent with the above, we considered the simple scenario in which a TNFα-secreting cell (or cluster of cells) produces a transient pulse of TNFα, which then diffuses into the surroundings, where it is subject to degradation and buffering. The real tissue environment is intricate and probably involves the presence of additional cytokines and more complex spatiotemporal patterns of TNFα secretion, but these simplifying assumptions can be viewed as a limiting case designed to investigate whether weak TNFα signaling can still be effective. Our simulations show that in this scenario nearby cells would experience a pulse of TNFα whose duration and amplitude both decrease rapidly with distance (Fig. 4, A and B, supplemental movie S1). We then considered how target cells might respond to such local changes in TNFα concentration by coupling the TNFα diffusion simulation (Fig. 4A) to the NF-κB pathway model (Fig. 2B). At various distances from the model TNFα source cell (e.g. a macrophage), we determined the local kinetic TNFα profiles due to diffusive spread and related them to the corresponding IKK activities (supplemental information, Section 3) and the resulting outputs of the NF-κB pathway. The simulations reveal that the NF-κB response amplitude (Fig. 4C) depends linearly on the distance from the TNFα source, whereas the duration of the response remains approximately constant (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, this qualitative behavior does not depend on the precise concentration or duration of the TNFα pulse (Fig. 4, C and D), nor on precise value of diffusivity or degradation rate/buffering strength (not shown). Rather, this signaling behavior is essentially because of the exponential drop of the maximum TNFα concentration with distance (Fig. 4B) coupled with logarithmic variation of the maximum NF-κB activity with TNFα input (Fig. 1B), and the remarkable independence of the duration of the initial NF-κB response on both the duration and the amplitude of the TNFα stimulus. Importantly, the duration of NF-κB activity remains approximately constant even at distances (∼500 μm) where the activity amplitude becomes negligible (Fig. 4, C and D). In comparison, the theoretical limit for cell-cell signaling has been estimated to be a few hundred microns (16Francis K. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12258-12262Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that one function of the dynamic properties of the IKK/NF-κB pathway illuminated in this study is to provide a reliable and immediate response to TNFα even at limiting distances in infected tissue. Here we undertook an iterative computational and experimental study of the dynamics of NF-κB in response to different TNFα doses. We present experimental data that show that NF-κB responds sensitively to TNFα over a concentration range of three orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the duration of the initial response is constant with respect to TNFα dose, a dynamic property without an obvious mechanistic or teleologic explanation. Computational modeling of NF-κB signaling helped suggest both the mechanistic basis and possible physiologic significance of the dynamic properties of the pathway. We found, by reconstructing the input into the IκB-NF-κB module, that one property mechanistically required for the observed NF-κB activity profiles is highly transient IKK activity with a peak at around 10 min following TNFα stimulation at different doses. Such reverse engineering may be useful in investigating other systems, but it is often difficult because of nonlinearities present in signaling systems and the large number of permissible input functions (38Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). We overcame these obstacles by starting with a simple linear case and using the results to guide the choice of nonlinear assumptions as well as by keeping the parameter space small to allow for exhaustive testing of all reasonable possibilities. Systematic perturbation of the revised model then indicated that the IKK activity was highly constrained by the observed output and this strong prediction was confirmed by kinase assays of IKKβ activity. The molecular mechanism for fast inactivation of IKK remains mysterious. It is unlikely that postinduction attenuation of IKK activity is solely dependent on NF-κB-regulated IKK inhibitors like A20. Other IKK inhibitors like PP2Cβ, PP2A, CYLD, hTid-1, and Hsp70 might be involved (25Prajapati S. Verma U. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol.

Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), or regulation of the conformational state of IKKβ via hyperautophosphorylation of its C terminus could lead to IKK inactivation (22Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Importantly, the disruption of the C-terminal sites in IKKβ leads to persistently active IKK upon stimulation (22Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), suggesting inhibitory autophosphorylation as the major source of fast IKK down-regulation. High basal activity of IKK phosphorylation mutants prohibited us from easily testing this mechanism (22Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) but highlights the need for additional study into the mechanisms of IKK regulation. The computational model also suggested how the characteristic NF-κB pathway dynamics might facilitate innate immunity in tissues during infection. TNFα may be secreted by a cell or a small cluster of cells (e.g. macrophages) thereby signaling to target cells located nearby. TNFα is a poor signaling agent because it is secreted briefly at low levels and diffuses slowly, but our results paint an intuitively appealing picture of why the local action of TNFα in innate immunity, acting through activation of NF-κB, can be both robust and efficient. TNFα can effectively activate NF-κB for prolonged periods in cells, possibly to ensure efficient triggering of gene transcription, even at near-limiting distances. The spatially graded nature of the response amplitude (Fig. 4E) also may ensure that cells respond commensurate with their distance from the source of danger (9Matzinger P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), which could provide an economical result in which every responsive cell is neither excessively nor inadequately stimulated. These dynamic properties, in combination with information provided by other extracellular cues, could help prime and coordinate tissue responses to local infection. As such, IKK regulatory mechanisms may represent sensitive clinical targets in diseases with aberrant innate immune system activity. Download .zip (.23 MB) Help with zip files"
https://openalex.org/W2079659761,"We report here the x-ray structure of a covalent serpin-proteinase complex, α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) with porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), which differs from the only other x-ray structure of such a complex, that of α1PI with trypsin, in showing nearly complete definition of the proteinase. α1PI complexes with trypsin, PPE, and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) showed similar rates of deacylation and enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis by exogenous proteinases in solution. The differences between the two x-ray structures therefore cannot arise from intrinsic differences in the inhibition mechanism. However, self-proteolysis of purified complex resulted in rapid cleavage of the trypsin complex, slower cleavage of the PPE complex, and only minimal cleavage of the HNE complex. This suggests that the earlier α1 PI-trypsin complex may have been proteolyzed and that the present structure is more likely to be representative of serpin-proteinase complexes. The present structure shows that active site distortion alone is sufficient for inhibition and suggests that enhanced proteolysis is not necessarily exploited in vivo.

The present structure shows that active site distortion alone is sufficient for inhibition and suggests that enhanced proteolysis is not necessarily exploited in vivo. Over the last 10 years, many of the details of the remarkable conformational change-based serpin inhibition mechanism have been worked out (1Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The proteinase initially recognizes the serpin as a potential substrate using residues in the reactive center loop (RCL), 2The abbreviations used are: RCL, reactive center loop; α1PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; HNE, human neutrophil elastase; PPE, porcine pancreatic elastase; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone. and, in some cases, additional exosite interactions. This initial Michaelis-like complex forms without major conformational change in either serpin or proteinase. This is borne out by five x-ray structures of such complexes formed using inactivated proteinase to prevent further reaction (2Ye S. Cech A.L. Belmares R. Bergstrom R.C. Tong Y. Corey D.R. Kanost M.

Biol. 2004; 11: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). When functional proteinases are used, however, cleavage of the scissile bond of the serpin occurs with cleavage of the RCL and formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate (7Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This cleavage removes the constraints that hold the RCL out from the serpin body and allows the cleaved RCL to insert into β-sheet A of the serpin, dragging the proteinase with it and moving it over 70 Å to the distal end of the serpin (8Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The length of the RCL available to insert into the β-sheet is tightly linked to the length of the β-sheet, such that full insertion results in steric clashes between serpin and proteinase at the interface, which appear to be resolved by extraction of the P1 side chain from the S1 pocket of the proteinase (9Futamura A. Stratikos E. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13110-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and consequent displacement of the covalently attached active site Ser-195 by ∼6 Å from its catalytic partner His-57 (10Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). This separation of the two key catalytic residues provides a very plausible explanation for the loss of catalytic function in the covalent complex and, hence, an explanation for the mechanism whereby serpins inhibit serine proteinases by kinetically trapping the acyl intermediate of the substrate cleavage reaction.

Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The structure confirms the expectations of active site distortion and steric compression between serpin and proteinase and provides the quantitation of the movements of the catalytic residues and the serpin substrate noted above. What was quite unexpected was that 37% of the proteinase was crystallographically disordered. This was interpreted as the structural manifestation of the altered biochemical properties of serpin-complexed proteinases that have been known for many years. These alterations include increased susceptibility of complexed proteinase to proteolysis and a reduction in overall proteinase stability (16Hervé M. Ghélis C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Fish W.W. Orre K. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Cooperman B.S.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that such apparent “partial denaturation” of the proteinase in the x-ray structure is an integral part of the inhibition process and might provide a means for degradation and clearance in vivo (10Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Given the remarkable and unexpected loss of ordered structure for a major part of the proteinase in the crystal structure of the α1PI-trypsin complex and the suggestion that this is part of the inhibition process, it is essential to test whether it is indeed a common aspect of the mechanism and therefore to determine the x-ray structure of a second such complex for comparison. We report here such a structure, formed between the same serpin, α1PI, and PPE, a proteinase closer than trypsin in specificity to the natural target HNE. We find no evidence for partial denaturation of the elastase, even though the biochemical properties of the proteinase are altered in equivalent ways to trypsin or HNE in complex with α1PI. Our structural and biochemical findings, taken together, suggest that the present structure of α1PI with PPE is more likely to be representative of the serpin-proteinase complex than that published previously of α1PI with trypsin. Protein Isolation and Purification—The His-tagged multi-8 variant of α1PI, containing seven stabilizing mutations (23Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), C232S (24Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11884-11892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and an R101H mutation, which randomly appeared during cloning, was expressed and purified as described previously (15Dobó J. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9264-9269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The His tag was not removed but has been found not to alter the inhibitory properties of the serpin. PPE and HNE were from Calbiochem. Bovine pancreatic trypsin was from Sigma. The covalent complex of α1PI and PPE was made and purified by chromatofocusing as previously reported (15Dobó J. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9264-9269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with some modifications, namely inclusion of 5 μm methoxy-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloro-methyl-ketone (MS-AAPV-CMK, Sigma) in all chromatography buffers to minimize complex degradation and a subsequent gel filtration step to remove residual polybuffer following the chromatofocusing column. The complex was concentrated to 2 ml, applied to a 24-ml Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 μm MS-AAPV-CMK, and eluted with the same buffer. Fractions containing pure complex were combined, 400 μm final concentration MS-AAPV-CMK and 1% (by weight) α1PI were added to prevent any degradation by liberated proteinase, and the protein was concentrated to 12 mg/ml final concentration and stored at -80 °C in aliquots. Crystallization and Data Collection—α1PI-PPE covalent complex was crystallized from hanging drops containing 2 μl of protein (12.6 mg/ml) and 2 μl of reservoir solution (0.2 m bicine buffer, pH 8.1, 60 mm sodium citrate, 16-18% polyethylene glycol-3350). Small crystals appeared within 4-5 days at 18 °C. Several cycles of microseeding gave better quality crystals with an average size of 50 × 50 × 200 μm. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K from a single flash-frozen crystal cryoprotected in oil on a Mar CCD-300 detector at the SER-CAT beam-line (Advanced Proton Source, Argonne National Laboratory). Data were indexed and processed with the HKL 2000 software suite (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The crystal diffracted up to 3.3 Å and contained one molecule of complex/asymmetric unit (Table 1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using CNS (26Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Initial phases were determined by Patterson search, with the structures of native PPE (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1H9L) and cleaved α1PI from the covalent complex with trypsin (PDB entry 1EZX) as search models. The final model of the complex was obtained after multiple cycles of refinement consisting of a manual model building on an SGI Silicon Graphics work station with Quanta 2000 software followed by annealing and minimization steps using crystallography NMR software. Crystallographic statistics are given in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab Determination of Dissociation Rates—All covalent complexes were made and purified analogously to α1PI-PPE, except that no inhibitors were added and the gel filtration step was omitted. The purified complexes were concentrated to 0.5-3 mg/ml in ultrafiltration cells fitted with 30-kDa cutoff membranes and stored at -80 °C prior to use. The assay was performed in 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol-8000 at 37 °C at a final protein concentration of 10-200 nm and substrate concentration of 200 μm. Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA (Calbiochem) was used as a substrate in the assay for α1PI-PPE and α1PI-HNE complexes and H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (DiaPharma) for the α1PI-trypsin complex. Complex dissociation was monitored continuously for 1-12 h using the increase in absorbance at 410 nm. The progress curve was fitted using the equation: At = Ao + vo × t + ½ × TN × kdiss × [C] × t2, where At and Ao are the absorbances at time t and zero, respectively, vo is the initial rate of absorbance change, kdiss is the apparent first order rate constant of complex dissociation, [C] is the concentration of the complex, and TN is the turnover number determined by assaying free proteinase from the slope of the curve relating the rate of absorbance change to the proteinase concentration. The coefficient of the t2 term was calculated by computer fitting of progress curves. Dissociation constants were calculated by plotting these fitted coefficients as a function of serpin-proteinase concentration followed by multiplying the linear least squares slopes of these plots by 2/TN. Limited Proteolysis—Purified serpin-proteinase complexes, at final concentrations of 4-8 μm, were incubated with TPCK-treated trypsin, subtilisin Carlsberg, and V8 proteinase at concentrations of 0.1-3 μm. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for various time periods in a buffer of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl. Aliquots taken for SDS-PAGE analysis were reduced at 80 °C for 2 min in loading buffer with 2% (v/v) mercaptoethanol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The different forms of α1PI and free PPE and HNE were treated by proteinase under the same conditions. Complex Stability—The purified serpin-proteinase complexes at final concentrations of 10-20 μm in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl were incubated at room temperature for time periods indicated in each experiment, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis as described above. Crystallization and Structure of the α1PI-Elastase Complex—α1PI-PPE complex was purified and crystallized as described under “Materials and Methods.” Crystals grown for different periods of time under the same conditions were dissolved in sample buffer and examined by SDS-PAGE for evidence of complex degradation. After 11 days, a small amount of complex cleavage could be seen (∼5%), whereas after 16 days, as much as 20% appeared to have been cleaved. Data collection was therefore restricted to crystals grown for no more than 9 days to minimize heterogeneity in the crystal resulting from traces of cleaved complex. With this limitation, it was possible to obtain diffraction data to 3.3 Å that were 97.8% complete and to determine a structure for the complex using molecular replacement. To avoid model bias, the starting model for the cycles of rebuilding and refinement had 43 residues of the proteinase and 81 residues of the serpin removed, including loops on the serpin and proteinase that were likely to be in contact with one another as well as the serpin RCL and the proteinase loop containing the active site Ser-195. After 25 cycles of refinement, a final structure was obtained (Fig. 1) with Rwork of 0.25 and Rfree of 0.31 (Table 1). In overall organization, the structure resembles that determined previously for α1PI-trypsin by both fluorescence resonance energy transfer (8Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (10Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), with the RCL fully inserted into β-sheet A and the attached proteinase translocated to the distal end of the serpin, where it is held tightly against the serpin body by the RCL tether. The serpin moiety is almost identical to that of cleaved α1PI, with root mean square deviation for all Cα of only 0.85 Å. The location of the proteinase is very similar, although not identical, to that of trypsin in the α1PI-trypsin complex, with the elastase rotated ∼40° clockwise about an axis running along the inserted RCL and viewed from the serpin toward the proteinase. In the elastase-active site, there is clear density for Ser-195 and His-57 and clear evidence that the acyl group of the cleaved RCL is in an ester linkage with the γ-O of Ser-195, that the P1 methionine has been removed from the elastase S1 pocket, and that the Ser γ-O is ∼6 Å away from the ring Nϵ-2 nitrogen of His-57 (Fig. 2). The oxyanion hole, formed by backbone amides of residues 193 and 195, is disrupted, with the nitrogens moved 3.4 and 2.8 Å, respectively, compared with free elastase and with the Asp-194 Cα displaced by 2.6 Å. These findings are as expected from the inhibition mechanism in that they show the same type of active site distortion as in the α1PI-trypsin structure and hence provide a structural basis for kinetic trapping of the complex.FIGURE 2Electron density map for the catalytic residues of the complexed elastase and the α1PI P1 methionine (stereo). Continuous density links the backbone of the methionine 358 to the γO of Ser-195, indicating the presence of a covalent ester linkage between the serpin and the proteinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The major difference between the present complex and that of α1PI-trypsin is that almost all of the proteinase is ordered and gives rise to well defined electron density. Of the secondary structural elements that make up 45% of the native elastase structure, all are visible in elastase in complex. Of the remaining turns and loops, only residues 142-149, 186-190, and the N-terminal 4 residues cannot be defined. The 142-149 loop is likely to be involved in the interface with α1PI, whereas the stretch from 186 to 190 is much more buried and is close to the active site, suggesting some very limited disorder induced by complex formation. An overlay of the structures of free and complexed elastase (Fig. 3A) also clearly demonstrates the absence of major conformational change upon complex formation for almost the whole protein, with root mean square deviation for all defined Cα of 1.0 Å. The only exception is the surface loop 218-225, which is slightly displaced relative to free elastase, with the Cα differences ranging from 1.4 to 3.5 Å. This may result from distortions in the active site being propagated to this loop via the linking disulfide between Cys-191, adjacent to oxyanion hole-forming Gly-193, and Cys-220 in the surface loop. In contrast to the well defined structure of complexed elastase, the structure of trypsin complexed with α1PI is missing not only surface loops but about one-third of the secondary structure. Because both elastase and trypsin have the same chymotrypsin fold, an overlay of the structures of complexed elastase and trypsin serves well to visualize the differences between them (Fig. 3B). That there is no fundamental difference in the degree of ordering for that part of elastase that is undefined in the α1PI-trypsin complex is shown by the poor correlation with B-factor values for those regions (Fig. 4). Although the B-factors for the present complex are much higher than for free elastase (Fig. 4), they are similar in magnitude to those found for the α1PI-trypsin complex. Thus, the average B factor value for complexed elastase is 58 Å2, whereas for the defined part of complexed trypsin it is 60 Å2. Deacylation Rates of α1PI-Proteinase Complexes—Rates of deacylation were determined under physiological conditions for complexes of α1PI with trypsin, PPE, and HNE as described under “Materials and Methods.” The rates of deacylation were all very low, as expected for complexes that are sufficiently long-lived to be crystallized, and were similar to those reported previously for the α1PI-trypsin complex (27Calugaru S.V. Swanson R. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32446-32455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although there was some variation in deacylation rate for the three complexes (Table 2), this represented a difference of less than a factor of two between α1PI-PPE and either α1PI-trypsin or α1PI-HNE.TABLE 2Rate constants for dissociation of α1 PI-proteinase complexesComplexKdisst½s−aValues are the average and spread of duplicate measurements.daysα1PI-PPE3.8 ± 0.3 × 10−721α1PI-HNE2.9 ± 0.3 × 10−728α1PI-trypsin5.3 ± 0.6 × 10−715a Values are the average and spread of duplicate measurements. Open table in a new tab Proteolytic Susceptibility of α1PI-Proteinase Complexes—We next examined whether there were differences in the enhancements in proteolytic susceptibility of the three proteinases in complex with α1PI. Each of the three purified serpin-proteinase complexes was incubated separately with proteinases of different specificity (trypsin, subtilisin Carlsberg, and V8 proteinase). Compared with the susceptibility to proteolysis of the uncomplexed proteinases, each of the three complexed proteinases showed similar greatly enhanced reactivity. Trypsin cleavage was the most extensive (Fig. 5), followed by subtilisin cleavage, and then relatively little cleavage by V8 proteinase (data not shown). Importantly, each of the complexed proteinases behaved similarly toward each of the three proteinase probes. Complex formation thus appears to have qualitatively similar effects on the structures of each proteinase that renders some regions more reactive to exogenously added proteinase. Self-proteolysis of α1PI-Proteinase Complexes—A separate question that was addressed was whether the proteinase released by deacylation of a given complex would cause degradation. Because each complex would give rise to a different proteinase (trypsin, PPE, or HNE), this is a different question from that addressed above but one with important practical consequences for crystallization studies, where maintenance of complex homogeneity through prevention of self-proteolysis is critical. Each complex was incubated at room temperature, with samples removed after different times and examined by SDS-PAGE for evidence of complex degradation. The three complexes showed dramatic differences. The trypsin complex showed nearly complete cleavage of the complexed proteinase after even 1 day (Fig. 6). The PPE complex also showed cleavage of the complexed proteinase, although this was much less than for the trypsin complex, with only 50% of the complex cleaved after 1 day (Fig. 6). In contrast, the HNE complex showed minimal degradation over the 2-day period. Given that each complex undergoes deacylation at similar rates (Table 2), the amount of proteinase released and available for cleavage of complex should have been a similarly small amount in each case. Thus, the differences for the three complexes must represent a combination of different proteinase specificities for trypsin, PPE, and HNE and different available sequences within the regions of enhanced proteolytic susceptibility. The presence of cleaved complex for PPE was in keeping with what we found above in examining PPE-α1PI crystals grown for different periods of time. There was, however, a time period during which crystals were of sufficient size to use for data collection without being so old that major cleavage of the complex had occurred. In contrast, the greater rate of degradation for the trypsin complex suggests that it might be very difficult to obtain crystals of the trypsin-α1PI complex without incurring significant cleavage, even though the pH used in the earlier study (7.4) was a little lower than that used here for crystal growth (8.1). The structure presented here of the covalent complex of α1PI with PPE is only the second of a serpin with a target proteinase. It shows many features in common with the first structure of α1PI with bovine trypsin, including full insertion of the cleaved RCL and concomitant translocation of the proteinase to the distal end of the serpin, a tight interface between serpin and proteinase, and a distortion of residues in the active site that can alone account for the kinetic trapping of the acyl-enzyme reaction intermediate. There is, however, one major difference between the two structures. Although 37% of the polypeptide of the trypsin moiety in complex was crystallographically disordered (10Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), this was not the case for PPE in the present complex. For the trypsin complex, residues both within surface loops as well as some strands of β-sheet were untraceable. In the present structure, only 17/243 residues from elastase cannot be traced. These are restricted to one loop in direct contact with the serpin body, where the nonspecific nature of the compression between serpin and proteinase may give rise to multiple conformations for these loops, an internal loop adjacent to the active site, and the extreme N terminus, which interacts with Asp-194 in the active site of free elastase. In addition, the Cα root mean square deviation for the 93% of the PPE structure that can be seen in the complex shows only 1.0 Å root mean square deviation from the structure of free PPE, implying that the forces imposed on the proteinase by RCL insertion and compression against the serpin body result in changes that are restricted to the active site and the surrounding surface loops. No major conformational change occurs within the stable secondary structure of the proteinase. Given this difference between the two complexes, we sought to understand the basis for it by comparing the solution properties of the two complexes with respect to deacylation rates and susceptibility to proteolysis. It has been proposed that the final conformational state of the serpin-proteinase complex is in equilibrium with one in which the RCL has been completely or almost completely inserted into β-sheet A but in which the catalytic function of the proteinase has not been fully compromised (28Gettins P.G.W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence supports such a two-state model in which a very small fraction retains some catalytic function, whereas the dominant species is catalytically inactive. It has been shown for trypsin, under physiological conditions, that the small fraction with reduced catalytic activity accounts for almost all of the observed deacylation of the acyl intermediate (27Calugaru S.V. Swanson R. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32446-32455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Deacylation rates therefore are a direct measure of the fractional population of this conformation. Because the equilibrium populations of these conformers are predicted to be influenced by how much of the energy derived from RCL insertion is expended on structurally modifying the proteinase to change it to the final catalytically compromised conformation, it would be expected that a complex in which there was less structural modification would have a smaller population in the catalytically active conformation and therefore deacylate at a rate reduced in proportion to the reduction in conformer population. Although the comparison is not perfect, it has been shown that there is a difference in stability between free and complexed proteinase for PPE and α1PI, using denaturants to follow unfolding of the proteinase moiety (16Hervé M. Ghélis C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). That study gave a substantial difference in stability (6.3 kcal mol-1) between these two proteinase conformations, suggesting that there is a large enough expenditure of energy needed to alter the proteinase structure that differences in such structural alteration for different proteinases might result in large shifts in the equilibrium between the two conformations. Accordingly, if the apparently greater structural alteration in complexed trypsin compared with complexed elastase results from more of the energy derived from RCL insertion being used to alter the trypsin conformation, there should be less of a free energy difference between the two states in the trypsin complex than in the PPE complex, a higher fractional population of partially active trypsin in complex than PPE in complex, and a correspondingly higher rate of catalyzed deacylation for the trypsin complex than the PPE complex. This is not what was found. Instead, the trypsin and PPE complexes deacylated at very similar rates, which were also similar to that for the complex with the true α1PI target, HNE. This suggests that, for each complex, the fraction of complex in the partially active conformation is similar and in turn implies similar ΔG° values for the conformational equilibrium for each complex. Because the serpin is the same in all three cases, the energy available from RCL insertion should be very similar for each complex. This suggests that the energy expended in each case to produce the final conformation of the proteinase is similar and therefore that each is likely to be altered in structure in a similar way. Finally, it should be noted that, although the stabilized multi-8 variant of α1PI was used in the present study, the rate of α1PI-trypsin complex dissociation is very similar to that reported elsewhere for the complex of wild-type α1PI with trypsin (27Calugaru S.V. Swanson R. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32446-32455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A separate measure of possible differences in conformational alteration of the proteinase in the trypsin and PPE complexes was provided by their susceptibility to proteolysis by a range of proteinases of different specificities. Such enhanced proteolytic susceptibility of the proteinase in complex has been shown for a number of serpin-proteinase complexes and has been taken as evidence for the conformational alteration of the complexed proteinase (17Fish W.W. Orre K. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Cooperman B.S. Stavridi E. Nickbarg E. Rescorla E. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using subtilisin, V8 proteinase, and trypsin as probes, we found that both the PPE and trypsin complexes showed similar enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis and even that HNE was affected in the same way. Although the three proteinases thus appear to have undergone similar structural alteration upon complex formation, it is not possible from such studies to deduce what the exact nature of these changes are, which may be subtle. However, the absence of defined electron density for the extreme N terminus, which would normally interact with Asp-194, suggests a linkage between disruption of the active site caused by the “tugging” of the acyl intermediate from its normal site and structural and/or dynamic changes elsewhere in the proteinase. It was also noted above that movement of Cys-191 near the active site might explain the perturbation of the disulfide-linked loop 218-225. Similar deacylation rates and increases in proteolytic susceptibility support the conclusion that the structural alterations that occur in PPE upon complex formation with α1PI are the same as those for trypsin. Furthermore, this similarity extends to HNE. Why then is there such a large difference in the x-ray structures of the trypsin and PPE complexes? A possible answer lies in the results obtained above on self-proteolysis within the complexes. The studies on enhanced proteolysis used three proteinases, including trypsin. Trypsin resulted in the greatest degree of proteolysis for each of the three complexes. This implies that, although both trypsin and PPE complexes would be expected to release a similar amount of proteinase during a comparable period of crystal growth, the released trypsin might be more potent at cleaving the remaining complex than a similar amount of released PPE. The results obtained above bear this out. After an incubation period of only 1 day at room temperature, all of the α1PI-complexed trypsin was cleaved at one or more sites, resulting in bands of complex that migrated on SDS-PAGE much faster than intact complex. Although there was also degradation for the complexed PPE, this was significantly less. Even more striking was the near absence of degradation for complexed HNE, suggesting that, for similar structural changes within the complexed proteinase, the degree of cleavage by released proteinase is a combined function of the proteinase, its activity and specificity, and the availability of appropriate cleavage sites in the regions of the trapped proteinase that are made generally more reactive to proteolysis. There is thus the possibility that the structure determination of the trypsin-α1PI complex was of partially degraded complex and that the apparent crystallographic disorder of 37% of the proteinase resulted from self-proteolysis. This is supported by two pieces of evidence. The first is from a detailed study of the sites of enhanced proteolysis in uPA complexed with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (22Egelund R. Petersen T.E. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). That study shows that only a subset of potential cleavage sites undergoes increased susceptibility to proteolysis upon complex formation with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. These are confined to loop regions, including the activation loop. If the regions undergoing such changes in proteolytic susceptibility are common to other serpin-proteinase complexes, it would be expected that the missing regions in the trypsin-α1PI complex would map exclusively to these sites, whether increased flexibility or proteolysis were the cause of the loss of electron density. However, this was not the case. The loop connecting h1C and s3C of uPA was cleaved by both V8 proteinase and trypsin in the uPA-plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 complex. In the trypsin-α1PI complex, however, the equivalent region of trypsin (residues 173PGQITSN) is well defined. The significance is that this region in uPA contains a potential trypsin cleavage site, whereas trypsin itself does not, suggesting that altered flexibility per se is not the determinant for observing electron density in the α1PI-trypsin structure, but it is whether there is also a trypsin cleavage site that has then been used to give cleaved complex. The second piece of evidence is the SDS gel of the crystal of complex used for the α1PI-trypsin study (Ref. 10Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar and supplemental information within). The dissolved crystal of the complex showed high heterogeneity, with three bands rather than one and with the lowest mobility band (likely to correspond to uncleaved complex) representing no more than 25% of the total complex. In the case of the present study with PPE, we carefully monitored complex degradation as a function of time and used crystals grown for a short enough time that such degradation was not a major concern. We conclude that the present structure of a serpin-proteinase complex carried out on crystals in which minimal complex cleavage had occurred is a better representation of the true nature of the structural changes that occur within the proteinase upon complex formation than is the earlier structure of α1PI-trypsin. The failure to observe electron density for 37% of the trypsin in regions that are well defined in the PPE complex, despite similar structural changes detected in solution for the two complexes, suggests that this may have resulted from trypsin self-proteolysis and consequent heterogeneity rather than simply from the much higher mobility of an intact polypeptide. The limited active site distortion seen in both complexes is therefore sufficient to account for kinetic trapping of the acyl intermediate. Furthermore, there is no support for the idea that proteolysis of complexed proteinase is exploited in vivo. Indeed, neither HNE in the present study nor uPA in an earlier study (22Egelund R. Petersen T.E. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) gives rise to self-proteolysis of serpin-complexed proteinase.

Myler P.J. Bartholomeu D.C. et al.Science. 2005; 309: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). The parasite has a complex life cycle, which involves obligatory passage through four stages, proliferative epimastigote and infective trypomastigote in triatomine insects as vectors, proliferative intracellular amastigotes, and infective bloodstream trypomastigotes in mammalian hosts (2Kreier T. Julius P. Parasitic Protozoa. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). The infection is transmitted among humans predominantly by insect vectors or through blood transfusion and primarily affects the heart (chagastic cardiopathy), gastrointestinal tract (megasyndromes), and nervous system (dementia) (3Morel C.M. Lazdins J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Left untreated, Chagas disease is commonly fatal. Anti-parasitic therapy is highly toxic and usually ineffective in the chronic stages (1El-Sayed N.M. Myler P.J.

Growing knowledge on the basic biology of TC opens new opportunities for rationally developed approaches to treatment of Chagas disease. One of the approaches is to block a key metabolic pathway in the parasite (5Urbina J.A. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 6: 733-741Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Conserved in eukaryota, sterol biosynthesis is one such target pathway. Either through deoxyxylulose or more generally via the mevalonate pathway (which is likely to take place in Trypanosomatidae (6Berriman M. Ghedin E. Hertz-Fowler C. et al.Science. 2005; 309: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar)), it leads to squalene cyclization in all sterol-synthesizing organisms (www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway/map/map00100.html) and then proceeds through several phyla-specific reactions of sterol core modification, including C4 and C14 demethylation and side-chain modification, resulting in production of cholesterol in animals, ergosterol in fungi, and a variety of 24 alkylated and olefinated sterols in plants and protozoa (7Nes W.R.

Parasitol. 2003; 126: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The sterols are essential architectural components of cellular membranes and also fulfill bioregulatory functions, e.g. serving as precursors of steroid hormones and vitamin D in mammals and modulators of growth and development in unicellular organisms (9Roberts C.W. McLeod R. Rice D.W. Ginger M. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although animals can accumulate cholesterol from the diet, blocking ergosterol production is lethal in fungi, making fungal sterol biosynthesis a very attractive target for treatment of human mycoses (10Kale P. Johnson L.B. Drugs Today. 2005; 41: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In Trypanosomatidae, structural sterols are found in plasma, inner mitochondrial, and glycosomal membranes (11Catisti R. Uyemura S.A. Vercesi A.E. Lira R. Rodriguez C. Urbina J.A. Docampo R. J.

Sterol 14α-demethylases are members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYP51), which catalyze oxidative removal of the 14α-methyl group from post-squalene sterol precursors (Fig. 1A). Even with only 22-33% amino acid identity across the biological kingdoms (18Lepesheva G.I. Waterman M.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 215: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the orthologous enzymes from bacteria to mammals preserve strict catalytic regio- and stereospecificity and have a very limited range of substrates. Until now there were four CYP51 substrates known (Fig. 1B): lanosterol (L), 24,25-dihydrolanosterol (D), 24-methylanedehidrol-anosterol (M), and obtusifoliol (O), with no other compounds reported to be metabolized by this enzyme. Although mammalian and fungal orthologs in vitro are able to 14α-demethylate each of them (although only C4-dimethylsterols are formed in vivo, D/L and M/L, respectively), CYP51 from plants are specific toward their physiological substrate, O (19Lamb D.C. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have found recently (20Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that, although the pathways leading to obtusifoliol formation in plants and Trypanosomatidae are different, the same profound substrate preference toward this C4-monomethylated sterol exists in CYP51 from Trypanosoma brucei (TB), the cause of African trypanosomiasis. In contrast, much to our surprise, as described herein, upon initiating studies of TCCYP51 as the target for direct testing of specific inhibitory effects of a broad range of potential anti-chagastic agents in vitro, this enzyme is found to strongly favor substrates having two C4-methyl groups. This is the first case within the same phylum that such profound differences in CYP51 substrate specificity have been observed. The substrate preferences of TC and TB CYP51 imply that the catalytic sequence after lanosterol formation in TC and TB is different. Although the physiological reason for this at the current level of our knowledge of the biology of the parasites remains unclear, we have found that the molecular basis of the substrate preferences of TCCYP51 is largely associated with a single amino acid in the B′ helix. Cloning of TCCYP51—Sequence data for the TCCYP51 gene were obtained from the website of The Institute of Genomic Research (www.tigr.org) using as a template the protein sequence of TBCYP51 (20Lepesheva G.I.

The gene was PCR-amplified from TC genomic DNA using the FailSafe PCR Premix Selection kit (Epicenter). The upstream primer 5′-CGCCATATGTTCATTGAAGCCATTGTATTGG-3′ contained a unique NdeI cloning site (underlined) and corresponded to the TCCYP51 cDNA from 1 to 25 bp. The downstream primer 5′-CGCAAGCTTCAGTGATGGTGATGCGAGGGCAATTTCTTCTTGCG-3′ included a unique HindIII cloning site (underlined) followed by a stop codon (bold) and C-terminal 4-histidine tag (italics) and was complementary to TCCYP51 sequence from 1443 to 1423 bp.

The TCCYP51 DNA and protein sequences were deposited into the NCBA data base (accession number AY856083). To obtain the expression construct, the TCCYP51 insert was excised by digestion with NdeI and HindIII (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the pCW expression vector (21Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to destroy the internal NdeI site at 1113 bp (silent mutation Ser371 Ser, TCA to TCT), to introduce N-terminal modifications in order to increase the P450 expression level in E. coli (Table 1) and also to mutate Ile105 (ATT) to Phe (TTT) and Thr107 (ACA) to Val (GTA).TABLE 1Impact of N- and C-terminal modification of the TCCYP51 gene on the P450 expression level and purification yieldConstructN terminusC terminusP450 expressionYield after Ni2+ columnnmol/l%1MFIEA4-HisATG-TTC-ATT-GAA-GCCCAT-CAC-CAT-CAC-TGA2MAIEA4-His5-10<15ATG-GCT-ATT-GAA-GCCCAT-CAC-CAT-CAC-TGA3MAIKA4-His250-300<20ATG-GCT-ATT-AAA-GCTCAT-CAC-CAT-CAC-TGA4MAIKA6-His250-30080-90ATG-GCT-ATT-AAA-GCTCAT-CAC-CAT-CAC-CAT-CAC-TGA Open table in a new tab Expression in E. coli and Purification—CYP51 from TB, human (HU), Candida albicans (CA), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) and TB and rat cytochrome P450 reductase were all expressed and purified as described previously (20Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). TCCYP51 was expressed at conditions similar to the TBCYP51 ortholog and purified using three chromatographic stages, including a nickel-chelating affinity column as described for human CYP51 (22Lepesheva G.I. Virus C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9091-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), negative chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and cation exchange on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular weight and purity of the proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Sterol Substrates and Synthesis of 14α-Amino-derivatized Substrate Analogs—O, L, D, and M were isolated from plant and fungal sources and labeled with 3H at C3 as described (20Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). N was from the Nes steroid collection (23Venkatramesh M. Guo D. Jia Z. Nes W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and labeled under the same conditions as other sterols. 4,4-Dimethyl-14α-aminomethyl-cholest-7-en-3β-ol (AL7) and 4,4-dimethyl-14α-aminomethyl-cholest-8-en-3β-ol (AL8) were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1 (compounds 5 and 6, respectively). For routine monitoring of the product profile, steroids were injected into a GC column packed with 3% SE-30 from a Hewlett 5890 Packard Series II operated isothermally at 240 °C. Cholesterol was used as the reference specimen from which the retention times of unknown specimens relative to the retention of cholesterol were calculated. GC-mass spectroscopy was operated using a HP 6890 GC interfaced to a 5973 mass spectrometer at 70 eV. GC was performed using an Agilent HP-5 column (30 m × 25 μm in diameter). Film thickness was 0.25 μm, and the flow rate of He was set at 1.2 ml/min. The temperatures for the GC to mass spectroscopy interface, mass spectroscopy ion source, and quadruple were 280, 250, and 230 °C, respectively. Helium at 8 p.s.i. was used as the carrier gas. In this system cholesterol elutes at 13 min. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz spectrometer at ambient temperature in deuterochloroform with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Spectroscopic Measurements—Absolute and difference absorbance spectra of TCCYP51 were taken at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-240IPC spectrophotometer. The high spin form content was estimated from the absolute spectra using the ratio (ΔA393-470/ΔA417-470) (20Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Na2S2O4-reduced carbon monoxide complex (CO) difference spectra were used to measure the P450 concentration (molar extinction coefficient 91 mm-1 cm-1) to test correspondence between the total amount of hemoprotein (molar extinction coefficient 117 mm-1cm-1) and P450 complexes and to confirm the absence of conversion into the inactive P420 form. Specific heme content was estimated as the ratio between hemoprotein and total protein determined using the BSA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The abilities of rat and TB cytochrome P450 reductase to support electron transport from NADPH to TCCYP51 were compared as both the half time and efficiency of the enzymatically reduced CO-complex formation at 1 μm P450 and a P450:cytochrome P450 reductase molar ratio 1:2. Catalytic Activity—Reconstitution of TCCYP51 enzymatic activity was carried out at 2 μm P450 final concentration and a enzyme:substrate molar ratio 1:25. The final sample contained 4 μm TB cytochrome P450 reductase, 100 μm dilauroyl-α-phosphatidylcholine, 0.4 mg/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase, 25 mm sodium isocitrate, and 5 mm NADPH in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol (buffer A). Activities of TB, HU, CA, Sorghum bicolor (SB), and MT CYP51 were compared in parallel experiments, only using rat cytochrome P450 reductase as the electron donor for HU, CA, and SB orthologs and the E. coli flavodoxin:flavodoxin reductase system (24Lepesheva G.I. Podust L.M. Bellamine A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28413-28420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for MTCYP51. After incubation for different times at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by extraction of the sterols with ethyl acetate. The reaction products were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Waters Corp.) equipped with β-RAM detector (INUS Systems Inc.) using a Varian C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm) and a linear gradient acetonitrile:water:methanol (4.5:1:4.5), methanol as a mobile phase at a flow rate 1.5 ml/min. Ligand Binding Assay—Ligand-induced changes in the Soret band of ferric TCCYP51 (2 μm) were monitored at room temperature in buffer A. The sterol substrates (N, O, L, D, and M) were added from 1 mm stock solution in 45% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc.) in the range 0.25-20 μm. Fluconazole (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) and 14α-aminomethyl derivatives of L, AL7 and AL8, were dissolved in Me2SO (2 mm) and added in the range 0.1-20 μm. The corresponding volumes of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin or Me2SO were added to the reference cuvette. Maximal spectral response per nanomole of P450 (type I, ΔA390-420 for substrate binding; type II, ΔA426-410 and ΔA426-390 for nitrogen coordination for fluconazole and amino derivatives of L, respectively) and apparent dissociation constants were determined as previously described (22Lepesheva G.I. Virus C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9091-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by plotting absorbance changes against the concentration of free ligand and fitting the data to a rectangular hyperbola using Sigma Plot Statistics. Inhibition of TCCYP51—The inhibitory effects of fluconazole and the two amino-substrate analogs were compared as TCCYP51 activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of the tested inhibitors (1-50 μm) and expressed as the molar ratio I/P450 at which the activity decreases 2-fold. Homology Modeling—A molecular model of TCCYP51 was constructed using MTCYP51 (1e9x) (41% structural identity), CYP3A4 (1tqn) (29% identity), and 2C9 (1nr6) (29% identity) as templates. The sequences were aligned, and the coordinates were obtained from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Coordinates for heme and fluconazole were taken from MTCYP51 (1ea1). Mutations were modeled in Swiss-PDB Viewer. The sequence of the amplified TCCYP51 gene corresponds to the preliminary DNA sequence in the TIGR data base with the exception of one, silent base pair substitution (G78A). The protein consists of 481 amino acid residues having a molecular mass of ∼55 kDa. Although the N-terminal part of the gene is not highly GC-rich (AT/GC ratio is 55/45 for the first 40 codons), the wild type TCCYP51 gene was not expressed in E. coli in the P450 form. Substitution of the second codon to alanine (GCT) (21Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) led to low P450 expression (Table 1). A further increase of the AT content of the 5′-end by silent mutation in codon 4 and insertion of the substitution E5K allowed us to increase the expression to 250-300 nmol of P450 per liter. Poor interaction of the four His-tagged TCCYP51 with the nickel column suggested limited availability of the TCCYP51 C terminus, perhaps due to proline 480 restricting its local flexibility. Insertion of two additional His residues into the TCCYP51 C-terminal His tag solved this problem. The yield of the electrophoretically pure P450 after the three-step purification procedure (Fig. 2A)was about 50%. TCCYP51 is purified in the low spin form (Fig. 2B) with a Soret maximum at 417 nm and equal intensities of α-(568 nm) and β-band (536 nm) absorbances, which is typical for sterol 14α-demethylases. The purified protein had a spectrophotometric index of A417/280 1.6 and a specific heme content of 16.6 nmol/mg. The carbon monoxide spectrum of Na2S2O4-reduced TCCYP51 is stable at room temperature for at least 30 min and had a maximum at 448 nm. P420 content does not exceed 5%. Both rat and TB cytochrome P450 reductase support electron transfer from NADPH to TCCYP51, with maximal efficiency 85 and 100% that of the amount of chemically reduced P450, respectively. The electron transfer, however, at least in in vitro conditions, occurred faster with the reductase from TB (Supplemental Fig. 2). The fact that TB cytochrome P450 reductase is a better electron donor for TCCYP51 correlates with our previous data on the reduction of TBCYP51 (20Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and implies that the two protozoan CYP51s are likely to have high similarity in the organization of the region of interaction with their electron donor partner. Preferences of TB and TC CYP51 for sterol substrates are remarkably different. Although TBCYP51 profoundly prefers O of the four known substrates of sterol 14α-demethylase (20Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), TCCYP51 demethylates this sterol very poorly (0.06 min-1) (Table 2). Instead, it shows the highest turnover number upon 14α-demethylation of M (2.4 min-1). Metabolism of D upon the same conditions is about 30% slower (1.6 min-1). The rate of 14α-demethylation of L is only 0.57 min-1, although the initial accumulation of the 14α-carboxyaldehyde intermediate from L occurs more than 3-fold faster than the overall demethylation reaction (1.7 min-1). The tendency of TCCYP51 to form the aldehyde intermediate from L resembles that observed with TBCYP51, although the ratio between the rates of formation of the intermediate and the product from L by TBCYP51 is much higher, reaching about 80 (20Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Substrate binding parameters calculated from type I spectral responses of TCCYP51 (blue shift from 417 to 393 nm in the Soret band) upon sterol versus 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin addition, including maximal amplitude, which reflects the increase in the high spin content (hs,%), apparent dissociation constants (Kd), and their ratio (hs/Kd), suggest that the differences in the rates of sterol metabolism are connected with the ability of the enzyme to interact with the substrate. Comparison of the values calculated for M, D, and L demonstrates a role for the geometry of the hydrophobic side chain. Both M and D have a flexible side chain, but the larger side chain size caused by the additional 24-methylene group of M in this region is slightly preferable. Alternatively, a decrease of the side chain flexibility by the addition of a 24 (25Goad L.J. Holz Jr., G.G. Beach D.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 3: 257-279Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar)-double bond (L) further affects interaction (∼2-fold) and product formation (∼3-fold), although the rate of production of the aldehyde intermediate remains practically the same. This 2-fold reduction due to the side chain alteration is also observed upon comparison of the binding and metabolism of O and its C24-demethylated analog N (which we tested as a potential substrate for trypanosomal CYP51 because it was listed among the sterols identified in vivo in Leishmania species (25Goad L.J. Holz Jr., G.G. Beach D.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 3: 257-279Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Beach D.H. Goad L.J. Holz Jr., G.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 2: 149-162Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). However, the major differences in catalytic activity and binding parameters (M, D, and L versus O and N) are derived from the geometry surrounding the sterol C4 atom; both the equatorial (α) and the angular (β) methyl groups are strongly favored by TCCYP51.TABLE 2Sterol binding and catalytic activity of TCCYP51Wild typeI105FSubstrateSpectral responseTurnovercnmol of substrate/nmol of P450/min.Spectral responseTurnoverEffect (-fold)hsmaMaximal increase in the high spin content calculated from the spectral response per nmol of P450, where 0.11 optical units/nmol corresponds to 100% conversion of TCCYP51 from low to high spin form.KdbApparent dissociation constant.hsm/Kdhsm%Kdhsm/KdInteractiondhsm/Kd mutant/hsm/Kd wild type.Activity%μm%μmN10 ± 0.79.5 ± 1.41.20.03 ± 0.0154 ± 2.20.04 ± 0.011354.6 ± 0.5↑ 113↑ 150O9 ± 0.64.4 ± 0.72.00.06 ± 0.0145 ± 3.40.7 ± 0.05643.6 ± 0.3↑ 32↑ 60L21 ± 1.81.9 ± 0.3110.57 ± 0.04eThe rate of accumulation of the 14α-aldehyde intermediate is 1.7 min−1.

This study provided biochemical data about the substrate specificity and activation of hK6 by glycosaminoglycans and by kosmotropic salts, which followed the Hofmeister series. The screening of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide families derived from Abz-KLRSSKQ-EDDnp resulted in the finding that Abz-AFRFSQ-EDDnp (where Abz is ortho-aminobenzoic acid and EDDnp is N-[2,4-dinitrophenyl]ethylenediamine)) is the best synthetic substrate described so far for hK6 (kcat/Km = 38,667 s–1 mm–1). It is noteworthy that the AFRFS sequence was found as a motif in the amino-terminal domain of seven human ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits. We also examined the hK6 hydrolytic activity on FRET peptides derived from human myelin basic protein, precursor of the Aβ amyloid peptide, reactive center loop of α1-antichymotrypsin, plasminogen, and maturation and inactivation cleavage sites of hK6, which were described earlier as natural substrates for hK6. The best substrates were derived from myelin basic protein. The hK6 maturation cleavage site was poorly hydrolyzed, and no evidence was found to support a two-step self-activation process reported previously. Finally, we assayed FRET peptides derived from sequences that span the cleavage sites for activation of protease-activated receptors (PAR) 1–4, and only the substrate with the PAR 2 sequence was hydrolyzed. These results further supported the hypothesis that hK6 expressed in the central nervous system is involved in normal myelin turnover/demyelination processes, but it is unlikely to self-activate.

The identification of substrate specificity and activators for hK6 is a relevant goal to understand the biological roles of this enzyme, to identify potentially susceptible substrates, and to elucidate functional information. We examine the modulation of salts and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on hydrolytic activity of hK6 and their effects on the pH profile activity of this enzyme. The rationale for investigation of the effects of GAGs on hK6 activity was based on the co-localization of both molecules in the CNS.

We also present a detailed substrate specificity analysis of hK6 that was performed by using two strategies; in the first strategy, the S3 to S2′ subsite specificities are examined by taking as reference the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide Abz-KLRSSKQ-EDDnp (Abz is ortho-aminobenzoic acid and EDDnp is N-[2,4-dinitrophenyl]ethylenediamine), which was designed based on previously reported subsite requirements for hK1 substrates (20Chagas J.R.

A series of analogues of this peptide were synthesized with modification by all amino acids, except Gln, and assayed as substrates. For comparison, we also determined the kinetic parameters for hydrolysis by hK1 of the FRET peptides derived from Abz-KLRSSKQ-EDDnp.

These properties of PARs motivated us to include in this study FRET peptides derived from sequences that span the cleavage sites for activation of these receptors because hK6 has preference for Arg at the P1 site of substrates and hK6 is involved in inflammatory diseases as mentioned above.

Molar concentrations of active hK6 and hK1 were determined by titration with 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride by spectrofluorimetric titration as described previously (59Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S.A. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—All FRET peptides were obtained by the solidphase peptide synthesis strategy as described previously (60Hirata I. Cezari M.H.C. Nakaie C.R. Boshcov P. Ito A.S.

The peptides were synthesized in NovaSyn®TGR resin (Novabiochem-Merck) (loading 0.2 mmol/g) using 2-(1-H-benzotriazole-1 yl)1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole as coupling reagent, and the cleavage of peptide-resin was accomplished with trifluoroacetic acid:anisol:1,2-ethanedithiol:water (85:5:3:7). All peptides obtained were purified by semi-preparative high pressure liquid chromatography on an Econosil C-18 column. The molecular weight and purity of synthesized peptides (94% or higher) were checked by amino acid analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, using a TofSpec-E from Micromass, Manchester, UK. Stock solutions of the peptides were prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide, and the concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficient of 17,300 m–1 cm–1 at 365 nm. Glycosaminoglycans—We have used a size-defined (10 kDa) bovine lung heparin (The Upjohn Co.), prepared by using size exclusion column approach (61Dietrich C.P. Tersariol I.L.S. Toma L. Moraes C.T.

Bianchini (Opocrin Research Laboratories, Modena, Italy) (61Dietrich C.P. Tersariol I.L.S. Toma L. Moraes C.T. Porcionatto M.A. Oliveira F.W. Nader H.B. Cell. Mol.

Kinetic Measurements—The FRET peptides were assayed in a Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorometer at 37 °C. The assays were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 2 m sodium citrate or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. The enzymes were preincubated in the assay buffer for 3 min before the addition of substrate. Fluorescence changes were monitored continuously at λex = 320 nm and λem = 420 nm. The enzyme concentrations for initial rate determinations were chosen at a level intended to hydrolyze less than 5% of the amount of added substrate over the time course of data collection. The slope of the generated fluorescence signal was converted into micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed per min based on a calibration curve obtained from the complete hydrolysis of each peptide. The substrate concentration for determination of the kinetic parameters was between two Km values higher and lower than the obtained value. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat were calculated by nonlinear regression using the Grafit program (62Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit,Version 3.0. Erithacus Software, Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). For peptides hydrolyzed at more than one site, or for substrate exhibiting inhibition, the apparent kcat/Km values were also determined under pseudo-first order conditions (where [S] ≪ Km) and performed under two different substrate concentrations. Errors were less than 5% for each of the obtained kinetic parameters.

We initially observed that this peptide was a better substrate for hK6 in the pH range 7–9.0 than any other commercially available substrate. The relative hydrolytic activity of hK6 on the peptide Abz-KLRSSKQ-EDDnp at pH 7.5 and 9.0 in the presence of 1 m sodium citrate, sodium sulfate, and sodium acetate and 5 mm NaCl are shown in Table 1. hK6 exhibited the greatest activity with sodium citrate and sodium sulfate, pH 7.5, whereas these same salts inhibited the enzyme at pH 9.0. The sodium citrate activation of hK6 is concentration-dependent and is more effective at pH 7.5 than pH 9.0 (Fig. 1). The enzyme activity was reduced in 1 m sodium acetate and 5 mm NaCl. The chloride salts of, K+, NH4+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ inhibited hK6 at pH 7.5 or 9.0. The monovalent cations at 5 μm concentration inhibited 20–50% of the enzyme activity, whereas Mg2+ and Ca2+ completely inhibited the enzyme at the same concentration.TABLE 1Relative hydrolytic activity of hK6 on Abz-KLRSSKQ-EDDnp at pH 7.5 and 9.0 in presence of different anionspHBuffer, no saltSodium citrateSodium sulfateSodium acetateSodium chloride7.51157.40.70.59.011.40.30.10.3 Open table in a new tab Chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin activated hK6 in a concentration-dependent manner, but with distinctly different profiles at pH 7.5 and 9.0 (Fig. 2).

At higher concentrations, all the GAGs reduced their activation or even inhibited the hK6 activity. At pH 7.5, all the GAGs activated hK6 with higher relative efficiency than either a similar comparison at pH 9.0 or in the absence of GAGs.

https://openalex.org/W1978321269,Holocene acceleration of deformation and postseismic relaxation are two hypotheses to explain the present-day deformation in the Central Nevada Seismic Belt (CNSB). Discriminating between these two mechanisms is critical for understanding the dynamics and seismic potential of the Basin and Range province. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar detected a broad area of uplift (2 to 3 millimeters per year) that can be explained by postseismic mantle relaxation after a sequence of large crustal earthquakes from 1915 to 1954. The results lead to a broad agreement between geologic and geodetic strain indicators and support a model of a rigid Basin and Range between the CNSB and the Wasatch fault.
https://openalex.org/W2152897468,"Here we showed that a naturally occurring ether analog of lysophosphatidic acid, 1-O-octadecenyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (AGP), is a high affinity partial agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Binding studies using the PPARgamma ligand binding domain showed that [32P]AGP and [3H]rosiglitazone (Rosi) both specifically bind to PPARgamma and compete with each other. [32P]AGP bound PPARgamma with an affinity (Kdapp 60 nm) similar to that of Rosi. However, AGP displaced approximately 40% of bound [3H]Rosi even when applied at a 2000-fold excess. Activation of PPARgamma reporter gene expression by AGP and Rosi showed similar potency, yet AGP-mediated activation was approximately 40% that of Rosi. A complex between AGP and PPARgamma was generated using molecular modeling based on a PPARgamma crystal structure. AGP-interacting residues were compared with Rosi-interacting residues identified within the Rosi-PPARgamma co-crystal complex. These comparisons showed that the two ligands occupy partially overlapping positions but make different hydrogen bonding and ion pairing interactions. Site-specific mutants of PPARgamma were prepared to examine individual ligand binding. H323A and H449A mutants showed reduced binding of Rosi but maintained binding of AGP. In contrast, the R288A showed reduced AGP binding but maintained Rosi binding. Finally, alanine replacement of Tyr-473 abolished binding and activation by Rosi and AGP. These observations indicate that the endogenous lipid mediator AGP is a high affinity ligand of PPARgamma but that it binds via interactions distinct from those involved in Rosi binding. These distinct interactions are likely responsible for the partial PPARgamma agonism of AGP."

Here we present direct genetic evidence for such an allele in Drosophila pseudoobscura . Alleles conferring high or low assortative mating in D. pseudoobscura produce the same effects when inserted into D. persimilis . This observation suggests that the type of genetic variation that is most conducive to controversial modes of speciation with gene flow, such as reinforcement or sympatric speciation, is present in nature."

The role of TNFalpha in restenosis was also assessed in ApoE*3-Leiden mice, TNFalpha knockout mice, and by local delivery of a TNFalpha biosynthesis inhibitor, thalidomide. The -238G-1031T haplotype of the TNFalpha gene increased clinical and angiographic risk of restenosis (P=0.02 and P=0.002, respectively). In a mouse model of reactive stenosis, arterial TNFalpha mRNA was significantly time-dependently up-regulated. Mice lacking TNFalpha or treated locally with thalidomide showed a reduction in reactive stenosis (P=0.01 and P=0.005, respectively). Clinical and preclinical data indicate that TNFalpha plays an important role in restenosis. Therefore, TNFalpha genotype may be used as a risk marker for restenosis and may contribute to individual patient screening prior to PCI in clinical practice. Inhibition of TNFalpha may be an anti-restenotic target strategy."

Although phosphatidylinositol signaling has been implicated in this event, how netrin-1 regulates phosphatidylinositol signaling remains poorly understood. Here we provide evidence that netrin-1 stimulates phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis in cortical neurons. This event appears to be mediated by DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), but not neogenin or Unc5h2. Netrin-1 induces phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) tyrosine phosphorylation.

Phosphoinositides are quantitatively minor phospholipids of cell membranes, but their metabolism is highly active and tightly regulated. They (e.g. PIP2) function either as precursors of second messengers such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol or by directly interacting with both actin-binding and pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins to regulate their spatiotemporal distribution and/or activity. In addition, PIP2 functions as a cofactor for small GTP-binding proteins (e.g. Arf) and phospholipase D (21Hilpela P. Vartiainen M.K. Lappalainen P. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Using Xenopus growth cone-turning assays, Poo and colleagues (27Ming G. Song H. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that perturbation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) activity by pretreatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) attenuates netrin-1-induced neurite outgrowth. Although PLCγ is implicated in netrin-1-induced growth cone guidance, exactly how netrin-1 regulates this signaling event and its role in netrin-1-induced neurite outgrowth remain largely unknown. In this paper, we have characterized the potential role of PIP2 hydrolysis in netrin-1 signaling. We show that netrin-1 stimulates PIP2 hydrolysis in cultured cortical neurons. This event appears to be mediated by DCC. In addition, netrin-1 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ, a time course similar to that of PIP2 hydrolysis induced by netrin-1. Furthermore, inhibition of PLC activity by U73122 attenuated netrin-1-induced neurite elongation. These results demonstrate a crucial role of PLC signaling in netrin-1 induced neurite outgrowth.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and proteinase inhibitors) (31Ren X.R.

Cortical Neuronal Culture—Primary cortical neurons were cultured as described previously (18Ren X.R. Ming G.L. Xie Y. Hong Y. Sun D.M. Zhao Z.Q. Feng Z. Wang Q. Shim S. Chen Z.F. Song H.J. Mei L.

Cerebral cortexes were dissected out and chopped into small pieces after meninges were completely removed. After incubation in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.125% (w/v) trypsin (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C, digested tissues were mechanically triturated by repeated passages through a Pasteur pipette in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% (w/v) DNase (Sigma). Dissociated cells were suspended in the neurobasal medium with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated dishes (Corning). After a 2-day incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to inhibit the proliferation of glial cells. PIP2 Hydrolysis Assay—HEK293 cells, neurons, or mouse embryonic fibroblasts were incubated in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 μCi/ml myo-2-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/μl, Amersham Biosciences), and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 20 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for an additional hour in the same medium lacking isotope. 20 mm LiCl was added to the culture, and incubation continued for another 25 min. [3H]inositol-incorporated cells were stimulated with netrin-1 for different times. Inositol phosphates were extracted in 10 mm formic acid and purified by ion-exchange chromatography using AG1-X8 resin as described previously (32Hara S. Swigart P. Jones D. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14908-14913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Explant Cultures—Explant assays were carried out as described previously (33Metin C. Deleglise D. Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Tessier-Lavigne M.

For cortical explants, telencephalic vesicles of E15 embryos were dissected out in L-15 medium (Invitrogen), and the pia mater was removed. The dorsolateral cortex was cut with thin tungsten needles into ∼200 × 200-μm pieces that spanned the full thickness of the cortical wall. Explants were embedded in a three-dimensional collagen (Roche Diagnostics) matrix with the ventricular side up. After polymerization, gels were incubated with Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Neurite outgrowth was analyzed after 19–43 h in culture. Total neurite length for each explant was obtained by adding the lengths of all neurites from each explant (regardless of bundle thickness). Each experiment was repeated three times, and six explants for each treatment were analyzed (n = 2 × 3 = 6). Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to determine significance of effects. Data are presented as the mean of all independent replicates ± S.E. Netrin-1 Stimulation of PLC Signaling in a Time-dependent Manner—To address whether netrin-1 regulates PLC signaling, we measured PLC-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis in cultured rat cortical neurons in response to netrin-1. Rat cortical neurons (E17, 3 days in vitro) were labeled with [3H]inositol, stimulated with or without netrin-1, and assayed for the production of inositol phosphates, an indicator of PIP2 hydrolysis. BDNF, a growth factor that stimulates PLC signaling, was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1A, netrin-1 as well as BDNF stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis, supporting the notion of conserved signaling pathways of netrin-1 and BDNF (27Ming G. Song H. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 36Graef I.A. Wang F. Charron F. Chen L. Neilson J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2003; 113: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Slit-2, a repulsive cue that negatively regulates neurite outgrowth (37Brose K. Tessier-Lavigne M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), failed to stimulate this activity (Fig. 1A). In addition, netrin-1 induction of PIP2 hydrolysis appeared to be time-dependent, with a maximal activity observed within 15 min of netrin-1 stimulation (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that netrin-1 stimulates PLC signaling in neurons in a time-dependent manner. Dependence of Netrin-1 Stimulation of PLC Signaling on DCC—We next investigated the role of netrin-1 receptors in netrin-1 stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis. To this end, we reconstituted netrin-1 regulation of PIP2 hydrolysis in HEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous DCC (data not shown). Netrin-1 stimulation did not elicit PIP2 hydrolysis in control HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). However, transfection with DCC rendered HEK293 cells able to respond to netrin-1 with an increase in PIP2 hydrolysis (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), implying dependence on the DCC protein. Remarkably, netrin-1 stimulation did not induce, or elicited very weakly if at all, PIP2 hydrolysis in HEK293 cells transfected with Unc5h2 or with neogenin, a DCC-related receptor (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). These results suggest that DCC, but not neogenin or Unc5h2, may mediate netrin-1-induced PLC signaling. To determine the role of DCC in vivo in netrin-1-induced PLC signaling, we turned to neurons isolated from DCC knock-out mice (Fig. 2B). Used as control were neurons from wild type or heterozygote mutant mice (Fig. 2B). As observed with rat cortical neurons, cortical neurons from DCC wild type or heterozygote mice responded to netrin-1 with an increase in PIP2 hydrolysis (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4). However, the induction of PIP2 hydrolysis was completely eliminated in neurons from DCC homozygote mice (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), demonstrating a necessity for DCC in netrin-1 activation of PLC signaling in neurons. Note that neogenin was expressed at a similar level in neurons from DCC-/- mice as compared with wild type neurons (Fig. 2B), consistent with the notion that DCC, but not neogenin, mediates netrin-1 induction of PIP2 hydrolysis in neurons. Requirement of the DCC-P3 Domain for Netrin-1-induced PLC Signaling—The cytoplasmic region of DCC contains no catalytic domain but has three conserved regions: P1, P2, and P3. DCC interacts via the P domains with other receptors to form homo- or heterodimers important for netrin-1 function (9Culotti J.G. Merz D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Stein E. Zou Y. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 38Kennedy T.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39Stein E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To identify which domain is necessary for netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis, we compared the effects of DCC with DCCΔP3, a P3 deletion mutant, because P3 domain is required for netrin-1-stimulated neurite outgrowth and growth cone turning in Xenopus spinal neurons (29Stein E. Zou Y. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Stein E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of this mutant in HEK293 cells blocked netrin-1 stimulation of PLC signaling, whereas expression of wild type DCC showed a significant response to netrin-1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–6). These results suggest a role of the DCC-P3 domain in netrin-1-induced PLC signaling. We next determined the role of DCC-P3 domain in vivo in netrin-1 induction of PIP2 hydrolysis by taking advantage of DCCkanga mice. These mice have a spontaneous deletion of exon 29 that encodes the DCC-P3 domain and show abnormal projection of corticospinal tract fibers to the spinal cord (35Finger J.H. Bronson R.T. Harris B. Johnson K. Przyborski S.A. Ackerman S.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10346-10356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike mice homozygous for the targeted allele of DCC, which die perinatally (40Fazeli A. Dickinson S.L. Hermiston M.L. Tighe R.V. Steen R.G. Small C.G. Stoeckli E.T. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Rayburn H. Simons J. Bronson R.T. Gordon J.I. Tessier-Lavigne M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), DCCkanga homozygotes have a relatively normal life span (35Finger J.H. Bronson R.T. Harris B. Johnson K. Przyborski S.A. Ackerman S.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10346-10356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis may be impaired in DCCkanga mice if the DCC-P3 domain plays an important role in this event. Neurons were isolated from DCCkanga mutant and wild type embryos. Wild type mouse cortical neurons responded to netrin-1 with an increase in PIP2 hydrolysis, as did DCCkanga heterozygous neurons (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4). In contrast, the induction of PIP2 hydrolysis was significantly attenuated in neurons from homozygous embryos (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). These results suggest a crucial role of the DCC-P3 domain in PIP2 hydrolysis by netrin-1. Independence of DCC-P3 Homodimerization or FAK for Netrin-1-induced PLC Signaling—DCC-P3 domain not only binds to itself to mediate DCC homodimerization but also interacts with FAK (18Ren X.R. Ming G.L. Xie Y. Hong Y. Sun D.M. Zhao Z.Q. Feng Z. Wang Q. Shim S. Chen Z.F. Song H.J. Mei L. Xiong W.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Stein E. Zou Y. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both events are required for netrin-1 functions (18Ren X.R. Ming G.L. Xie Y. Hong Y.

Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We thus examined the effects of DCC dimerization and FAK on netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis. To test whether self-association of P3 contributes to netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis, we constructed DCC/SAM, a chimeric protein of DCC with the SAM domain of the EphB1 receptor substituted for the P3 domain. This SAM domain has been demonstrated to mediate self-association of the DCC cytoplasmic domain when it replaces the P3 domain and can substitute fully for P3 in mediating the ligand-regulated chemoattractant function (29Stein E.

Note that transfection of DCC/SAM blocked netrin-1 response in PIP2 hydrolysis (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8, and Fig. 3C), suggesting a slight role of DCC-P3 domain-mediated dimerization in this event. We next examined the role of FAK in netrin-1 induction of PIP2 hydrolysis, as FAK is a P3 binding partner (18Ren X.R. Ming G.L. Xie Y. Hong Y. Sun D.M. Zhao Z.Q. Feng Z. Wang Q. Shim S. Chen Z.F. Song H.J. Mei L. Xiong W.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To this end, FAK-/- fibroblasts transfected with DCC were used. As shown in Fig. 3D, netrin-1 was able to elicit PIP2 hydrolysis in both fak+/+ and fak+/- fibroblasts expressing DCC, suggesting a slight role of FAK in this event. In aggregate, our results suggest that neither P3 domain-mediated dimerization nor P3-FAK binding appeared to be required for netrin-1 induction of PLC signaling, thus implicating an involvement of other P3-dependent-binding proteins in this event. DCC has been found to be phosphorylated at tyrosine 1420 (Tyr1420), a site close to the P3 region and implicated in netrin-1 signaling (19Li W. Lee J. Vikis H.G. Lee S.H. Liu G. Aurandt J. Shen T.L. Fearon E.R. Guan J.L. Han M. Rao Y. Hong K. Guan K.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 41Meriane M. Tcherkezian J. Webber C.A. Danek E.I. Triki I. McFarlane S. Bloch-Gallego E. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether DCC-Tyr1420 phosphorylation contributes to netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis. To this end, the DCC-Y1420F mutant was expressed into HEK293 cells, and netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis was examined. The netrin-1 response in PIP2 hydrolysis was reduced, but not abolished, in cells expressing DCC-Y1420F mutant (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10). Note that the basal activity appeared to be increased in cells expressing the Y1420F mutant (Fig. 3A, lanes 9). These results suggest a potential role of DCC Tyr1420 phosphorylation in netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis. Netrin-1 Induction of Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PLCγ in Rat Cortical Neurons—PLC, a large family of proteins including PLCβ and PLCγ, is a major enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of PIP2 into IP3 and diacylglycerol. To understand further how netrin-1 induces PIP2 hydrolysis, we examined whether netrin-1 activates PLC. Both PLCγ and -β are highly expressed in embryonic rat brain (Fig. 4A). We examined whether netrin-1 stimulates PLCγ by increasing its tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4B, netrin-1 rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ within 5 min in rat cortical neurons, peaking at 30 min and gradually returning to basal levels after 60 min, a transient time course similar to that of netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis. Note that this time course appeared to be slightly different from that of netrin-1-induced FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4B), which peaked earlier, at 15 min, and lasted longer (18Ren X.R. Ming G.L. Xie Y. Hong Y. Sun D.M. Zhao Z.Q. Feng Z. Wang Q. Shim S. Chen Z.F. Song H.J. Mei L. Xiong W.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, netrin-1 also increased the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4B), a downstream kinase of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway that is implicated in netrin-1-induced growth cone turning (27Ming G. Song H. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), with a different time course than that of netrin-1 induction of PLCγ phosphorylation. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ by netrin-1 may not be FAK-dependent, which is in line with the observation that FAK is not required for netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis. Requirement of PLC Signaling for Netrin-1-induced Cortical Neurite Elongation—To explore the involvement of PLC signal transduction in mediating netrin-1 functions, we tested whether inhibition of PLC affects netrin-1-stimulated neurite outgrowth in rat embryonic cortical explants. In the absence of netrin-1, neurites are few and short (Fig. 5A). A significant increase in neurite outgrowth (both in number and length) was observed when explants were stimulated with netrin-1 (Fig. 5, B and I) (33Metin C. Deleglise D. Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Development. 1997; 124: 5063-5074PubMed Google Scholar, 34Richards L.J. Koester S.E. Tuttle R. O'Leary D.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2445-2458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, this event was inhibited by a PLC-specific inhibitor, U73122, but not by STI571, an inhibitor for Abl tyrosine kinase (Fig. 5, C–H). Of note is that the inhibitory effect by U73122 appeared to be dose-dependent. Whereas a weak effect was observed at a concentration of 10 nm, treatment with 500 nm U73122 showed significant inhibition (Fig. 5, C–F and I). In addition, this inhibitory effect appeared to be specific and was not associated with necrosis of the explants (Fig. 5, A, C, and E). Furthermore, U73122 had no effect on netrin-1-independent neurite outgrowth (data not shown), suggesting that the observed inhibitory effect by U73122 does not result from a general inhibition of neurite outgrowth but rather from specific inhibition of netrin-1-induced neurite elongation. Taken together, these results support the notion that PIP2 hydrolysis may be involved in netrin-1-stimulated cortical neurite outgrowth. Netrin-1 induced PIP2 hydrolysis appears to be an important mechanism for netrin-1-induced neurite elongation. This notion is supported by the following observations. First, PIP2 hydrolysis is increased in neurons challenged with netrin-1. Netrin-1 induced PIP2 hydrolysis occurs rapidly after stimulation, apparently prior to changes in neurite outgrowth. Second, netrin-1 stimulates PLCγ in a time-dependent manner. Third, treatment of neurons with U73122, an inhibitor of PLCs, attenuates netrin-1-stimulated neurite outgrowth. Fourth, PLCγ signaling has been implicated in nerve growth factor- and netrin-1-induced growth cone guidance of Xenopus spinal neurons (27Ming G. Song H. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been demonstrated that IP3 receptor-mediated calcium release from intracellular stores plays an important role in the axonal extension of chick dorsal root ganglia (42Takei K. Shin R.M. Inoue T. Kato K. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1998; 282: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Netrin-1 acts through two families of receptors: DCCs and UNC-5s. The DCC family includes DCC and neogenin in vertebrates (5Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Hinck L. Leonardo E.D. Chan S.S. Culotti J.G. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1996; 87: 175-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Although DCC is required for growth cone attraction by netrins (9Culotti J.G. Merz D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the role of neogenin in netrin-1 signaling remains unclear. Interestingly, recent observations indicate that neogenin, but not DCC, appears to be a receptor for RGM (repulsive guidance molecule), which repels retinal axons (43Rajagopalan S. Deitinghoff L. Davis D. Conrad S. Skutella T. Chedotal A. Mueller B.K. Strittmatter S.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our data have indicated a role of DCC, but not neogenin or Unc5h2, in netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis, supporting the notion that different functions could be mediated by DCC and neogenin. DCC, an Ig family receptor, contains a cytoplasmic region with three conserved domains, namely P1, P2, and P3 (7Kolodziej P.A. Timpe L.C. Mitchell K.J. Fried S.R. Goodman C.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1996; 87: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The P domains are important for DCC functions. For example, P3 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to another molecule of DCC to form a homodimer (29Stein E. Zou Y. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Stein E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The homodimerization appears to be necessary for neurite outgrowth and attractive turning in Xenopus spinal neurons (29Stein E. Zou Y. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Stein E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In addition, P3 interacts with Robo1, a receptor of the repulsive cue, Slit (39Stein E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This interaction is believed to be critical for Slit-2-induced silencing of netrin-1 attraction (39Stein E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Furthermore, P3 interacts with FAK and phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α, which are required for netrin-1-induced neurite outgrowth (18Ren X.R. Ming G.L. Xie Y. Hong Y. Sun D.M. Zhao Z.Q. Feng Z. Wang Q. Shim S. Chen Z.F. Song H.J. Mei L. Xiong W.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Li W. Lee J. Vikis H.G. Lee S.H. Liu G. Aurandt J.

Ackerman S.L. Kozlowski D. Mei L. Xiong W.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1124-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this paper, we provide evidence for an important role of P3 in netrin-1-induced PLC signaling. This event appears to be independent of P3-mediated self-association or FAK interaction, consistent with our recent observation of an important role of PITPα interaction in this event (44Xie Y. Ding Y.Q. Hong Y. Feng Z. Navarre S. Xi C.X. Zhu X.J. Wang C.L. Ackerman S.L. Kozlowski D. Mei L. Xiong W.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1124-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here support a role of DCC and PLCγ tyrosine phosphorylation in netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis and regulation of neurite outgrowth. This is suggested by a similar time course of induction of both DCC and PLCγ tyrosine phosphorylation and PIP2 hydrolysis upon netrin-1 stimulation, an attenuation of netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis in DCC-Y1420F-expressing cells, and an inhibition of neurite outgrowth by a PLC inhibitor. These observations are consistent with previous studies showing that DCC tyrosine phosphorylation contributes to netrin-1-induced neurite outgrowth (41Meriane M. Tcherkezian J. Webber C.A. Danek E.I. Triki I. McFarlane S. Bloch-Gallego E. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), that PLCγ signaling is required in nerve growth factor- and netrin-1-induced growth cone guidance of Xenopus spinal neurons (27Ming G. Song H. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and that IP3 receptor-mediated calcium release from intracellular stores plays an important role in axonal extension of chick dorsal root ganglia (42Takei K. Shin R.M. Inoue T. Kato K. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1998; 282: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results that both netrin-1 and BDNF activate PLCγ and PIP2 hydrolysis provide additional evidence for conserved signaling pathways between netrins and neurotrophins. This notion is in line with the observation that perturbation of PLC signaling by pretreatment of BDNF blocks netrin-1-induced neurite turning in Xenopus spinal neurons (27Ming G. Song H. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, this notion is supported by a recent demonstration that both neurotrophins and netrins stimulate calcineurin-dependent nuclear localization of NFATc4 and activation of NFAT-mediated gene transcription in cultured primary neurons and also that calcineurin-NFAT signaling is required for both neurotrophin- and netrin-1-induced neurite outgrowth (36Graef I.A. Wang F. Charron F. Chen L. Neilson J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2003; 113: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, we speculate that netrin-1, via DCC-PLCγ, regulates PIP2 hydrolysis, enhances IP3 production, elevates the intracellular calcium concentration, and stimulates calcineurin-NFAT signaling, which is important for netrin-1-induced neurite elongation. In addition, it is possible that PIP2-bound actin-binding and pleckstrin homology domain-containing signaling proteins may be regulated by netrin-1-induced PIP2 hydrolysis. This regulation may be in a time- and space-dependent manner that is crucial for neurite outgrowth and growth cone turning. However, whether netrin-1 stimulates neurite outgrowth through such a mechanism remains to be studied further."
https://openalex.org/W2094981306,"The translation release factors (RFs) RF1 and RF2 of Escherichia coli are methylated at the N5 -glutamine of the GGQ motif by PrmC methyltransferase. This motif is conserved in organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFs, mitochondrial Mrf1p and cytoplasmic Sup45p (eRF1), have sequence similarities to the bacterial RFs, including the potential site of glutamine methylation in the GGQ motif. A computational analysis revealed two yeast proteins, Mtq1p and Mtq2p, that have strong sequence similarity to PrmC. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that Mtq1p and Mtq2p methylate Mrf1p and Sup45p, respectively, in vivo. A tryptic peptide of Mrf1p, GGQHVNTTDSAVR, containing the GGQ motif was found to be ∼50% methylated at the glutamine residue in the normal strain but completely unmodified in the peptide from mtq1-Δ. Moreover, Mtq1p methyltransferase activity was observed in an in vitro assay. In similar experiments, it was determined that Mtq2p methylates Sup45p. The Sup45p methylation by Mtq2p was recently confirmed independently (Heurgue-Hamard, V., Champ, S., Mora, L., Merkulova-Rainon, T., Kisselev, L. L., and Buckingham, R. H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 2439–2445). Analysis of the deletion mutants showed that although mtq1-Δ had only moderate growth defects on nonfermentable carbon sources, the mtq2-Δ had multiple phenotypes, including cold sensitivity and sensitivity to translation fidelity antibiotics paromomycin and geneticin, to high salt and calcium concentrations, to polymyxin B, and to caffeine. Also, the mitochondrial mit– mutation, cox2-V25, containing a premature stop mutation, was suppressed by mtq1-Δ. Most interestingly, the mtq2-Δ was significantly more resistant to the anti-microtubule drugs thiabendazole and benomyl, suggesting that Mtq2p may also methylate certain microtubule-related proteins. The translation release factors (RFs) RF1 and RF2 of Escherichia coli are methylated at the N5 -glutamine of the GGQ motif by PrmC methyltransferase.

Post-translational modification of proteins extends molecular structures beyond the limits imposed by the 20 encoded amino acids and, if reversible, allows a means of control and signaling. A wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins are methylated post-translationally, including, for example, cytochrome c, ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and histones (1Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Baton, FL1990: 1-451Google Scholar). The modifications occur by either N-methylation or carboxymethylation reactions, with the former reactions usually involving N-methylation of lysine, arginine, histidine, alanine, proline, glutamine, phenylalanine, asparagine, and methionine, whereas the latter reactions usually involving O-methylesterification of glutamic and aspartic acid. The enzymes catalyzing these methylation reactions generally use S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 4The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry time-of-flight analysis; RF, translation release factor; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; DTT, dithiothreitol; Oligo, oligonucleotide; TAP, tandem affinity purification; RT, reverse transcription. as the methyl donor to transfer the methyl group to the free amino group on the side chain of an amino acid residue (2Lhoest J. Colson C. Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Baton, FL1990: 61-92Google Scholar). The extent of methylation can be complete or almost complete, as in the case of cytochrome c, or can be partial, as in case of ribosomal proteins. Once incorporated, the methyl groups do not appear to be removed from most proteins. However, reversible methylation of glutamic acid residues is involved in the chemotactic response of bacteria (3Kim C. Jackson M. Lux R. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); also reversible methylation of the C subunit of the phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at a conserved C-terminal leucine residue regulates PP2A activity (4Tolstykh T. Lee J. Vafai S. Stock J.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5682-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, histones were recently shown to be demethylated at the N-terminal tails by the LSD1 enzyme, a process that impacts on chromatin structure and gene transcription (5Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). Protein methylation affects various important cell processes, including protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, protein nuclear trafficking, protein metabolism, cellular signaling, and other basic cellular phenomena (1Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Baton, FL1990: 1-451Google Scholar, 6McBride A.E. Silver P.A.

Although methylation does not change the overall charge of amino acid residues, addition of the methyl groups increases steric hindrance and removes amino hydrogens that might be involved in the formation of bonds. Therefore, methylation could serve to modulate intra- or intermolecular interactions of the target proteins. Particularly, modification of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA proteins, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors may affect their affinity to RNA or play auxiliary role in RNA binding. Methylation of the proteins involved in translation, including translation factors and ribosomal proteins, has been observed in diverse organisms, from Escherichia coli to higher eukaryotes. Furthermore, methylation of certain ribosomal protein orthologs, for example, E. coli L11, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae L12, and rat L12 and L3, as well as possibly methylation of translation release factors (RFs), is conserved throughout evolution (2Lhoest J. Colson C. Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Baton, FL1990: 61-92Google Scholar, 8Dincbas-Renqvist V. Engstrom A. Mora L. Heurgue-Harnard V. Buckingham R. Ehrenberg M.

RFs recognize the stop codon in the A site of the ribosome and transfer this stop signal to the peptidyltransferase center (10Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This induces the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA, thus releasing the nascent polypeptides, but the mechanisms of this reaction are not clearly understood (11Inge-Vechtomov S. Zhouravleva G. Philippe M. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). There are two RFs classes, I, which actually recognizes a stop codon, and II, a recycle factor for RFI, which is a GTPase (10Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In E. coli, two of the class I translation release factors, RF1 and RF2, are required for recognition of the translation termination stop codons; RF1 recognizes UAG and UAA and RF2 recognizes UAA and UGA (12Scolnick E.M. Tompkins R. Caskey C.T. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 13Beaudet A.L. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The corresponding genes of the class I release factors, RF1, RF2, and eRF1, are essential for viability in bacteria and yeast (11Inge-Vechtomov S. Zhouravleva G. Philippe M. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). RF3 (class II RF) enhances the activity of RF1 and RF2 in a GTP-dependent manner and catalyzes the dissociation of RFI from the ribosome following peptide release (15Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y.

In the yeast S. cerevisiae, the MRF1 gene encodes a protein more similar to the prokaryotic RF1 than to RF2, and the MRF1 gene is required for proper translation in mitochondria (27Towpik J.

Mrf1p recognizes only the termination codons UAA and UAG on mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes (25Askarian-Amiri M.E. Pel H.J. Geuvremont D. McCaughan K.K. Poole E.S. Sumpter V.G. Tate W.P. J.

The UGA codon is not a stop signal in yeast mitochondria (28Jukes U.P. Osawa S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1993; 106: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Bacterial RF1, mitochondrial RF1, and eRF1 are homologous proteins (supplemental Fig. 1), and although they are functionally similar, they belong to the different families and display differences in the protein domain structure (10Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, one tripeptide motif, the GGQ motif, is the most conserved feature of the release factors in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and Archaea (14Frolova L.Y. Le Goff X. Rasmussen H.H. Cheperegin S.

This motif was shown to be important for the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA (22Frolova L.Y. Merkulova T.I. Kisselev L.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that the glutamine residue in the release factor GGQ motif is involved in the coordination of the water molecule necessary for the hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond (29Song H.

S. cerevisiae Mrf1p and Sup45p (eRF1) have extensive sequence similarities to the bacterial RF1, including the predicted site of methylation, GGQ. The GGQ motif is essential for the function of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RFs, and mutations of the glutamine residue in E. coli and S. cerevisiae result in lethality (29Song H. Mugnier P.

Ehrenberg M. Kisselev L. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RF1 and RF2 proteins of E. coli are post-translationally methylated at the glutamine residue by PrmC (HemK) methyltransferase (31Heurgue-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstrom A. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32Nakahigashi K. Kubo N. Narita S.-I. Shimaoka T. Goto S. Oshima T. Mori H. Maeda M. Wada C. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has been confirmed in another study that the glutamine residues of the GGQ motif at position 235 in RF1 and at position 252 in RF2 are indeed N5-methylated (8Dincbas-Renqvist V. Engstrom A. Mora L. Heurgue-Harnard V. Buckingham R. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, methylation of glutamine at position 252 in the GGQ motif of E. coli RF2 correlates with increased efficiency of translation termination (8Dincbas-Renqvist V. Engstrom A. Mora L. Heurgue-Harnard V. Buckingham R. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The E. coli ribosomal protein L3 is the only other protein known to have an N5 -methylglutamine modification (33Lhoest J. Colson C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to high similarities of the protein sequences for translation release factors in bacteria and yeast, including the conserved GGQ motif, the proteins similar to E. coli PrmC methyltransferase could be identified in yeast as well. The protein methyltransferases responsible for these modifications generally have conserved functional domains, responsible for binding of the cofactor AdoMet. The orthologs of these protein methyltransferases share common functional domains, and consequently potential protein methyltransferases can be identified by sequence comparisons. To identify those methyltransferases that may modify the yeast translation release factors, we have searched the yeast S. cerevisiae proteome for potential candidates; this search revealed the two yeast proteins, Ynl063wp and Ydr140wp, that had strong sequence similarity to the E. coli PrmC (Fig. 1). The corresponding genes will be referred to as MTQ1 and MTQ2, respectively. In this study we demonstrated that the yeast S. cerevisiae protein methyltransferases, Mtq1p and Mtq2p, methylate Mrf1p and Sup45p (eRF1), respectively, in vivo. We also tested the methyltransferase activity of Mtq1p and Mtq2p in vitro and the phenotypes of the corresponding deletion mutants. Although mtq1-Δ strains had only slightly diminished growth on YPG medium, the mtq2-Δ strains showed multiple phenotypes, including cold sensitivity and sensitivity to translation fidelity antibiotics paromomycin and geneticin, to high salt and calcium concentrations, to polymyxin B, and to caffeine. Most interestingly, the mtq2-Δ mutant was significantly more resistant to the anti-mitotic drugs thiabendazole and benomyl as compared with the normal strain. While this work was in progress, Heurgue-Hamard et al. (35Heurgue-Hamard V. Champ S. Mora L. Merkulova-Rainon T. Kisselev L.L. Bucking ham R.H. J. Biol.

Yeast Strains—The strains of S. cerevisiae used in this study are listed in Table 1. The analysis of N5 -glutamine methylation was carried out with two isogenic series, which were derived from the following parental strains: B-8114 (MATa CYC1 cyc7-67 lys5-10 ura3-52) and B-14276 (MATα his3Δ0 leu2Δ0 lysΔ0 ura3Δ0).

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Other media contain 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, and either 2% ethanol (YPE), 2% glycerol and 1% ethanol (YPEG), or 2% raffinose. Unless stated otherwise, yeast strains were grown at 30 °C. Certain phenotypes of the mtq1-Δ and mtq2-Δ strains were determined with YPD medium containing the following amounts of different agents: 1 m NaCl; 1 m KCl; 0.3 m CaCl2; 0.15% caffeine; 200 –1200 μg/ml paromomycin; 50 –75 μg/ml geneticin (G418); 100–200 μg/ml polymyxin B; 25–50 μg/ml thiabendazole; and 10 –30 μg/ml benomyl. Construction of the Deletion Mutants—Standard molecular biological procedures were used to generate deletions. The MTQ1, MTQ2, and MRF1 genes were disrupted by replacing portions of the genes with the URA3 gene of Kluveromyces lactis or the kanMX4 gene produced by PCR and then using the appropriate fragment for yeast transformation. For example, primers Oligo1 and Oligo2 (Table 2) and plasmid pAB2630 (pBS1539) were used to prepare the PCR fragment, which were used in the construction of the mtq1-Δ::URA3 disruption. After yeast transformation, the correct disruptions among the transformants were identified by PCR, using the set of primers Oligo3 and Oligo4. Similarly, the DNA fragment required for producing the mtq2-Δ::URA3 disruption was prepared with Oligo5 and Oligo6 and plasmid pAB2630. The transformants were screened by PCR with Oligo7 and Oligo8. To obtain mtq1, mtq2, and mrf1 deletion strains with the marker kanMX4 in the B-8114 background, yeast genomic DNAs, which were prepared from the corresponding ORF::kanMX4 deletion strain (Invitrogen), were used as template for PCR with primers Oligo3 and 4, Oligo7 and 8, and Oligo14 and 15, respectively.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used in the construction and testing of the disrupted genesOpen reading frameOligonucleotideSequence (5′ → 3′)MTQ1Oligo1(-26) CTCTTCCCCTTAACTCGTAGACAAGGAGCGATAGTTGAATGGTAGGCATTGGATGGTGGTAACGMTQ1Oligo2(+1016) TCCACAGAGTGTTCCGTTTGATAACTTCCAACAAAAAAACCTGAGCCATTAAGTTGATCCATTGMTQ1Oligo3(-51) GGAGCGATAGTTGAATGGTAGGMTQ1Oligo4(+993) AACTTCCAACAAAAAAACCTGAGMTQ2Oligo5(-50) CTCTGAAATATAATATTGATAAACTTAACACAGGGTGAGAAAGGTGATTGGATGGTGGTAACGCMTQ2Oligo6(+707) GACACAGGTTATCAATTATAACGTGAAAGGTTTTGCAACTGTCACCTTAAGTTGATCCATTGTGMTQ2Oligo7(-100) CCGAAGACGCCATCGGAATTTGMTQ2Oligo8(+719) CGCTTTGAGTAAAGACACAGGTSUP45Oligo9(+1264) GAGGATGAATATTATGACGAAGATGAAGGATCCGACTATGATTTCTCCATGGAAAAGAGAAGSUP45Oligo10(+1390) AGCGAATTTAATTTAAATCTGGCATCTAGTGATTAAATTCTTTTTGTACGACTCACTATAGGGSUP45Oligo11(-151) CCAGTGCTAAGCGTCAAATCASUP45Oligo12(+1485) TCCTCTAAACCCACTATGTACSUP45Oligo13(+1111) GAATGGCTAGCAGCTAACTACMRF1Oligo14(-44) TGAAAAGTTCGTAGAGCAGAACMRF1Oligo15(+1294) CAGAAGTGATAGATACGATATGMTQ1Oligo16(-7) AGAACATATGGTCGACATATCTACATCATTGMTQ1Oligo17(+956) CATTTATATACTGGATCCCAATTAGCTTTGTGMTQ2Oligo18(-6) TGAAGTATGCTCGAGACCCCTTATGTAMTQ2Oligo19(+667) GTCACCTTGGATCCCTGTACACACTGACOX2Oligo20(+798) GCATATTTGCATGACCTGTCCCCOX2Oligo21(+171) ATTTTCAGGATTCAGCAACACCCOX2Oligo22(+720) ACTTGATTTAATCTACCAGGAGACT1Oligo23(+702) AGAAGATTGAGCAGCGGTTTGCACT1Oligo24(+73) GACGCTCCTCGTGCTGTCTTCCACT1Oligo25(+646) GTTTTTCCTTGATGTCACGGAC Open table in a new tab Construction of the SUP45::TAP Yeast Strain—The SUP45::TAP strain was made by a PCR-based technique with Oligo9 and Oligo10 and with plasmid pAB2630 (pBS1539) as a template (Table 2). B-8114 was transformed with the resulting PCR product containing the SUP45::TAP::URA3 DNA fragment, and the transformants were screened by amplifying the SUP45 locus with Oligo11 and Oligo12. The SUP45::TAP from the positive clones was amplified by PCR, and the insert was sequenced to confirm the correct in-frame fusion. In addition, the cell extract of the positive strain, B-15543, was probed with peroxidase-anti-peroxidase complex antibody that recognizes the TAP tag within proteins. Because B-15543 grew similar to the normal strain, without a detectable phenotype, the SUP45::TAP fusion was inferred to be completely functional. It is important to note that SUP45, unlike MRF1, is an essential gene, and the sup45 deletion mutant is not viable. Also, MRF1::TAP was completely functional, although the mrf1-Δ strain does not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. Test for Suppression of the Readthrough Accuracy Using the cox2-V25 Mutant—Testing gene deletions for readthrough accuracy in mitochondrial translation was performed by using strains B-15594, normal, and B-15593 that contain the cox2-V25 allele, which has an early premature stop codon that interrupts the COX2 gene (37Boguta M. Zoladek T. Putrament A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 2087-2097PubMed Google Scholar). These tester strains were obtained from Dr. M. Boguta (Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland). mtq1-Δ deletions were made in both strains B-15594 and B-15593 by replacing the MTQ1 gene with the kanMX4 gene, as described above, to produce B-15598 and B-15599, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, mtq2-Δ strains B-15891 and B-15890 were made from B-15594 and B-15593, respectively. Subsequently, all strains were tested on YP0.1%DG medium. The level of mitochondrial Cox2p expression was determined by Western blot analysis, using cell extracts of the yeast strains grown on YPDG and using mouse monoclonal anti-Cox2p antibody (a gift from Dr. T. Fox, Cornell University). We also used actin antibody as loading control (rabbit polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. A. Bretscher, Cornell University). The following isogenic series of strains were used: normal B-15594 (mit+); B-15593 (cox2-V25); and each of the strains containing mtq1-Δ or mtq2-Δ (Table 1). Yeast cell extract preparation, protein separation by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and probing with antibody were performed by standard techniques (38Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M.

Total yeast RNA was extracted by standard procedures with phenol: chloroform treatment of the glass-bead disrupted cells. The RNA samples were normalized after measuring their absorbance at 280/260 nm and were tested by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. COX2 and ACT1 cDNAs were obtained with ThermoScript RT-PCR System kit (Invitrogen) using gene-specific oligonucleotides 20 and 23, respectively (Table 2). Subsequently, specific DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with nested oligonucleotides 21 and 22 for COX2 and oligonucleotide 24 and 25 for ACT1. The expected PCR products of 550 bp for COX2 and 574 bp for ACT1 were observed in 1% agarose gel. MTQ1 and MTQ2 Overexpression in Bacterial System—Cloning of the MTQ1 and MTQ2 genes for overexpression in the E. coli pET system was performed by using PCR with oligonucleotides Oligo16 and Oligo17 for MTQ1 and Oligo18 and Oligo19 for MTQ2 (Table 2). Genomic DNA prepared from the normal yeast strain served as template for PCR, and the primers were designed to introduce XhoI and BamHI restriction sites to both ends of the resulting PCR products (Table 2). This allowed for the direct cloning of DNA fragments containing the modified MTQ1 and MTQ2 genes into the pET15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) that is used for making polyhistidine-tagged proteins. The positive transformants containing inserts were sequenced to confirm the correct in-frame fusion for MTQ1 and MTQ2 genes; subsequently the corresponding cell extracts were tested with anti-polyhistidine antibody (Sigma). The plasmids containing N-His6-MTQ1 and -MTQ2 were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 that is designed for production of proteins.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have recently been shown to be up-regulated in gastric epithelial cells infected with H. pylori and might contribute to the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer. The aim of this study was to extend the knowledge about the effect of H. pylori infection on MMP-1 expression by gastric epithelial cells, the kinetics of induction, the pathogenetic properties of the bacterium, and the intracellular signaling pathways required for MMP-1 up-regulation. Expression of MMP-1 was induced more than 10-fold by co-culture of AGS+cells with H. pylori strains carrying the pathogenicity island (PAI). H. pylori strains with mutations in the PAI and a defective type IV secretion system had no effect on MMP-1. Double immunofluorescence revealed strong MMP-1 staining in epithelial cells of gastric biopsies at sites of bacterial attachment. In vitro, MMP-1 is up-regulated by interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, but these regulatory mechanisms are not operating in H. pylori infection as shown by inhibitory antibodies. Specific inhibitors of JNK kinase and ERK1/2 kinase were found to suppress the H. pylori-induced MMP-1 expression and activity. AGS cells treated with antisense MMP-1 showed a significantly reduced potential to degrade reconstituted basement membrane. Our results suggest that in gastric epithelial cells, H. pylori up-regulates MMP-1 in a type IV secretion system-dependent manner via JNK and ERK1/2. Induction of MMP-1 is further implicated in complex processes induced by H. pylori, resulting in tissue degradation and remodeling of the gastric mucosa.

In response to H. pylori occurs an enhanced release of cytokines and chemokines, which, in turn, stimulates gastric epithelial cells to produce matrix-degrading enzymes implicated in connective tissue remodeling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), embedded in a complex network of proteases, are involved in turnover and remodeling of extracellular matrix components, which in turn activate other assorted proteins, including growth factors and protease inhibitors (18Lynch C.C. Matrisian L.M. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 19Mott J.D. Werb Z. Curr. Opin.

Activity of MMPs is regulated both at the level of gene expression and in proteolytic activity control. MMP mRNA expression can be induced by growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and oncogene products. Once translated, MMPs were rapidly secreted in a proenzyme form, which could be activated by proteolytic cleavage and inhibited by their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) (21Zucker S. Pei D. Cao J. Lopez-Otin C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different MMPs and TIMPs have been reported to be overexpressed in gastric cancer, and a role in gastric cancer invasion and peritoneal metastasis was suggested. Recent studies have addressed the potential role of gastric MMPs and their inhibitors in early stages of gastric carcinogenesis. Besides the overexpression of MT1-MMP (22Koyama S. Scand. J.

NF-κB is also essential for H. pylori-induced activation of MMP-9 gene expression (29Mori N. Sato H. Hayashibara T. Senba M. Geleziunas R. Wada A. Hirayama T. Yamamoto N. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 983-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed how H. pylori elicits the up-regulation of MMP-1 in gastric epithelial cells. We tried to ascertain the pathogenetic factors of H. pylori indispensable for the MMP-1 induction and the signals and regulatory pathways stimulated by exposure to H. pylori, which are mostly relevant for the overexpression of MMP-1 and the increase of basement membrane destruction in response to the pathogen. Cell Culture and H. pylori Infection—The human gastric epithelial cells (AGS) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (PAA, Linz, Austria) medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and antibiotics/antimycotics (PAA). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The adherent cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Prior to functional assays, 0.02% EDTA (Sigma) was alternatively used to avoid the destruction of cell surface antigens. Cells were counted in the Coulter Counter ZII (Coulter Immunotech, Marseille, France). The cells were infected with H. pylori according to the protocol of Churin et al. (17Churin Y. Al-Ghoul L. Kepp O. Meyer T.F. Birchmeier W. Naumann M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). H. pylori strains were cultured on agar plates containing 10% horse serum under microaerophilic conditions at 37 °C for 48 h. For the infection, bacteria were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and added to the serum-starved host cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50. We used wild-type H. pylori strain P1; isogenic mutant strains cagA and virB7; and wild-type strain Hp26695; and isogenic mutant strains HpPAI, Hp0539, and Hp0543. cDNA Array Analysis—We used the GEArray Q series Human Tumor Metastasis Array designed to establish the expression profile of 96 genes important in tumor metastasis (Superarray Bioscience Corp., Bethesda, MD). The complete list of genes can be found at the Superarray web site. Total RNA was prepared by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Two micrograms of RNA was reverse transcribed, and the probe was simultaneously labeled using the AmpoLabeling-LRP Kit (Superarray Bioscience Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization, washing steps, hybridization, and chemiluminescence detection were carried out following the protocol of the manufacturer. Array images were detected using the Syngene BIO Imaging system. The raw signal intensities were corrected for background by subtracting the signal intensities of the average of the three negative controls and the four blanks, and were expressed as -fold changes given as the relative expression ratio: gene/housekeeping gene. Quantification of mRNA by RT-PCR—Using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), we extracted total cellular RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)12-18 primers by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Amplification of selected cDNA was done with the primer pairs listed in Table 1. Integrity of RNA and adequate cDNA synthesis were confirmed by using 18 S RNA specific primers. The lengths of the resulting amplification products in base pairs are given in Table 1. Complete PCR were initially heated to 94 °C for 5 min for denaturation, and specific fragments were amplified in 30 cycles (0.5 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50-60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The PCR products were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and scanned. All oligo-nucleotide primers were custom synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium).TABLE 1Sequences of PCR primers, length of PCR products, and optimal annealing temperaturePrimers (5′-3′)SenseAntisenseTemplateAnnealingbp°CMMP-1CTGAAGGTGATGAAGCAGCCAGTCCAAGAGAATGGCCGAG42857MMP-3CTCACAGACCTGACTCGGTTCACGCCTGAAGGAAGAGATG29457uPACTTGCTGAAGATCCGTTCCATCTTCCTTGGTGTGACTGCG44760TIMP-1CTGTTGTTGCTGTGGCTGATACCGTCCACAAGCAATGAGT4815718 S RNACGGCTACCACATCCAAGGGCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT18650 Open table in a new tab Patient Populations—Biopsy specimens were obtained from 15 patients who had undergone upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the University Hospital Magdeburg. The patients included in the study had to be older than 18 years. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. H. pylori infection was detected by the urease breath test, rapid urease test, and histological examination. Six patients were H. pylori positive (3 cag+ patients) and 9 patients had no H. pyloriinfection. The patients without H. pylori infection had clinical indications, such as dyspeptic symptoms or gastroesophageal reflux disease, making upper gastrointestinal endoscopy necessary. The investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the local Ethics Committee. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in ethanol. The tissue was blocked in 10% horse serum/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Helicobacter antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:50 and monoclonal anti-MMP-1 antibody (Calbiochem, distributed by Merck) diluted 1:100, each for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline/Triton, primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and Texas red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:100 for 2 h at 37 °C. The tissue sections were thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline/Triton and mounted in VECTASHIELD® mounting medium with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). The specimens were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMRE7, Leica Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (Spot RT, Diagnostic Instruments, Burroughs, MI) and a 20/1.25 objective. Separate images were taken in the corresponding channels, and later merged using the Photoshop® software. Image acquisition of the controls and data processing were carried out under the same conditions. Protein Extraction and Quantification—Tissue samples were homogenized in phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm E-64, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using sonication. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 10,000 × g. Protein contents were measured in all samples using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). MMP-1 Protein Secretion and Activity—Culture supernatants were 10-fold concentrated in Centricon® centrifugal filter devices (molecular mass cutoff, 30 kDa) (VIVAScience, Hannover, Germany). The supernatants and tissue homogenates were reduced by adding 5× Laemmli buffer containing 20% dithiothreitol and were boiled. 25-μl Supernatants or 50 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% dry milk in TBS/Tween and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with monoclonal anti-MMP-1 antibody (1:100) (Calbiochem). This was followed by incubation with the secondary, peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:25,000) for 30 min. West Pico Supersignal substrate (Perbio, Bonn, Germany) was left on the membrane until distinct bands had developed. A MagicMark standard (Invitrogen) was used to identify the molecular weights. The ECL membrane images were quantified using the GeneGnome and GeneTools image scanning and analysis package (Syngene BioImaging Systems, Synoptics Ltd.). Measurement of secreted active MMP-1 was performed using Fluorokine® E Human active MMP-1 Fluorescent Assay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 150-μl culture supernatants (unconcentrated) were applied from each sample. Cell Treatment—The recombinant human IL-1β, human IL-6, human TNF-α, human transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and human IL-8 were purchased from R&D Systems. The NF-κB inhibitor SN50, p38 inhibitor SB203580, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 were purchased from Calbiochem; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDT) was purchased from Sigma; the NF-κB inhibitor IKK-NBD from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany); and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 from BioSource (Nivelles, Belgium). The neutralizing antibodies nTGF-β, nIL-1β, nTNF-α, and nIL-6 were purchased from R&D Systems. The AGS cells were seeded onto 3-cm Petri dishes (5 × 105 cells/dish), serum-starved for 24 h, and infected or not with H. pylori. The following concentrations of reagents were used: 50 ng/ml for each cytokine; 10 μm of each inhibitor; 1.2 μg/ml of nTGF-β, 1.0 μg/ml of nIL-1β, 0.08 μg/ml of nTNF-α, and 3.0 μg/ml of nIL-6. Quantification of Specific mRNA by Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR— Assays were performed on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics). Several dilutions of plasmids containing the cDNA fragments of the different genes were used as internal controls. For plasmid construction, the cDNA fragments were amplified using primers for: MMP-1, 5′-CTGAAGGTGAT-GAAGCAGCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGTCCAAGAGAATGGCCGAG-3′ (antisense); and 18 S RNA, 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3′ (antisense). The same primers were used for quantitative PCR. PCR products were inserted into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The copy number of the resulting plasmids was calculated after DNA quantification. Using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), we extracted total cellular RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)12-18 primers by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR were done with the quantitative PCR Mastermix kit (Qbiogene, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The standard temperature profile included initial denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 0 s, annealing at 50 °C or 57 °C (primer dependent) for 5 s, and an extension at 72 °C for 11 s. The PCR products were checked on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. All oligonucleotide primers were custom synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Antisense Oligonucleotides—The antisense oligonucleotide (asMMP-1) used in this study was complementary to the AUG codon of the MMP-1 mRNA: 5′-GGAAAGCTGTGCATACTGGC-3′. A random oligonucleotide was used as a control (nsODN): 5′-TGTAGT-CAGTTGAGTTAGAT-3′. Both oligonucleotides were protected against exo and endonucleases by phosphorothioate backbones. The uptake of oligonucleotides in cultured cells was monitored by 3′-fluorescein isothiocyanate labeling. Transfection was performed as described previously (31Krueger S. Kellner U. Buehling F. Roessner A. Cancer Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 10 μmasMMP-1 or the nsODN oligonucleotides was added to the culture medium without a transfection reagent. The ability of the antisense oligonucleotide to decrease the MMP-1 mRNA and protein level (concentrated culture supernatants) was controlled by quantitative RT-PCR and in Western blots 24 h after transfection. In Vitro Invasion Assay—Cellular invasion of AGS cells infected with H. pylori was evaluated in 24-well Transwell chambers (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany) as described previously (32Krueger S. Haeckel C. Buehling F. Roessner A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6010-6014PubMed Google Scholar). The upper and lower culture compartments were separated by polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pore size. Prior to the invasion assays, the polycarbonate filters were coated with 100 μg of Matrigel matrix per cm2. AGS cells (1.5 × 105/per well) were preincubated on the reconstituted basement membrane for 3 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium. Following infection with H. pylori strains, cells were incubated for 24 h in the invasion chambers. Cells passing the filters and attaching to the lower sites of Matrigelcoated membranes (invasive cells) were harvested using trypsin/EDTA; the cell number was quantified in a Coulter Counter ZII. The percentage of invasive cells was calculated from controls grown under identical culture conditions for 24 h in 48-well plates. All quantifications were performed in triplicate. Statistics—Mean values and standard deviations were calculated to describe the data population. Statistical analyses were performed using the Chi 2The abbreviations used are: PAI, pathogenicity island; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; T4SS, type IV secretion system; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; RT, reverse transcriptase; TGF, transforming growth factor; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator. test (immunohistochemistry) or the Student's t test. p values of < 0.05 (*) were considered significant. Analysis of mRNA Expression for Genes Known to Be Involved in Extracellular Matrix Remodeling by Gastic Epithelial Cells after Coculture with H. pylori—To characterize changes in the gene expression profile of gastric epithelial cells in response to H. pylori (wild-type strain P1), we performed cDNA microarray analysis using the GEArray Q Series Human Tumor Metastasis Gene Array (Biomol), which contains 96 genes including growth factors and their receptors, extracellular matrix components, proteases and their inhibitors, oncogenes and suppressors, and other related genes. We used mRNA isolated from AGS cells compared with mRNA of AGS cells co-cultivated for 24 h with H. pylori strain P1 (m.o.i. 50). The majority of genes examined showed only small differences in expression. However, there were 15 different genes (Table 2), the expression of which was more than 2-fold up-regulated by infection with H. pylori. Interestingly, 10 of these 15 genes were proteases or protease inhibitors, whereas only one cell-matrix molecule or oncogene was found to be up-regulated. The most abundant gene found to be up-regulated 25-fold was MMP-1, followed by MMP-3 (12.5-fold) and MMP-8 (5.3-fold). Down-regulated genes were not involved in this study. To confirm the results of cDNA microarray analysis, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1). Control RT-PCRs on primary cultures of gastric epithelial cells revealed similar results, allowing for the reproduction of the results obtained from carcinoma cells as shown in Table 2 (data not shown).TABLE 2Analysis of mRNA expression for genes known to be involved in extracellular matrix remodeling by gastic epithelial cells after coculture with H. pylori-FoldProteasesMMP-125.0MMP-314.3MMP-87.2MMP-74.0MMP-103.5uPA3.1Protease inhibitorsPAI-27.9Maspin4.5TIMP-12.8Growth factors and receptorsNGF-β6.1TGF-β2.0Signal transduction moleculesuPAR5.8Rac12.0Cell-cell, cell-matrix interaction MoleculesNCAM-13.5Oncogenesc-src2.2 Open table in a new tab MMP-1 Overexpression in Gastric Mucosa Is Associated with H. pylori Infection—To analyze the effects of H. pylori-induced inflammation on MMP-1 production in vivo, we localized MMP-1 expression in gastric biopsy specimens. Double immunofluorescence revealed strong expression of MMP-1 (red fluorescence) in epithelial cells of H. pylori-infiltrated (green fluorescence) foveolae (Fig. 2m C, D, and F), whereas none of the H. pylori-negative foveolae showed this strong positivity for MMP-1 (Fig. 2, A, B, and E). Staining of MMP-1 was localized mainly to sites of bacterial infection and was also identified in fibroblasts. H. pylori Induces MMP-1 Overexpression in Gastric Epithelial Cells in Vivo and in Vitro—The analysis of the MMP-1 protein expression pattern in gastric biopsies indicates that MMP-1 is not or only weakly expressed in normal gastric mucosa, but significantly up-regulated in biopsies of H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa (Fig. 3). The two patients with very high levels of MMP-1 were infected with cag+ strains. These data were consistent with the immunohistochemical results and correspond to the array data. The time course of MMP-1 gene expression and secretion in response to H. pylori infection was investigated in AGS cells by Western blot analysis and in an activity assay. Significant H. pylori stimulation (wild-type strain P1, m.o.i. 50) of MMP-1 protein secretion was observed after 4 h. Active MMP-1 increased significantly within 20 h of stimulation (Fig. 4). We next determined whether induction of MMP-1 overexpression depended on pathogenetic factors that vary among H. pylori strains. AGS cells were cocultured for 24 h with the wild-type H. pylori strains P1 and Hp26695 or the corresponding mutant strains cagA, virB7, HpPAI, Hp0543, and Hp0539. Like the wild-type strains, the isogenic cagA and Hp0543 mutant strains induced high MMP-1 expression. The cagA mutant does not show CagA expression and the Hp0543 mutant is defective in CagA translocation, but both mutants still induce activation of JNK and NF-κB (16Al-Ghoul L. Wessler S.

Thus, H. pylori-induced MMP-1 expression is CagA-independent. The mutant strains HpPAI, Hp0539, and virB7, which are either missing or defective in the T4SS, completely failed to increase MMP-1 expression and activity (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5MMP-1 induction by H. pylori is PAI-dependent.

https://openalex.org/W1975418052,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid that acts both as an extracellular ligand for endothelial differentiation gene receptor family and as an intracellular second messenger. Cellular levels of S1P are low and tightly regulated by sphingosine kinase (SPK). Recent studies have suggested that eNOS pathway may function as a downstream target for the biological effects of receptor-mediated S1P. Here we have studied the possible interplay between intracellular SIP generation and the eNOS activation pathway. S1P causes an endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in rat aorta that is PTX sensitive, inhibited by L-NAME that involves eNOS phosphorylation, and mainly dependent on hsp90. When rat aorta rings were incubated with the SPK inhibitor DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DTD), there was a concentration-dependent reduction of Ach-induced vasorelaxation, implying a consistent contribution of sphingolipid pathway through intracellular sphingosine release and phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments consistently showed increased association of hsp90 with eNOS after exposure of cells to S1P as well to BK or calcium ionophore A-23187. Interestingly, as opposite to A-23187, BK and S1P effect were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with the SPK inhibitor DTD. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that an interplay exists among eNOS, hsp90, and intracellularly generated S1P where eNOS coupling to hsp90 is a major determinant for NO release as confirmed by our functional and molecular studies."
https://openalex.org/W2003558607,"ATP is released in many cell types upon mechanical strain, the physiological function of extracellular ATP is largely unknown, however. Here we report that ATP released upon hypotonic stress stimulated prostate cancer cell proliferation, activated purinergic receptors, increased intracellular [Ca2+]i, and initiated downstream signaling cascades that involved MAPKs ERK1/2 and p38 as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). MAPK activation, the calcium response as well as induction of cell proliferation upon hypotonic stress were inhibited by preincubation with the ATP scavenger apyrase, indicating that hypotonic stress-induced signaling pathways are elicited by released ATP. Hypotonic stress increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. Consequently, ATP release was inhibited by antagonists of PI3K (LY294002 and wortmannin), phospholipase A2 (methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP)), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (indomethacin, etodolac, NS398) and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), which are involved in arachidonic acid metabolism. Furthermore, ATP release was abolished in the presence of the adenylate cyclase (AC) inhibitor MDL-12,330A, indicating regulation of ATP-release by cAMP. The hypotonic stress-induced ATP release was significantly blunted when the ATP-mediated signal transduction cascade was inhibited on different levels, i.e. purinergic receptors were blocked by suramin and pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS), the Ca2+ response was inhibited upon chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), and ERK1,2 as well as p38 were inhibited by UO126 and SB203580, respectively.

In summary our data demonstrate that hypotonic stress initiates a feed forward cycle of ATP release and purinergic receptor signaling resulting in proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Cytosolic concentrations of ATP typically amount to ∼3-5 mm, whereas the extracellular concentration is very low (0.1-1 μm) (1Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Despite the huge concentration gradient, ATP and other nucleotides cannot permeate cell membranes due to their negative charge. However, during recent years it has become evident that in many different cell types distinct physiological mechanisms for ATP release exist (2Burnstock G. J.

The nucleotides released to the extracellular medium may stimulate purinergic receptors in autocrine and paracrine manner and activate downstream signaling cascades (5Insel P.A. Ostrom R.S. Zambon A.C. Hughes R.J. Balboa M.A. Shehnaz D. Gregorian C. Torres B. Firestein B.L. Xing M. Post S.R. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ATP can be released to the extracellular milieu under pathophysiological conditions such as hypoxia, mechanical and osmotic strain, as well as following cytolysis (4Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The lifetime of released ATP is short, however, due to the presence of ecto-ATPase, ecto-apyrase, and 5′-nucleotidase. This short half-lifetime of extracellular ATP has led to the suggestion that ATP and other purinergic agonists are only biologically active in the close microenvironment of the tissues (4Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that already concentrations as low as 0.1-10 μm are active, which means that the cells need only release <0.1% of their cellular ATP content to achieve a biological signal that is transduced in autocrine and paracrine manner to more distant areas (1Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms for the controlled release of ATP from cells have been reported previously: (i) in platelets (6Randriamboavonjy V. Schrader J. Busse R. Fleming I. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), neuronal cells (7Jo Y.H. Schlichter R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and pancreatic β cells (8Hazama A. Hayashi S. Okada Y. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 437: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) ATP is stored in concentrations up to 1 m within intracellular vesicles. It has been discussed that ATP stored in intracellular vesicles is active as neurotransmitter or cotransmitter/coagonist together with classical neurotransmitters or histamine (6Randriamboavonjy V. Schrader J. Busse R. Fleming I. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). (ii) Non-secretory release of ATP and related nucleotides occurs via adenine-nucleotide transporters, which are driven by the ATP concentration gradient across the plasma membrane (9Brustovetsky N. Becker A. Klingenberg M. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These transporters are expressed in mitochondrial membranes, within the endo- and sarko-plasmic reticulum, as well as in the membranes of chromaffin granula and synaptic vesicles of rat neuronal cells (10Schwiebert E.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). (iii) ATP release has been shown to occur via connexin hemichannels (11Stout C.E. Costantin J.L. Naus C.C.

(iv) ATP can be released through anion channels, associated to the ABC transporter family, e.g. the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 2The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; ETYA, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; MAFP, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate; PPADS, pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; AC, adenylate cyclase; PLA2, phospholipase A2.

Further ATP-conducting channels are the outward rectifying Cl- channel, the voltage-dependent anion channel of the plasma membrane (porin), or maxi-Cl- channels (10Schwiebert E.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, an ATP-permeable channel, which conducts ATP under hyperpolarizing conditions, was described in Xenopus oocytes, which was 4000 times more permeable for ATP than Cl- under hyperpolarizing conditions (16Bodas E. Aleu J. Pujol G. Martin-Satue M. Marsal J. Solsona C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20268-20273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of regulation of ATP release are currently not sufficiently explored nor is there any consent about the physiological function of released ATP. Previously it has been shown that the arachidonic acid metabolism, which results in the formation of cAMP, is involved in signaling via P2Y purinergic receptors (17Post S.R. Jacobson J.P. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2029-2032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which points toward a cAMP regulation of ATP release mechanisms (5Insel P.A. Ostrom R.S. Zambon A.C. Hughes R.J. Balboa M.A. Shehnaz D. Gregorian C. Torres B. Firestein B.L. Xing M. Post S.R. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to investigate signaling pathways which relay the mitogenic effect of ATP on DU-145 prostate cancer cells previously reported by us (18Sauer H. Klimm B. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2539-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the signaling cascade that regulates ATP release under mechanical strain (hyposmotic) conditions. Our data point toward a cAMP-regulated pathway of ATP release which results in a feed forward cycle of purinergic receptor stimulation and growth stimulation of prostate cancer cells. Materials—SB203580, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), LY294002, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), wortmannin, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), MDL-12,330A, etodolac, indomethacin, and NS398 were from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). UO126, pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS), and apyrase were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Culture Technique of DU-145 Prostate Cancer Cells—The human prostate cancer cell line DU-145 was used throughout the whole study. The cell line was grown routinely in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (BD Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) in 5% CO2, humidified air at 37 °C with Ham’s F-10 medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm minimal essential medium, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Bioluminescence Experiments—ATP release from confluent DU-145 cells was determined using a luciferin-luciferase assay (Sigma) in a chemiluminescence apparatus (Bioluminiscence Analyzer XP2000, SKAN, Basel, Switzerland) under dim light. For data sampling, the output of the photomultiplier tube of the setup was connected to a multimeter (Voltcraft M-3610D, Conrad Electronics, Hirschau, Germany) and a personal computer. Cells grown to confluence on 20 × 20-mm coverslips were washed five times in E1 buffer, containing in mm: 85 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 85 sucrose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 at 23 °C). Cells were subsequently immersed in 1 ml of hypotonic E1 cell culture medium from which sucrose was omitted, resulting in an osmolality of 150 mosmol/kgH2O. In control experiments, cells grown to confluence on coverslips were immersed in an equal volume of isotonic medium. For the experiments with inhibitors, cells were preincubated for 2 h in isotonic E1 buffer that was supplemented with the respective inhibitor. Subsequently, cells were immersed in 1 ml of hypotonic E1 buffer supplemented with inhibitors. After different times, during which the cells were gently shaken, a 200-μl aliquot was removed and pressure injected via a light-tight access into a 3-ml glass cuvette containing 50 μl of the ATP assay mix and 1.5 ml of ATP assay mix dilution buffer (Sigma). Calibration measurements with ATP were performed in a concentration range of 0-100 nm. The lowest concentration of ATP that could be detected under the applied experimental conditions was 0.5 nm. The half-life time of extracellular ATP in the presence of cells was determined to ∼5 min. From the calibration curves the total picomoles of ATP released per 105 cells were calculated. The chemiluminescence output curve was integrated, and the resulting values were set in relation to the calibration curve. To correlate ATP release to the cell number, the cells from which ATP release had been determined were enzymatically dissociated with a 0.2% trypsin, 0.05% EDTA solution, and the cells were counted using a Neubauer chamber. Ca2+ Imaging—DU-145 prostate cancer cells grown on coverslips were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3-AM (10 μm) (Molecular Probes) dissolved in Me2SO. Following incubation for 30 min cells were washed in isotonic E1 solution and mounted to a perfusion chamber fixed to the stage of the confocal setup. Fluo-3 fluorescence was excited by the 488-nm band of the argion-ion laser of a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2, Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Emission was recorded at >515-nm. Fluorescence images (512 × 512 pixels) were taken at 1-s intervals; the fluorescence intensity changes were integrated in single cells by the physiology software of the confocal setup. BrdUrd Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were cultured on 12-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates until they were 70% confluent and subsequently incubated in serum-free medium for 8 h. After serum-free medium incubation cells were treated with either isotonic E1 buffer in the absence or presence of ATP or hypotonic E1 (for 20 min) and incubated in cell culture medium with 10 μm BrdUrd substance (Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) for 18 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 40 min. Denaturation of DNA was achieved with 2 n HCl for 30 min at 37 °C followed by neutralization with 100 mm boric acid for 10 min. To avoid unspecific binding of antibodies cells were incubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% Triton X-100 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% bovine serum albumin and subsequently treated with rat anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:50) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h followed by a 1-h incubation with Cy5-conjugated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). For nuclear counter-staining BrdUrd-labeled cells were incubated with Sytox green nuclear stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min. PGE2 Assay—Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and treated either with isotonic or hypotonic E1 buffer. Volumes of 50 μl of the incubation buffer were collected following 20 min of incubation and assayed for PGE2 by using PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit monoclonal (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance of the product was read at 405 nm in a microplate reader (Dynatech, MR7000), and data were expressed as picograms of PGE2 per milliliter. According to the manufacturer, this assay system has a specificity of 100% for PGE2 and PGE2 ethanolamide and 43 and 18.7% for PGE3 and PGE1, respectively. Other prostanoids have specificities of 0.01-1%. Immunohistochemical Techniques and Quantitative Immunohistochemistry—Monoclonal anti-human-Ki-67 antibody was obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal phospho-specific rabbit antibodies directed against active ERK1,2 (dilution 1:50), active JNK (dilution 1:50), active p38 MAPK (dilution 1:50), and active PI3K (dilution 1:50) were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Cells on coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (4 °C), and permeabilized in 100% methanol. Subsequently, they were incubated for 1 h in 0.01% PBST (PBS + 0.01% Triton X-100) containing 10% fat-free milk powder to reduce nonspecific binding and over night at 4 °C with primary antibody. After washing three times in 0.1% PBST the cells were incubated for 1 h in 0.01% PBST supplemented with 10% milkpowder and either a Cy5™-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (concentration 4.6 μg/ml) (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) or a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Ki-67). Excitation was performed using either a 633-nm helium-neon laser or an argion-ion laser (488 nm band) of the confocal setup. Emission was recorded at >655 nm (Cy5 fluorescence) or at >515 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence). —For quantitative immunohistochemistry confocal images were recorded from cells stained with only secondary antibodies (background fluorescence image) and cells stained with primary and secondary antibodies. After subtraction of background fluorescence, the fluorescence signal (counts) was evaluated by the image analysis software of the confocal setup in single cells and was routinely exported for further analysis to the Sigma Plot graphic software (Erkrath, Germany). Statistical Analysis—Data are given as mean values + S.D., with n denoting the number of experiments. Student’s t test for unpaired data were applied as appropriate. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Time Course of Hypotonic Stress-induced ATP Release in Prostate Cancer Cells—Mechanical (hypoosmotic) strain is a stimulus for ATP release in many cell types (4Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) including prostate cancer cells (19Sauer H. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C295-C307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that ATP is released within a few seconds from DU-145 prostate cancer cells via anion channels that are activated by mechanical stimulation (19Sauer H. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C295-C307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling cascades underlying ATP release have not yet been investigated, however. When DU-145 prostate cancer cells grown to confluence on coverslips were incubated in hypotonic (150 mosm/kg H2O) solution a transient increase in extracellular ATP concentration was observed, which peaked at 20 min with 72 ± 22 pmol/105 cells (basal release under isotonic conditions, 11 ± 4 pmol ATP/105 cells) and a gradual decline toward the basal level within 120 min (Fig. 1A)(n = 63). The extracellular ATP concentration was significantly reduced under isotonic as well as hypotonic conditions when 6 units/ml apyrase was present in the extracellular medium (n = 4) (Fig. 1B). A comparable release of ATP was observed when cells were seeded on flexible membranes, which were stretched by 10% through application of vacuum (data not shown). ATP release was apparently not due to membrane rupture as investigated by lethal cell staining using the cell membrane-impermeable fluorescence dye Sytox green, which accumulates in the cell nuclei of dead cells. Under conditions of hypotonic stress no increase in numbers of Sytox green-positive cell nuclei were observed, indicating absence of cell lethality (data not shown). Stimulation of Cell Proliferation by ATP Released following Hypotonic Stress—Although it is meanwhile well established that many cells own ATP release mechanisms, the physiological role of extracellular ATP is not well known. In a number of different cell types including coronary artery smooth muscle cells (20Coutinho-Silva R. Stahl L. Cheung K.K. de Campos N.E. de Oliveira S.C. Ojcius D.M. Burnstock G. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: G1024-G1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), human intestinal epithelial cells (20Coutinho-Silva R. Stahl L. Cheung K.K. de Campos N.E. de Oliveira S.C. Ojcius D.M. Burnstock G. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: G1024-G1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), rat astrocytes (21Franke H. Krugel U. Illes P. Glia. 1999; 28: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and rat mesangial cells (22Schulze-Lohoff E. Zanner S. Ogilvie A. Sterzel R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F374-F383PubMed Google Scholar) exogenous ATP has been shown to exert mitogenic effects. The role of ATP in the regulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation is controversial, however. Whereas we have previously shown that exogenous added ATP stimulates the growth of DU-145 prostate tumor spheroids (18Sauer H. Klimm B. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2539-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), others have shown a growth inhibitory effect of ATP (23Janssens R. Boeynaems J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which was observed after long term incubation with the nucleotides and repeated application. In the present study cell proliferation following hypotonic stress of cells for 20 min was assessed by immunohistochemical quantification of the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 2A) as well as BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2B) into the cell nuclei of proliferating cells. Hypotonic stress significantly increased Ki-67 expression to 150 ± 16% (untreated control set to 100%), which was in the same magnitude as achieved upon treatment for 1 time with either 10 or 100 μm exogenous ATP (n = 3). Interestingly, the proliferation stimulus obtained with hypotonic stress was completely abolished in the presence of the ATP scavenger apyrase (10 units/ml), which indicates that cell proliferation requests ATP release from the cells. Furthermore, incubation with apyrase under isotonic conditions resulted in an ∼20% decrease in Ki-67 expression, suggesting proliferation control of cells by exogenous ATP (data not shown). The data achieved with Ki-67 staining were corroborated by labeling cells with BrdUrd. Upon hypotonic stress significantly increased cell numbers of BrdUrd-positive, proliferating cells were observed (n = 3), which supports a role of released ATP as a mitogen in prostate cancer cells. Activation of MAPKs upon Hypotonic Stress of DU-145 Prostate Cancer Cells—Stimulation of cell proliferation is generally associated with phosphorylation/activation of MAPK members. In DU-145 prostate cancer cells transient activation of ERK1,2 (maximum after 20 min) (Fig. 3A) and p38 (maximum after 10 min) (Fig. 3B) was observed, whereas JNK phosphorylation was not increased upon hypotonic stress (data not shown). Furthermore, hypotonic stress resulted in activation of PI3K, which was absent in the presence of the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 (100 μm) and wortmannin (1 μm) (data not shown). As expected, activation of ERK1,2 as well as p38 was abolished in the presence of either the ERK1,2 inhibitor UO126 (10 μm) or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (5 μm) as well as in the presence of the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (1 μm) and LY294002 (100 μm) suggesting upstream activation of PI3K (n = 3). Notably, preincubation with apyrase (6 units/ml) significantly inhibited activation of ERK1,2 as well as p38 upon hypotonic stress, which clearly indicates that hypotonic stress does not per se activate MAPK pathways but requires ATP release to the extracellular milieu and activation of signaling pathways presumably via purinergic receptor binding. Likewise, the activation of PI3K upon hypotonic stress was abolished in the presence of apyrase (data not shown). Effects of ATP Scavenging and Purinergic Receptor Inhibition on Hypotonic Stress-induced Calcium Responses—Hypotonic stress increases intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i in a variety of preparations, and the sources of the observed [Ca2+]i increase as well as possible mechanisms of mechano-transduction of Ca2+ responses have been extensively studied during recent years (for review, see Refs. 24Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J. Morishima S. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar and 25Jakab M. Furst J. Gschwentner M. Botta G. Garavaglia M.L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S. Meyer G. Eichmueller S. Woll E. Chwatal S. Ritter M. Paulmichl M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 12: 235-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The interrelation between hypotonicity-induced ATP release and subsequent Ca2+ responses have, however, so far not been investigated. In the present study it was hypothesized that the hypotonic stress-induced Ca2+ response was dependent on extracellular ATP and purinergic receptor activation. During hypotonic incubation of cells a transient rise in [Ca2+]i was observed, which was still present albeit at reduced duration in Ca2+-free solution containing 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 4A and B), suggesting that the Ca2+ response was composed of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores followed by capacitative Ca2+ influx across the cell membrane. When apyrase (6 units/ml) was present in the incubation medium only about 40% of the cells responded toward the hypotonic challenge, and the amplitude of observed [Ca2+]i gradients was significantly reduced (n = 3). Comparable results were observed when cells were treated with the purinergic receptor antagonist suramin (100 μm), which likewise decreased the number of responding cells and the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i response (n = 3). Notably, the Ca2+ response was totally absent in all cells when suramin-treated cells were swollen in hypotonic solutions in the absence of extracellular calcium supporting a role of extracellular Ca2+ for the hypotonicity-induced Ca2+ response. Taken together these data suggest that the hypotonicity-induced Ca2+ response required extracellular ATP and purinergic receptor activation and point toward the notion that hypotonic cell swelling per se is not sufficient to raise [Ca2+]i in DU-145 prostate cancer cells.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20118-20124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have been previously shown to activate arachidonic acid metabolism and prostaglandin generation. It is, however, presently not known whether prostaglandins are involved in hypotonic stress-induced ATP release and whether prostaglandin synthesis requires the presence of ATP released upon hypotonic stress of cells. To address this issue, DU-145 prostate cancer cells were incubated either with exogenous ATP (50 μm) or hypotonic solution in the absence or presence of the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 or the ATP scavenger apyrase. Following 20 min of hypotonic incubation the generation of PGE2 was monitored (Fig. 5). It was apparent that ATP as well as hypotonic stress significantly increased PGE2 formation, which was totally abolished upon inhibition of COX-2 and scavenging extracellular ATP (n = 3). The latter observation clearly indicates that ATP released by hypotonic stress is required for the initiation of signaling events, which stimulate arachidonic acid metabolism thus resulting in increased PGE2 synthesis. Inhibition of Hypotonic Stress-induced ATP Release by Purinergic Receptor Antagonists—The data of the present study demonstrate that hypotonic stress releases intracellular ATP, elicits an intracellular Ca2+ response, increases PGE2 synthesis, and stimulates cell proliferation presumably by activating the purinergic signal transduction cascade from the extracellular compartment. Purinergic receptor signaling may be vice versa required for hypotonic stress-induced ATP release. To verify this assumption ATP release from DU-145 prostate cancer cells was monitored in the presence of either the purinergic receptor antagonist suramin (100 μm) or PPADS (100 μm) (Fig. 6"
https://openalex.org/W2057773092,"Mechanosensitive cation channels (MSC) are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cell types. However, the physiological functions of MSC in several tissues remain in question. In this study we have investigated the role of MSC in skeletal myogenesis. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with gadolinium ions (MSC blocker) inhibited myotube formation and the myogenic index in differentiation medium (DM). The enzymatic activity of creatine kinase (CK) and the expression of myosin heavy chain-fast twitch (MyHCf) in C2C12 cultures were also blocked in response to gadolinium. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with gadolinium ions did not affect the expression of either cyclin A or cyclin D1 in DM. Other inhibitors of MSC such as streptomycin and GsTMx-4 also suppressed the expression of CK and MyHCf in C2C12 cultures. The inhibitory effect of gadolinium ions on myogenic differentiation was reversible and independent of myogenic cell type. Real-time-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that inhibition of MSC decreases the expression of myogenic transcription factors MyoD, myogenin, and Myf-5. Furthermore, the activity of skeletal alpha-actin promoter was suppressed on MSC blockade. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with gadolinium ions prevented differentiation-associated cell death and inhibited the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and activation of caspase-3. On the other hand, delivery of active caspase-3 protein to C2C12 myoblasts reversed the inhibitory effect of gadolinium ions on myogenesis. Our data suggest that inhibition of MSC suppresses myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the caspase-3 activity and the expression of myogenic regulatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W2047248575,"Proteins are poor immunogens that require an adjuvant to raise an immune response. Here we show that the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 Tat protein possesses an autoadjuvant property, and we have identified the determinants and the molecular events that are associated with this unusual property. Using a series of chemically synthesized Tat101 derivatives, we show that the core region controls the autoadjuvant phenomenon independently of the B-cell recognition and T-cell stimulation that are associated with epitopes respectively located on the N-terminal region and the cysteine-rich region. We also show that cysteine-mediated oligomerization is a key molecular event of the adjuvant-free antibody response. In particular, a Tat dimer formed by the oxidation of two cysteine residues, at position 34 only, raises an adjuvant-free antibody response that is comparable with that observed with the wild-type protein. Unlike the parent protein, the Tat dimer has no transactivating activity and remains homogeneous for several weeks in solution. This construct might be of value for the design of an adjuvant-free Tat-based vaccine. Furthermore, we suggest that the specific autoadjuvanticity determinant of Tat could be used to provide other proteins with adjuvant-free immunogenicity. Proteins are poor immunogens that require an adjuvant to raise an immune response. Here we show that the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 Tat protein possesses an autoadjuvant property, and we have identified the determinants and the molecular events that are associated with this unusual property. Using a series of chemically synthesized Tat101 derivatives, we show that the core region controls the autoadjuvant phenomenon independently of the B-cell recognition and T-cell stimulation that are associated with epitopes respectively located on the N-terminal region and the cysteine-rich region. We also show that cysteine-mediated oligomerization is a key molecular event of the adjuvant-free antibody response. In particular, a Tat dimer formed by the oxidation of two cysteine residues, at position 34 only, raises an adjuvant-free antibody response that is comparable with that observed with the wild-type protein. Unlike the parent protein, the Tat dimer has no transactivating activity and remains homogeneous for several weeks in solution. This construct might be of value for the design of an adjuvant-free Tat-based vaccine. Furthermore, we suggest that the specific autoadjuvanticity determinant of Tat could be used to provide other proteins with adjuvant-free immunogenicity. Most free proteins injected in a soluble form in humans or animals are poor immunogens and can induce B- or T-cell tolerance or rapid proliferation followed by rapid death of Ag-specific T-cells. They usually become immunogenic when they are mixed with an adjuvant. It is not completely understood how adjuvants are able to convert a tolerogenic stimulus into an immunogenic one. The process seems to be related to an increase in immunogen half-life through the so-called “depot effect” (1Lascelles A.K. Eagleson G. Beh K.J. Watson D.L. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1989; 22: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and to a series of immunological events that include induction of inflammation and of inflammatory cytokines (2Bomford R. Dev.

Barillari G. Chang H.K. Bohan C.A. Kao V. Morgan R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7159-7167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tat was proposed to target monocyte-derived dendritic cells and enhance their maturation, function, and Ag-specific T-cell responses (16Fanales-Belasio E. Moretti S. Nappi F. Barillari G. Micheletti F. Cafaro A. Ensoli B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Also, a recent report showed that Tat can reprogram immature dendritic cells to express chemoattractants for activated T-cells and macrophages, but in contrast to the previous paper this work showed that Tat cannot induce their maturation and induction of proinflammatory cytokines (17Izmailova E. Bertley F.M. Huang Q. Makori N. Miller C.J. Young R.A. Aldovini A. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although somewhat contradictory, these various observations suggest that Tat expresses activities that are reminiscent of those triggered by adjuvants, and we may wonder whether they could be associated with the Tat-specific immune response that is observed in HIV-1-infected humans (18Reiss P.

Gringeri A. Carcagno M. Criscuolo M. Burny A. Gallo R.C. Zagury D. J. Hum. Virol. 1998; 1: 282-292PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Tat can induce an immune response in the absence of adjuvant. This hypothesis was supported by a report showing that the repeated intradermal immunization of one monkey with low doses of a biologically active 86-aa-long Tat protein, in the absence of adjuvant, induced a specific Th1 response and cytotoxic T-cells without Ab production (22Cafaro A. Caputo A. Fracasso C. Maggiorella M.T. Goletti D. Baroncelli S. Pace M. Sernicola L. Koanga-Mogtomo M.L. Betti M. Borsetti A. Belli R. Akerblom L. Corrias F. Butto S. Heeney J. Verani P. Titti F. Ensoli B. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To document the possibility that Tat may possess immunoadjuvant properties, we have analyzed the humoral immune response raised against Tat, in mice. In most studies, truncated forms of Tat are used that come from laboratory isolates and encode sequences of 86 aa. However, primary isolates encode Tat sequences that are 15 aa longer. Because this additional C-terminal region could contain immunogenic sites that might influence the Tat immune response, we selected a Tat of 101 aa and synthesized it by chemical means. We show that a synthetic 101-aa Tat molecule is indeed able to induce an autoadjuvant immune response. Then we searched for the determinant that is associated with this uncommon property. We show that introduction of substitutions in the N-terminal part, the core region (aa 39–48), or the cysteine-rich region (aa 22–37) affect the Ab response. However, only substitutions introduced in the core region abrogated the Ab response without affecting the major B-cell epitope region and/or the T-cell stimulating capacity of Tat. Furthermore, we observed that cysteine-mediated oligomerization represents a molecular event that is required in the process of the adjuvant-free Ab response. In particular, we observed that a dimer formed by oxidation of two cysteine residues at position 34 only raises an autoadjuvant Ab response that is comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Because this derivative has no transactivating activity and remains homogeneous for several weeks in a PBS buffer, we suggest that it could be considered for the design of an adjuvant-free Tat-based vaccine. Furthermore, the specific autoadjuvanticity determinant of Tat identified in this work may represent a novel component to provide other proteins with adjuvant-free immunogenicity. Synthesis of Tat and of its derivatives was performed using the Fmoc/tert-butyl strategy on an Applied Biosystems 433A synthesizer. The chemical procedure used 0.1 mmol of Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-PAL-PEG-PS resin, a 10-fold excess of each aa, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole, and diisopropylethylamine/N-methyl pyrrolidone. Incorporation of Gln54 was performed twice manually. Cleavage and deprotection were achieved using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/water (9.5/0.25/0.25, v/v/v). The crude material was precipitated twice with cold tert-butyl methyl ether and subsequently dissolved in 15% aqueous acid. The crude protein was then purified by HPLC on a Jupiter C4 column. The S(tBu) moieties were then removed from the cysteines using degassed 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 6 m urea and dithiothreitol (50 eq/Cys). After completion the mixture was acidified to pH 2.2 and purified by HPLC on a C4 column, and the fully reduced Tat proteins were kept freeze-dried at –20 °C. Eighteen 15-mer peptides representing the sequence of Tat101 with an overlap of 5 aa residues were synthesized on a 357 Advanced ChemTec multiple peptide synthesizer using the Fmoc strategy. The peptides were synthesized using a rink amide resin and were N-terminally acetylated using acetic anhydride. The peptides were cleaved and deprotected as described above and then purified on a Vydac C18 reverse phase column (Hesperia, CA). The synthesized peptides and proteins were characterized by mass spectrometry and aa analysis. The mass found for each synthesized Tat protein is shown in the supplemental data section. The HIV-1 LTR sequence chosen for this study comes from the HIV-1 AVR-2 isolate (GenBank™ accession number K02007). The sequence covering positions –137 to +58 relating to the RNA start site was synthesized by the method described by Stemmer et al. (23Stemmer W.P. Crameri A. Ha K.D. Brennan T.M. Heyneker H.L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid pLTR-G was constructed by inserting the synthetic HIV-1 LTR upstream of the promoterless enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene within the multiple cloning site of pEGFP-1 (Clontech). HeLa cells were transfected with pLTR-G and subsequently cloned by limiting dilution. The cell line overexpressing EGFP with the highest efficiency in the presence of Tat was then selected for the transactivation assay. In the transactivation assay, the transfected cell line was incubated with either Tat101 or Tat101C(22,37)S or Tat101R(52,53)Q in the presence of 100 μm chloroquine. After 3 h at 37 °C, 10% fetal bovine serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. 45 h later, the cells were harvested, and fluorescence intensity was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Groups of four BALB/c mice (IFFA CREDO, France) were injected twice subcutaneously at the tail base with 100 μl of a PBS solution containing 5 μg of Tat101 or Tat101 derivatives. Blood samples were collected 14 and 28 days after the second injection. Groups of four SWISS mice were injected with 5 μg or 50 μg of Tat101 according to the same protocol. To assess the T-cell response, BALB/c mice were injected twice with the different Ags following the procedure described above. Ten days after immunization of mice, spleens were harvested and suspended in a proliferation medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. The cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were cultured at 37 °C with serial dilutions of the different Ags. The presence of IL-2 in culture supernatants was determined after a 24-h period by measuring the proliferation of an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cell line, using methyl-[3H]thymidine ([3H]TdR; 5 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Proliferation of the cells was assessed after 3 days and an 18-hour pulse with methyl-[3H]thymidine. The data are expressed in cpm. Ab Titer—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated overnight with either Tat101 or Tat101 derivatives (0.1 μg/well) in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. The plates were then saturated with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Individual antisera were serially diluted in the same buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in the wells overnight at 4 °C. Binding of Abs was assessed using a goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). The titers were defined as the highest serum dilution giving an absorbance value of 0.6 above the negative control. For this control we used pooled sera collected before immunization of mice. Mapping of the B-cell Epitopes—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated overnight with the 18 overlapping peptides (1 μg/well) as described above. Antisera were serially diluted in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in the wells overnight at 4 °C. Binding of Abs was assessed using a goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). The chip-based separations were performed on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer using the Protein 50 Plus LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). All of the chips were prepared according to the protocol provided with the kit. Briefly, the channels of the chip were filled with a mixture of a sieving matrix and a fluorescent dye for detection. Tat101 and its derivatives were incubated for different times in the absence or presence of an excess of reducing agent, cysteine oxidation was stopped by the addition of an excess of maleimide, and the mixtures were subsequently boiled in the presence of SDS. The samples were then heat-denatured at 95–100 °C for 7 min before loading them onto the chip. The chip was then placed in the bioanalyzer, and each sample was sequentially separated and detected by laser-induced fluorescence detection (670–700 nm) within 45 s. After completion of the chip run, the data were displayed as an electropherogram and as a gel-like image. Student's t tests were performed using Lumière software. Selection of the Tat Sequence—We determined a theoretical consensus sequence containing the amino acids most represented in 66 sequences of Tat variants found in different HIV-1 isolates and reported in the Swiss Protein Database and the TrEMBL Database between 1999 and 2000 (24Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). The sequence that was closest to the theoretical consensus sequence was found in the infectious clone 320.2A 2.1 (25Groenink M. Fouchier R.A. de Goede R.E. de Wolf F. Gruters R.A. Cuypers H.T. Huisman H.G. Tersmette M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1968-1975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We synthesized it chemically and replaced its N-terminal methionine by a nonoxidizable isosteric norleucine (see Fig. 4), because it is known that spontaneous oxidation of methionine can occur during purification. Intrinsic Immunogenicity of Tat101—We investigated whether Tat and other unrelated protein Ags, such as hen egg lysozyme (HEL), ovalbumin, glutathione S-transferase, and viral protein R from HIV-1, could trigger an adjuvant-free immune response in BALB/c mice. We injected subcutaneously 5 μg of each Ag in PBS, and 14 or 28 days after the second immunization we observed that Tat101 had raised a high Ab response, whereas the four other Ags triggered no response (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the other proteins do not possess adjuvant-free immunogenic properties. Then we examined the anti-Tat Ab response in outbred mice, by injecting four SWISS mice with either 5 or 50 μg of Tat101 in PBS. A clear humoral immune response was elicited upon administration of the highest dose of Tat protein (Fig. 1B), indicating that the ability of Tat to raise a humoral immune response in the absence of adjuvant is not related to the genetic background of the mice and is clearly dose-dependent. Because Tat86 was previously described as being poorly immunogenic in the presence of adjuvant (26Cohen S.S. Li C. Ding L. Cao Y. Pardee A.B. Shevach E.M. Cohen D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10842-10847Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we compared the immunogenicity of Tat101 in the presence or absence of Alum. In these experiments, a single intraperitoneal injection of Tat101 previously mixed with Alum raised an anti-Tat antibody response (8302 ± 4212) close to that with two adjuvant-free injections of Tat101 (4895 ± 2733), indicating that Tat101 is substantially immunogenic in the presence of adjuvant. The reasons for the differences between our observations and those of previous reports are not clear but might be related to the differences between the Tat molecules, both in terms of lengths and amino acid sequences. To examine whether Tat also elicits a T-cell response in mice in the absence of adjuvant, we immunized BALB/c mice with two subcutaneous injections of Tat101 solubilized in PBS, collected spleens 10 days after the second injection, and measured the ability of splenocytes to secrete IL-2 in vitro in the presence of Tat101. As shown in Fig. 2A, cells from Tat-immunized mice produced IL-2 when incubated in the presence of Tat101 but not in the presence of an irrelevant Ag (HEL). In contrast, no IL-2 secretion was observed with spleen cells from naive mice (not shown). Surprisingly, however, although capable of secreting IL-2, the splenocytes from Tat-immunized mice did not proliferate in the presence of Tat (Fig. 2B). The reasons for the discrepancy between IL-2 production and proliferation remain unclear but could be related to Tat toxicity and/or to its ability to induce apoptosis in cells (27Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results indicated that, in the absence of adjuvant, Tat can raise specific T-cells that are functional for IL-2 secretion. Mapping the Tat B-cell Epitopes in the Absence of Adjuvant—To characterize the B-cell epitope(s) of Tat101, we synthesized eighteen 15-mer overlapping peptides encompassing the Tat polypeptide chain. The peptides were subsequently coated on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates, and we assessed their binding to a nonimmune serum and to a pooled serum from BALB/c mice immunized with Tat101 in PBS. As shown in Fig. 2C, the nonimmune serum revealed no Ab binding to the coated plates. In contrast, Abs present in sera from Tat101-immunized mice bound mainly peptides 1 and 2 and to a lesser extent peptide 18 (Fig. 2D), suggesting that region 1–20 of Tat101 is the B-cell immunodominant region in BALB/c mice when Tat is injected in the absence of adjuvant. Identification of the Molecular Regions That Control Tat Autoadjuvant Property—Because we had no obvious starting guidelines to identify the molecular determinants involved in the autoadjuvant property of Tat101, we modified the Tat regions that govern its biological properties, and we examined the effect of these modifications on the capacity of Tat101 to raise Ab in the absence of adjuvant. Because the main activity of intracellular Tat is to transactivate the viral genome, we first investigated whether or not the determinant associated with transactivating activity overlaps the determinant that is responsible for the autoadjuvant effect. Because positions 22, 37, 52, and 53 were previously described to be important for the transactivating activity of Tat86 (28Caputo A. Grossi M.P. Bozzini R. Rossi C. Betti M. Marconi P.C. Barbanti-Brodano G. Balboni P.G. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hauber J. Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we synthesized two Tat101 derivatives in which cysteines 22 and 37 were replaced by serine residues (Tat101C(22,37)S) in the first derivative and arginine residues 52 and 53 were substituted by glutamine residues (Tat101R(52,53)Q) in the other. The transactivating activity of these derivatives was examined using an assay where HeLa cells were first transfected with a plasmid coding for the LTR sequence of HIV-1 and for the sequence of EGFP. Transfected cells were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution and transiently transfected with a plasmid coding for wild-type Tat101. The HeLa cell line that overexpressed EGFP with the highest efficiency was selected for the assessment of the transactivating activity in the presence of 100 μm chloroquine. As shown in Fig. 3A, wild-type Tat101 transactivates efficiently as it increased EGFP expression by the HeLa cell line. In contrast, neither Tat101C(22,37)S nor Tat101R(52,53)Q caused such an increase in EGFP expression, indicating that these two derivatives are devoid of transactivating property, in agreement with previous reports (28Caputo A. Grossi M.P. Bozzini R. Rossi C. Betti M. Marconi P.C. Barbanti-Brodano G. Balboni P.G. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hauber J. Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then we immunized groups of four BALB/c mice, in the absence of adjuvant, with either 5 μg of Tat101 or its derivatives in PBS and measured the anti-Tat Ab response 14 days after the second injection. As shown in Fig. 3B, Tat101C(22,37)S and Tat101R(52,53)Q were as immunogenic as wild-type Tat101, suggesting that the determinant associated with the autoadjuvant property is different from the one that is involved in transactivating activity. Tat has multiple extracellular activities, and at least five determinants have been associated with these properties. To understand whether or not one of these regions controls the autoadjuvanticity of Tat, we prepared a series of five Tat derivatives by introducing a series of substitutions in these five regions (Fig. 4A). Because Asp5 and Pro6 contribute to the mechanism of immunosuppression of CD26-dependent T-cell growth (30Gutheil W.G. Subramanyam M. Flentke G.R. Sanford D.G. Munoz E. Huber B.T. Bachovchin W.W.

Then, because the cysteine-rich region (aa 22–37) is known to contribute to numerous activities, including inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation (32Viscidi R.P. Mayur K. Lederman H.M. Frankel A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1606-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), inhibition of apoptosis (33Zauli G. Gibellini D. Caputo A. Bassini A. Negrini M. Monne M. Mazzoni M. Capitani S.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 15-20PubMed Google Scholar), we replaced all the cysteines, highly conserved in HIV-1 isolates, with serine residues in the second derivative (Tat101C(22–37)S). The core region (aa 38–48) contributes to monocyte chemotaxis (14Albini A. Benelli R. Giunciuglio D. Cai T. Mariani G. Ferrini S. Noonan D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15895-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and angiogenesis (34Boykins R.A. Mahieux R. Shankavaram U.T. Gho Y.S. Lee S.F. Hewlett I.K. Wahl L.M.

Therefore, we synthesized a Tat derivative (Tat101core) in which the hydrophobic and charged residues of the core were substituted by the polar uncharged residue, glutamine, whereas the polar serines and threonine were replaced by alanine, as shown in Fig. 4A. The basic region is also involved in numerous activities, including the inflammatory response (35Philippon V. Vellutini C. Gambarelli D. Harkiss G. Arbuthnott G. Metzger D. Roubin R. Filippi P. Virology. 1994; 205: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), neurotoxic activity (36Sabatier J.M. Vives E. Mabrouk K. Benjouad A. Rochat H. Duval A. Hue B. Bahraoui E. J.

Therefore, we prepared a fourth derivative (Tat101polyQ), in which the five lysines and the three arginines of the basic region (aa 49–57) were replaced by 8 glutamines. Finally, because the RGD motif contributes to Tat binding to the integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 (38Barillari G. Gendelman R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7941-7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), it was replaced by a KGE nonbinding sequence (39Brake D.A. Debouck C. Biesecker G. J.

We immunized groups of four BALB/c mice, in the absence of adjuvant, with 5 μg of either Tat101 or its derivatives and monitored the anti-Tat Ab response after the second injection. As shown in Fig. 4B, Tat101polyQ and Tat101RGD,KGE were as immunogenic as the wild-type Tat101, indicating that the basic region and the integrin-binding sequence are unlikely to be involved in the autoadjuvant property. A significant decrease in the Ab response was observed with Tat101D5I,P6L 14 days after the second immunization (p < 0.05) but not at 28 days. Even more pronounced was the lack of response observed with Tat101core and Tat101C(22–37)S (Fig. 4, B and C). Altogether, these data suggest that the autoadjuvant phenomenon could be controlled by the N-terminal region, the core region, and/or the cysteine-rich region of the molecule. Do the B-cell Epitopes of Tat and/or Its T-cell Stimulating Capacity Play a Role in the Autoadjuvant Effect?—To raise a T-cell-dependent humoral immune response, a protein must both be capable of stimulating T-helper cells and possess one or more B-cell epitopes (40Mitchinson N.A.

Two serine residues of ZEBRA, Ser167 and Ser173, are substrates for casein kinase 2 (CK2) and are constitutively phosphorylated in vivo. Phosphorylation of ZEBRA at its CK2 sites is required for proper temporal regulation of viral gene expression. Phosphopeptide analysis indicated that ZEBRA contains additional constitutive phosphorylation sites. Here we employed a co-migration strategy to map these sites in vivo. The cornerstone of this strategy was to correlate the migration of 32P- and 35S-labeled tryptic peptides of ZEBRA. The identity of the peptides was revealed by mutagenesis of methionine and cysteine residues present in each peptide. Phosphorylation sites within the peptide were identified by mutagenesis of serines and threonines. ZEBRA was shown to be phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues, but not tyrosine. Two previously unrecognized phosphorylation sites of ZEBRA were identified in the NH2-terminal region of the transactivation domain: a cluster of weak phosphorylation sites at Ser6, Thr7, and Ser8 and a strong phosphorylation site at Thr14. Thr14 was embedded in a MAP kinase consensus sequence and could be phosphorylated in vitro by JNK, despite the absence of a canonical JNK docking site. Thus ZEBRA is now known to be constitutively phosphorylated at three distinct sites.

Thus ZEBRA is now known to be constitutively phosphorylated at three distinct sites. Phosphorylation, the most common post-translational modification of proteins, modulates the transcriptional potential of transcription factors by several discrete mechanisms. For example, phosphorylation of the NF-κB subunit p65 at Ser276, c-Jun at Ser63-Ser73, and cAMP-response element-binding protein at Ser133, increases the transcriptional activity of these proteins by increasing their affinity for the transcriptional co-activator, CBP 2The abbreviations used are: CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; aa, amino acid(s); TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HKB, hybrid kidney B-cell; CK2, casein kinase 2; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier. 2The abbreviations used are: CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; aa, amino acid(s); TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HKB, hybrid kidney B-cell; CK2, casein kinase 2; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier.

Fourteen of 16 amino acids in the DNA binding domain of ZEBRA fit the DNA recognition consensus sequence present in other bZIP family members. This sequence is BB-BN-AA-B-R-BB, where B is any basic residue, N is asparagine, A is alanine, and R is arginine (20Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6919-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The two exceptions are positions Ser186 in ZEBRA, which is an alanine in the consensus and position Phe193, which is basic in the consensus. Even though all bZIP proteins share this similar DNA binding motif, each protein recognizes different response elements. ZEBRA binds to an array of sites known as ZEBRA response elements; in addition, the protein binds to the AP-1 consensus sequence, known as a TPA response element (21Urier G. Buisson M. Chambard P.

Virol. 1990; 64: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZEBRA is a multifunctional protein. Its capacity to disrupt viral latency resides partially in its function as a transcriptional activator and partially in its role as a DNA replication protein (23Rooney C.M. Rowe D.T. Ragot T.

ZEBRA activates the promoter of brlf1, a gene expressing a second EBV encoded lytic cycle transcription factor, Rta (24Kolman J.L. Taylor N. Gradoville L. Countryman J. Miller G. J.

Genet. 2004; 36: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The two proteins function individually or synergistically to activate a cascade of lytic cycle genes essential for viral replication and virion production (29Ragoczy T. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9858-9866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Francis A. Ragoczy T. Gradoville L. El-Guindy A. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4543-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZEBRA also serves as a repressor of Rta-activated late genes during the early phase of the lytic cycle; thus ZEBRA temporally inhibits late gene expression prior to viral replication (29Ragoczy T. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9858-9866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31El-Guindy A.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7634-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As an essential factor required for viral DNA replication, the ZEBRA protein mediates interaction among several virally encoded protein components of the viral lytic replication machinery and binds to DNA encompassing the viral origin of lytic replication (32Schepers A.

Presumably, ZEBRA escorts these proteins to the site of replication and stabilizes the whole complex (36Gao Z. Krithivas A. Finan J.E. Semmes O.J. Zhou S. Wang Y. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8559-8567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the importance of ZEBRA binding to the viral lytic origin of replication in the process of viral DNA amplification was demonstrated by showing that a mutant Epstein-Barr virus, in which the ZEBRA binding sites in viral origin of lytic replication were exchanged for papilloma E2-binding sites, was markedly impaired in replication (37Feederle R. Delecluse H.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12082-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Despite the critical role of phosphorylation in modulating the activity of several members of the bZIP family of transcription factors, information about the role of phosphorylation in the function of ZEBRA is limited. ZEBRA, a phosphoprotein, is constitutively phosphorylated at multiple sites (38Daibata M. Humphreys R.E. Sairenji T. Virology. 1992; 188: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the phosphorylation state of ZEBRA changes following treatment of EBV-infected cells with phorbol ester, a protein kinase C agonist that is capable of inducing the EBV lytic cycle (38Daibata M. Humphreys R.E. Sairenji T. Virology. 1992; 188: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Baumann M. Mischak H. Dammeier S. Kolch W. Gires O. Pich D. Zeidler R. Delecluse H.J. Hammerschmidt W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8105-8114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, ectopic expression of ZEBRA in the absence of such exogenous inducing agents is sufficient to activate the whole lytic cycle of EBV (40El-Guindy A. Heston L. Endo Y. Cho M.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11199-11208Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus constitutive, but not inducible, phosphorylation of ZEBRA is likely to be adequate to establish its function as a lytic cycle switch. Moreover, the phosphorylation state of ZEBRA is not detectably altered in response to induction of the viral lytic cycle following transfection of ZEBRA expression vectors into cells harboring latent EBV. The phosphopeptide pattern of wild type ZEBRA and a mutant, Z(S186A), which is incompetent to activate the lytic cycle, are identical (40El-Guindy A. Heston L. Endo Y. Cho M.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11199-11208Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, we mapped two constitutive phosphorylation sites in vivo, Ser167 and Ser173. Phosphorylation of ZEBRA at these two residues was found to be essential for the ability of the protein to act as a repressor of Rta-mediated activation of a late protein, blrf2 during early times in the lytic cycle (31El-Guindy A.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7634-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this report, we further examine the constitutive phosphorylation of ZEBRA in vivo and identify several new phosphorylation sites. The strategies we utilized to analyze in vivo phosphorylation of ZEBRA are generally applicable to mapping the phosphorylation sites of proteins expressed at low levels in eukaryotic cells. Cells and Transient Transfection—The human Burkitt lymphomaderived cell line HH514-16, an EBV-positive cell line permissive for viral replication, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B (41Heston L. Rabson M. Brown N. Miller G. Nature. 1982; 295: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The HKB5/Cl8 cell line (HKB: hybrid kidney B-cell), a kind gift from Dr. Myung-Sam Cho, was generated by fusing HH514-16 cells with the 293 human embryonic kidney cell line. HKB5/Cl8 cells carry the EBV genome of HH514-16 cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient transfection of HH514-16 cells was performed by means of electroporation. A mixture of 107 cells and 10 μg of plasmid DNA were subjected to 960 microfarads and 250 volts using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Expression Vectors—Constitutive expression of ZEBRA from both pHD1013-gZ and FLAG-gZ plasmids was driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. An EBV genomic DNA fragment (nucleotides 102115 to 103181) containing the bzlf1 gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pHD1013, using the NaeI and NcoI restriction sites (42Davis M.G. Huang E.S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1988; 10: 6-12PubMed Google Scholar). To generate FLAG-gZ, two HindIII sites in the bzlf1 open reading frame were destroyed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Neither change resulted in any amino acid alterations. The HindIII-resistant sequences were inserted into pHM201-FLAG (a gift from M. Hochstrasser, Yale University) as a HindIII-NotI fragment at compatible sites. The bacterial expression vector, pET-22b/cDNA ZEBRA, has been previously described (40El-Guindy A. Heston L. Endo Y. Cho M.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11199-11208Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All point mutations were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Bacterial Expression and Purification of ZEBRA—Escherichia coli (BL21) cells were transformed with pET22b/cDNA-Z or pET22b/cDNA-Z(T14A). ZEBRA expression was induced by growing the cells in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37°C. The induced culture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was re-suspended in nickel column binding buffer containing 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). ZEBRA was extracted by sonicating the cell lysate in binding buffer containing 6 m urea. The cell extract was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded on a nickel affinity column. The retained ZEBRA protein was eluted by a stepwise gradient of imidazole ranging from 0 to 1 m dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.25 m NaCl, and 6 m urea. Column fractions containing the ZEBRA protein were pooled; the purity of ZEBRA was examined by silver nitrate staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Purified ZEBRA proteins were refolded by dialysis against gradually decreasing concentrations of urea. In Vitro Phosphorylation of ZEBRA by c-Jun NH2-terminal Kinase (JNK)—JNK phosphorylation of ZEBRA was carried out by mixing 500 ng of purified recombinant ZEBRA protein with JNK assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm cold ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding different concentrations of recombinant JNK2 (Upstate) (see Fig. 6). After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The level of phosphorylation for each protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was first stained with silver nitrate (Bio-Rad), then dried and autoradiographed. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Twelve hours after transfection of 1.5 × 107 HH514-16 cells with 15 μg of plasmid DNA, the cells were incubated in 3 ml of phosphate or methionine and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium (ICN) containing 1.6 mCi of [32Pi]orthophosphate or 0.45 mCi of [35S]methionine (70%) and [35S]cysteine (15%) (Tran35S-label, MP Biomedicals), respectively. Labeling was carried out for 6 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. Cell lysates were prepared by re-suspending the cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg of aprotinin per ml). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (40El-Guindy A. Heston L. Endo Y. Cho M.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11199-11208Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, ZEBRA was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the NH2-terminal domain of ZEBRA (43Taylor N. Countryman J. Rooney C. Katz D. Miller G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1721-1728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ZEBRA-antibody complex was captured with a mixture of protein A/protein G-coated agarose beads (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved using SDS-8% PAGE; the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Peptide Mapping and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis were carried out as described in the Hunter thin layer peptide mapping electrophoresis system manual. The radiolabeled ZEBRA band was excised from a dried SDS-PAGE gel and the protein was extracted in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% SDS. ZEBRA was separated from the gel slurry by centrifugation. The protein was precipitated from the supernatant with 20% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 20 μg of bovine albumin. The pellet was washed twice with ethanol and oxidized in 50 μl of performic acid at 0 °C for 1 h. After oxidation the sample was diluted with water, frozen, and lyophilized. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and digested with 20 μg of trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic digest was resolved by electrophoresis on a thin layer cellulose plate (EM Science) at 1000 volts for 25 min in pH 1.9 buffer (2.5% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid (v/v)). After the plate was dried at room temperature, the peptides were subjected to ascending chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer (32.5% n-butanol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid (v/v)). The labeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography at –70 °C. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by hydrolyzing 32P-labeled ZEBRA in 6 n HCl for 60 min at 110 °C. The solution was dried in a SpeedVac and reconstituted in pH 1.9 buffer. Cold phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma) were added to the sample and the mixture was subjected to thin layer electrophoresis in two dimensions, the first in pH 1.9 buffer and the second in pH 3.5 buffer (5% acetic acid and 0.5% pyridine (v/v)). The plate was dried, sprayed with 5% ninhydrin (Sigma) dissolved in methanol, and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. Radiolabeled amino acids were visualized by autoradiography and their position was compared with the unlabeled reference phosphoamino acids. ZEBRA Is Phosphorylated in Vivo at Serine and Threonine Residues— As a prelude to mapping the phosphorylation sites on ZEBRA we performed phosphoamino acid analysis of the protein. ZEBRA was expressed in two human EBV-containing cell lines, either by transfecting ZEBRA expression vector into HKB5/Cl8 cells or HH514-16 cells (Fig. 1, A and C) or by treating HH514-16 cells with two chemicals that induce ZEBRA expression, namely sodium butyrate and phorbol ester (TPA) (Fig. 1B). The cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then radioactively labeled ZEBRA protein was purified by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and excision from the gel. Two radioactive spots that co-migrated with the phosphoserine and the phosphothreonine standards were observed in both cell lines (Fig. 1). No radioactive spot co-migrated with the phosphotyrosine standard. These experiments showed that in two different cell lines, ZEBRA expressed from a transfected plasmid as well as ZEBRA expressed from the endogenous viral genome were phosphorylated at both serine and threonine residues. In HKB5/Cl8 cells transfected with a ZEBRA expression vector the stoichiometry of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine was ∼1 (Fig. 1A). In HH514-16 cells treated with chemical inducing agents, TPA and sodium butyrate, phosphoserine was more abundant than phosphothreonine (Fig. 1B). Previous experiments have shown that TPA treatment leads to phosphorylation of Ser186 (39Baumann M. Mischak H. Dammeier S. Kolch W. Gires O. Pich D. Zeidler R. Delecluse H.J. Hammerschmidt W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8105-8114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HH514-16 cells transfected with an expression vector, phosphoserine was also more abundant than phosphothreonine in the ZEBRA protein (Fig. 1C). In all subsequent experiments we examined the constitutive phosphorylation state of ZEBRA that was expressed after transfection of HH514-16 cells in the absence of any chemical treatment that would induce the viral lytic cycle. Moreover, for these experiments we used the ZEBRA S186A mutant in which the major protein kinase C site is abrogated. Strategy for Mapping Constitutive Phosphorylation Sites on ZEBRA Protein in Vivo—ZEBRA contains 15 serines and 12 threonines (Table 1). We used a strategy to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites on ZEBRA that did not require the necessity of mutating every serine and threonine individually and in combination. This strategy consisted of four interrelated maneuvers directed at identifying phosphorylated tryptic peptides. 1) We identified tryptic peptides of ZEBRA that, when labeled with [35S]cysteine or methionine or with [32P]orthophosphate, migrated similarly on a two-dimensional TLC plate (e.g. Fig. 2). These tryptic peptides presumably contain both cysteine (Cys) or methionine (Met), and serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr). The definitive identification of these tryptic peptides involved site-directed mutagenesis of Cys or Met and Ser or Thr associated with the disappearance of a radiolabeled peptide. 2) We identified 35S-labeled NH2-terminal tryptic peptides by apposition of a 10-amino acid NH2-terminal FLAG tag (Fig. 3). The co-migration strategy allowed us to predict the identity of NH2-terminal phosphopeptides (e.g. Fig. 3). 3) Another component of the strategy, to differentiate between complete versus partial tryptic digestion products, involved mutating tryptic cleavage sites (e.g. Fig. 4). 4) Finally, we confirmed the identity of phospholabeled peptides suggested by the co-migration strategy by specific site mutations of serines and threonines (Fig. 5).TABLE 1Peptides predicted from complete digestion of ZEBRA by trypsinPeptide No.PositionPeptide sequence11-12MMDPNSTSEDVK213-31FTPDPYQVPFVQAFDQATR332-157VYQDLGGPSQAPLPCVLWPVLPEPLPQGQLTAY HVSTAPTGSWFSAPQPAPENAYQAYAAPQLFP VSDITQNQQTNQAGGEAPQPGDNSTVQTAAA VVFACPGANQGQQLADIGVPQPAPVAAPAR158R4159-160TR5161-178KPQQPESLEECDSELEIK179R6180-181YK7182-183NR8184-187VASR188K9189-190CR10191-192AK11193-194FK12195-201QLLQHYR13202-207EVAAAK14208-213SSENDR15214-215LR16216-219LLLK17220-233QMCPSLDVDSIIPR18234-245TPDVLHEDLLNF Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Identification of the NH2-terminal tryptic peptide of ZEBRA using 35S labeling. A, a diagram illustrating the predicted tryptic cleavage sites of the NH2 terminus region of FLAG-tagged ZEBRA. The FLAG tag has a methionine residue at position 1 and a lysine residue at position 4. Both residues are circled to distinguish them from ZEBRA amino acids. The amino acid sequence of ZEBRA begins with two methionine residues, M1 and M2. All peptides are visualized as a result of 35S labeling of one of three methionines, Met1 of FLAG, and Met1, Met2 of ZEBRA. Two tryptic cleavage sites in the NH2 terminus of ZEBRA are located at positions, Lys12 and Arg31. Complete digestion with trypsin would generate a 4-amino acid FLAG peptide, a chimeric 18-aa FLAG/ZEBRA peptide 1, and ZEBRA peptide 2 (amino acids 13–31). ZEBRA peptide 2 would not be visualized by 35S labeling because it does not contain Met or Cys. However, a 37-aa chimeric FLAG/ZEBRA peptide containing sequences from ZEBRA peptides 1 and 2 could be visualized as a result of incomplete trypsin digestion at position 12. B–D, mapping of the positions of the tryptic peptide containing methionines 1 and 2 of ZEBRA. HH514-16 cells were transfected with Z(S186A) (B), FLAG-Z(S186A) (C), or FLAG-Z(S186A) with the first two methionines in ZEBRA mutated to alanine (D). The cells were metabolically labeled with 35S, ZEBRA was immunoprecipitated and digested with trypsin. Comparing B and C note that peptides I–VI disappear in the FLAG-tagged versions. In panels C and D the first four amino acids in the FLAG tag are indicated by the peptide termed F1–4. FP1 and FP1′ are the two chimeric peptides composed of the last six amino acids of the FLAG tag and the ZEBRA NH2-terminal peptide(s) containing methionines 1 and 2. FP1 and FP1′ disappear following mutation of Met1 and Met2 to alanine (D). Bold dashed circles indicate the position of 35S-labeled peptides that contain FLAG tag sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Analysis of the NH2 terminus region of ZEBRA by incomplete trypsin digestion. A, illustration of predicted NH2-terminal peptides generated by trypsin digestion and location of serines and threonines within these peptides. Depending on the extent of trypsin cleavage of wild type ZEBRA protein at lysine 12, two peptides will be observed with 35S labeling, peptide 1 (I), or, peptide 1 + 2(II), that represents lack of digestion with trypsin at Lys12. Peptide 2 cannot be detected with 35S because of the absence of methionine and cysteine residues from its amino acid sequence. In the mutant Z(K12A) (III), peptide 1 is absent and peptide 1 + 2 is detected. B and C, 35S-labeled tryptic peptide maps of wild type Z(S186A) (B) and a mutant ZEBRA, Z(K12A/S186A), in which lysine 12 was mutated to alanine in the background of S186A (C). Peptide 1 (P1) and peptide 1 + 2 are indicated by dashed boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Mapping phosphorylation sites in the NH2 terminus of ZEBRA.

Results from three spacecraft currently operating at Mars (Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Express), as well as from the continuing Spirit and Opportunity rover missions, have been changing our views in fundamental ways. This was evident, for example, at this year's Planet Mars II workshop (1) as well as in several recent papers. Among the most important issues discussed at the workshop and in the literature were seasonal cycles, obliquity variations, and climate changes over a time scale of 4 billion years."

In this [essay][1], Ben Lakhdar chronicles how she overcame personal, political, social, and cultural obstacles to become in 1978 professor of physics at the University of Tunis, El Manar, in Tunisia. She was the first woman to achieve this status. Although her talents in science and math were apparent at an early age, she still had to argue her way into the all-male preserve of higher education in her country. Her first break came in 1967 when she was selected to be among the few top students in the country given an opportunity to study in France, where she developed expertise in atomic and molecular spectroscopy and eventually earned a Ph.D. Rather than accepting offers to pursue her interests in countries with long traditions of science and research, she returned to Tunisia, where she became an active physicist devoted to widening the pathway to science, that she helped to open, for ever more Tunisian and African women.
