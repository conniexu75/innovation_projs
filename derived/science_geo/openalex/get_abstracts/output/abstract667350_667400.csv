https://openalex.org/W3122365738,"Chromosomal inversions are ubiquitous in genomes and often coordinate complex phenotypes, such as the covariation of behavior and morphology in many birds, fishes, insects or mammals1–11. However, why and how inversions become associated with polymorphic traits remains obscure. Here we show that despite a strong selective advantage when they form, inversions accumulate recessive deleterious mutations that generate frequency-dependent selection and promote their maintenance at intermediate frequency. Combining genomics and in vivo fitness analyses in a model butterfly for wing-pattern polymorphism, Heliconius numata, we reveal that three ecologically advantageous inversions have built up a heavy mutational load from the sequential accumulation of deleterious mutations and transposable elements. Inversions associate with sharply reduced viability when homozygous, which prevents them from replacing ancestral chromosome arrangements. Our results suggest that other complex polymorphisms, rather than representing adaptations to competing ecological optima, could evolve because chromosomal rearrangements are intrinsically prone to carrying recessive harmful mutations. Chromosomal inversions at the mimicry locus of Heliconius numata butterflies accumulate deleterious variants. This leads to selection against homozygosity, in opposition to positive selection for mimicry, resulting in intermediate allele frequency."
https://openalex.org/W3124179444,"Abstract The concept of a so-called urban advantage in health ignores the possibility of heterogeneity in health outcomes across cities. Using a harmonized dataset from the SALURBAL project, we describe variability and predictors of life expectancy and proportionate mortality in 363 cities across nine Latin American countries. Life expectancy differed substantially across cities within the same country. Cause-specific mortality also varied across cities, with some causes of death (unintentional and violent injuries and deaths) showing large variation within countries, whereas other causes of death (communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional, cancer, cardiovascular disease and other noncommunicable diseases) varied substantially between countries. In multivariable mixed models, higher levels of education, water access and sanitation and less overcrowding were associated with longer life expectancy, a relatively lower proportion of communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional deaths and a higher proportion of deaths from cancer, cardiovascular disease and other noncommunicable diseases. These results highlight considerable heterogeneity in life expectancy and causes of death across cities of Latin America, revealing modifiable factors that could be amenable to urban policies aimed toward improving urban health in Latin America and more generally in other urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W3121930166,"Cell competition allows winner cells to eliminate less fit loser cells in tissues. In Minute cell competition, cells with a heterozygous mutation in ribosome genes, such as RpS3+/- cells, are eliminated by wild-type cells. How cells are primed as losers is partially understood and it has been proposed that reduced translation underpins the loser status of ribosome mutant, or Minute, cells. Here, using Drosophila, we show that reduced translation does not cause cell competition. Instead, we identify proteotoxic stress as the underlying cause of the loser status for Minute competition and competition induced by mahjong, an unrelated loser gene. RpS3+/- cells exhibit reduced autophagic and proteasomal flux, accumulate protein aggregates and can be rescued from competition by improving their proteostasis. Conversely, inducing proteotoxic stress is sufficient to turn otherwise wild-type cells into losers. Thus, we propose that tissues may preserve their health through a proteostasis-based mechanism of cell competition and cell selection."
https://openalex.org/W3121990740,"Synovial sarcoma (SyS) is an aggressive neoplasm driven by the SS18-SSX fusion, and is characterized by low T cell infiltration. Here, we studied the cancer-immune interplay in SyS using an integrative approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial profiling and genetic and pharmacological perturbations. scRNA-seq of 16,872 cells from 12 human SyS tumors uncovered a malignant subpopulation that marks immune-deprived niches in situ and is predictive of poor clinical outcomes in two independent cohorts. Functional analyses revealed that this malignant cell state is controlled by the SS18-SSX fusion, is repressed by cytokines secreted by macrophages and T cells, and can be synergistically targeted with a combination of HDAC and CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors. This drug combination enhanced malignant-cell immunogenicity in SyS models, leading to induced T cell reactivity and T cell-mediated killing. Our study provides a blueprint for investigating heterogeneity in fusion-driven malignancies and demonstrates an interplay between immune evasion and oncogenic processes that can be co-targeted in SyS and potentially in other malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W3122091881,"Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and G3BP2, respectively) are widely recognized as core components of stress granules (SGs). We report that G3BPs reside at the cytoplasmic surface of lysosomes. They act in a non-redundant manner to anchor the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex to lysosomes and suppress activation of the metabolic master regulator mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids and insulin. Like the TSC complex, G3BP1 deficiency elicits phenotypes related to mTORC1 hyperactivity. In the context of tumors, low G3BP1 levels enhance mTORC1-driven breast cancer cell motility and correlate with adverse outcomes in patients. Furthermore, G3bp1 inhibition in zebrafish disturbs neuronal development and function, leading to white matter heterotopia and neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, G3BPs are not only core components of SGs but also a key element of lysosomal TSC-mTORC1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3125009572,"Short-term memory is associated with persistent neural activity that is maintained by positive feedback between neurons. To explore the neural circuit motifs that produce memory-related persistent activity, we measured coupling between functionally characterized motor cortex neurons in mice performing a memory-guided response task. Targeted two-photon photostimulation of small (<10) groups of neurons produced sparse calcium responses in coupled neurons over approximately 100 μm. Neurons with similar task-related selectivity were preferentially coupled. Photostimulation of different groups of neurons modulated activity in different subpopulations of coupled neurons. Responses of stimulated and coupled neurons persisted for seconds, far outlasting the duration of the photostimuli. Photostimuli produced behavioral biases that were predictable based on the selectivity of the perturbed neuronal population, even though photostimulation preceded the behavioral response by seconds. Our results suggest that memory-related neural circuits contain intercalated, recurrently connected modules, which can independently maintain selective persistent activity. Two-photon photostimulation and imaging of a cortical short-term memory circuit reveal intercalated modules that can independently maintain memory. The modules are defined by connectivity between neurons with similar task-related tuning."
https://openalex.org/W3125823424,"Ribosomes are multicomponent molecular machines that synthesize all of the proteins of living cells. Most of the genes that encode the protein components of ribosomes are therefore essential. A reduction in gene dosage is often viable albeit deleterious and is associated with human syndromes, which are collectively known as ribosomopathies1–3. The cell biological basis of these pathologies has remained unclear. Here, we model human ribosomopathies in Drosophila and find widespread apoptosis and cellular stress in the resulting animals. This is not caused by insufficient protein synthesis, as reasonably expected. Instead, ribosomal protein deficiency elicits proteotoxic stress, which we suggest is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins that overwhelm the protein degradation machinery. We find that dampening the integrated stress response4 or autophagy increases the harm inflicted by ribosomal protein deficiency, suggesting that these activities could be cytoprotective. Inhibition of TOR activity—which decreases ribosomal protein production, slows down protein synthesis and stimulates autophagy5—reduces proteotoxic stress in our ribosomopathy model. Interventions that stimulate autophagy, combined with means of boosting protein quality control, could form the basis of a therapeutic strategy for this class of diseases. Recasens-Alvarez et al. model human ribosomopathies and find that apoptosis and cellular stress result from proteotoxic stress that overwhelms the degradation machinery."

https://openalex.org/W3124650834,"Cas12g, the type V-G CRISPR-Cas effector, is an RNA-guided ribonuclease that targets single-stranded RNA substrate. The CRISPR-Cas12g system offers a potential platform for transcriptome engineering and diagnostic applications. We determined the structures of Cas12g-guide RNA complexes in the absence and presence of target RNA by cryo-EM to a resolution of 3.1 Å and 4.8 Å, respectively. Cas12g adopts a bilobed structure with miniature REC2 and Nuc domains, whereas the guide RNAs fold into a flipped 'F' shape, which is primarily recognized by the REC lobe. Target RNA and the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guide form a duplex that inserts into the central cavity between the REC and NUC lobes, inducing conformational changes in both lobes to activate Cas12g. The structural insights would facilitate the development of Cas12g-based applications."
https://openalex.org/W3121196420,"The nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) and the ventral pallidum (VP) are critical for reward processing, although the question of how coordinated activity within these nuclei orchestrates reward valuation and consumption remains unclear. Inhibition of NAcSh firing is necessary for reward consumption, but the source of this inhibition remains unknown. Here, we report that a subpopulation of VP neurons, the ventral arkypallidal (vArky) neurons, project back to the NAcSh, where they inhibit NAcSh neurons in vivo in mice. Consistent with this pathway driving reward consumption via inhibition of the NAcSh, calcium activity of vArky neurons scaled with reward palatability (which was dissociable from reward seeking) and predicted the subsequent drinking behavior during a free-access paradigm. Activation of the VP-NAcSh pathway increased ongoing reward consumption while amplifying hedonic reactions to reward. These results establish a pivotal role for vArky neurons in the promotion of reward consumption through modulation of NAcSh firing in a value-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3121726530,"Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicles containing mRNA, miRNA, and proteins of origin cells, which can control the characteristics of other cells or surroundings. Despite increasing evidence on oncogenic properties of tumor-derived exosomes, fibrosarcoma-derived exosomes remain largely unrevealed. While the proper extraction and characterization of exosomes is critical in exosomes research, there are various limitations in techniques to measure the size and homogeneity of exosomes. Here, we analyzed exosomes from a fibrosarcoma cell line WEHI-164 compared with a breast cancer cell line MDA-MD-231 as a control. Results from dot blot and western blot analysis demonstrated that GM1 ganglioside, and TSG101, HSC70 and GAPDH proteins were contained in exosomes from the WEHI-164 fibrosarcoma cell line. The existence of tetraspanins such as CD81, CD63 and CD9 was confirmed in the exosomes by ExoView analysis. The results obtained from TEM showed their sphere-like shapes of around 50 to 70 nm in radius. Through DLS, we found out that the mean radius of the exosomes derived from WEHI-164 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines was 94.4 nm and 107.8 nm, respectively, with high homogeneity. When comparing the radius measured by TEM with the radius measured by DLS, it was revealed that the difference between the two methods was about 40 nm. This study has significance in characterizing the molecular properties of exosomes from a fibrosarcoma, which has not been researched much before, and in providing clear evidence that DLS can be used as an efficient, convenient and noninvasive technique to simply check the homogeneity and size of exosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3122632485,"In recent years, it has become apparent that the gut microbiome can influence the functioning and pathological states of organs and systems throughout the body. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiome has a major role in the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone rats (SHRSP), an animal model for hypertensive cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Loss of BBB is thought to be an early and initiating component to the full expression of CSVD in animal models and humans. To test this hypothesis, newly born SHRSP pups were placed with foster dams of the SHRSP strain or dams of the WKY strain, the control strain that does not demonstrate BBB dysfunction or develop hypertensive CSVD. Similarly, WKY pups were placed with foster dams of the same or opposite strain. The rationale for cross fostering is that the gut microbiomes are shaped by environmental bacteria of the foster dam and the nesting surroundings. Analysis of the bacterial genera in feces, using 16S rRNA analysis, demonstrated that the gut microbiome in the rat pups was influenced by the foster dam. SHRSP offspring fostered on WKY dams had systolic blood pressures (SBPs) that were significantly decreased by 26 mmHg (P < .001) from 16-20 weeks, compared to SHRSP offspring fostered on SHRSP dams. Similarly WKY offspring fostered on SHRSP dams had significantly increased SBP compared to WKY offspring fostered on WKY dams, although the magnitude of SBP change was not as robust. At ~20 weeks of age, rats fostered on SHRSP dams showed enhanced inflammation in distal ileum regardless of the strain of the offspring. Disruption of BBB integrity, an early marker of CSVD onset, was improved in SHRSPs that were fostered on WKY dams when compared to the SHRSP rats fostered on SHRSP dams. Although SHRSP is a genetic model for CSVD, environmental factors such as the gut microbiota of the foster dam have a major influence in the loss of BBB integrity."
https://openalex.org/W3124134442,"This study aims to highlight SARS-COV-2 mutations which are associated with increased or decreased viral virulence. We utilize genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries’ regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein."
https://openalex.org/W3125059163,"The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going through a period of great expectations, introducing a certain level of anxiety in research, business and also policy. This anxiety is further energised by an AI race narrative that makes people believe they might be missing out. Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to “win”. Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in the latter regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the nature and kinds of regulatory actions most suitable to improve safety compliance in the contexts of both smooth and sudden technological shifts."

https://openalex.org/W3123618347,"Historic wooden structures in Polar Regions are being adversely affected by decay fungi and a warming climate will likely accelerate degradation. Fort Conger and the Peary Huts at Lady Franklin Bay in northern Ellesmere Island are important international heritage sites associated with early exploration in the High Arctic. Fort Conger, built by Adolphus Greely and expedition members during the First International Polar Year in 1881, was dismantled and used by Robert Peary and his expedition crew in the early 1900’s to build several smaller shelters. These historic structures remain at the site but are deteriorating. This investigation examines the fungi associated with wood decay in the historic woods. Soft rot was observed in all 125 wood samples obtained from the site. The major taxa found associated with the decayed wood were Coniochaeta (18%), Phoma (13%) Cadophora (12%), Graphium (9%), and Penicillium (9%) as well as many other Ascomycota that are known to cause soft rot in wood. Micromorphological observations using scanning electron microscopy of historic wooden timbers that were in ground contact revealed advanced stages of type I soft rot. No wood destroying Basidiomycota were found. Identification of the fungi associated with decay in these historic woods is a first step to better understand the unusual decomposition processes underway in this extreme environment and will aid future research to help control decay and preserve this important cultural heritage."
https://openalex.org/W3122784303,"The adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (Ampk) is a central regulator of metabolic pathways, and increasing Ampk activity has been considered to be an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we have identified an orphan ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit protein, Fbxo48, that targets the active, phosphorylated Ampkα (pAmpkα) for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. We have generated a novel Fbxo48 inhibitory compound, BC1618, whose potency in stimulating Ampk-dependent signaling greatly exceeds 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-ribofuranoside (AICAR) or metformin. This compound increases the biological activity of Ampk not by stimulating the activation of Ampk, but rather by preventing activated pAmpkα from Fbxo48-mediated degradation. We demonstrate that, consistent with augmenting Ampk activity, BC1618 promotes mitochondrial fission, facilitates autophagy and improves hepatic insulin sensitivity in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. Hence, we provide a unique bioactive compound that inhibits pAmpkα disposal. Together, these results define a new pathway regulating Ampk biological activity and demonstrate the potential utility of modulating this pathway for therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W3123174506,"Background and aim The association between body mass index (BMI) and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) has been inconsistent. We aimed to explore the association of BMI with FGIDs in a primary care setting to provide more data in this area. Methods A cross-sectional study of consecutive Asian adults attending a primary healthcare setting was conducted. This study was conducted in 2 phases: The association between BMI and common FGIDs (functional diarrhea/FD, irritable bowel syndrome/IBS, functional diarrhea and functional constipation/FC) was studied initially. The influence of anxiety and depression on BMI and FGIDs was additionally explored in phase 2. Results A total of 1002 subjects (median age 32 years, 65.4% females, 90.7% Malay ethnicity, 73.2% higher than secondary level education) were recruited between August 2019 to January 2020. The majority of subjects were obese (39.2%), and had central obesity (51.7%), while 6.1% had metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of FD, IBS, functional diarrhea and FC were 7.5% (n = 75), 4.0% (n = 40), 1.2% (n = 12) and 10.5% (n = 105) respectively, based on the Rome III criteria. Among individual FGIDs, FD subjects had more underweight adults (BMI&lt;18.5kg/m 2 ) compared to controls (13.3% vs 3.5%, P = 0.002) and being underweight remained as an independent association with FD [OR = 3.648 (95%CI 1.494–8.905), P = 0.004] at multi-variate analysis. There were no independent associations between BMI and other FGIDs. When psychological morbidity was additionally explored, anxiety (OR 2.032; 95%CI = 1.034–3.991, p = 0.040), but not depression, and a BMI&lt;18.5kg/m 2 (OR 3.231; 95%CI = 1.066–9.796, p = 0.038) were found to be independently associated with FD. Conclusions FD, but not other FGIDs, is associated with being underweight. This association is independent of the presence of anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W3124859900,"Objective Cardiac sarcoidosis is difficult to diagnose, often requiring expensive and inconvenient advanced imaging techniques. Circulating exosomes contain genetic material, such as microRNA (miRNA), that are derived from diseased tissues and may serve as potential disease-specific biomarkers. We thus sought to determine whether circulating exosome-derived miRNA expression patterns would distinguish cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) from acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods Plasma and serum samples conforming to CS, AMI or disease-free controls were procured from the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center repository and National Jewish Health. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on exosome-derived total RNA (n = 10 for each group), and miRNA expression levels were compared after normalization using housekeeping miRNA. Quality assurance measures excluded poor quality RNA samples. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNA patterns, based upon &gt;2-fold change ( p &lt; 0.01), were established in CS compared to controls, and in CS compared to AMI. Relative expression of several DE-miRNA were validated by qRT-PCR. Results Despite the advanced age of the stored samples (~5–30 years), the quality of the exosome-derived miRNA was intact in ~88% of samples. Comparing plasma exosomal miRNA in CS versus controls, NGS yielded 18 DE transcripts (12 up-regulated, 6 down-regulated), including miRNA previously implicated in mechanisms of myocardial injury (miR-92, miR-21) and immune responses (miR-618, miR-27a). NGS further yielded 52 DE miRNA in serum exosomes from CS versus AMI: 5 up-regulated in CS; 47 up-regulated in AMI, including transcripts previously detected in AMI patients (miR-1-1, miR-133a, miR-208b, miR-423, miR-499). Five miRNAs with increased DE in CS included two isoforms of miR-624 and miR-144, previously reported as markers of cardiomyopathy. Conclusions MiRNA patterns of exosomes derived from CS and AMI patients are distinct, suggesting that circulating exosomal miRNA patterns could serve as disease biomarkers. Further studies are required to establish their specificity relative to other cardiac disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3121886134,"Background Colleges and universities across the country are struggling to develop strategies for effective control of COVID-19 transmission as students return to campus. Methods and findings We conducted a prospective cohort study with students living on or near the UC Berkeley campus from June 1st through August 18th, 2020 with the goal of providing guidance for campus reopening in the safest possible manner. In this cohort, we piloted an alternative testing model to provide access to low-barrier, high-touch testing and augment student-driven testing with data-driven adaptive surveillance that targets higher-risk students and triggers testing notifications based on reported symptoms, exposures, or other relevant information. A total of 2,180 students enrolled in the study, 51% of them undergraduates. Overall, 6,247 PCR tests were administered to 2,178 students over the two-month period. Overall test positivity rate was 0.9%; 2.6% of students tested positive. Uptake and acceptability of regular symptom and exposure surveys was high; 98% of students completed at least one survey, and average completion rate was 67% (Median: 74%, IQR: 39%) for daily reporting of symptoms and 68% (Median: 75%, IQR: 40%) for weekly reporting of exposures. Of symptom-triggered tests, 5% were PCR-positive; of exposure-triggered tests, 10% were PCR-positive. The integrated study database augmented traditional contact tracing during an outbreak; 17 potentially exposed students were contacted the following day and sent testing notifications. At study end, 81% of students selected their desire “to contribute to UC Berkeley’s response to COVID-19” as a reason for their participation in the Safe Campus study. Conclusions Our results illustrate the synergy created by bringing together a student-friendly, harm reduction approach to COVID-19 testing with an integrated data system and analytics. We recommend the use of a confidential, consequence-free, incentive-based daily symptom and exposure reporting system, coupled with low-barrier, easy access, no stigma testing. Testing should be implemented alongside a system that integrates multiple data sources to effectively trigger testing notifications to those at higher risk of infection and encourages students to come in for low-barrier testing when needed."
https://openalex.org/W3122801259,"Biomarkers play a pivotal role in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by facilitating early diagnosis and ‘treat to the target.’ However, no gold standard biomarker has been identified for monitoring the disease activity in RA. Cytokines, a diverse group of small protein molecules secreted by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), play a pivotal role in pathogenesis and disease progression in RA. Research is currently underway to find out the applicability of cytokines as biomarkers in RA. This study aimed to quantify the PBMCs that secrete four types of cytokines; TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-17A in two cohorts of active RA patients (early RA patients and established RA patients), compared to healthy controls (HC), using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay, and to assess their association with measures of disease activity of RA. Patients were recruited from outpatient rheumatology clinics, and the disease activity was assessed using single and composite measures of disease activity. The cytokine expression was evaluated using freshly separated PBMCs from whole blood of RA patients using the ELISPOT assay. The number of PBMCs (counted as spot-forming cells (SFCs) per 10 5 PBMCs) that secreted the cytokine of interest were statistically significantly higher in early RA patients, compared to HC, for IL-17A (P&lt;0.05). Such an increased number of SFCs was not observed in the established RA group, compared to controls, for any of the cytokines tested. The correlation analysis showed that IL-17A is having a moderate correlation (Spearman`s ρ, p &lt;0.05) with five clinical measures of disease activity, including disease activity score 28 (DAS28). According to the multivariable linear regression models, IL17A was a good predictor of both the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI). In conclusion, IL-17A has potential applicability as a biomarker of disease activity of RA."
https://openalex.org/W3124456994,"The gut microbiota has been shown to play a role in energy metabolism of the host. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may predispose to obesity on the one hand, and stunting on the other. The aim of the study was to study the difference in gut microbiota composition of stunted Indonesian children and children of normal nutritional status between 3 and 5 years. Fecal samples and anthropometric measurements, in addition to economic and hygiene status were collected from 78 stunted children and 53 children with normal nutritional status in two regions in Banten and West Java provinces: Pandeglang and Sumedang, respectively. The gut microbiota composition was determined by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The composition was correlated to nutritional status and anthropometric parameters. Macronutrient intake was on average lower in stunted children, while energy-loss in the form of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) appeared to be higher in stunted children. In stunted children, at the phylum level the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (44.4%) was significantly lower than in normal children (51.3%; p -value 2.55*10 −4 ), while Firmicutes was significantly higher (45.7% vs. 39.8%; p -value 5.89*10 −4 ). At the genus level, overall Prevotella 9 was the most abundant genus (average of 27%), and it was significantly lower in stunted children than in normal children (23.5% vs. 30.5%, respectively; q -value 0.059). Thirteen other genera were significantly different between stunted and normal children ( q -value &lt; 0.1), some of which were at low relative abundance and present in only a few children. Prevotella 9 positively correlated with height (in line with its higher relative abundance in normal children) and weight. In conclusion, Prevotella 9, which was the most abundant genus in the children, was significantly lower in stunted children. The abundance of Prevotella has been correlated with dietary fibre intake, which was lower in these stunted children. Since fibres are fermented by the gut microbiota into SCFA, and these SCFA are a source of energy for the host, increasing the proportion of Prevotella in stunted children may be of benefit. Whether this would prevent the occurrence of stunting or even has the potential to revert it, remains to be seen in follow up research."

We analyzed the whole seedlings, which allowed us to recognize the systemic response of the plants to the infection. We decided to analyze two time points: 24h and 48h, because our goal was to learn the mechanisms activated in the initial stages of infection, these points were selected based on the previous analysis of chitinase gene expression, whose increase in time of Fusarium oxysporum lini infection has been repeatedly confirmed both in the case of flax and other plant species.

Until recently, it was believed that overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) and polycistronic mRNAs only occurred in prokaryotes and viruses. However, recent studies have challenged the notion of an mRNA coding for a single annotated protein and showed the pervasive properties of the translation machinery (1Mouilleron H. Delcourt V. Roucou X. Death of a dogma: Eukaryotic mRNAs can code for more than one protein.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Multiple examples of mRNAs coding for an annotated coding sequence (RefORF) and an alternative open reading frame (AltORF) have been published in recent years (2Kondo T. Hashimoto Y. Kato K.

About 183,000 AltORFs are predicted in the human transcriptome, of which 76% are predicted to be encoded in coding RNAs (6Samandi S. Roy A.V. Delcourt V. Lucier J.-F. Gagnon J. Beaudoin M.C.

These AltORFs localize in the 5'/3'-UTRs or overlap the annotated coding sequence (CDS) in the +2 or the +3 reading frames. Several specific examples have been reported in recent years, the first one being ALEX, an AltORF encoded in the coding sequence of the G protein XLαs (11Abramowitz J. Grenet D. Birnbaumer M. Torres H.N. Birnbaumer L. XLαs, the extra-long form of the α-subunit of the Gs G protein, is significantly longer than suspected, and so is its companion Alex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two overlapping reading frames in a single exon encode interacting proteins—a novel way of gene usage.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3849-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ALEX interacts with XLαs and prevents it from activating the adenylate cyclase. More recently, the rat Adora2a gene has been shown to code for the adenosine A2a receptor and a novel alternative protein encoded in an AltORF located in the 5’UTR, named uORF5. Expression of uORF5 modulates the expression of several genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/ERK pathway, and stimulation of the A2aR receptor results in an increase in uORF5 expression (7Lee C. Lai H.-L. Lee Y.-C. Chien C.-L. Chern Y. The A2A adenosine receptor is a dual coding gene: A novel mechanism of gene usage and signal transduction.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 1257-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Another recent example is the discovery of the seven amino acid peptide named PEP7, which is encoded in an AltORF present in the 5'UTR of the rat angiotensin AT1aR gene (14Liu J. Yosten G.L.C. Ji H. Zhang D. Zheng W. Speth R.C. Samson W.K. Sandberg K. Selective inhibition of angiotensin receptor signaling through Erk1/2 pathway by a novel peptide.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2014; 306: R619-R626Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Exogenously applied PEP7 inhibited β-arrestin-dependent MAPK activation in HEK293 cells expressing AT1aR. In vivo, PEP7 blocked angiotensin II-stimulated saline intake (14Liu J. Yosten G.L.C. Ji H. Zhang D. Zheng W. Speth R.C. Samson W.K. Sandberg K. Selective inhibition of angiotensin receptor signaling through Erk1/2 pathway by a novel peptide.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2014; 306: R619-R626Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using the Openprot database (16Brunet M.A. Brunelle M. Lucier J.-F. Delcourt V. Levesque M. Grenier F. Samandi S. Leblanc S. Aguilar J.-D. Dufour P. Jacques J.-F. Fournier I. Ouangraoua A. Scott M.S. Boisvert F.-M. et al.OpenProt: A more comprehensive guide to explore eukaryotic coding potential and proteomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D403-D410PubMed Google Scholar), we identified a total of 4645 putative novel AltORFs with a minimum length of 30 codons in 81% of the 830 human G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes (Fig. 1A; see Table S1 for complete list of AltORFs). In total, 42% of them are localized in the 3'UTR, 23% in the 5'UTR, and more than 35% are predicted to overlap the annotated GPCR coding sequence. The human BDKRB2 gene has nine predicted AltORFs (Fig. 1B, Table S2). One of them is a 474 nucleotide AltORF overlapping the coding sequence of B2R in the +3 reading frame (Fig. 1B). This AltORF, which we termed AltB2R, is predicted to produce a 157 amino acid long protein with a 17 kDa molecular weight and an isoelectric point of 6.58 (ProtParam tool, ExPASy server). PSORT bioinformatic analysis indicates that AltB2R is likely to be a soluble cytosolic protein rather than a transmembrane protein (not shown). B2R exhibits constitutive expression in various tissues/organs and exerts pleiotropic (beneficial and deleterious) effects in various physiopathological conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers (17Regoli D.

The role of kinin receptors in cancer and therapeutic opportunities.Cancer Lett. 2014; 345: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Its principal peptide agonist ligands are the nona- and decapeptide bradykinin and Lys-BK (alias kallidin; KD), respectively. Whereas the carboxy-terminally truncated peptide metabolites desArg9-BK and desArg10-KD, derived from enzymatic activities of carboxypeptidases M/N, selectively bind to the other type of kinin receptor, the inducible B1R (22Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F.

Rev. 2005; 57: 27-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). B2R can initiate multiple signaling pathways through multiple G proteins (e.g., Gαq/11, Gα12/13, Gαi and Gαs) and β-Arrestins (βarrs) in mammalian cells (22Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F.

These latter are often linked to successive activation of MAPK/ERK1/2 involved in transcription of genes that promote cellular proliferation and survival (22Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F.

In this study, we investigated whether the expression of AltB2R can directly regulate B2R activity. Our results demonstrated that AltB2R can interact with B2R protein and enhance B2R-mediated transduction signals occurring through Gαq/i2/i3 signaling activity. We also showed bona fide endogenous coexpression of AltB2R and B2R with variable expression patterns, in clinical specimens of different types of solid human cancers, indicating that it is likely to perform important functions in these diseases. To test whether AltB2R is coexpressed with B2R, an HA tag was introduced in frame with AltB2R to produce carboxy-tagged AltB2R (AltB2RHA), within the B2R coding sequence. Since B2R has a C-terminal Flag tag, this construct is termed B2R(HA)Flag to indicate that the HA tag is silent within the B2R reading frame (Fig. 2A). Control constructs included B2RFlag and AltB2RHA. B2RFlag and AltB2RHA were detected in cells transfected with B2R(HA)Flag, indicating that both proteins are expressed from the coding sequence of B2R (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence staining in permeabilized HeLa cells transfected with AltB2RHA showed the cytoplasmic localization of the protein with a nonhomogeneous distribution (Fig. 2C). Cotransfection with B2RFlag indicated that both proteins colocalized at the cell membrane, perinuclear regions, and in cytoplasmic foci, most likely to be endosome and/or plasma membrane transport vesicles (Fig. 2C). Similar experiments conducted in nonpermeabilized cell conditions gave strong punctate surface staining of the B2R (Fig. 2D). Further confirmation of the cytoplasmic localization of AltB2R was obtained by western blot analysis of highly purified subcellular fractions (nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell membrane fractions) (Fig. 2E). Cytoplasmic colocalization of B2R and AltB2R suggested a possible interaction between both proteins. To test this hypothesis, we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) based on the association of split VENUS fragments composed of VN (amino acids 1–210) and VC (amino acids 210–238). B2RFlag-VN and VC-AltB2RHA displayed a membranous/cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3A), in accordance with our previous microscopy and western blot data. Cells cotransfected with B2RFlag-VN and VC-AltB2RHA displayed Venus fluorescence, confirming B2R/AltB2R interaction in cellulo (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3B). In support of a specific interaction between B2R and AltB2R, competition with B2R lacking the VN fragment or AltB2R lacking the VC fragment completely prevented the formation of BiFC complexes (Fig. 3A). Further experiments performed with constructs where the Venus fragments were switched around to B2RFlag-VC and VN-AltB2RHA gave similar positive results (data not shown). In control experiments, cells expressing either VN or VC, VN and VC, B2R-VN and VC, or VC-AltB2R and VN did not display any BiFC signal (Fig. 3B). To demonstrate the specificity of interaction between AltB2R and B2R, we conducted similar experiments in cells transfected with the human B1RFlag-VC and VN-AltB2RHA. In this experimental setting, no BiFC signal could be detected between the two proteins, suggesting some degree of specificity in the association between AltB2R and B2R (Fig. S3A). Next, we tested if the physical interaction between AltB2R and B2R could modulate B2R signaling processes. Considering that many signaling pathways of B2R converge toward the activation of MAPK ERK1/2 (27Blaukat A. Structure and signalling pathways of kinin receptors.Andrologia. 2003; 35: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we first studied the level of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 upon agonist stimulation of endogenous B2R in HeLa cells. The metabolically stabilized, selective, potent B2R agonists NG291 and RMP-7 were used in these functional assays and in others to avoid possible interference and unpredictable actions of peptidases on B2R signaling (ex. formation of active metabolites at receptors other than B2R, cross talk between peptidases and B2R) in the cell models employed for the study, i.e., HeLa and HEK293 cells (28Bausch-Fluck D. Hofmann A. Bock T. Frei A.P. Cerciello F. Jacobs A. Moest H. Omasits U. Gundry R.L. Yoon C. Schiess R. Schmidt A. Mirkowska P. Härtlová A. Van Eyk J.E. et al.A mass spectrometric-derived cell surface protein atlas.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0121314Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Campbell D.J. Neprilysin inhibitors and bradykinin.Front. Med. 2018; 5: 257Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In mock-HeLa cells stimulated with RMP-7, levels of phospho-ERK1/2 reached a maximum 10 min poststimulation and returned to basal levels after 30 min (Fig. 4A). ERK1/2 phosphorylation kinetics were similar in HeLa cells stably expressing AltB2R, but maximum levels at 10 min were significantly higher compared with mock cells (Fig. 4A). We performed the same assays using instead the biostable, selective B1R agonist NG29 (30Savard M. Côté J. Tremblay L. Neugebauer W. Regoli D. Gariépy S. Hébert N. Gobeil F. Safety and pharmacokinetics of a kinin B1 receptor peptide agonist produced with different counter-ions.Biol. Chem. 2016; 397: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and did not observe any difference in the increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 between mock and AltB2RFlag cells (Fig. S3), indicating some functional specificity of AltB2R toward the modulation of MAPK from B2R. Since B2R-induced MAPK ERK1/2 activation often requires the mobilization of intracellular calcium (i[Ca2+]), we then analyzed whether the presence of AltB2R can also impact intensity of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in B2R-stimulated cells previously loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-4. In mock stable cells, RMP-7 treatment induced a significant increase in i[Ca2+] (Fig. 4B). In AltB2RFlag-expressing cells, basal levels of free Ca2+ were significantly lower compared with mock cells. Interestingly, these latter cells had significantly higher Ca2+ mobilization levels compared with mock cells in response to RMP-7 (Fig. 4B). From these observations, it could be inferred that the potentiation of B2R agonist responses elicited by AltB2R may involve upstream targets of MAPK/ERK and Ca2+ pathways. In order to further substantiate the magnitude of effects of AltB2R on the pharmacological and signaling properties of B2R, we generated a mutant construct termed B2R(Ø), expressed in HEK293A cells (Fig. S1A). This construct is a monocistronic version of B2R with the mutation C168T. In this mutant, a premature stop codon is introduced in the AltB2R coding sequence (Q11stop) in a manner synonymous for B2R (L56 L). Thus, the B2R encodes B2R and AltB2R, whereas mutant B2R(Ø) encodes only B2R. Indeed, western blotting showed that cells transfected with B2R(Ø) did not express AltB2R, while having relatively unaltered B2R expression compared with mutant cells encoding both B2R/AtlB2R (Fig. S1B). Western blotting experiments showed that in B2R-expressing cells stimulated with RMP-7, levels of phospho-ERK1/2 reached a maximum at 5 min poststimulation and returned to basal levels after 15 min (Fig. 5A). ERK1/2 phosphorylation kinetics were similar in cells transfected with B2R(Ø), but maximal levels of phospho-ERK1/2 were significantly lower (Fig. 5A). To consolidate the western blot data, AlphaLISA assays were also conducted in parallel in the same cell lines for the quantitative analyses of B2R-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5, B and C). Again, the results showed decreased maximal levels of phospho-ERK1/2 in B2R(Ø) versus B2R-transfected cells when stimulated with either RMP-7 or NG291. Since calcium mobilization precedes ERK1/2 phosphorylation and results from 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) binding to IP3R at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, we tested whether the presence AltB2R could also amplify production of IP3 resulting from B2R activation. IP3 formation (indirectly measured via its stabilized metabolite IP1) was assessed following generation of full concentration-response profiles of B2R agonists RMP-7 and NG291 in B2R and B2R(Ø)-transfected cells. Results indicated no significant difference in potencies (EC50 values) of agonists between B2R- and B2R(Ø)-transfected cells (Fig. 5, D and E). However, significantly lower agonist efficacies (Emax values) were noted in cells without AltB2R expression (16 and 22% reduction of efficacy for RMP-7 and NG291, respectively). These results indicate that AltB2R may impact B2R signal transduction pathways at various levels. The observation that AltB2R is necessary to achieve a full production of IP3 upon B2R stimulation suggests that AltB2R modulates coupling between B2R and Gαq and/or Gαi. To test this hypothesis, we used live-cell bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) measurements to monitor the activation of G proteins by B2R. HEK293A cells were cotransfected with vectors coding for Gαq-RlucII or Gαi2/3-RlucII, Gβ, GFP10-Gγ1, and B2R or B2R(Ø). In this experimental setting, the dissociation of Gαq-RlucII or Gαi2/3-RlucII from GFP10-Gγ1 results in a decrease of BRET signals. BRET data in Figure 6, A–C are presented relative to the maximum B2R-induced BRET response. We observed no difference of the EC50 for the dissociation Gαq/Gγ1 in B2R-transfected cells compared with B2R(Ø)-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). There was a significant decrease in the maximal dissociation Emax (100 ± 10% versus 74 ± 8% for B2R and B2R(Ø), respectively). For the dissociation Gαi2/Gγ1, we observed no difference in the EC50 whether AltB2R was present or absent, but Emax decreased from 100 ± 11% in B2R-transfected cells to 66 ± 12% in B2R(Ø)-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). For the dissociation of Gαi3/Gγ1, the EC50 was similar in B2R- and B2R(Ø)-transfected cells, but Emax was significantly lower in B2R(Ø)-transfected cells (60 ± 22% versus 100 ± 21%) (Fig. 6C). Since both G proteins and β-arrestins commonly participate in activation of MAPK pathways, we extended the BRET analysis to determine the effects of AltB2R on the efficacy of β-arrestin2 recruitment at the plasma membrane of HEK293A cells transfected with vectors coding for β-arrestin2-RLucII, rGFP-CAAX, and B2R or B2R(Ø). BRET signals were monitored after addition of NG291. We detected no difference in the recruitment of β-arrestin2 in cells either expressing or not AltB2R (Fig. 6D); similar results were obtained with BK (data not shown). Moreover, AltB2R did not impair both the magnitude and rate of agonist-promoted internalization of B2R, most likely dependent on β-arrestin2 (31Zimmerman B. Simaan M. Akoume M.-Y. Houri N.

https://openalex.org/W3125068049,"Background/Objectives This study aimed to study one-month recovery profile and to identify predictors of Quality of Recovery (QOR) after painful day surgery and investigate the influence of pain therapy on QOR. Methods/Design This is a secondary analysis of a single-centre, randomised controlled trial of 200 patients undergoing ambulatory haemorrhoid surgery, arthroscopic shoulder or knee surgery, or inguinal hernia repair between January 2016 and March 2017. Primary endpoints were one-month recovery profile and prevalence of poor/good QOR measured by the Functional Recovery Index (FRI), the Global Surgical Recovery index and the EuroQol questionnaire at postoperative day (POD) 1 to 4, 7, 14 and 28. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of QOR at POD 7, 14, and 28. Differences in QOR between pain treatment groups were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Four weeks after haemorrhoid surgery, inguinal hernia repair, arthroscopic knee and arthroscopic shoulder surgery, good QOR was present in 71%, 76%, 57% and 24% respectively. Poor QOR was present in 5%, 0%, 7% and 29%, respectively. At POD 7 and POD 28, predictors for poor/intermediate QOR were type of surgery and a high postoperative pain level at POD 4. Male gender was another predictor at POD 7. Female gender and having a paid job were also predictors at POD 28. Type of surgery and long term fear of surgery were predictors at POD 14. No significant differences in total FRI scores were found between the two different pain treatment groups. Conclusions The present study shows a procedure-specific variation in recovery profile in the 4-week period after painful day surgery. The best predictors for short-term (POD 7) and long-term (POD 28) poor/intermediate QOR were a high postoperative pain level at POD 4 and type of surgery. Different pain treatment regimens did not result in differences in recovery profile. Trial registration European Union Clinical Trials Register 2015-003987-35 ."

In particular, recent studies have demonstrated that albumin reduces leukocyte cytokine production. Here, we investigated whether albumin also has the ability to protect tissues from the damaging actions of these inflammatory mediators. We circumscribed our investigation to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, which exemplifies the connection between immunity and tissue injury. In vivo experiments in analbuminemic mice showed that these mice exhibit a more pronounced response to a model of TNFα-mediated liver injury induced by the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (D-gal). A tissue protective action against LPS/D-gal liver injury was also observed during the administration of human albumin to humanized mice expressing the human genes for albumin and neonatal Fc receptor (hAlb+/+/hFcRn+/+) with preestablished carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced early cirrhosis. The cytoprotective actions of albumin against TNFα-induced injury were confirmed ex vivo, in precision-cut liver slices, and in vitro, in primary hepatocytes in culture. Albumin protective actions were independent of its scavenging properties and were reproduced by recombinant human albumin expressed in Oryza sativa. Albumin cytoprotection against TNFα injury was related to inhibition of lysosomal cathepsin B leakage accompanied by reductions in mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity. These data provide evidence that in addition to reducing cytokines, the albumin molecule also has the ability to protect tissues against inflammatory injury."

Heterodimeric complexes of yeast Ups1/Mdm35 or human PRELID1/TRIAP1 shuttle phosphatidic acid (PA) mainly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the inner membrane, where it is converted to cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondria. Loss of Ups1/PRELID1 proteins impairs the accumulation of CL and broadly affects mitochondrial structure and function. Unexpectedly and unlike yeast cells lacking the CL synthase Crd1, Ups1-deficient yeast cells exhibit glycolytic growth defects, pointing to functions of Ups1-mediated PA transfer beyond CL synthesis. Here, we show that the disturbed intramitochondrial transport of PA in ups1Δ cells leads to altered unfolded protein response (UPR) and mTORC1 signaling, independent of disturbances in CL synthesis. The impaired flux of PA into mitochondria is associated with the increased synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and a reduced phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine ratio in the ER of ups1Δ cells which suppresses the UPR. Moreover, we observed inhibition of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling in these cells. Activation of either UPR by ER protein stress or of TORC1 signaling by disruption of its negative regulator, the Seh1-associated complex inhibiting TORC1 complex, increased cytosolic protein synthesis, and restored glycolytic growth of ups1Δ cells. These results demonstrate that PA influx into mitochondria is required to preserve ER membrane homeostasis and that its disturbance is associated with impaired glycolytic growth and cellular stress signaling.

The functional integrity of mitochondria depends on characteristic lipid compositions of their membranes, the mitochondrial outer and inner membrane (OM and IM) (1Tatsuta T. Langer T.

CL is synthesized along an enzymatic cascade at the IM from phosphatidic acid (PA), which is mainly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and imported into mitochondria (16Lev S.

Although it has been reported that PA can be produced in mitochondrial membranes by phospholipases and kinases (17Choi S.Y. Huang P. Jenkins G.M. Chan D.C. Schiller J.

Similar to other membrane lipids, PA is transported from the ER to the OM at membrane contact sites, which facilitate the bi-directional transport of phospholipids between both organelles. Studies on the cellular distribution of newly synthesized phosphatidylserine (PS) revealed that phospholipid transfer to mitochondria can be driven by localized synthesis (21Gaigg B. Simbeni R.

Loss of Ups1 or PRELID1 in yeast or human cells, respectively, inhibits intramitochondrial PA transport and limits CL synthesis at the IM, which is accompanied by mitochondrial deficiencies, such as impaired respiration and mitochondrial fragmentation, and increases the susceptibility of the cells toward apoptotic stimuli (23Connerth M.

Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). High levels of PRELID1 and TRIAP1 were identified as an unfavorable prognostic marker in cancer (36Uhlen M. Zhang C.

Hober S. et al.A pathology atlas of the human cancer transcriptome.Science. 2017; 357eaan2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). As cancer cells are often glycolytic, it is noteworthy that yeast cells lacking Ups1 also exhibit slow growth in glucose media (23Connerth M. Tatsuta T. Haag M. Klecker T. Westermann B. Langer T.

Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This phenotype is difficult to reconcile with reduced CL levels only, as cells lacking the CL synthase Crd1 in mitochondria grow normally in glucose-containing media although they are virtually devoid of CL (37Joshi A.S. Thompson M.N. Fei N. Huttemann M. Greenberg M.L. Cardiolipin and mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine have overlapping functions in mitochondrial fusion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17589-17597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the inhibition of intramitochondrial PA transport upon loss of Ups1 does not only perturb the mitochondrial membrane homeostasis but also causes deficiencies presumably beyond mitochondrial functions. Here, we demonstrate that a disturbed intramitochondrial transport of PA affects TORC1 signaling and alters the phospholipid homeostasis of the ER membrane modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR). To examine how the loss of Ups1 affects cell growth under glycolytic conditions, we used quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) to determine the phospholipid profile of cellular membranes in wild-type and ups1Δ cells which were grown in glucose-containing media. In agreement with previous findings (23Connerth M. Tatsuta T. Haag M. Klecker T. Westermann B. Langer T.

Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), we observed reduced CL levels in ups1Δ cells, reflecting impaired PA transport to CL-synthesizing enzymes at the IM (Fig. 1, A and B and Fig. S1A). We also noted a significant increase of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and a decrease of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), resulting in a low PE/PC ratio in cellular membranes (Fig. 1, A–C and Fig. S1A). Unexpectedly, deletion of UPS1 also affected the phospholipid composition of ER membranes. We observed an increased total phospholipid content of an ER-enriched membrane fraction, which was accompanied by a significant increase of PC and phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Fig. 1, D and E and Fig. S1B), and a low PE/PC ratio (Fig. 1F). Previous studies have reported that an increased PE/PC ratio in ER membranes activates the UPR independent of protein stress (38Gao X. van der Veen J.N. Vance J.E. Thiesen A. Vance D.E. Jacobs R.L.

We therefore monitored UPR induction in ups1Δ cells harboring GFP under the control of the UPR element (UPRE) in their genome (42Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S.

Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Whereas GFP accumulated in wild-type cells under basal conditions, GFP expression was decreased in cells lacking Ups1 which were grown in glucose- (Fig. 1, G and H) or galactose-containing media (Fig. S1, C and D). Moreover, we observed reduced mRNA levels of spliced HAC1, encoding a transcription factor involved in UPR (Fig. 1I) (43Walter P. Ron D.

Walter P.

We therefore conclude that basal gene expression under the control of UPRE is suppressed in ups1Δ cells. Notably and in contrast to ups1Δ cells, cells lacking other enzymes involved in CL synthesis (such as Tam41, Pgs1, or Crd1) did not show significant reduction of the GFP expression under UPRE (Fig. S1, E–H), pointing that CL defect per se does not lead to the suppression of UPR. A central sensor of UPR is the ER kinase Ire1, which senses unfolded proteins in the ER lumen as well as lipid bilayer stress in the membrane (43Walter P. Ron D.

Cells expressing Ire1(ΔIII) recapitulated the suppression of the UPR by the loss of Ups1 (Fig. 1, J and K). These results suggest that the altered phospholipid composition of ER membranes limits UPR activation in ups1Δ cells. To examine how a decreased PE/PC ratio in ER membranes affects UPR, we induced de novo synthesis of PC via the Kennedy pathway by supplementing the growth medium with choline (51Henry S.A. Kohlwein S.D. Carman G.M. Metabolism and regulation of glycerolipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 190: 317-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and monitored UPR activity. Choline supplementation increased PC levels in ER-enriched membrane fractions of wild-type cells and led to a lower PE/PC ratio in these membranes (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar to cells lacking Ups1, the decreased PE/PC ratio in ER membranes was accompanied by an impaired basal UPR (Fig. 2, C and D), which was not altered in cells expressing mutant Ire1(ΔIII) (Fig. 2, E and F). We conclude from these experiments that the basal UPR is impaired if the PE/PC ratio in ER membranes is decreased, whereas an increased PE/PC ratio in ER membranes induces the UPR (41Thibault G. Shui G. Kim W. McAlister G.C. Ismail N. Gygi S.P. Wenk M.R. Ng D.T. The membrane stress response buffers lethal effects of lipid disequilibrium by reprogramming the protein homeostasis network.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 16-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To unambiguously demonstrate that Ups1 affects UPR activation by modulating the phospholipid profile in ER membranes, we manipulated the PE/PC ratio in ups1Δ cells genetically. Yeast cells lacking Cho2 or Opi3, which are required for synthesis of PC from PE (51Henry S.A. Kohlwein S.D. Carman G.M. Metabolism and regulation of glycerolipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 190: 317-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), accumulate PE relative to PC (Fig. 2G). Accordingly, deletion of CHO2 or OPI3 induces the UPR (41Thibault G. Shui G. Kim W. McAlister G.C. Ismail N. Gygi S.P. Wenk M.R. Ng D.T. The membrane stress response buffers lethal effects of lipid disequilibrium by reprogramming the protein homeostasis network.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 16-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We therefore deleted CHO2 or OPI3 in ups1Δ cells, which strongly increased the PE/PC ratio in an ER-enriched membrane fraction (Fig. 2, G and H). This was accompanied by UPR activation in the absence of Ups1 (Fig. 2, I and J). Thus, ups1Δ cells maintain the ability to induce the UPR upon lipid bilayer stress, but the reduced PE/PC ratio in the ER membrane of ups1Δ cells impairs the UPR under basal conditions. Having established the link between Ups1 and UPR activation, we examined in further experiments whether the reduced UPR activity can explain the impaired glycolytic growth of ups1Δ cells. We therefore treated ups1Δ cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation, which causes ER protein stress and induces the UPR. Treatment with tunicamycin activated the UPR both in wild-type and in ups1Δ cells (Fig. 3A) and allowed growth of ups1Δ cells on fermentable medium (Fig. 3B). Consistently, activation of the UPR upon overexpression of Ire1 (Fig. 3C) (47Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

Walter P. Oligomerization and phosphorylation of the Ire1p kinase during intracellular signaling from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3028-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) or deletion of CHO2 or OPI3 (Fig. 2, I and J) suppressed growth deficiencies of ups1Δ cells on glucose-containing medium (Fig. 3, D and E). The restoration of cell growth by tunicamycin and overexpression of Ire1 depended on Ire1-Hac1 signaling (Fig. 3, F and G), demonstrating that UPR activation is sufficient to promote glycolytic growth of ups1Δ cells. Notably, previous studies correlated the growth of ups1Δ cells on glucose-containing media with mitochondrial CL levels (53Miyata N. Goda N. Matsuo K. Hoketsu T. Kuge O. Cooperative function of Fmp30, Mdm31, and Mdm32 in Ups1-independent cardiolipin accumulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 16447Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Ire1 did not alter the accumulation of CL (Fig. 3G). We therefore conclude that UPR activation is sufficient to allow growth of ups1Δ cells on fermentable carbon sources independent of CL levels in mitochondrial membranes. We noted that the loss of UPR activity in ire1Δ and hac1Δ cells did not limit growth in glucose-containing medium (Fig. 3F). This contrasts ups1Δ cells and therefore points to additional deficiencies in ups1Δ cells that limit cell growth. We therefore determined transcriptome and proteome profiles of ups1Δ cells under glycolytic growth conditions (Tables S1 and S2). Consistent with the observed impaired UPR activity, canonical UPR target genes were expressed at lower levels in ups1Δ cells when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. S2A). Both transcriptome and proteome profiles pointed to reduced protein synthesis in ups1Δ cells (Fig. 4, A and B). The expression of genes involved in processes driving protein synthesis, such as rRNA processing or ribosome biogenesis, was most prominently downregulated in ups1Δ cells (Fig. 4A and Table S3). Consistently, proteins regulating rRNA processing accumulated at reduced levels in ups1Δ cells (Fig. 4B and Table S4). Together, these data demonstrate that protein synthesis is inhibited in Ups1-deficient cells. The expression of genes related to protein synthesis is decreased under stress conditions (54Gasch A.P.

Most Indonesian pilgrims are senior adults and elderly adults, who are more prone to acquire infections during the Hajj ritual. The aims of this study are to investigate the dynamics of Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization and to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of pneumococcal strains in Indonesian pilgrims. This was a prospective multi-site longitudinal study in Indonesian hajj pilgrims aged &gt;18 years old in the year 2015. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the same subject before departure and upon arrival at the airport. S . pneumoniae was identified using conventional and molecular approach, while antibiotic susceptibility was determined using a disk diffusion method. Among 813 Hajj pilgrims who were enrolled from five sites in this study, the prevalence of S . pneumoniae carriage rates before- and after-the Hajj were 8.6% (95% CI 6.7–10.5%) and 8.2% (95% CI 6.4–10.1%), ( p value : 0.844) respectively. Serotype 16F, 6A/6B, 3, 18, and 23F were the five most prevalent serotypes before Hajj, whereas serotypes 3, 34, 13, 4, and 23F were the most prevalent serotypes after Hajj. Serotype 3 was identified as most acquired serotype during Hajj in Indonesian pilgrim. There was an increase in the percentage of isolates susceptible to co-trimoxazole after Hajj (42.9% versus 57.4%). The study provided an overview of the change of dynamics of S . pneumoniae serotype acquisition in Indonesian Hajj Pilgrims. Along with data of vaccination serotypes coverage and antimicrobial susceptibility, these findings may contribute to recommendation of vaccination and treatment policies in the future."

Currently available treatment modalities are limited to undesirable effects. Thus, in the present study, we sought to study the pathogenesis mechanism of EMS. For this purpose, the ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissues were resected from 86 patients with EMS and 54 infertile patients without EMS, respectively. The regulatory mechanism among HES family bHLH transcription factor 5 (HES5), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-induced factor 1 (TGIF1), F-box, and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7) was studied by performing co-immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, respectively. A mouse model of EMS was established to verify the aforementioned regulatory mechanism in vivo. Upregulation of HES5 and TGIF1, as well as downregulation of FBXW7, was observed in EMS endometrial tissues and human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs), respectively. The overexpression of HES5 was found to suppress the FBXW7 transcription and TGIF1 degradation, resulting in the inactivation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, as well as inhibition of hESC proliferation and invasion, thereby enhancing apoptosis. Results from a mouse model of EMS showed that the presence of HES5 contributed to the alleviation of EMS. Collectively, we attempted to provide a mechanistic insight into the unrecognized roles of the HES5/FBXW7 in EMS progression."
https://openalex.org/W3123060863,"Background Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for improving the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). Accurate positioning of the stimulation electrodes is necessary for better clinical outcomes. Objective We applied deep learning techniques to microelectrode recording (MER) signals to better predict motor function improvement, represented by the UPDRS part III scores, after bilateral STN DBS in patients with advanced PD. If we find the optimal stimulation point with MER by deep learning, we can improve the clinical outcome of STN DBS even under restrictions such as general anesthesia or non-cooperation of the patients. Methods In total, 696 4-second left-side MER segments from 34 patients with advanced PD who underwent bilateral STN DBS surgery under general anesthesia were included. We transformed the original signal into three wavelets of 1–50 Hz, 50–500 Hz, and 500–5,000 Hz. The wavelet-transformed MER was used for input data of the deep learning. The patients were divided into two groups, good response and moderate response groups, according to DBS on to off ratio of UPDRS part III score for the off-medication state, 6 months postoperatively. The ratio were used for output data in deep learning. The Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16 model with a multitask learning algorithm was used to estimate the bilateral effect of DBS. Different ratios of the loss function in the task-specific layer were applied considering that DBS affects both sides differently. Results When we divided the MER signals according to the frequency, the maximal accuracy was higher in the 50–500 Hz group than in the 1–50 Hz and 500–5,000 Hz groups. In addition, when the multitask learning method was applied, the stability of the model was improved in comparison with single task learning. The maximal accuracy (80.21%) occurred when the right-to-left loss ratio was 5:1 or 6:1. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Conclusion Clinical improvements in PD patients who underwent bilateral STN DBS could be predicted based on a multitask deep learning-based MER analysis."

Though not widely adopted, umbilical cord milking (UCM) may achieve faster transfusion when DCC cannot be performed such as when a neonate requires resuscitation. Methods Pragmatic, two-arm, randomized clinical trial in which consenting women in spontaneous labour or provider-initiated delivery at 28 to less than 37 weeks at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, were enrolled. At delivery, stable preterm infants were randomized to UCM (4 times) or DCC (60 seconds). Neonatal samples were collected for analysis at 24 hours after delivery. Maternal primary PPH (within 24 hours) and neonatal jaundice (within 1 week) were evaluated clinically. The primary outcome was the mean neonatal haemoglobin level at 24 hours after birth. Modified Intention to treat analysis was used for all outcomes. P-value was significant at p&lt;0.05. Results Between March 2018 to March 2019, 344 pregnant women underwent screening, and 280 eligible participants were randomized when delivery was imminent. The intervention was not performed on 19 ineligible neonates. Of the remaining 260 neonates, 133 underwent UCM while 128 underwent DCC. Maternal and neonatal baseline characteristics were similar. The mean neonatal haemoglobin (17.1 vs 17.5 grams per decilitre, p = 0.191), haematocrit (49.6% vs 50.3%, p = 0.362), anaemia (9.8% vs 11.7%, p = 0.627), maternal PPH (2.3% vs 3.1%, p = 0.719) were similar between UCM and DCC respectfully. However, neonatal polycythaemia (2.3% vs 8.6%, p = 0.024) and neonatal jaundice (6.8% vs 15.6%, p = 0.024) were statistically significantly lower in UCM compared to DCC. Conclusion UCM compared to DCC for preterm neonates resulted in similar outcomes for neonatal haemoglobin, haematocrit, anaemia and maternal primary PPH and a lower proportion of neonatal polycythaemia and clinical jaundice. UCM offers a comparable method of placental transfusion compared to DCC and may be considered as an alternative to DCC in preterm neonates at 28 to &lt;37 weeks’ gestation."
https://openalex.org/W3125949857,"Our preliminary findings have lead us to propose bone marrow adipocyte secretions as new contributors to bone loss. Indeed, using a coculture model based on human bone marrow stromal cells, we previously showed that soluble factors secreted by adipocytes induced the conversion of osteoblasts towards an adipocyte-like phenotype. In this study, microarray gene expression profiling showed profound transcriptomic changes in osteoblasts following coculture and confirmed the enrichment of the adipocyte gene signature. Double immunofluorescence microscopic analyses demonstrated the coexpression of adipogenic and osteoblastic specific markers in individual cells, providing evidence for a transdifferentiation event. At the molecular level, this conversion was associated with upregulated expression levels of reprogramming genes and a decrease in the DNA methylation level. In line with these in vitro results, preliminary immunohistochemical analysis of bone sections revealed adipogenic marker expression in osteoblasts from elderly subjects. Altogether, these data suggest that osteoblast transdifferentiation could contribute to decreased bone mass upon ageing."
https://openalex.org/W3121474858,"Introduction Understanding the risk factors for behavioral patterns in sexual relationships play a significant role in the reduction of the transmission of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Objective To investigate individual and community level factors on the lifetime number of sexual partners of women in Eswatini Material and methods The study was a secondary cross-sectional analysis of the 2014 Eswatini Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). A total of 2,832 women aged 15–49 years were asked in total, how many different people have you had sexual intercourse in your lifetime. The multilevel negative binomial regression model was used to analyze the data. Results The overall mean number of lifetime sexual partners was 2.78 (95% CI: 2.66, 2.91) in 2014. Compared to women aged 15–19, those aged 20 years and older, formerly married or never married reported more lifetime sexual partners compared to currently married women. Those that were aged 15 years and older at sexual debut reported fewer lifetime sexual partners compared to those that were aged less than 15 years. Compared to women that used a condom at last sexual intercourse, those that did not use a condom at last sexual encounter reported fewer lifetime sexual partners. Relative to women that lived with their sons and daughters, those that did not live with their sons and daughters reported more lifetime sexual partners. Women that lived in the Shiselweni and Lubombo regions reported fewer lifetime sexual partners compared to those residents in the Hhohho region. Conclusion Overall, lifetime sexual partners in Eswatini was significantly associated with individual characteristics and is unique across regions. Programs that aim to elucidate the factors associated with incident HIV infections among women in Eswatini should focus on individual and community-level factors that are associated with multiple sexual partnerships, which in turn might increase the risk of HIV exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3123041130,"Alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) represent a promising model system for the study of cellular processes underlying cell-to-cell transmission of alpha-synuclein proteopathic aggregates. However, the ability to differentiate the fate of internalized PFFs from those which remain in the extracellular environment remains limited due to the propensity for PFFs to adhere to the cell surface. Removal of PFFs requires repeated washing and/or specific quenching of extracellular fluorescent PFF signals. In this paper we present a new method for analyzing the fate of internalized alpha-synuclein. We inserted a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site between alpha-synuclein and green fluorescent protein and subjected cells to brief treatment with TEV protease after incubation with tagged PFFs. As the TEV protease is highly specific, non-toxic, and active under physiological conditions, protection from TEV cleavage can be used to distinguish internalized PFFs from those which remain attached to the cell surface. Using this experimental paradigm, downstream intracellular events can be analyzed via live or fixed cell microscopy as well as by Western blotting. We suggest that this method will be useful for understanding the fate of PFFs after endocytosis under various experimental manipulations."
https://openalex.org/W3123861664,"Periodontal diseases, including gingivitis and periodontitis, are a global oral health problem. Porphyromonas gingivalis , a key pathogen involved in the onset of periodontitis, is able to colonize the subgingival epithelium and invade the underlying connective tissue due to the contribution of cysteine proteases known as gingipains. In this study, we investigated the effects of a phenolic extract prepared from tart cherry ( Prunus cerasus L.) juice on the growth, adherence, and protease activity of P . gingivalis . We also assessed the protective effect of the tart cherry extract on the disruption of the oral epithelial barrier induced by P . gingivalis . The tart cherry extract that contains procyanidins and quercetin and its derivatives (rutinoside, glucoside) as the most important phenolic compounds attenuated P . gingivalis growth, reduced adherence to an experimental basement membrane matrix model, and decreased the protease activities of P . gingivalis . The tart cherry extract also exerted a protective effect on the integrity of the oral epithelial barrier in an in vitro model infected with P . gingivalis . More specifically, the extract prevented a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance as well as the destruction of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin). These results suggest that the tart cherry phenolic extract may be a promising natural product for the treatment of periodontitis through its ability to attenuate the virulence properties of P . gingivalis and curtail the ability of this pathogen to impair the oral epithelial barrier."
https://openalex.org/W3123998283,"With population growth and aging, more and more patients with cerebral infarction have varying degrees of disability. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels regulate many cellular functions by coupling metabolic status with cell membrane electrical activity. Nicorandil (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-nicotinamide nitrate) is the first KATP channel opener approved for clinical use. It has been reported that it might exert protective effects on the cerebral infarction by increasing cerebral blood flow and reducing inflammation. However, only a few studies explored its role in synaptogenesis. We made the rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Nicorandil was administered to rats via oral administration immediately after the surgery at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg and then daily for the next days. Infarct volume, cerebral edema, neurological deficits, cognitive impairment, and the level of Synaptophysin (SYP)、Growth associated protein-43 (GAP43) and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) levels were measured to evaluate the effect of nicorandil. Our data showed that nicorandil treatment could decrease brain damage, improve learning and memory, and increase SYP、GAP43 and NeuN level. Taken together, we propose that nicorandil, as an opener of the KATP channel, provides a neuroprotective role in MCAO by promoting synaptic connections."
https://openalex.org/W3121924915,"Background Peru is a Latin American country with a significant burden of hypertension that presents worrying rates of disparities in socioeconomic determinants. However, there is a lack of studies exploring the association between those determinants, hypertension and prehypertension in Peruvian population. Objective We aimed to assess the association betwgeen socioeconomic determinants, hypertension and prehypertension using a nationally representative survey of Peruvians. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey (2018), which is a two-staged regional-level representative survey. We used data from 33,336 people aged 15 and older. The dependent variable was blood pressure classification (normal, prehypertension and hypertension) following the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC-7) on hypertension management. Independent variables were socioeconomic: age, sex, marital status, wealth index, health insurance, education, region and area of residence. Due to the nature of the dependent variable (more than two categories), we opted to use the multinomial regression model, adjusting the effect of the multistage sample using the svy command. We tested interactions with the adjusted Wald test. Results The prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension was 33.68% and 19.77%, respectively. Awareness was higher in urban than in rural areas (9.61% vs. 8.31%, p = 0.008). Factors associated with a higher prevalence ratio of both prehypertension and hypertension were age (ratios rose with each age group), male sex (prehypertension aRPR 5.15, 95%CI 4.63–5.73; hypertension aRPR 3.85, 95% CI 3.37–4.40) and abdominal obesity (prehypertension aRPR 2.11, 95%CI 1.92–2.31; hypertension aRPR 3.04, 95% CI 2.69–3.43). Factors with a lower prevalence ratio of both diseases were secondary education (prehypertension aRPR 0.76, 95%CI 0.60–0.95; hypertension aRPR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58–0.97), higher education (prehypertension aRPR 0.78, 95%CI 0.61–0.99; hypertension aRPR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46–0.82), being married/cohabiting (prehypertension aRPR 0.87, 95%CI 0.79–0.95; hypertension aRPR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68–0.87), richest wealth index (only prehypertension aRPR 0.76, 95%CI 0.63–0.92) and living in cities different to Lima (rest of the Coastline, Highlands and Jungle). Having health insurance (only hypertension aRPR 1.26, 95%CI 1.03–1.53) and current drinking (only prehypertension aRPR 1.15, 95%CI 1.01–1.32) became significant factors in rural areas. Conclusions We evidenced socioeconomic disparities among people with hypertension and prehypertension. Better health policies on reducing the burden of risk factors are needed, besides, policy decision makers should focus on hypertension preventive strategies in Peru."
https://openalex.org/W3124195528,"Autonomic neurons innervating uterine horn is probably the only nerve cell population capable of periodical physiological degeneration and regeneration. One of the main sources of innervation of the uterus is paracervical ganglion (PCG). PCG is a unique structure of the autonomic nervous system. It contains components of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The present study examines the response of neurons of PCG innervating uterine horn to axotomy caused by partial hysterectomy in the domestic pig animal model. The study was performed using a neuronal retrograde tracing and double immunofluorescent staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DβH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), neuronal nictric oxide synthase (nNOS), galanin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), somatostatin and substance P (SP). Our study showed that virtually all neurons of the porcine PCG innervating uterine horn are adrenergic and we did not confirm that PCG is the source of cholinergic fibers innervating uterine horn of the pig. After axotomy there was a decrease in expression of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes (TH, DβH) and a strong increase in the galanin expression. The increase of the number of NPY-IR neurons in the ganglia after axotomy was observed. There were no changes in the expression of other studied substances in the PCG neurons innervating the uterine horn, what was often found in rodents studies. This indicates that neurons can respond to damage in a species-specific way."
https://openalex.org/W3125461799,"Recognizing facial expressions of emotions is a fundamental ability for adaptation to the social environment. To date, it remains unclear whether the spatial distribution of eye movements predicts accurate recognition or, on the contrary, confusion in the recognition of facial emotions. In the present study, we asked participants to recognize facial emotions while monitoring their gaze behavior using eye-tracking technology. In Experiment 1a, 40 participants (20 women) performed a classic facial emotion recognition task with a 5-choice procedure (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness). In Experiment 1b, a second group of 40 participants (20 women) was exposed to the same materials and procedure except that they were instructed to say whether (i.e., Yes/No response) the face expressed a specific emotion (e.g., anger), with the five emotion categories tested in distinct blocks. In Experiment 2, two groups of 32 participants performed the same task as in Experiment 1a while exposed to partial facial expressions composed of actions units (AUs) present or absent in some parts of the face (top, middle, or bottom). The coding of the AUs produced by the models showed complex facial configurations for most emotional expressions, with several AUs in common. Eye-tracking data indicated that relevant facial actions were actively gazed at by the decoders during both accurate recognition and errors. False recognition was mainly associated with the additional visual exploration of less relevant facial actions in regions containing ambiguous AUs or AUs relevant to other emotional expressions. Finally, the recognition of facial emotions from partial expressions showed that no single facial actions were necessary to effectively communicate an emotional state. In contrast, the recognition of facial emotions relied on the integration of a complex set of facial cues."

The aim of this study is to assess the dynamic changes of pneumococcal serotype before and after PCV13 administration, with two primary and one booster doses. Methods The prospective cohort study was conducted as a follow up study measuring the impact of PCV13 demonstration program by the Indonesian Ministry of Health in Lombok Island, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, from March 2018 to June 2019. The subjects were two-month-old healthy infants who were brought to the primary care facility for routine vaccination and followed until 18 months of age. We use convenience sampling method. There were 115 infants in the control group and 118 infants in the vaccine group, and the PCV immunization was given on a 2+1 schedule. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected four times during the vaccination periods by trained medical staff. Specimens were analyzed by culture methods to detect S . pneumonia colonization and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) to determine serotype. The most frequently detected serotypes will be named as dominant serotypes. Descriptive analysis of demographic characteristics, the prevalence of overall and serotype colonization, and the distribution of serotypes were performed. The prevalence of both cohort groups were compared using chi-square test. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results Two hundred and thirty three infants age two months old were recruited, with 48.9% of the subjects were male and 51.1% of the subjects were female. Sociodemographic data in both cohort groups were relatively equal. Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization before PCV13 administration occurred in 19.1% of the control and 22.9% of the vaccine group. The prevalence increased with increasing age in both groups. The prevalence of VT serotypes in control groups aged 2 months, 4 months, 12 months, and 18 months was 40.9%, 44.2%, 53.8%, and 54.3%, respectively, and in the vaccine group, 25.9%, 40.4%, 38.0%, and 22.6%, respectively. The most common VT serotypes in both groups were 6A/6B, 19F, 23F, and 14. The prevalence of VT serotypes decreased significantly compared to non-vaccine type serotypes after three doses of the PCV13 vaccine ( p &lt; 0.001). Another notable change was the decline in prevalence of serotype 6A/6B after PCV13 administration using the 2+1 schedule. Conclusions This study shows lower prevalence of VT and 6A/6B serotypes in the nasopharynx among children who were PCV13 vaccinated compared with those who were unvaccinated. The result from this study will be the beginning of future vaccine evaluation in larger population and longer period of study."
https://openalex.org/W3121215208,"The ability and efficiency of targeted nucleases to perform sequence replacements or insertions into the genome are limited. This limited efficiency for sequence replacements or insertions can be explained by the dependency on DNA repair pathways, the possibility of cellular toxicity, and unwanted activation of proto-oncogenes. The piggyBac (PB) transposase uses a very efficient enzymatic mechanism to integrate DNA fragments into the genome in a random manner. In this study, we fused an RNA-guided catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to the PB transposase and used dual sgRNAs to localize this molecule to specific genomic targets. We designed and used a promoter/reporter complementation assay to register and recover cells harboring-specific integrations, where only by complementation upon correct genomic integration, the reporter can be activated. Using an RNA-guided piggyBac transposase and dual sgRNAs, we were able to achieve site-directed integrations in the human ROSA26 safe harbor region in 0.32% of cells. These findings show that the methodology used in this study can be used for targeting genomic regions. An application for this finding could be in cancer cells to insert sequences into specific target regions that are intended to be destroyed, or to place promoter cargos behind the tumor suppressor genes to activate them."
https://openalex.org/W3121698398,"mir-33a and mir-33b are co-transcribed with the SREBF2 and SREBF1 transcription factors, respectively. The main role of SREBF1 is the regulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, while SREBF2 regulates genes participating in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Our objective was to study the expression of both miR-33a and miR-33b, together with their host SREBF genes, in liver, adipose tissue and muscle to better understand the role of miR-33a/b in the lipid metabolism of pigs. In our study, the expression of miR-33a, miR-33b and SREBF2 in liver, adipose tissue, and muscle was studied in 42 BC1_LD (25% Iberian x 75% Landrace backcross) pigs by RT-qPCR. In addition, the expression of in-silico predicted target genes and fatty acid composition traits were correlated with the miR-33a/b expression. We observed different tissue expression patterns for both miRNAs. In adipose tissue and muscle a high correlation between miR-33a and miR-33b expression was found, whereas a lower correlation was observed in liver. The expression analysis of in-silico predicted target-lipid related genes showed negative correlations between miR-33b and CPT1A expression in liver. Conversely, positive correlations between miR-33a and PPARGC1A and USF1 gene expression in liver were observed. Lastly, positive and negative correlations between miR-33a/b expression and saturated fatty acid (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content, respectively, were identified. Overall, our results suggested that both miRNAs are differentially regulated and have distinct functions in liver, in contrast to muscle and adipose tissue. Furthermore, the correlations between miR-33a/b expression both with the expression of in-silico predicted target-lipid related genes and with fatty acid composition, opens new avenues to explore the role of miR33a/b in the regulation of lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3122470207,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of viral hepatitis around the world, especially in developing countries. Recently, HEV has also been recognized as important cause of hepatitis in Europe and Japan, however, there is a paucity of clinical data from the United States. The overall seroprevalence of HEV antibodies is around 10% in the United States, but considerable variation is seen based on geographic location, year, and assay used. In this study, 63 adults and 417 children from New York State were tested for anti-HEV IgG antibodies using the commercially available Wantai IgG assay. The overall seroprevalence of HEV antibodies among adult participants was 9.52% (95% CI: 3.58–19.59%). Positive adults tended to be older than HEV negative adults, all positive adults were female. Only 3 (0.7%, 95% CI:: 0.15–2.09%) of the children were positive, all positive children were male. These results are consistent with global and United States trends in HEV seroprevalence."
https://openalex.org/W3122489463,"The capacity for reflective functioning (RF) or mentalizing of adoptive parents is hypothesized to play an important role in fostering socio-emotional development in adopted children. This paper reports on the development and preliminary validation of the Adoption Expectations Interview (AEI), a semi-structured interview to assess RF in prospective adoptive parents. The AEI was developed based on the Pregnancy Interview, Parent Development Interview, and Working Model of the Child Interview, three interviews that have been used to assess RF in biological parents, to capture RF before child arrival in prospective adoptive parents. In a sample of 96 prospective adoptive parents, the Reflective Functioning Scale, as applied to the AEI (AEI-RFS) showed good reliability, with strong correlations between the different demand items, high internal consistency, and good to excellent inter-rater reliability. A principal component analysis yielded one component, suggesting that the items measured a unidimensional factor. Preliminary evidence for the construct validity of the AEI-RFS was demonstrated by significant associations between the AEI-RFS and well-validated measures of mentalizing, attachment dimensions, and interpersonal functioning."

Our aim was to identify the major food companies manufacturing packaged foods and non-alcoholic beverages available in New Zealand supermarkets in 2018; to assess the healthiness of products using (1) the Health Star Rating (HSR) system, (2) Australian Dietary Guidelines classification (core/discretionary), and (3) by level of processing; to compare the healthiness of products displaying and not displaying the HSR and; to assess potential for food reformulation within selected food sub-categories. Information on packaged foods was obtained from the Nutritrack supermarket database. Companies that manufactured each food and brand were identified using company websites and the New Zealand companies register. In total, 13,506 packaged products were mapped to 1,767 brands and 1,214 companies. Based on market share of products available for sale (Euromonitor data), there were 22 dominating companies producing 31% of products and 17% of brands. Fifty-nine percent of products were classified as unhealthy (HSR &lt;3.5/5 stars), 53% as discretionary, and 69% as ultra-processed. Products displaying the HSR on the package had a higher mean HSR ±SD than if the HSR was not displayed (3.2±1.3 versus 2.5±1.4, p = 0.000). Efforts to improve the healthiness of products should be directed to the 22 food companies dominating this market share, particularly in the core foods groups which are currently less likely to meet Heart Foundation reformulation targets (bread, breakfast cereals, cheese, canned baked beans, yoghurt). The New Zealand supermarket packaged food supply included in the Nutritrack database is dominated by a small number of companies and is mostly unhealthy. Government leadership is required to improve the healthiness of the packaged food supply and provide adequate information to consumers. This includes interventions setting reformulation targets for core food groups, setting population nutrient intake targets and mandating that the HSR is displayed on all products."
https://openalex.org/W3122126650,"Background Acute and agent-specific chronic infections have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, however data on the burden of common recurrent infections on cardiovascular disease is limited. We hypothesized women with greater exposure to uncomplicated common infectious events had an increased risk of subclinical cardiovascular disease (sCVD). Methods In a cross-sectional study, we assessed the relation of recurrent infections and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) in 1946 disease-free women from the Mexican Teachers’ Cohort. Through 2012–2016, participants answered structured questions on respiratory, urinary and vaginal infections during the previous year and their IMT was measured using ultrasound by standardized neurologists. We defined sCVD as mean right and left IMT ≥0.8 mm or the presence of atheromatous plaque. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association of infectious events with IMT and sCVD adjusting for age, sociodemographic, and cardiovascular risk factors. Results Among participants (50±5 years) 13% reported no infections, 20% one infection and 67% three or more episodes. Overall prevalence of sCVD was 12%(n = 240). Adjusted models for logistic regression showed that women with 2 or more infections had 91% higher odds of sCVD (OR 1.91; 95%CI 1.16, 3.13) compared to women without infections (p-trend:0.015). Sub-analyses by type of infection resulted not significant. Linear regression analysis did not show a significant association between mean IMT and recurrent infections. Conclusions Recurrent infectious events in young adult women are associated with greater sCVD, which supports the hypothesis of low-grade chronic inflammation in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3123603885,"Understanding the hip loading environment for daily activities is useful for hip fracture prevention, rehabilitation, and the design of osteogenic exercises. Seventeen older adults (50–70 yrs) and twenty young adults (18–30 yrs) were recruited. A rigid body model combined with a musculoskeletal model was used to estimate lower extremity loading. An elliptical cross-section model of the femoral neck was used to estimate femoral neck stress during stair ascent and descent. Two peaks were identified in the stress curves, corresponding to the peaks in the vertical ground reaction force. During stair ascent, significantly higher tension on the superior femoral neck was found for the young group at peak 1 (young: 13.5±6.1 MPa, older: 4.2±6.5 MPa, p&lt;0.001). Also during stair ascent, significantly higher compression on the posterior femoral neck was found for the older group at peak 2 (young: -11.4±4.9 MPa, old: -18.1±8.6 MPa, p = 0.006). No significant difference was found for stair descent. Components of stress (muscle vs. reaction forces; axial forces vs. bending moments) were also examined for each trial of stair ascent and descent. The stresses and their components provided loading magnitude and locations of higher stress on the femoral neck during stair ascent and descent. Understanding femoral neck stresses may be used to help prevent hip fractures, reduce pain, improve rehabilitation, and design osteogenic exercises."
