Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which are expressed in the cells of the atherosclerosic lesion. PPARα ligands have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory activities in different cell types by antagonizing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. In the present study, the influence of PPARα activators on the NF-κB signaling pathway was investigated. Our results show that fibrates, synthetic PPARα activators, induced the expression of the inhibitory protein IκBα in human aortic smooth muscle cells as well as in primary human hepatocytes, whereas neither IκB-kinase activity nor the degradation rate of IκBα were affected. Using PPARα-null mice, we demonstrated that fibrates induced IκBα in liver in vivo and that this action required PPARα. Furthermore, fibrate treatment induced IκBα protein expression in the cytoplasm and also enhanced IL-1β-induced accumulation of IκBα protein in the nucleus. These actions of fibrates on IκBα expression were accompanied by a decrease in NF-κB DNA binding activity as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Taken together, these data provide an additional molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory activity of PPARα agonists and reinforce their potential use in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

This NF-κB/Rel family consists of five members, c-Rel, p65, Rel B, p50, and p52, which form heterodimeric complexes that are most frequently composed of p50 and p65 proteins. In most non-activated cells, NF-κB remains in a cytoplasmic inactive complex through its association with the inhibitory proteins IκBs (3Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Inducers of NF-κB, which include inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and viral products, activate a dimeric IκB kinase (IKK)1 complex (4Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A.

NF-κB has been suggested to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (7Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19076) Google Scholar). NF-κB was reported to be essential for the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) (8Bellas R.E. Lee J.S. Sonenshein G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2521-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and activated NF-κB heterodimers are detected in human atherosclerotic lesions (9Brand K. Page S. Rogler G. Bartsch A.

PPARs regulate gene expression by binding with the retinoid receptor RXR as a heterodimeric partner to specific DNA sequence elements termed PPAR response elements (PPRE) (20Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating gene transcription via PPREs, PPARs have recently been shown to modulate gene transcription also by negatively interfering with other transcription factor pathways in a DNA binding-independent manner (18Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar,21Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Among the three different PPARs, PPARα activation has been shown to repress cytokine-induced activation of a number of inflammatory genes such as VCAM-1, COX-2, and IL-6by negatively interfering with NF-κB transcriptional activity (14Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda-Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar,22Marx N. Sukhova G.K. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3125-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar).However, the influence of PPARα activators on the different components of the NF-κB signaling cascade have not yet been explored. In the present study, we show that fibrates, synthetic PPARα ligands, induce IκBα expression in a PPARα-dependent manner. By contrast, PPARα agonists do not influence IκBα degradation nor IKK activity. This induction results in an inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding leading to a sharp reduction of the p65-mediated gene activation. These actions may contribute to the anti-inflammatory activities of PPARα ligands.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRecently, it was demonstrated that PPARα activators inhibit IL-1β-induced IL-6 secretion by human aortic SMC (HASMC) in a dose-dependent manner (14Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda-Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARα activators negatively regulate IL-1β-induced-IL-6 production at the gene expression level by inhibiting NF-κB transcriptional activity (21Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is controlled by a cytokine-activated protein kinase complex, which phosphorylates IκBα, triggering its polyubiquitination (5DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Because PPARα agonists negatively interfere with IL-1β-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in HASMC, we investigated whether PPARα activators influence IL-1β-induced IKK activity in these cells. IKK activity was very low in non-stimulated HASMC treated with or without the PPARα ligand Wy-14643 (Fig.1 A). Treatment with IL-1β for 10 min resulted in a strong induction of IKK activity. This induction was not affected by preincubation with the PPARα activator Wy-14643 for 2 h, the time period previously reported to inhibit IL-1β-induced COX-2 gene expression (14Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda-Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). This result indicates that PPARα activators do not regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity by modulating IKK function. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of Wy-14643 on IL-1β-induced-IκBα degradation. Western blot analysis showed that IκBα protein was degraded within 30 min after IL-1β stimulation, followed by reappearance of the protein at 1 h as previously reported (28Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Fibrate treatment did not affect IκBα protein degradation, consistent with the absence of any effect on IKK. Taken together, these data indicate that fibrates do not impair NF-κB transcriptional activation by modulating IKK activity or IκBα degradation.Next, it was investigated whether PPARα agonists influence IκBα expression. Incubation of HASMC with IL-1β resulted in the induction of both IL-6 and IκBα mRNA (Fig.2 A), which is consistent with the previous demonstration that NF-κB controls the expression of IκBα by an inducible autoregulatory loop (28Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Wy-14643 alone induced IκBα mRNA (Fig. 2 A), and this effect was further enhanced by IL-1β suggesting that PPARα and IL-1β regulate IκBα gene expression by different mechanisms. By contrast, Wy-14643 treatment inhibited the induction of IL-6 mRNA levels by IL-1β as described previously (21Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Similarly, when incubations were done with fenofibric acid, another PPARα ligand, IκBα mRNA was significantly induced (Fig.1 B). This induction occurred rapidly with a maximum reached after 1 h. IκBα mRNA levels declined thereafter but remained elevated to increase again at 24 h (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, Wy-14643 increased IκBα mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). Results from actinomycin D transcription inhibition experiments demonstrated that fibrates induce IκBα expression at the transcriptional level (data not shown). In HASMC, Wy-14643 also increased IκBα protein with a maximum of induction reached after 24 h of treatment (2.25 ± 0.19-fold; p < 0.05), demonstrating that the induction of IκBα gene expression results in increased protein levels (Fig. 2 D).Figure 2PPAR α activators induce IκBα mRNA and protein levels in human aortic SMC. A, human aortic SMC (80% confluence) were incubated for 2 h in standard medium with Wy-14643 (250 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) and were subsequently stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 3 h. IL-6, IκBα, and 36B4 mRNA were measured by Northern blot analysis. B, SMC were cultured in standard medium with fenofibric acid (100 μm) for different times as indicated. RNA (10 μg) was extracted, separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and analyzed by hybridization to IκBα and 36B4 cDNA probes. C,SMC were cultured in standard medium with increasing concentrations of Wy-14643 for 1 h. RNA (10 μg) was extracted, separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and analyzed by hybridization to IκBα and 36B4 cDNA probes. D,human aortic SMC were cultured in standard medium with Wy-14643 (100 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) for different lengths of time (h). Protein extracts were prepared, and 30 μg of each extract were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond membrane, and probed with antibodies to IκBα and β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether this induction of IκBαexpression by fibrates occurs in other PPARα- expressing cell types, IκBα regulation was next studied in the liver, where PPARα is highly expressed (29Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Griffin K.J. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 30Gervois P. Pineda Torra I. Chinetti G. Grötzinger T. Dubois G. Fruchart J.-C. Fruchart-Najib J. Leitersdorf E. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1535-1549PubMed Google Scholar). In line with previous studies (31Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), human primary hepatocytes express IκBα mRNA under basal conditions (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, treatment with Wy-14643 increased IκBα mRNA (approximately 3-fold)(Fig. 3 A), indicating that PPARα ligands regulate IκBα expression also in human primary hepatocytes. Western blot analysis confirmed that Wy-14643 treatment led to IκBα protein induction in human primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3 C). To determine whether IκBα mRNA induction by fibrates in liver is mediated by PPARα, further studies were performed in PPARα-null mice (32Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). In livers of PPARα wild-type mice, treatment with the PPARα agonist ciprofibrate resulted in a significant increase (>4-fold) of IκBα mRNA, whereas in PPARα−null mice no induction was observed (Fig. 3 B). This result indicates that fibrates regulate IκBα in liver in a PPARα-dependent manner. Because the liver constitutes a major organ implicated in the synthesis of numerous acute phase proteins such as cytokines and hemostatic factors, whose transcription is under the control of NF-κB transcription factors (33Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar), we next studied NF-κB target gene regulation by fibrates in human primary hepatocytes. Primary human hepatocytes express basal COX-2 protein levels, which were modestly induced by IL-1β (Fig. 3 D). Fibrate treatment dose-dependently inhibited COX-2 expression similarly as described previously in human aortic SMC (14Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda-Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), suggesting a similar role for PPARα in the control of the hepatic inflammatory response.Figure 3Fibrates induce IκBα mRNA and protein expression in human primary hepatocytes and in livers of PPAR α +/+ but not of PPAR α −/− mice. A, human primary hepatocytes were cultured with standard medium supplemented with Wy-14643 (50 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) for 24 h. RNA (10 μg) was extracted, separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and analyzed by hybridization to IκBα and 36B4 cDNA probes. B, male PPARα −/− and +/+ mice (n = 3/group) were fed with rodent chow or rodent chow supplemented with 0.05% ciprofibrate for 2 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, livers were isolated and total RNA was extracted. RNA (10 μg) was separated on 1% agarose, transferred to a nylon membrane, and analyzed by hybridization to IκBα and 36B4 cDNA probes. Statistical analysis was assessed by analysis of variance (p < 0.05). Statistical significant differences between groups were then evaluated by the Student's t test.C, human primary hepatocytes were cultured with standard medium supplemented with Wy-14643 (50 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) for 24 h. Protein extracts were prepared and 50 μg of each extract were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond membrane, and probed with antibodies to IκBα and β-actin. D, human primary hepatocytes were cultured with standard medium supplemented with Wy-14643 (50 μm or 100 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) for 24 h and subsequently stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 16 h. Protein extracts were then prepared, and 50 μg of each extract were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond membrane, and probed with antibodies to COX-2 (a kind gift from Dr Habib, Paris, France) and β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After IκBα degradation, p50/p65 dimers translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription. To explore the functional consequences of IκBα up-regulation, EMSAs, using a NF-κB consensus site probe, were performed. Extracts from non-activated SMC contained a basal NF-κB binding activity, which was inhibited by fibrate treatment (Fig. 4 A). The presence of NF-κB proteins in the complex was verified by shifting the complex using an anti-p65 antibody (data not shown). Treatment with IL-1β resulted in a drastic increase of NF-κB binding, which was reduced by Wy-14643 treatment for 2 h and completely abolished after 24-h fibrate pretreatment, whereas binding of OCT1 proteins to their respective consensus site was unaffected (Fig. 4 A). As a control, Western blot analysis demonstrated that PPARα activators do not affect either p50 or p65 protein levels (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Poynter and Daynes (35Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and Marx et al.(22Marx N. Sukhova G.K. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3125-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) showed that PPARα activators significantly reduced NF-κB DNA binding activities in aged murine splenocytes and in TNFα-stimulated endothelial cells, respectively. Therefore, our data are in line with the findings of these studies and suggest that the inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activities depends on the time of PPARα agonist exposure.Figure 4Wy-14643 reduces IL-1β-induced NF-κB DNA binding activities in cultured HASMC and increases nuclear IκBα protein. A, human aortic SMC were cultured for 2 or 24 h with Wy-14643 (100 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) and were subsequently treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. Nuclear proteins were extracted and 5 μg of each sample were subjected to EMSAs using NF-κB consensus site or consensus OCT1 site radiolabeled probes (Promega). Complexes were visualized by autoradiography. B, SMC were cultured in standard medium with fenofibric acid (100 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) for 24 h and subsequently treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for different time intervals (min). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared and proteins (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a Hybond membrane, and probed with antibodies to p65. C and D, SMC were cultured in standard medium with Wy-14643 (100 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) for 24 h and were subsequently treated with or without IL-1β for 1 h. Nuclear (C) and cytoplasmic protein extracts (D) were prepared and proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a Hybond membrane, and probed with antibodies to IκBα, histone H1, and β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In resting cells, IκBα sequesters p50/p65 heterodimers in a cytoplasmic inactive complex. To determine whether IκBα induction modulates NF-κB protein translocation, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from cultured SMC were isolated. IL-1β induced a rapid but transient p65 translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, fenofibric acid treatment did not inhibit IL-1β-induced p65 translocation suggesting that IκBα up-regulation by fibrates does not result in an increased sequestration of NF-κB in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 B). This result constitutes a major difference between fibrates and glucocorticoids, which were reported to induce IκBα in T cells and to block p65 translocation (36Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 37Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Because newly synthesized IκBα protein accumulates not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus reducing thereby NF-κB binding (38Zabel U. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar,39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IκBα protein localization was analyzed in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from human aortic SMC after fibrate treatment by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-IκBα antibody. As a control, fibrate treatment resulted in an increase of the IκBα cytoplasmic content (Fig. 4 D), which is consistent with our findings in Fig. 2 D. Surprisingly, in non-stimulated cells, IκBα protein was also present in the nucleus but its levels were not affected by fibrate treatment (Fig. 4 C). IL-1β treatment for 1 h did not result in an increased nuclear content of IκBα. This finding is in line with a previous study demonstrating that newly synthesized IκBα protein is only detectable in the nucleus after 2 h of IL-1β or TNFα exposure in HeLa S3 cells (39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, fibrate treatment in the presence of IL-1β for 1 h led to an increase of nuclear IκBα protein content (Fig. 4 C), which occurs concomitantly with the loss of NF-κB DNA binding activity observed in IL-1β treated cells (Fig.4 A).Several concurring mechanisms may explain the overall anti-inflammatory activities of PPARα ligands. First, PPARs have been shown to down-regulate inflammatory response genes by negatively interfering with the STAT, AP-1, and NF-κB transcriptional pathways (14Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R.

Direct protein-protein interactions between PPARα and AP-1 and NF-κB proteins have been invoked as mechanisms of transrepression (21Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M.

Second, by regulating anti-oxidant enzyme activities such as catalase (41Klucis E. Crane D. Masters C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 65: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), PPARα activators reduce the oxidative stress, and, as such, may inhibit NF-κB activation. Finally, the results of the present study provide an additional mechanism through which PPARα activators may antagonize NF-κB activation (Fig.5). Induction of IκBα mRNA by fibrates may contribute to the inhibition of inflammatory gene activation such as COX-2 or IL-6. The induction of IκBα by fibrates in cytokine-activated cells should result in an acceleration of NF-κB nuclear desactivation. This is consistent with a previous report in which PPARα ligands were shown to affect the duration of the inflammatory response in a PPARα-dependent manner (42Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vasquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the increase of IκBα protein after treatment with PPARα activators would lead to a halt in p65-mediated gene activation thereby reducing the duration of the inflammatory response.Figure 5Model of NF-κB signaling pathway inhibition by PPAR α activators.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The IκBα promoter contains several regulatory regions among which are sites for NF-κB (43Le Bail O.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The results using the PPARα-deficient mice indicate that IκBα activation by fibrates occurs in a PPARα-dependent manner. Our EMSA experiments indicate that PPARα activators do not activate IκBα transcription in a NF-κB-dependent manner because basal NF-κB binding activity present in SMC was not increased by Wy-14643 but was conversely lowered. Furthermore, IκBα mRNA appeared to be synergistically induced by fibrates in the presence of IL-1β (Fig.2 A) suggesting that PPARα activators regulateIκBα gene expression via a distinct signaling pathway. In addition, PPARα was reported to play a major role in the control of the cellular redox status (35Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol.

We demonstrated the association of Trp4 and phospholipase C-β1 with NHERF in vivo in an HEK293 cell line expressing Trp4 and in adult mouse brain by immuno-coprecipitation. NHERF is a two PDZ domain-containing protein that associates with the actin cytoskeleton via interactions with members of ezrin/radixin/moesin family. Thus, store-operated channels involving Trp4 and Trp5 can form signaling complexes with phospholipase C isozymes via interactions with NHERF and thereby linking the lipase and the channels to the actin cytoskeleton.

In many cells, stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC)1 by cell surface receptors is accompanied by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. This occurs via Ca2+release from internal stores and Ca2+ influx from extracellular space (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). While the mechanism of Ca2+release from the endoplasmic reticulum is well understood, the channel(s) and mechanism(s) that mediate Ca2+ influx remain to be elucidated. It is currently believed that most, if not all, Ca2+ influx is mediated through a set of plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels that open in response to internal Ca2+ store depletion (3Fasolato C.

Molecular cloning and functional expression have revealed that the products of the Drosophila transient receptor potential (trp) gene as well as a number of its mammalian homologues form SOCs (5Vaca L.

However, in all cases, the Trp-formed channels are activated by signaling events downstream from receptor activation and PLC stimulation. Moreover, a store depletion-insensitive Trp subunit may heteromultimerize with a store depletion-sensitive Trp to form a SOC (17Gillo B. Chorna I. Cohen H. Cook B. Manistersky I. Chorev M. Arnon A.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, store-operated Ca2+ influx is most likely mediated by channels formed by Trp proteins. In Drosophila eyes, Trp is organized in a supramolecular complex along with other phototransduction proteins, such as PLC and protein kinase C, through association with a multi-PDZ domain-containing protein, INAD (inactivation no after potential D) (19Tsunoda S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2285-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PDZ domains were first identified as 80–100 amino acid repeated sequences in the neuron-specific post-synaptic density protein (PSD-95/SAP-90), the Drosophila septate junction protein disc-large (dlg) and the epithelial tight-junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO1) (22Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Growing evidence suggests that these domains are important protein-protein interaction sites for clustering and organization of signaling molecules, particularly those involved in ion transport (22Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Pawson T. Scott J.D.

INAD contains five PDZ domains, each of which interacts with a particular target protein and thus serves as a scaffold to bring PLC, Trp, protein kinase C, and G protein together in a signaling complex. Although INAD is not directly involved in transmitting the signal of light perception, it plays a critical role in localizing PLC and Trp at the proper sites of the rhabdomere ofDrosophila photoreceptors (19Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 20Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Since PLC-mediated signaling in mammals is very similar to phototransduction cascade of insects, an INAD-like scaffold may exist in mammalian cells. Although several multi-PDZ domain-containing proteins distantly related to INAD have been cloned from human and rodents (25Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H.

Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), none has been shown to interact with mammalian Trp or PLC. The interaction between a target protein and a specific PDZ domain is often determined by the last three C-terminal residues of the target (28Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal sequences of mammalian Trps are very different from their Drosophila counterpart and also very diverse among themselves (Fig. 1 a), each Trp may bind to different PDZ domains and the PDZ domains that bind to the mammalian Trps may be quite different from that of INAD. Here we show that murine Trp4 (mTrp4) and Trp5 bind to the first PDZ domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF). We additionally show that the same PDZ domain binds to the C termini of PLC-β1 and PLC-β2, indicating that NHERF is capable of bringing together the signaling molecules involved in the PLC-mediated pathway in mammalian cells and therefore, may play a role similar to that of INAD in insect phototransduction. We demonstrate the physical association of PLC-β1, Trp4, and NHERF in an HEK293 cell line stably expressing mTrp4 and in adult mouse brain by immuno-coprecipitation experiments.

Another rabbit polyclonal anti-Trp4 antibody, T4nAb, was raised against the synthetic Trp4 N-terminal peptide, CYYKRNVNAPYRDR (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies for PLC-β1 (G-12) and His-tag (H-15) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibody 12CA5 for hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was from Babco (Berkeley, CA). Full-length cDNAs for murine Trp4 and Trp5 was obtained from a mouse brain cDNA library for rapid amplification of complimentary ends by polymerase chain reaction made according to the protocol provided by the Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH). Rapid amplification of complimentary ends by polymerase chain reaction primers were designed and the reactions were carried out following the previous description (7Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52244) Google Scholar). The sequences for murine Trp4α, Trp4β, and Trp5 have been deposited in GenBank data base with accession numbers AF011543, AF019663, and AF060107, respectively. For in vitro synthesis of35S-labeled proteins, the cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pAGA (32Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9570-9579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a T7 promoter that allows transcription initiation by T7 RNA polymerase. An ATG codon contained within an NcoI site serves as a translation initiation site. The C-terminal constructs for Trp4α and Trp5 were made by subcloningHindIII/EcoRI fragments encoding the corresponding sequences into pAGA at the NcoI site via blunt-end ligation after each fragment had been filled-in by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of dNTP. cDNAs for bovine PLC-β1 and PLC-β2 were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Gierschik. Their C-terminal constructs were made by subcloning aPvuII/BamHI fragment of PLCβ1 or aPvuII/XbaI fragment of PLCβ2 into pAGA at theNcoI site via blunt-end ligation. HA-tagged trp4 constructs contain the coding nucleotide sequence for the HA epitope, “YPYDVPDY,” immediately after the coding sequence for the C-terminal end of Trp4 “VTTRL.” A stop codon was added after the codon for the last “Y” of the HA-epitope. For expression in HEK293 cells, the cDNA for the full-length mTrp4α or the C-terminal HA-tagged mTrp4α was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Constructs for preparing glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins for PDZ1 and PDZ2 of NHERF were as described (28Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL-21 cells after transformation with corresponding plasmids. Synthesis of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside to log-phase cultures (A 600 ≈0.6) at 37 °C. After 3–5 h of incubation with constant shaking, the bacteria were recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min and either used immediately or stored at −20 °C. GST and GST fusion proteins were purified, using glutathione-Sepharose 4B, from bacterial lysates prepared by incubating with 20 mm lysozyme and 1% Sarcosyl and sonication. The glutathione beads with the bound proteins were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL) and then resuspended in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Lubrol. 35S-Labeled Trp4, Trp5, or the C-terminal portions of Trp4, Trp5, PLC-β1, and PLC-β2 were made in vitrousing the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system. GST protein (2 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose and 10 μl of 35S-labeled protein were added to 250 μl of the binding buffer and were incubated on a platform shaker at room temperature for 30 min. The bound proteins were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 2 min and washed three times with the binding buffer. After the last wash, 10 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer (1 time = 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) was added to the pellet and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Aliquots (10 μl) of each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray films overnight. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, 2.8 × 106cells were cultured in a 10-cm tissue culture dish for 20 h and 5 μg of mtrp4α/pcDNA3 or mtrp4α-HAc/pcDNA3 was transfected into the cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (34Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were harvested, suspended in the same medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418, and transferred to wells of 96-well plates in three serial dilutions of 1:4. G418-resistant transformants that appeared to arise from single colonies were transferred to 12-well plates for growth and further analysis. Clonal cell lines expressing Trp4α or C-terminal HA-tagged Trp4α were identified by immunocytochemistry and confirmed by immunoprecipitation as detailed before (34Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) using an affinity purified polyclonal anti-Trp4 N-terminal antibody, T4nAb. The stable cell lines were diluted twice weekly and maintained in medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. HEK293 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate-buffered saline: 136 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), scraped off from the dishes in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamide, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μmleupeptin, 1 μm soybean protease inhibitor), and pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 2 min. Cells were sonicated in RIPA buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitors listed above. Mouse brain samples were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer in 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors followed by sonication. All procedures for immunoprecipitation were carried out at 4 °C. The crude lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. Nonspecific bindings were removed by a preincubation with 1/10 volume of protein-A Sepharose for 1 h followed by a low speed centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was then incubated with appropriate dilutions of the desired antibody for 10–16 h. The dilutions for the antibodies were 1:200 for anti-Trp4, 1:100 for anti-NHERF and anti-PLCβ1. Immunocomplexes were purified by incubation with 1/10 volume of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h, centrifuged, and washed three times in RIPA buffer. Bound immunocomplexes were eluted by incubating the Sepharose beads in 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged briefly at 14,000 rpm and a 10-μl aliquot of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Semi-dry Transfer Blotter (W. E. P. Co., Concord, CA) at 120 mA for 2 h and immunoblotted with antibodies as indicated. For immunoblotting, dilutions of antibodies were 1:2,000 for anti-Trp4, 1:1,000 for anti-NHERF and anti-PLC-β1. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody and all blots were developed using the ECL system. Among the seven mammalian Trp homologues currently known, Trp4 and Trp5 are the most closely related. The first 754 residues of mTrp4, encompassing the N terminus, the transmembrane regions, and the first 133 residues of the C terminus, share 73% identity (82% similarity) with the equivalent regions of mTrp5 (761 residues). However, the last 220 residues of Trp4 are divergent from the last 214 residues of Trp5 with an identity score of 20% and a similarity score of 38%. Strikingly, both proteins end with the same C-terminal sequence, VTTRL (Fig. 1 a). Since the ligand specificities of PDZ domains are often defined by the last few residues of target proteins, this sequence conservation suggests that Trp4 and Trp5 might interact with a common PDZ domain. Random peptide library screening has revealed that peptides terminating with the amino acid sequence “TRL” bound with high affinity to the first PDZ domain of NHERF (28Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Trp4 and Trp5 interact with NHERF in GST pull-down experiments. Fig. 1 bshows that the GST fusion protein containing PDZ1 of NHERF interacted with 35S-labeled full-length mTrp4 and mTrp5. PDZ2 of NHERF interacted with Trp4 and Trp5 only very weakly. In agreement with the notion that the C-terminal sequences of the target proteins are responsible for the interaction with PDZ domains, NHERF PDZ1 also interacted with the C-terminal portions of Trp4 or Trp5 (Fig.1 c). In contrast, human Trp3 terminates with “MLRCE” and did not interact with NHERF PDZ1 (Fig. 1 d). Molecular cloning has revealed the existence of at least two forms of mTrp4: a longer form (Trp4α) that contains 974 amino acids and a shorter form (Trp4β) that contains 890 amino acids and lacks residues 781–864 corresponding to Trp4α. Because the C-terminal ends remain the same, both Trp4α and Trp4β interact with PDZ1 of NHERF (Fig.1 e). However, when the C terminus was masked by the addition of an HA epitope, neither Trp4 isoform interacted with NHERF (Fig.1 e). These data indicate that the presence of TRL motif at the C-terminal end is essential for the interaction between Trp4 and NHERF PDZ1. While the VTTRL sequence is found at the C-terminal end of bovine, human, and murine Trp4, it has been reported that rat Trp4 terminates with “HKIMI” (GenBankTM accession numberAB008889). In order to confirm this, we isolated total RNA from the brain of an adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat and performed rapid amplification of complimentary ends by polymerase chain reaction using primers that would anneal to both mouse and rat trp4. Products corresponding to trp4α and trp4βwere obtained and sequenced. Despite the 99.4% identity with the published rat trp4 (AB008889) at the nucleotide level, our polymerase chain reaction products predict proteins with VTTRL at the C termini (GenBankTM accession numbers: AF288407 andAF288408). Therefore, the VTTRL sequence and hence the association with NHERF is conserved among Trp4 orthologues in mammalian species. Bovine PLCβ1 and PLCβ2 terminate with “TPL” and “SRL,” respectively (Fig. 2 a). Results of the random peptide library screening (28Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) indicated that these sequences might also interact with PDZ1 of NHERF. Therefore, we tested the binding of PLC-β1 and PLC-β2 with the two PDZ domains of NHERF. As shown in Fig. 2 b, 35S-labeled C-terminal fragments of PLC-β1 and PLC-β2 bound to GST fusion protein containing PDZ1 but only very weakly to that containing PDZ2 of NHERF. Thus, the first PDZ domain of NHERF is capable of interacting with PLC-β1, PLC-β2, Trp4, and Trp5, suggesting that NHERF may serve as a scaffold for the clustering of PLC signaling molecules in mammalian cells. In order to test whether Trp4 associates with NHERF in vivo, we expressed mTrp4α in HEK293 cells and established a stable cell line, T4-60. In immunoblotting, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (T4cAb) raised against a peptide representing the last 13 amino acids of Trp4 (30Philipp S. Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schroth G.

The expression of endogenous NHERF in HEK293 cells was detected in total cell lysates using an anti-NHERF specific antibody, IC270 (Fig. 3 b). Moreover, the association of Trp4 with NHERF was examined by first immunoprecipitating cell extracts using IC270 followed by the separation of precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the anti-Trp4, T4cAb. Trp4 was detected in the precipitates obtained from T4-60 but not untransfected cells (Fig. 3 c). No Trp4 signal was found in the blot made from immunoprecipitation of T4-60 cell lysate using a nonspecific antibody, anti-HA 12CA5 (not shown). In addition, an anti-Trp4 N-terminal antibody (T4nAb) also detected Trp4α in the anti-NHERF immunoprecipitates from the T4-60 cells but not from cells expressing Trp3 or the C-terminal-tagged Trp4α (Fig. 3 c). The expression of the HA-tagged Trp4α in this cell line was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with T4nAb followed by immunoblotting with the anti-HA antibody. These data demonstrated that Trp4 interacts with NHERF in vivo and that the presence of TRL at the C-terminal end of Trp4 is essential for this interaction. Endogenous PLC-β1 can be detected in HEK293 cells using a polyclonal anti-PLC-β1 antibody (Fig.4 a). Immunoblotting with the antibody revealed the presence of PLC-β1 in immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-NHERF antibody (Fig. 4 b) and thereby demonstrating that endogenous PLC-β1 and NHERF associate with each other in vivo in HEK293 cells. Moreover, in T4-60 cells, PLC-β1 coprecipitated with Trp4 in immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-Trp4 antibody (Fig. 4 b). Interestingly, the amount of PLC-β1 coprecipitated by the anti-Trp4 antibody was similar to that precipitated by the anti-NHERF antibody (Fig. 4 b). Assuming that the two antibodies had the same efficiency for the precipitation of the NHERF·Trp4 complex, this result indicates that most likely, PLC-β1 is part of the same complex that contains Trp4 and NHERF. Thus, the three proteins appear to coassemble in HEK cells expressing Trp4. In order to determine whether the three proteins also coassemble in animal tissues that normally express them, we performed immuno-coprecipitation experiments using adult mouse brain. Significant amounts of PLC-β1 and NHERF were detected in mouse brain by immunoblotting using the respective specific antibodies (Fig.5 a, left andmiddle). The expression of Trp4 in adult mouse brain was difficult to detect by immunoblotting alone using the anti-Trp4, T4cAb. However, two bands, 110 and 100 kDa, presumably representing the α and β isoforms of Trp4, were detected by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting using the same antibody (Fig. 5 a, right). Immuno-coprecipitation experiments showed that the anti-NHERF antibody also precipitated the two isoforms of Trp4 from the brain lysate (Fig. 5 b) and that a similar amount of PLC-β1 was precipitated by the anti-NHERF, IC270, and the anti-Trp4, T4cAb (Fig. 5 c). An unrelated rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-His tag, did not precipitate Trp4 or PLC-β1. Thus, PLC-β1, Trp4, and NHERF coexist as a molecular complex in adult mouse brain. Our data suggest that NHERF is a molecular scaffold that brings PLC isozymes and Trp4 or Trp5 into a signaling complex. Similar function is known to be carried out by INAD in theDrosophila phototransduction system (19Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S.

The MMR system functions through the interactions between several proteins, such as hMSH2, hMSH3, hMSH6, hMLH1, hPMS2, and recently discovered hMLH3 (1.Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin.

Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 6.Drummond J.T.

In addition, hMSH2 can dimerize with hMSH3 creating the hMutS-β complex, which binds larger DNA insertion/deletion mispaired loops (5.Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S.

Subsequently, activated hMutS-α or hMutS-β interacts with hMutL-α (a heterodimer of hMLH1 with hPMS2) to direct DNA repair (9.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Recent studies suggest that maintaining an appropriate balance of the components of the human MMR system is critical for its proper repair function. In hMSH6-defective HCT15 cells, hMSH3 protein is highly expressed, whereas in hMSH2-defective LoVo cells, hMSH3 and hMSH6 proteins are not detected (11.Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The suggested cause for the absence of the hMSH3 and hMSH6 proteins is that they are relatively unstable without forming a heterodimer complex with hMSH2 (11.Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T.

When hMSH3 was overexpressed by methotrexate-induced simultaneous amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase andhMSH3 genes in CHOR and HL60R cells, the relative amount of hMSH6 protein decreased (12.Drummond J.T.

Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8568-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In all likelihood, this decrease was caused by excess hMSH3 protein competing with hMSH6 for dimerization with the common partner protein, hMSH2 (12.Drummond J.T. Genschel J. Wolf E. Modrich P. Proc.

Immunohistochemical studies show that the hMSH2 protein is readily detected in the proliferating portion of esophageal and intestinal epithelium (14.Leach F.S. Polyak K. Burrell M. Johnson K.A.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2189-2196PubMed Google Scholar) and increases at least 12-fold in proliferating cells (16.Marra G. Chang C.L. Laghi L.A. Chauhan D.P. Young D. Boland C.R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2189-2196PubMed Google Scholar). Since the major role of the MMR system occurs during the immediate postreplicative stage, it seems plausible that the MMR system may be up-regulated in highly replicating cells.Although a stable relationship among the components of the MMR system is important in maintaining their function as a complex, the exact quantitative profile of each MMR component is not yet known. Limited information as to the genetic regulation of the MMR system is available. Recently, some quantitative approaches have been attempted to demonstrate that functional defects of the MMR system may result in microsatellite instability and carcinogenesis (17.Wei Q. Eicher S.A. Guan Y. Cheng L. Xu J. Young L.N. Saunders K.C. Jiang H. Hong W.K. Spitz M.R. Strom S.S. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1998; 7: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Wei Q. Bondy M.L. Mao L. Gaun Y. Cheng L. Cunningham J. Fan Y. Bruner J.M. Yung W.K. Levin V.A. Kyritsis A.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1673-1677PubMed Google Scholar).We have developed a new method, competitive quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (CQ-RT-PCR) for measuring the exact amount of each MMR mRNA. We then compared the amount of each mRNA to the expression of the corresponding protein. We successfully determined the exact amount of each MMR component in the balanced steady state for both mRNAs and proteins in MMR-proficient cell lines. Moreover, the quantitative changes in abnormal MMR-defective cell lines were studied at both the mRNA and protein level. We also found that all human MMR mRNA and proteins measured were up-regulated in highly proliferating SV40-transformed cell lines in comparison with their normal counterpart.DISCUSSIONThe DNA MMR system has been extensively studied in prokaryotes and yeast, but the human system is more complex and less well understood. The stoichiometry and quantitative interaction among the components of human DNA MMR are assumed to be similar to that in lower organisms (1.Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). However, these issues have not been directly studied for all of the components of the system. Quantification of mRNA levels is necessary to evaluate the regulation of MMR gene expression. Northern blot hybridization, a conventional method for quantifying mRNA levels, is of limited value when sample sizes are small and the message is minimally expressed. We used multiplex RT-PCR to measure the relative amounts of mRNA for multiple individual genes between different samples. However, this technique is not sufficiently accurate to measure absolute transcript numbers. We developed a novel technique, CQ-RT-PCR using an internal RNA standard to measure the steady-state relationships among the components of the MMR system within individual cell lines. Furthermore, we used purified proteins as standards to measure absolute amounts of MMR proteins in individual cell lines.In six different DNA MMR-proficient human cell lines, we performed RT-PCR to determine relative mRNA levels for each cell. We were able to measure absolute amounts of DNA MMR mRNA by CQ-RT-PCR for five of these genes; we also determined the steady-state expression of the same five proteins. In DNA MMR-proficient cell lines, the relationship between mRNA and protein for each MMR gene was linear, suggesting that the level of each protein was primarily determined by transcription, with similar kinetic characteristics for each of the components of this system.In DNA MMR-proficient cell lines, the hMutS components were expressed substantially more abundantly than the hMutL components. The hMSH2 protein is an essential component of the human MMR system and is expressed 3–5 times more abundantly than hMLH1. hMSH2 must heterodimerize with either hMSH3 or hMSH6 for mismatched DNA to be recognized (5.Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), and presumably a complex between mismatched DNA and hMutS proteins transduces a signal through the hMutL system to initiate DNA repair by ADP-ATP exchange (10.Fishel R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The precise role of the hMutL complexes is not yet completely understood. In E. coli, MutL is thought to accelerate an ATP-dependent translocation of the MutS-MutL complex to a hemimethylated GATC Dam site bound by MutH to achieve strand-specific repair (3.Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24727-24730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recent data have suggested that the hMSH2-hMSH6 heteroduplex may function as a molecular switch. Fishel (10.Fishel R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) proposed that hMutL complexes may act as an adenine nucleotide regulator for hMutS complexes in a signal transduction series. A partial crystal structure of the N-terminal fragment fromEscherichia coli suggests that MutL is homologous to the ATPase-containing DNA gyrase, which binds to DNA directly as does MutS (26.Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 27.Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the hMLH1-hPMS2 heterodimer interacts with hMSH2, requiring mispaired DNA and ATP (28.Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In every model of DNA MMR, the MutS components serve to recognize mispaired DNA, and MutL components function downstream to complete repair. The stoichiometric interaction of MutS and MutL is less clear. Since MutL proteins are unnecessary as long as mispaired nucleotides are not recognized, the initial complex may serve to initiate a repair cascade through a smaller number of MutL proteins.Understanding the steady-state relationships among the components of the DNA MMR system, in addition to informing their functional roles in repair, may provide insights into hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) as well. Among the most important causes of HNPCC are germline mutations in hMSH2 (29.Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 30.Aaltonen L.A. Salovaara R. Kristo P. Canzian F. Hemminki A. Peltomaki P. Chadwick R.B.

In fact, hMSH2 and hMLH1 germline mutations account for most of the highly penetrant forms of HNPCC (29.Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 30.Aaltonen L.A. Salovaara R. Kristo P. Canzian F. Hemminki A. Peltomaki P. Chadwick R.B.

Germline mutations in hMSH6 account for relatively fewer cases of familial colorectal cancer than can be attributed to hMSH2 and hMLH1(29, 30), and the phenotype is relatively attenuated in the case ofhMSH6 germline mutations (31.Kolodner R.D. Tytell J.D. Schmeits J.L. Kane M.F. Gupta R.D. Weger J. Wahlberg S. Fox E.A. Peel D. Ziogas A. Garber J.E. Syngal S. Anton-Culver H. Li F.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5068-5074PubMed Google Scholar). To date, germline mutations in hMSH3 have never been linked to familial colorectal cancer (29.Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F.

Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32368-32375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and a new human DNA MMR component hMLH3, which also forms a complex with hMLH1, has been reported (4.Lipkin S.M.

In our study, hMLH1 was consistently detected at higher levels than hPMS2, particularly at the protein level. Unfortunately, probes were not available to accurately quantitate hPMS1 and hMLH3 at the message or protein level. We speculate that the combined amounts of hPMS1, hPMS2, and hMLH3 proteins might be approximately equal to hMLH1.We investigated in detail the interactive regulation of each component of the MMR system in MMR-deficient cell lines missing different components of the system. In LoVo cells, which are defective inhMSH2 (23.Boyer J.C. Umar A. Risinger J.I. Lipford J.R. Kane M. Yin S. Barrett J.C. Kolodner R.D. Kunkel T.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6063-6070PubMed Google Scholar), hMSH3 and hMSH6 proteins were also nearly undetectable (our data, and Ref. 11.Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Of interest, compensatory transcriptional up-regulation of the hMSH3 gene can be seen in the absence of hMSH6, as is the case in HCT15 cells. Similarly, absence of the hMLH1 affects expression of the hPMS2 protein, as seen in HCT116 cells. Interactions among the components of the MMR system can become particularly complicated. Mutations of hMSH2 orhMLH1, which functionally inactivate the system, can also facilitate somatic mutations of hMSH3 and hMSH6, both of which bear repetitive mononucleotide tracts in their coding sequences (33.Perucho M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 630-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).An inactivating mutation in hMSH6 in combination with intacthMSH2 is associated with an up-regulation ofhMSH3, which may compensate, to some degree, for the defective hMutS-α function. There is some redundancy in function between hMutS-α and hMutS-β as both can repair small insertion/deletion mispaired loops (34.Umar A. Risinger J.I. Glaab W.E. Tindall K.R. Barrett J.C. Kunkel T.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the lack of hMSH6 protein permits a compensatory increase in hMutS-β by increasing the stability of hMSH3 following its dimerization with hMSH2 (11.Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Additionally, we confirmed the transcriptional up-regulation ofhMSH3 in the presence of inactivating mutation inhMSH6. This observation helps explain the relatively weaker mutator effect of a mutated hMSH6 gene, and the observation that germline mutations in hMSH6 are associated with an attenuated HNPCC phenotype (31.Kolodner R.D. Tytell J.D. Schmeits J.L. Kane M.F. Gupta R.D. Weger J. Wahlberg S. Fox E.A. Peel D. Ziogas A. Garber J.E. Syngal S. Anton-Culver H. Li F.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5068-5074PubMed Google Scholar).The colon cancer cell line HCT116 has undergone mutational inactivation of the hMLH1 gene and is defective in DNA MMR activity (23.Boyer J.C. Umar A. Risinger J.I. Lipford J.R. Kane M. Yin S. Barrett J.C. Kolodner R.D. Kunkel T.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6063-6070PubMed Google Scholar). The SW48 cell line expresses no hMLH1 due to hypermethylation of its promoter (24.Kane M.F. Loda M. Gaida G.M. Lipman J. Mishra R. Goldman H. Jessup J.M. Kolodner R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 808-811PubMed Google Scholar). The level of the hMutS-α mRNAs and proteins are variable in these cell lines, indicating that the hMutS and hMutL systems do not quantitatively regulate each other. The stability of hPMS2 appears to depend upon the presence of an intact hMLH1 (our data and Ref. 35.Yao X. Buermeyer A.B. Narayanan L. Tran D. Baker S.M. Prolla T.A. Glazer P.M. Liskay R.M. Arnheim N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As seen in the HCT116+ch3 cell line, the reconstitution of hMLH1 also restores expression of the hPMS2 protein.We have previously reported that the human MMR system is regulated throughout the cell cycle in MMR-proficient cell lines (16.Marra G. Chang C.L. Laghi L.A. Chauhan D.P. Young D. Boland C.R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2189-2196PubMed Google Scholar). We noted that the MMR-proficient cancer cell lines showed higher levels of MMR mRNAs and proteins than we saw in the two normal lung fibroblast lines. The normal lung fibroblast cell line WI38 has been stably transformed and immortalized with the SV40 virus (19.Girardi A.J. Weinstein D. Moorhead P.S. Ann. Med. Exp. Biol. Fenn. 1966; 44: 242-254PubMed Google Scholar). The entire DNA MMR system underwent transcriptional up-regulation after SV40 transformation. The promoters of the MMR genes hMSH2,hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1 have characteristic features of housekeeping genes, including abundant CG islands and no TATA box (36.Yanagisawa Y. Ito E. Iwahashi Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Maruyama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 37.Nicolaides N.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genomics. 1995; 29: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38.Iwahashi Y. Ito E. Yanagisawa Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Onodera T. Maruyama K.

Commun. 1999; 256: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, these sequences show potential binding sites for transcriptional activators including AP-1 (in the case of the hMSH2 and hPMS1 promoters) (36.Yanagisawa Y. Ito E. Iwahashi Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Maruyama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 38.Iwahashi Y. Ito E. Yanagisawa Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Onodera T. Maruyama K. Gene (Amst .). 1998; 213: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and T-antigen (in the hMSH2 promoter) (38.Iwahashi Y. Ito E. Yanagisawa Y. Akiyama Y. Yuasa Y. Onodera T. Maruyama K. Gene (Amst .). 1998; 213: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence of these binding sites suggests that the MMR genes might be up-regulated in different physiological or biological settings. As cell cycle−dependent regulation of the MMR system has been previously reported (16.Marra G. Chang C.L. Laghi L.A. Chauhan D.P. Young D. Boland C.R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2189-2196PubMed Google Scholar), up-regulation of the MMR system in the synthetic and postsynthetic phases might reflect an increased need for active MMR function in actively proliferating cells. Increased recruitment of cells into the cell cycle from G0 phase or an increased proportion of S and G2/M phase cells by active proliferation may be responsible for up-regulation of the system.In summary, we have studied the steady-state expression of human DNA MMR transcripts and proteins, where a hierarchy of expression reflects the relative roles of these proteins in DNA repair. hMSH2 is the most abundantly expressed of these proteins, and the presence of hMSH2 protein serves to stabilize hMSH6 and hMSH3. The defect ofhMSH6 interactively up-regulates hMSH3transcription. The hMSH6 protein is substantially more highly expressed than hMSH3, an observation worthy of additional functional exploration. hMLH1 also behaves like a chaperone of stability for the other hMutL components. The components of the hMutS system are expressed severalfold more than components of the hMutL system, which suggests the presence of a signaling cascade in MMR function. Finally, SV40 transformation of a fibroblast cell line led to an up-regulation of the entire MMR system. The DNA MMR system is regulated primarily at a transcriptional level; however, mutational inactivation of the obligatory components of the system, hMSH2 andhMLH1, lead to post-translational down-regulation of its heterodimerizing partners. These findings have implications for the physiological regulation of the DNA MMR system and for the interpretation of germline mutations in hereditary colorectal cancer. The human mismatch repair (MMR)1 system ensures replication fidelity by correcting postreplication errors that have escaped the DNA proofreading function of DNA polymerase. Defects in the MMR system result in the development of a genetically unstable mutator phenotype and render the cell more susceptible to neoplastic transformation (reviewed in Refs. 1.Kolodner R.D.

The MMR system functions through the interactions between several proteins, such as hMSH2, hMSH3, hMSH6, hMLH1, hPMS2, and recently discovered hMLH3 (1.Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin.

Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 6.Drummond J.T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, hMSH2 can dimerize with hMSH3 creating the hMutS-β complex, which binds larger DNA insertion/deletion mispaired loops (5.Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S.

Subsequently, activated hMutS-α or hMutS-β interacts with hMutL-α (a heterodimer of hMLH1 with hPMS2) to direct DNA repair (9.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P.

Recent studies suggest that maintaining an appropriate balance of the components of the human MMR system is critical for its proper repair function. In hMSH6-defective HCT15 cells, hMSH3 protein is highly expressed, whereas in hMSH2-defective LoVo cells, hMSH3 and hMSH6 proteins are not detected (11.Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T.

This investigation was aimed (i) to ascertain whether and how these two processes are related and (ii) to gain insight into the role played by the released cytochrome c in the onset of neurotoxicity. Cytochrome c release takes place owing to the generation of reactive oxygen species both in glutamate-treated cerebellar granule cells and in sister control cultures incubated in the presence of the reactive oxygen species-generating system consisting of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase. In the early phase of neurotoxicity (30-min glutamate exposure) about 40% of the maximum (as measured at 3 h of glutamate exposure) cytochrome c release was found to occur in cerebellar granule cells from mitochondria that were essentially coupled and intact and that had a negligible production of oxygen free radicals. Contrarily, mitochondria from cells treated with glutamate for 3 h were mostly uncoupled and produced reactive oxygen species at a high rate. The cytosolic fraction containing the released cytochrome c was able to transfer electrons from superoxide anion to molecular oxygen via the respiratory chain and was found to partially prevent glutamate toxicity when added externally to cerebellar neurons undergoing necrosis. In the light of these findings, we propose that in the early phase of neurotoxicity, cytochromec release can be part of a cellular and mitochondrial defense mechanism against oxidative stress.

Moreover in vitro cultured cerebellar granule neurons undergo death via necrosis when exposed to excessive glutamate (1Choi D.W.

However the events that underlie necrosis as well as the participation of the different cell components to the biochemical processes that lead the cell to death have not been yet established in detail. As far as mitochondria are concerned, their major role in the glutamate-dependent necrosis is now commonly accepted as follows. Dying neurons have been shown to lose their mitochondrial membrane potential and energy charge (3Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P.

Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Ciotti T.M. Marra E. Calissano P. Brain Res. 1997; 768: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that during necrotic death caused by GNT, cytochromec (cyt c) release from mitochondria of CGCs occurs. This release was found to not impair mitochondrial respiration as measured in cell homogenate, at least in the early phase of glutamate exposure, but it was suggested to allow for cell defense against the onset of glucose uptake deficiency (13Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Marra E. Calissano P. Passarella S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it should be noted that cyt c release has been already reported to occur during apoptosis (14Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Cyt c release has also been found to occur before mitochondrial membrane potential collapse (14Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar) and to actively participate in the cascade of events leading to caspase activation (15Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D.

Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). During GNT, how cyt c release occurs as well as its function (see 13) outside the mitochondria remain to be established. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mostly due to xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity (11Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Minervini G.M. Ciotti M.T. Marra E. Calissano P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2038-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), occurs together with cyt crelease during GNT (13Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Marra E. Calissano P. Passarella S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we carried out experimental work aimed at ascertaining whether and how ROS could cause the release of cytc and whether this cyt c could take part in the mitochondrial defense mechanism against cell oxidative stress. Tissue culture medium (basal medium Eagle's) and fetal calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., tissue culture dishes were purchased from NUNC (Denmark), and enzymes and biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. Anti-cytochrome c antibodies (7H8.2C12) were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-glutamate dehydrogenase antibodies were kindly supplied by Dr. F. Rothe (Institut fuer Medizinische Neurobiologie, University of Magdeburg, Germany). Anti-cytochromec oxidase (subunit IV) antibodies (20E8-C12) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies and Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western blotting reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were obtained as described in Levi et al. (24Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti M.T. Gallo V. Brain Res. 1984; 290: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Before each experiment, the culture medium was removed, and the plated cerebellar granule cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline medium (PBS), pH 7.4, containing NaCl (138 mm), KCl (2.7 mm), Na2HPO4 (8 mm), and KH2PO4 (15 mm) and then collected by gentle scraping in a final volume of 4 ml of PBS/9-cm dish. Suspended granule cells showed full viability, even though they lacked the morphological organization present in culture dishes such as cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts as well as neuritis. Cell integrity, which remains rather constant for 3–5 h, was quantitatively assessed by checking the inability of cells to oxidize externally added succinate, which cannot enter intact cells (25Berry M.N. Edwards A.M. Barritt G.J. Burdon R.H. Van Knippenberg P.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 83-98Google Scholar), by checking the ability of ouabain to block glucose transport in cells (8Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Minervini G.M. Marra E. Passarella S. Calissano P. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2519-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and by counting dead cells, identified as large phase-bright cell bodies, as in Volontè et al. (26Volontè C. Ciotti M.T. Battistini L. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The final cell suspension contained routinely 85–95% intact cells and was prepared after 7–8 days in vitro. Glutamate exposure was performed 7 days after plating. Primary cultures were exposed usually for 30 min to 100 μm glutamate at 25 °C in Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mmNaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) in the presence of 1 μm glycine, added to fully activateN-methyl-d-aspartate-sensitive glutamate receptors (27Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar). Cells were then replenished with basal medium Eagle's containing 25 mm KCl, 2 mmglutamine, and gentamicin (100 μg/ml) and put in the incubator. For the quantitative assessment of GNT, cell integrity and count were measured as described above after 12–24 h. Neurotoxicity was expressed as the percentage of intact cells with respect to control cells kept under the same experimental conditions without the glutamate addition. In control experiments 95–97% integrity was found in 24 h. Cell homogenate from a cell suspension was obtained by 10 strokes with a Dounce potter at room temperature. With this procedure, lactate dehydrogenase was released, and subsequent treatment with Triton X-100 did not cause further release. Mitochondria were isolated from cell homogenates, essentially as reported in Almeida and Medina (28Almeida A. Medina J.M. Brain Res. Protocols. 1998; 2: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly: the homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was kept on ice. The pellet was re-homogenized with a further 3 ml of isolation buffer consisting of 320 mmsucrose, 1 mm K+-EDTA, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The two supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was further centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 11 min at 4 °C. The pellet, i.e. the mitochondrial fraction, was then resuspended in 200 μl of isolation buffer to obtain about 4 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml. These mitochondria, incubated in PBS, were checked for their intactness and coupling by measuring the activities of both adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3) and glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) (see below), which are marker enzymes of the mitochondrial intermembrane space and matrix, respectively. The percentage of damaged mitochondria ranged between 0.5 and 1.5%. Mitochondrial coupling was checked by measuring the respiratory control ratio, i.e. (oxygen uptake rate after ADP addition)/(oxygen uptake rate before ADP addition), which reflects the ability of mitochondria to produce ATP; in both cases succinate was used as a respiratory substrate. As expected, both the inhibitors of electron flow and atractyloside, a powerful inhibitor of the ADP/ATP translocator (29LaNoue F.K. Schoolwerth A.C. Ernster L. Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 221-261Google Scholar), blocked ADP-stimulated oxygen uptake. Inhibition was also caused by oligomycin, which can inhibit ATP synthase (30Nicholls D.G. Bioenergetics. Academic Press, Inc., London1982Google Scholar) and is rapidly reversed by the uncoupler carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, which stimulates the rate of oxygen consumption. Cytosolic fractions of both control CGCs (C-CGCs) and glutamate-treated CGCs (GLU-CGCs) (about 30 × 106 cells in 1 ml) were obtained after homogenization in PBS and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was concentrated to 0.2 ml by using the Savant Speed Vac concentrator and indicated as cytosolic fraction containing cyt c (CCCF). Both the protein assay of cell and mitochondria were determined according to Waddel and Hill (31Waddel W.J. Hill C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1956; 48: 311-314PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin used as a standard. O2 consumption was measured polarographically by means of a Gilson 5/6 oxygraph using a Clark electrode, as in Atlante et al. (8Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Minervini G.M. Marra E. Passarella S. Calissano P. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2519-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Either the cell homogenate or mitochondria suspension in PBS (about 0.2 mg of protein) was incubated in a thermostatted (25 °C) water-jacketed glass vessel (final volume equal to 1.5 ml). Instrument sensitivity was set to a value that allowed the monitoring of rates of O2 uptake as low as 0.5 nanoatoms min−1mg−1 of protein. Immunoblot analysis was performed on cytosolic extracts from control and glutamate-treated cultures essentially as in Bobba et al. (18Bobba A. Atlante A. Giannattasio S. Sgaramella G. Calissano P. Marra E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In both cases cells were washed once with PBS and collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm1,10-phenantroline, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. The cells were homogenized in a Teflon glass homogenizer (10 strokes), and after 5 min on ice, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants,i.e. cytosolic fractions, were removed and stored at −80 °C until analyzed by gel electrophoresis. 10 μg of cytosolic proteins were loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with immunoblot analysis performed as described in Bobba et al. (18Bobba A. Atlante A. Giannattasio S. Sgaramella G. Calissano P. Marra E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Relative optical densities and areas of bands were quantified using the GS-700 imaging densitometer implemented with the Molecular Analyst Software (Bio-Rad). Cyt c was assayed as in Errede et al. (32Errede B. Kamen M.D. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) by using the Shimadzu double-wavelength (548 minus 540 nm) spectrophotometer model UV3000. Either the cell homogenate or the resulting supernatant (obtained by centrifuging homogenate at 15,000 × g for 15 min), in the presence of 3 μm rotenone plus 0.8 μm antimycin A and 6 μm myxothiazole, were first incubated with potassium ferricyanide (0.1 mm) to oxidize the reduced cytc, then potassium cyanide (1 mm) was added to inhibit cyt c oxidase. The reduction of cytochromec (ε550 = 21 mm−1cm−1) was then obtained by adding a few grains of sodium dithionite as in Atlante et al. (13Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Marra E. Calissano P. Passarella S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and measured as an increase of absorbance. O⨪2 was detected as in Atlante et al. (11Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Minervini G.M. Ciotti M.T. Marra E. Calissano P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2038-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and Atlante and Passarella (33Atlante A. Passarella S. Brain Res. Protocols. 1999; 4: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), according to either the Fe3+-cyt c (34Forman H.J. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or the adrenochrom assay (35Misra H.P. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 217: 3170-3175Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The newly formed O⨪2 gives an increase of absorbance at 550 and 480 nm for Fe2+-cyt cand adrenochrom formation, respectively, measured using a PerkinElmer lambda-5 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted holder. A calibration curve is made by using an O⨪2-producing system,i.e. XX + XOD, and an O⨪2 detection system,i.e. epinephrine/Fe3+-cyt c that, in the presence of O⨪2, gives adrenochrom/Fe2+-cytc with a 1:1 stoichiometry. To detect mitochondrial superoxide anion production, mitochondria (about 0.2 mg of protein) were incubated in 2 ml of PBS in the presence of Fe3+-cyt c (10 μm). The reduction of Fe3+-cyt c that is a result of superoxide formation was then obtained by adding a mitochondrial respiratory substrate such as succinate (5 mm). The increase of absorbance at 550 nm, i.e. Fe2+-cyt cformation (ε550 = 31.7 mm−1cm−1), is a measure of O⨪2production by mitochondria. To assess whether cyt c release takes place due to reactive oxygen species, produced either during GNT or in the presence of a ROS-generating system, two cell culture systems were employed: 1) GLU-CGCs and 2) CGCs, incubated in the presence of the ROS-producing system consisting of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase (ROS-CGCs), previously reported to cause about 60% ROS production under neurotoxicity (11Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Minervini G.M. Ciotti M.T. Marra E. Calissano P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2038-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In both cases cyt c release was measured by two independent procedures: namely, Western blot analysis and polarographic measurement of the activation of cyt c-dependent ascorbate oxidation in cell homogenate (13Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Marra E. Calissano P. Passarella S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Bobba A. Atlante A. Giannattasio S. Sgaramella G. Calissano P. Marra E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This last measurement, at variance with Western blot assessments, allows for the evaluation of whether the released cyt c is still functionally active, a prerequisite for any hypothesis about the possible functional significance of its cytoplasmic location. In the same experiment, the ongoing O⨪2 production was also monitored (Figs.1 and2).Figure 2ROS production due to externally added xanthine/xanthine oxidase system causes cytochrome crelease from mitochondria of control cells. Rat CGCs cultured for 7 days in vitro were incubated in Locke's solution in the absence (C) or presence of 10 μm xanthine plus 1 e.u./ml xanthine oxidase (C+XX/XOD) for 30 min. 5 e.u./ml SOD was present where indicated. A, Western blot analysis of cytochromec. The analysis was carried out as reported in the legend of Fig. 1 A. B, superoxide anion production. The measurements were carried out as reported in the legend of Fig.1 B. C, oxygen consumption caused by externally added ascorbate. The measurements were carried out as described in the legend of Fig. 1 C except that neither allopurinol or leupeptin was used. Numbers along the traces are rates of oxygen uptake expressed as nanoatoms of O2min−1 mg−1 of cell protein. Inb, ROS treatment was made in the presence of SOD. InA, B, and C, results are the means ± S.E. of triplicate measurements and are representative of at least five different experiments carried out with different cell preparations prepared from different groups of animals. Variations up to 5% were found.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a result of 30-min incubation of CGCs with 100 μmglutamate, a marked increase of cyt c released in the extramitochondrial phase was found with respect to the control, 210 ± 10% as evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A), and with respect to the cell homogenate capability to oxidize externally added ascorbate at more than 6-fold increase in the rate of oxygen uptake was measured in GLU-CGC homogenate (Fig.1 C, trace b) as compared with C-CGCs (Fig.1 C, trace a). These data confirm the marked release of cyt c in the extramitochondrial phase (see Ref.13Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Marra E. Calissano P. Passarella S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that such a pool is functionally active. Under the same experimental conditions, GLU-CGCs had a superoxide anion production, as detected with the ferricytochrome c method, 5–6-fold higher than controls (Fig. 1 B). As expected, the specific inhibitor of XOD activity allopurinol (36Flower R.J. Moncada S. Vanet J.R. Goodman A.G. Gilman L.S. Rall T.W. Murad F. The Pharmacological Bases of Therapeutics. Macmillian Publishing Co, New York1985: 674-715Google Scholar) was found to reduce cyt c levels (Fig. 1 A), ROS production (Fig. 1 B), and oxygen consumption rate (Fig.1 C, trace c). Consistently, leupeptin, which is known to specifically inhibit Ca2+-dependent proteases (37Arai A. Kessler M. Lee K. Lynch G. Brain Res. 1990; 532: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 38Rami A. Krieglstein J. Brain Res. 1993; 609: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and, consequently, XOD formation (11Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Minervini G.M. Ciotti M.T. Marra E. Calissano P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2038-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), strongly prevented both O⨪2 production and cyt c release (Fig. 1, A, B, and C, trace d). Cyt c release was fully prevented by (5R, 10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK801), a specificN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and largely prevented by externally added superoxide dismutase (SOD) (not shown). Controls confirmed that all the compounds failed to influence the assay conditions as shown in an in vitro system in the absence of CGCs. Interestingly, artificial ROS generation with the xanthine (XX) plus XOD system (Fig. 2 B) stimulated cyt c release in C-CGCs, as detected by both Western analysis (254 ± 5%) in the extramitochondrial phase (Fig. 2 A) and polarographic measurement (Fig. 2 C), in good agreement with the results reported in Fig. 1. In both the assays, externally added SOD largely prevented both cyt c release and ROS production (Fig. 2,A, B, C, trace b). It should be noted that in the experiments reported in the Figs. 1 and2 and in the following experiments, the presence of mitochondria in the cytosolic fraction as well as mitochondrial damage due to cell manipulations must be carefully controlled. This was done on the basis of controls performed with filters probed with a monoclonal antibody against cyt c oxidase (subunit IV) and a polyclonal antibody against glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the intactness of the mitochondrial membranes was checked by assaying both adenylate kinase and glutamate dehydrogenase, marker enzymes of the intermembrane and matrix space, respectively, in supernatants of control, ROS, and GLU-CGC homogenates at different times after glutamate exposure. In all cases the activity was negligible (0.5–1%) with respect to that measured in the whole homogenates treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 used to dissolve mitochondria and was always of the same extent within the time of cell harvesting after the glutamate pulse (0–300 min). On the other hand, the possibility that mitochondria can swell in the incubation medium due to the occurrence of Na+/H+ exchange (39Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), with cyt crelease caused by ROS in only swollen organelles, was also considered. Therefore, in another experiment, the Na+-containing medium was substituted with mannitol medium (consisting of 210 mmmannitol, 60 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) with no significant change in the experimental findings (not shown). We have previously shown that in the early phase of neurotoxicity, mitochondrial coupling in control and GLU-CGCs do not significantly differ from each other when measured in cell homogenates in which cyt c release has already occurred (13Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Marra E. Calissano P. Passarella S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Another set of experiments was carried out to rule out that the ROS-dependent cyt c release is accompanied by mitochondrial uncoupling, as measured with isolated organelles, and, more importantly, to ascertain whether mitochondria can produce ROS under conditions in which cyt c is released. In a typical experiment, mitochondria isolated from both control cells (C-CGC-M) (Fig. 3 A) and 30-min glutamate-treated cells (GLU-CGC-M) (Fig. 3 B) and 3-h glutamate-treated cells (Fig. 3 C) were found to oxidize succinate at a rate equal to 26, 24, and 20 nanoatoms of O2/min × mg of mitochondrial protein, respectively. The addition of 1 mm ADP increased these rates to 56, 48, and 28 nanoatoms of O2/min × mg of mitochondrial protein with a respiratory control ratio equal to 2.2, 2.0, and 1.4, respectively. It is worth noting that no significant difference in mitochondrial coupling was found between control and 30-min glutamate-treated mitochondria (n = 4). That these two treatments do not differ from each other was also shown by the capability of oligomycin (0.1 μg/mg), which inhibits ATP synthase, to decrease with the same efficiency the rate of oxygen uptake in a way reversed by adding the uncoupler carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (1 μm). The same mitochondria were analyzed for their capability to produce ROS (Fig. 3, D–E), as detected by the Fe3+-cytc method. Negligible ROS production was found in the control (C-CGC-M), whereas in mitochondria from 30 min glutamate-treated cells, ROS production increased to 3 nmol of O⨪2 formed/min × mg of protein (Fig. 3 D) and further increased to 12 nmol of O⨪2 formed/min × mg of protein in organelles isolated from cells exposed to glutamate for 3 h (Fig. 3 E). In this latter case, large uncoupling and a dramatic decrease in the rate of oxygen uptake takes place (Fig. 3 C) (see also Ref. 8Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Minervini G.M. Marra E. Passarella S. Calissano P. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2519-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). In the current model for Akt activation, Akt is first recruited from the cytoplasm to cellular membranes by interaction of its pleckstrin homology domain with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) lipid products phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) (2Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Akt activity is not stimulated by translocation itself but is dependent upon phosphorylation at two residues (Ser473 and Thr308). Thr308 is phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, which also contains a pleckstrin homology domain (3Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F.

The mechanism of phosphorylation of Ser473 remains elusive; although phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 is a possible candidate, the integrin-linked kinase and most recently autophosphorylation have also been implicated (5Delcommenne M.

The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) is an important causative agent of food-borne gastroenteritis in humans. Penetration of the intestinal epithelium and survival within a variety of mammalian cell types is essential for pathogenicity and is dependent on a number of virulence factors. The genes encoding these factors are located within five discrete S almonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) on the bacterial chromosome (reviewed in Ref. 8Marcus S.L. Brumell J.H. Pfeifer C.G. Finlay B.B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Encoded in SPI1 is a type III secretion system (TTSS), which translocates effectors directly into the cytoplasm of host cells and is required for bacterial invasion of nonphagocytic cells (9Galan J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This remarkable process is instigated by interactions between bacterial effectors, components of eukaryotic signaling pathways, and the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in membrane ruffling on the cell surface and subsequent bacterial internalization (10Fu Y. Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E.

Two GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac-1, which are key regulators of eukaryotic actin dynamics, are directly targeted bySalmonella. For example, the SPI1 effector protein SopE, when microinjected into eukaryotic cells, catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Cdc42 and Rac-1, thus activating them, to induce membrane ruffling (11Hardt W.D.

Although Salmonella-induced membrane ruffling is growth factor receptor independent (14Jones B.D. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we show that S. typhimuriumrapidly activates Akt in epithelial cells. One translocated bacterial effector protein, SigD, was found to be absolutely required for both phosphorylation and activation of Akt. A single point mutation in a conserved inositol phosphatase catalytic domain of SigD (16Norris F.A. Wilson M.P. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14057-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) abolished both Akt phosphorylation and activation. SigD was not required forSalmonella-induced membrane translocation of Akt, indicating that in this novel pathway the membrane translocation of Akt does not lead to its activation unless an exogenous bacterial factor is present. Except where indicated chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cytochalasin D stock, 1 mg/ml in Me2SO, was stored at −20 °C. LY294002 (BioMol) stock, 100 mm in Me2SO, was stored at −80 °C. EGF (Upstate Biotechnology) stock, 100 μg/ml in water, was stored at −20 °C. HeLa cells, S. typhimurium 1344 wild type, and the SB111/pRI203, A1A1, and E12A2 mutants were as described previously (17Garcia-del Portillo F. Pucciarelli M.G. Jefferies W.A. Finlay B.B. J.

Immun. 1999; 67: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) To construct the ΔsigD mutant (missing amino acids 34–465), we used the primers D1 (5′-GCG AAT TCT ATC TGT TCA AGC ATG-3′) and D2 (5′-GTC GAC TGA GAG AAT CTG CAT TCC-3′) to amplify by polymerase chain reaction a 514-base pair fragment including the region upstream of sigD and the first 33 codons of the gene. The primers D3 (5′-GTC GAC AAA GAT CGT ACA GGG ATG-3′) and D4 (5′-CTG CAA AGT CAG GAT GTC GTC AGG-3′) were used to amplify a 484-bp fragment including the last 99 codons ofsigD and the downstream region. PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. These two PCR products were fused at a SalI site (underlined in D2 and D3) and ligated into pCRTOPO2.1 (Invitrogen). The resulting deletion cassette was released by digestion with SacI and XbaI, ligated into the corresponding sites of the positive selection suicide vector pRE112 (CmR), and transformed into SY327λpir (19Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). The SL1344 sigD deletion mutant (ΔsigD) was then constructed by allelic exchange as described (20Edwards R.A. Keller L.H. Schifferli D.M. Gene (Amst. ). 1998; 207: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The pMWDE plasmid was constructed by amplification of thesigDE operon starting 46 bp upstream of the ATG start codon (includes the ribosome binding site but not the sigDpromoter) using the primers D5 (5′-TGT GGA TCC TGT TGA ATG TTC CCA C-3′) and D6 (see above) and inserted as aBamHI-EcoRI fragment into pMW119 (AmpR) (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.). The resulting plasmid, pMWDE, expresses the sigDE open reading frame under the control of the lacZ promoter. The C462S SigD mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis converting TGT (Cys462) to TCG (Ser462) and creating anEcoRI site. Primer SIGD-EV (5′-AAA AGA TAT CTT TCC CAG TGC TTA TG-3′) and primer C462S-Rev (5′-ATT CGA ATT CCA GGC GGG TAC CG-3′) were used to amplify a 780-bp fragment including the Cys462codon. Primer C462S-For (5′-CTG GAA TTC GAA AAG CGG CAA AGA TCG-3′) and primer SIGD-StuI (5′-TCG AGG CCT AAC GCG TCA TAT AAA C-3′) were used to amplify a 300-bp fragment including the Cys462codon and the downstream region. These two fragments were inserted into pBluescript SKII(+) (Stratagene) and ligated at the newEcoRI site. The resulting plasmid contains part of thesigD ORF from the EcoRV site to theStuI site in sigE. The corresponding fragment of pMWDE was removed and replaced with the mutated fragment, producing pMWDE*. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Overnight cultures were subcultured at a dilution of 1:33 in fresh LB and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for an additional 3 h. The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at room temperature and then directly resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Invasion was initiated by the addition of these bacteria directly to cultured cells. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 5–20 min as indicated, and free bacteria were then removed by washing with PBS. In experiments requiring longer infection times, the culture medium was supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 20 min post-infection to kill extracellular bacteria. Invasion assays were carried out as described previously (21Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Toh B.-H. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared by adding 80 μl of hot SDS sample buffer containing 50 mmdithiothreitol directly to the monolayer in 35-mm dishes. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.14 m NaCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder (Carnation). Primary antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution (rabbit anti-PKB, rabbit anti-PKB-Ser473, and rabbit anti-PKB-Thr308 from New England Biolabs). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) were used at 1:5,000. The PhotoTope™-HRP detection system (New England Biolabs) was used according to the manufacturer's directions. Subconfluent HeLa cells in 60-mm dishes (Nunc) were incubated in serum-free media for 3 h. Bacteria (∼200 colony-forming units/cell) were added for 10 or 20 min as indicated. Cells were placed on ice, and 1 ml of ice cold solubilization buffer was added (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na3MoO4, 1 μg/ml microcystin-LR, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Nuclei and bacteria were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 min), and supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Akt antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h with continuous mixing. Protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were then added and the samples were incubated for another hour. Beads were washed once with solubilization buffer, twice with solubilization buffer containing 500 mmNaCl, and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The beads were then resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 60 μm Crosstide (Upstate Biotechnology). ATP solution (5 μl) (200 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in kinase buffer) was added, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by spotting 20 μl onto 2-cm2pieces of P81 filter paper (Whatman), followed by extensive washing in 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid. Measurement of associated radioactivity was by liquid scintillation counting. HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with GFP-Akt (22Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) using the TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection (18–24 h), infection with bacteria was carried out as described above. Cells were then either fixed immediately or washed and incubated for a further 20 min (30-min time point). Fixation was in 2.5% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by extensive washing with PBS and permeabilization in PBS containing 10% (v/v) normal goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (TSB) for 10 min. Rabbit anti-lipopolysaccharide (Difco) diluted 1:400 in TSB was applied followed by goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) at 1:500 dilution. Antibodies were applied for 30 min each and after each incubation the monolayers were washed extensively with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Mowiol (Calbiochem). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axioplan upright microscope and a ×63 oil immersion objective. Single optical sections through each cell were obtained in a 512 × 512 pixel format. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5. The activation state of Akt in infected epithelial cells was initially investigated by determining its phosphorylation state. HeLa cells were serum-starved for 3 h and then infected with S. typhimurium for 2–10 min. After infection, the cells were washed to remove extracellular bacteria and incubated for varying times. Western blots were probed with phosphospecific antibodies recognizing either Thr308 or Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt. Phosphorylation on both residues was induced within 10 min of the addition of bacteria and peaked at approximately 60 min (Fig. 1,A and B). In comparison, activation of Akt by EGF produces a much more rapid and short lived phosphorylation response (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether the observed Akt phosphorylation was PI3-K-dependent we used the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 (LY29). Cells were pretreated for 20 min before infection, and the drug was maintained throughout the course of the experiment. Ser473 phosphorylation was not detected in cells that had been pretreated with 40 μm LY29 and then infected with S. typhimurium for 20 min (Fig.2 A). Similarly EGF-stimulated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was completely abrogated by LY29 pretreatment (Fig. 2 B). These experiments indicate that Akt phosphorylation by Salmonella is PI3-K-dependent.Figure 2Characterization of requirements for Akt phosphorylation in S. typhimurium-infected HeLa cells. Cells were infected with S. typhimurium as described. Western blot analysis was performed as described in Fig. 1.A, Akt phosphorylation is PI3-K-dependent. Cells were treated with LY29 for 15 min and then infected with S. typhimurium for 20 min. B, EGF stimulation of Akt. Cells were treated with LY29 for 15 min and then treated for 2 min with EGF (100 ng/ml). C, bacterial internalization is not required for Akt phosphorylation. Cells were treated with CytoD for 15 min and then infected with S. typhimurium for 20 min.D, the SPI1 TTSS is required for Akt phosphorylation. Cells were infected with wild type S. typhimurium or the SB111/pRI203 mutant strain for 20 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The actin depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D (CytoD) was used to inhibit S. typhimurium invasion of epithelial cells (23Finlay B.B. Ruschkowski S. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells for 15 min with 1 μg/ml CytoD did not preventS. typhimurium-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig.2 C). Although the level of phosphorylation appears slightly reduced compared with that in untreated cells, this is not proportional to the reduction in bacterial invasion. Under these conditions, invasion was less than 1% of that in cells without CytoD treatment (not shown). Thus S. typhimurium-induced Akt phosphorylation in epithelial cells does not require bacterial internalization. We subsequently examined whether effector proteins secreted by the SPI1 TTSS of S. typhimurium were involved in Akt activation. AS. typhimurium strain with a nonpolar mutation ininvA, a gene encoding an essential structural component of the SPI1 TTSS, was used (24Galan J.E. Ginocchio C. Costeas P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4338-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This invasion-deficient strain has been complemented with the inv gene of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis to ensure the intimate interaction of bacteria with HeLa cells (17Garcia-del Portillo F. Pucciarelli M.G. Jefferies W.A. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2005-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Invasin is expressed on the bacterial surface ofY. pseudotuberculosis or in this case the S. typhimurium SB111/pRI203 strain and facilitates bacterial internalization by binding with high affinity to β1integrin receptors (25Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Under the conditions employed here, the mutant was internalized at approximately half the efficiency of the wild type bacteria. However, the mutant did not induce Akt phosphorylation even when extremely high inocula (320 colony-forming units/cell) were used (Fig. 2 D). Thus Akt phosphorylation is dependent on one or more effectors secreted by the SPI1 TTSS. To identify effectors involved in Akt phosphorylation we screened several S. typhimurium mutants. These mutants were constructed by the random insertion of a promoterless luciferase gene cassette into the S. typhimurium chromosome and had been selected in a previous screen for increased intracellular expression (18Pfeifer C.G. Marcus S.L. Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these mutants, A1A1, was unable to induce Akt phosphorylation in HeLa cells (Fig.3 A). In this mutant, the transposon is inserted into a previously described gene,sigD located in SPI5, the gene product of which, SigD, is translocated via the SPI1 TTSS (26Hong K.H. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the sigDmutation is not polar because the E12A2 mutant, in which the luciferase gene cassette is inserted in a downstream SPI5 gene, pipB, did induce Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A andB). A nonpolar sigD deletion mutant, S. typhimuriumΔsigD, was constructed by removing 430 codons from thesigD open reading frame. Like the A1A1 strain, S. typhimurium ΔsigD did not induce Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). Under the conditions used in this study, the invasion efficiency of the SigD mutants did not differ significantly from the wild type S. typhimurium (not shown). Transcomplementation of the A1A1 and ΔsigD mutants with a plasmid (pMWDE) encoding the sigD and sigE genes under the control of the lacZ promoter, rescued the ability to phosphorylate Akt (DE in Fig. 3 C). ThesigE (pipC) gene was included in the pMWDE plasmid as it encodes a putative SigD chaperone that is essential for secretion of the effector (26Hong K.H. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having defined the phosphorylation status of Akt, we next investigated whether the enzymatic activity of Akt was increased by S. typhimurium. HeLa cells were infected with bacteria and then solubilized in lysis buffer after which total Akt was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with a synthetic peptide (Crosstide) containing the consensus sequence surrounding Ser9 of GSK-3B, a known target of Akt, and [γ-32P]ATP. Infection with wild type S. typhimurium for 10 min increased Akt kinase activity by approximately 12-fold compared with uninfected cells. Increasing the infection time to 20 min lead to a further increase (40-fold) in Akt activity (compare A and B of Fig.4). These results correlate well with the phosphorylation kinetics shown in Fig. 1. Stimulation of kinase activity was almost completely abolished by the PI3-K inhibitor LY29 and was comparable to the level of stimulation obtained with EGF. Furthermore, no significant Akt activity was detected when HeLa cells were infected with either the SPI1 TTSS mutant (SB111/pRI203) or with the ΔsigD strain. Complementation of the ΔsigD strain with pMWDE restored the bacterial stimulation of Akt activity (Fig. 4 A). These results demonstrate thatS. typhimurium activates Akt and that this activation is SigD-dependent. SigD and the S. dublin and Shigella flexnerihomologues, SopB and IpgD respectively, all contain two inositol 4-phosphatase domains, and a conserved cysteine residue in one of these domains is essential for the activity of mammalian inositol 4-phosphatases as well as in vitro phosphatase activity of SopB (16Norris F.A. Wilson M.P. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14057-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether this residue is also required for SigD-induced Akt phosphorylation/activation, we constructed the equivalent mutant (C462S), designated pMWDE*. When this plasmid was used to complement the ΔsigD strain, no Akt activation was detected (Fig. 4 B), and neither Ser473 nor Thr308 phosphorylation was induced (Fig. 4 C). Thus, a motif common to 4-phosphatases is required for Akt phosphorylation and activation by SigD. Because LY29 inhibited Akt activation, the association of PI3-K with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was examined. Such interactions lead to the activation of PI3-K by localization with its substrates at the plasma membrane and through allosteric modifications (28Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that the p85 subunit of class 1α-PI3-K was recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins during infection with either wild type or ΔsigD strains (Fig.4 D). This demonstrates that while Salmonellainvasion does activate PI3-K, this activation is independent of SigD. Having shown that SigD is essential for the phosphorylation and activation of Akt in epithelial cells, we also wished to define the role of SigD in the membrane recruitment of Akt. The localization of Akt in infected epithelial cells was studied using confocal microscopy and GFP-Akt (22Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with the GFP-Akt plasmid and then infected with S. typhimurium. Localized translocation of Akt in the vicinity of both S. typhimuriumwild type and ΔsigD mutant was clearly evident within 2 min of adding bacteria (Fig. 5,A and B). At this time point extensive membrane ruffling, characteristic of Salmonella invasion, is evident where the bacteria are in contact with the host cell (29Francis C.L. Ryan T.A. Jones B.D. Smith S.J. Falkow S. Nature. 1993; 364: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Bacterial-induced translocation of Akt is still evident 30 min post-infection, which is similar to the localization pattern induced by cell-cell or cell-matrix contact in epithelial cells (22Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These results show that Akt is translocated to membrane ruffles induced bySalmonella, and furthermore, that this translocation is independent of SigD. The remarkable ability of pathogens such as Salmonellato intricately interact with host cell signaling pathways is key to their survival. Defining the nature of these interactions is not only important for deciphering the role of bacterial effectors but can also provide vital information on the intricate signaling cascades present in eukaryotic cells. One of the central regulators of eukaryotic cellular survival is the protooncogene Akt. We have shown conclusively that the S. typhimurium SPI1 TTSS translocated effector SigD induces Akt activation. Intriguingly both wild type S. typhimurium and a mutant which does not express SigD stimulate both the translocation of Akt to sites of Salmonella-induced membrane ruffles and the association of PI3-K with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Thus another bacterial factor must be involved in the initial activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway upstream of the actions of SigD. Our data indicate that SigD is required for the phosphorylation and activation of Akt after it has been recruited to the cellular membrane. Previously it has been demonstrated that SopB, the S. DublinSigD ortholog (93% amino acid identity), is an inositol phosphatase. Furthermore, both SigD/SopB and the highly homologous S. flexneri effector IpgD contain two motifs also found in mammalian inositol 4-phosphatases (16Norris F.A. Wilson M.P. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14057-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Mutation of a single conserved cysteine residue in one of these motifs abrogates inositol phosphatase activity in all cases (16Norris F.A. Wilson M.P. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14057-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and we found that the equivalent SigD mutant does not induce Akt activation. However, recombinant SopB has broad substrate specificity and dephosphorylates several inositol phosphatases and phosphatidylinositol phosphates including PIP3 and PI(3,4)P 2 (16Norris F.A. Wilson M.P. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14057-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recombinant protein hydrolyzed phosphates at the C-3, -4, -5, and -6 positions. The localization of Akt toSalmonella-induced ruffles indicates that there are high concentrations of PIP3 and/or PI(3,4)P2 in the membrane at these sites (22Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, in vivo, the increased local concentration of 3′-phosphoinositides may be an important determinant for SigD activity and/or substrate specificity especially as translocated SopB/SigD appears to associate with cellular membranes (30Galyov E.E. Wood M.W. Rosqvist R. Mullan P.B. Watson P.R. Hedges S. Wallis T.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Identification of the substrates of SopB/SigD in vivowill help define the roles of PIP3 and PI(3,4)P 2 in Akt activation, which to date are unclear (28Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 31Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 32Frech M. Andjelkovic M. Ingley E. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33922-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is well documented that Akt is a general mediator of survival signals and that Akt is both necessary and sufficient for survival of eukaryotic cells (for review see Ref. 34Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible thatSalmonella-induced activation of Akt in epithelial cells would increase host cell survival, perhaps allowing the pathogen a greater intracellular time frame within which to replicate. Anti-apoptotic mechanisms are employed by at least two intracellular bacterial pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis (35Fan T. Lu H. Hu H. Shi L. McClarty G.A. Nance D.M. Greenberg A.H. Zhong G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) andRickettsia ricketsii (36Clifton D.R. Goss R.A. Sahni S.K. van Antwerp D. Baggs R.B. Marder V.J. Silverman D.J. Sporn L.A. Proc.

In macrophages,Salmonella and other bacterial pathogens includingShigella specifically induce apoptosis (12Hersh D. Monack D.M. Smith M.R. Ghori N. Falkow S. Zychlinsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 37Hilbi H. Moss J.E. Hersh D. Chen Y. Arondel J. Banerjee S. Flavell R.A. Yuan J. Sansonetti P.J. Zychlinsky A. J. Biol.

TheS. typhimurium TTSS effector, SipB, cleaves caspase-1 leading to rapid induction of the apoptotic cascade in macrophages but not in nonphagocytic cells (12Hersh D. Monack D.M. Smith M.R. Ghori N. Falkow S. Zychlinsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). This dichotomy may reflect the specific roles played by different cell types in host cell defense, giving those bacteria that can induce apoptosis in macrophages a distinct advantage in the establishment of infection (38Monack D.M. Hersh D. Ghori N. Bouley D. Zychlinsky A. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). While SigD does not appear to be required for virulence in a mouse model for typhoid fever (18Pfeifer C.G. Marcus S.L. Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Finlay B.B. Infect.

The transcription factor NF-κB, which is activated by S. typhimurium, is an important mediator of inflammation in the intestinal epithelium and also transmits both pro- and anti-apoptotic signals (40Hobbie S. Chen L.M. Davis R.J. Galan J.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5550-5559PubMed Google Scholar, 41Elewaut D. DiDonato J.A. Kim J.M. Truong F. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. J.

Because Akt can regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (43Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 44Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D.

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar), SigD may also regulate NF-κB induction in epithelial cells. Although several bacterial effectors have been shown to interact with eukaryotic signaling molecules this is the first time that one has been shown to activate the Akt pro-survival pathway. While the effects of this activation in pathogenesis remain undefined it is certain that, by targeting this one central mediator of signal transduction,Salmonella have greatly expanded their access to potential cellular targets.

These dominant transcriptional regulatory proteins cause elevated drug resistance and overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene,PDR5. We have carried out a genetic screen to identify negative regulators of PDR5 expression and found that loss of the mitochondrial genome (ρo cells) causes up-regulation of Pdr3p but not Pdr1p function. Additionally, loss of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Oxa1p generates a signal that results in increased Pdr3p activity. Both of these mitochondrial defects lead to increased expression of the PDR3 structural gene. Importantly, the signaling pathway used to enhance Pdr3p function in ρo cells is not the same as in oxa1 cells. Loss of previously described nuclear-mitochondrial signaling genes likeRTG1 reduce the level of PDR5 expression and drug resistance seen in ρo cells but has no effect onoxa1-induced phenotypes.

ATP-binding cassette Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction The appearance of multidrug-resistant cells in human tumors is often associated with overproduction of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 transporter proteins, like Mdr1 or Mrp (1Gottesman M.M.

Loss of normal transcriptional control of these S. cerevisiae ABC transporter protein-encoding genes is frequently associated with single amino acid substitutions within related Cys6-Zn(II) transcription factors designatedPDR1 (9Balzi E.

Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that these substitution mutant forms of Pdr1p (11Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and Pdr3p (10Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) behave as dominant, hyperactive transcriptional regulatory proteins and elicit marked overproduction of target genes like PDR5 andYOR1 (8Katzmann D.J.

Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both Pdr1p and Pdr3p bind to a sequence element referred to as the Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element (PDRE) that is found in the promoter region of all genes responsive to these transcription factors (13Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Importantly, loss of PDR1 orPDR3 does not produce the same phenotypic effect on cells.Δpdr1 cells are extremely sensitive to cycloheximide or oligomycin while Δpdr3 cells are relatively normal in terms of tolerance to these drugs (10Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, loss of both PDR1 and PDR3 causes a pronounced drug sensitivity, much greater than loss of either gene alone. More recent work has demonstrated that Pdr1p but not Pdr3p is positively regulated by a Hsp70-related protein, Pdr13p (15Hallstrom T.C. Katzmann D.J. Torres R.J. Sharp W.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This finding indicated that, while Pdr1p and Pdr3p are 36% identical across their lengths, these proteins are regulated by different mechanisms. Since several different substitution mutations could be isolated that produced hyperactive forms of Pdr1p or Pdr3p, we set out to examine the possibility that these mutant proteins were able to escape negative regulation. To test this hypothesis, we utilized transposon mutagenesis to identify loci that served as negative regulators of PDR5gene expression through reduction of Pdr1p or Pdr3p function. From this screen, three different genes were identified that acted genetically as negative regulators of PDR5 expression and resulting cycloheximide resistance: FZO1, encoding a mitochondrial GTPase required for normal organelle inheritance (16Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar); OXA1, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein involved in biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (17Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); and TIM17, a gene encoding a component of machinery required to import proteins across the inner membrane (18Maarse A.C. Blom J. Keil P. Pfanner N. Meijer M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similar induction of PDR5transcription was found when cells were induced to lose the mitochondrial genome (ρo). These data provide important new insight into the coordination of PDR gene expression with the functional status of the mitochondria and suggest that activation of ABC transporter gene expression may be required for cell viability upon compromise of mitochondrial function. The genotypes of the yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure (19Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

Standard YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) and synthetic complete medium (21Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Transformants were grown and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” A wild-type strain (SEY6210) containing an integrated PDR5-lacZ gene was transformed with a transposon-mutagenized S. cerevisiae genomic library (25Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.-Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) using a high-efficiency protocol. Approximately 5000 transformants were plated on SC (21Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar) plates containing 0.25 μg/ml cycloheximide. 14 transformants were recovered that exhibited elevated cycloheximide resistance. These transformants were then assayed for the level of expression of their integrated PDR5-lacZ reporter gene. Colonies with both elevated β-galactosidase expression and cycloheximide resistance were crossed to a wild-type strain and the resulting diploids subjected to standard genetic analysis. 5 colonies were found in which both the PDR5 overproduction and cycloheximide hyper-resistance phenotypes were linked to the transposon. The locations of transposon insertions in the genome were determined using plasmid rescue as described (25Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.-Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M.

ThePDR5-lacZ gene containing mutations in all three PDREs in the promoter was produced earlier, along with the plasmids carryingPDRE-CYC1-lacZ and mutant PDRE-CYC1-lacZ (13Katzmann D.J.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FZO1 gene, carried on the centromeric pRS416 vector, was obtained from Janet Shaw (16Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). TheATP2 gene (29Takeda M. Vassarotti A. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried on the low-copy vector YCplac22 and was provided by David Bedwell (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). The PDR3-lacZ gene (pTH38) was carried on a low-copy number vector and contains 652 bp of 5′-flanking sequence fromPDR3. The PDR1-lacZ gene (pTH223) contains 600 nucleotides upstream of translation start and was amplified from genomic DNA with the 5′ primer GAGCCTGAATTCCCGGTTGCTTGGACTTTT and the 3′ primer GAGCCTGGATCCATCTTCCAGTTTCTTGGA. The PCR product was cut withBamHI and EcoRI and cloned in-frame withlacZ in the pSEYC102 plasmid (30Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garret J. Geller B.C. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 600 bp of thePDR3 promoter was PCR amplified as aSacI-SacI fragment using the 5′ primer GGATTCGAGCTCACTTGACAGGGCTTCCAA and the 3′ primer GGATCCGAGCTCTGCGGTCACGCAATAAGA and cloned as a SacI fragment upstream of the PDR1 gene with a SacI site just 5′ of translation start. This plasmid (pTH221a) carried thePDR1 gene under control of the PDR3 promoter. The plasmid pTH223 carrying the PDR3 gene under PDR1promoter control was constructed by PCR amplifying 600 nucleotides of the PDR1 promoter with the 5′ primer GTCGGCGTCGACCCGGTTGCTTGGACTTTT and the 3′ primer GTCGG CCCATGGTCCAGTTTCTTGGATTCT. This PCR product was cut withSalI/NcoI and cloned into a plasmid (pDK4) carrying the PDR3 gene with a NcoI site introduced at the start codon. fzo1-Δ1::kanMX4 andrtg1-Δ1::kanMX4 gene disruption strains were obtained from Research Genetics. PCR primers specific for sequences 500 nucleotides upstream and downstream of thekanMX4 gene replacement were used to PCR amplify the locus. The product was used to disrupt the corresponding genes in SEY6210 by homologous recombination and selection on G418-containing plates (31Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). The rtg2-Δ1::his5+ gene disruption was generated following PCR-based protocol (32Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4135) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR primers were designed with 50 bp from either the 5′ or 3′ end of theRTG2 gene and with 16 bp specific for amplification of thehis5+ gene. Thertg2-Δ1::his5+ allele was generated using the 5′ primer GTGTCCTTTACTAAGGATTGTTTTGAACGAAAAGTGTAGGCGTGCCACAACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA and the 3′ primer TATATAAGGATTTCGTATTTATTGTTCAAGTATTTAAAGACTAGATGTCTGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC to PCR amplify the S. pombe his5+ gene carried on the pFA6:HIS5 plasmid (32Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4135) Google Scholar), transforming cells with the PCR product and selecting for strains that grew on plates without histidine. Correct integration in all strains constructed was determined by Southern blotting and PCR amplification techniques. Previous searches for mutants with an enhanced pleiotropic drug resistance phenotype have identified alterations in the genes encoding the zinc finger-containing transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p (see Ref. 33Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar for a review). Characterization of these gain-of-function alleles has shown that these lesions are single amino acid replacements that result in a constitutive elevation in activity of Pdr1p or Pdr3p. One hypothesis, consistent with these data, is that the function of Pdr1p and Pdr3p is subject to some form of negative regulation that is relieved in the mutant alleles. To identify these putative negative regulators and avoid isolation of more single amino acid replacements in the transcription factors, we used transposon mutagenesis to select cells that exhibited both elevated pleiotropic drug resistance and enhanced expression of a Pdr1p/Pdr3p target gene, the ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene, PDR5(5Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2206-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bissinger P.H. Kuchler K. J. Biol.

This screen was carried out by transforming a wild-type strain containing an integrated PDR5-lacZ fusion gene with a yeast genomic library containing random transposon insertions (25Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.-Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Approximately 5000 transformants were grown on selective media containing 0.25 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cycloheximide was included in the plates as an indicator of PDR5 expression, the key target gene for Pdr1p/Pdr3p-mediated cycloheximide resistance (12Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide hyper-resistant colonies were isolated and assayed forPDR5-lacZ-dependent β-galactosidase activity to ensure that PDR5 was also overproduced. The 14 transformants that exhibited both enhanced cycloheximide resistance and overproduction of PDR5 were crossed to an isogenic wild-type strain and subjected to standard genetic analysis to ensure that the increased cycloheximide resistance and PDR5-lacZ expression were linked to a single transposon insertion. Of the 14 recovered strains, 5 isolates were found that exhibited 100% linkage of the transposon to both phenotypes. The site of transposon insertion was determined by plasmid rescue as described (25Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.-Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The five different transposon insertions were found in three different nuclear genes: FZO1, OXA1, andTIM17 (Fig. 1). Three different insertions were found in FZO1, with single isolates found in OXA1 and TIM17. The insertions in FZO1 and OXA1 were all within the coding sequences of these loci while the insertion at TIM17 was found 11 bp downstream of the translation stop for this gene. Each of the genes affected by these transposon insertions is involved in mitochondrial function in S. cerevisiae. Fzo1p spans both mitochondrial membranes, contains a cytoplasmic GTPase domain and is required for normal mitochondrial fusion and maintenance of the mitochondrial genome (16Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Oxa1p spans the inner mitochondrial membrane (34Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and is required for proper assembly of cytochrome coxidase (complex IV) and the ATP synthase (complex V) (35Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Tim17p is a component of the preprotein import machinery of the mitochondrial inner membrane (36Bomer U. Meijer M. Maarse A.C. Honlinger A. Dekker P.J. Pfanner N. Rassow J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2205-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since TIM17 is an essential locus (18Maarse A.C. Blom J. Keil P. Pfanner N. Meijer M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the transposon insertion likely depresses but does not eliminate production of Tim17p. All these mutant strains failed to grow on medium with glycerol/ethanol as the carbon sources, consistent with their predicted defect in mitochondrial function. One concern underlying the isolation of these transposon insertion alleles is the possible production of truncated gene products that could possibly give rise to the observed phenotypes. To ensure that the effects on drug resistance and PDR5 expression seen in these transposon mutants were due to loss of gene function, we constructed two deletion derivatives in which either the entire coding sequence ofFZO1 or a large segment of the OXA1 coding sequence was removed and replaced with kanMX4 or S. cerevisiae HIS3, respectively. The essential role ofTIM17 precluded a similar type of analysis for this locus and the transposon-generated allele was assayed for comparison to the gene deletion alleles of FZO1 and OXA1. These deletion mutants were then tested for drug resistance using medium containing a gradient of increasing concentration of cycloheximide (Fig. 2). Loss of the normal FZO1 or OXA1 coding sequences caused a strong elevation of cycloheximide tolerance. Direct comparisons of the insertion mutations present in the original transposon insertion isolates with the deletion derivatives indicated that all alleles described here of either FZO1 orOXA1 behave identically (data not shown). Throughout this study, these different alleles were used interchangeably to facilitate strain construction. PDR5-dependent β-galactosidase was also assayed to quantitate the effects of these mutants on expression ofPDR5 (Fig. 2). Expression of a gene that is not a member of the Pdr1p/Pdr3p regulon, a gene involved in tryptophan biosynthesis (TRP5 (37Zalkin H. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1491-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), was also assayed as a control for the specificity of the effect of loss of FZO1, OXA1,or TIM17. Wild-type cells carrying a PDR5-lacZ fusion gene produce approximately 72 units/OD of β-galactosidase activity. Expression ofPDR5 increased 4-fold to 308 units/OD upon loss ofOXA1. The Δfzo1 and tim17mutations both led to over a 10-fold increase in PDR5expression generating 834 and 1116 units/OD, respectively.PDR5-lacZ expression in the Δfzo1and tim17 mutant backgrounds is comparable to the highest observed PDR5 expression generated by gain-of-function alleles of Pdr1p and Pdr3p (11Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 38Nourani A. Papajova D. Delahodde A. Jacq C. Subik J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Expression of theTRP5-lacZ gene fusion showed little response to alterations in mitochondrial function, varying from 22 units/OD in the wild-type and oxa1 strains to approximately 13 units/OD of β-galactosidase activity in the Δfzo1 andtim17 backgrounds. While expression of theTRP5 gene is not significantly influenced in this collection of mitochondrial mutant strains, it is possible that compromising the mitochondrial function might elicit stress responses in the cell that would not be expected to alter TRP5 expression. As previous work has suggested that PDR5 may be a stress-responsive gene (39Miyahara K. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that the mutants we isolated that led to PDR5 activation also induced expression of other stress-related genes. We analyzed a variety of stress-responsive genes and found that none exhibited the same level of induction as seen at the PDR5 promoter. The stress genes tested included the cytosolic catalase geneCTT1 (40Hartig A. Ruis H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and a small heat shock protein-encoding locus,HSP12 (41Praekelt U.M. Meacock P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 223: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Both of these genes are regulated by the stress-responsive transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p (42Martinez-Pastor M.T.

Finally, the oxidative stress-regulated genes GSH1 and TRX2 were examined in these different genetic backgrounds. Both GSH1 and TRX2are regulated by the basic region-leucine zipper-containing transcription factor Yap1p and are induced upon oxidative stress in cells (26Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell.

Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Together, this collection of genes represents targets for most of the major stress-responsive transcription factors in the cell. CUP1-lacZ expression increased 2-fold in an oxa1background and 300% in the Δfzo1 andtim17 backgrounds (Fig. 2). HSP12-lacZ expression increased 2-fold in the Δfzo1 andtim17 strains but was unchanged in the presence of theoxa1 strain. CTT1-lacZ, GSH1-lacZ, andTRX2-lacZ expression was unaffected by any of the mutant backgrounds. The 2–3-fold increase in CUP1 andHSP12 expression was consistent with the generation of a mild stress response upon loss of the normal function of eitherFZO1 or TIM17.

AlthoughO-glycosidases are ubiquitous, myrosinase is the only knownS-glycosidase. Its active site is very similar to that of retaining O-glycosidases, but one of the catalytic residues in O-glycosidases, a carboxylate residue functioning as the general base, is replaced by a glutamine residue. Myrosinase is strongly activated by ascorbic acid. Several binary and ternary complexes of myrosinase with different transition state analogues and ascorbic acid have been analyzed at high resolution by x-ray crystallography along with a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucosyl enzyme intermediate. One of the inhibitors, d-gluconhydroximo-1,5-lactam, binds simultaneously with a sulfate ion to form a mimic of the enzyme-substrate complex. Ascorbate binds to a site distinct from the glucose binding site but overlapping with the aglycon binding site, suggesting that activation occurs at the second step of catalysis,i.e. hydrolysis of the glycosyl enzyme. A water molecule is placed perfectly for activation by ascorbate and for nucleophilic attack on the covalently trapped 2-fluoro-glucosyl-moiety. Activation of the hydrolysis of the glucosyl enzyme intermediate is further evidenced by the observation that ascorbate enhances the rate of reactivation of the 2-fluoro-glycosyl enzyme, leading to the conclusion that ascorbic acid substitutes for the catalytic base in myrosinase.

They constitute a large family ofS-glucosides that differ by their aglycon (Ref. 1Fenwick G.R. Heaney R.K. Mullin W.J CRC Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1983; 18: 123-201Crossref Scopus (1185) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 a). The same plants produce myrosinase (thioglucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.3.1), an S-glucosidase hydrolyzing glucosinolates. Myrosinase and glucosinolates are stored in different compartments of the plant, especially in the seeds. Mixing of enzyme and substrate (for example through mastication) induces glucosinolate hydrolysis. The biological function of myrosinase and glucosinolates is only partly elucidated; it has been suggested that they represent a defense system of the plant. Glucosinolates may as well serve to store inactive precursors of hormones such as 3-indolylacetic acid. 3-Indolyl acetonitrile and related indoles (2Gmelin R. Virtanen A.I Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. A. 1961; 11: 3-25Google Scholar) are released from indolyl glucosinolates by myrosinase (3Bones A.M. Rossiter J Physiol. Plant. 1996; 97: 1194-1208Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Cleavage of indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (glucobrassicin) by myrosinase in the presence of ascorbic acid produces ascorbigen, a condensation product of ascorbic acid with 3-hydroxymethylindole (4Kiss G. Neukom H Mitt. Geb. Lebensm. Hyg. 1966; 57: 443-448Google Scholar). Thus, the myrosinase system could be involved in the storage and in the inactivation of ascorbic acid. A detailed review on myrosinase is given by Bones and Rossiter (3Bones A.M. Rossiter J Physiol.

Henrissat B. Driguez H Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15256-15259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Retaining glycosidases operate by a double displacement at the anomeric center promoted by two carboxylic residues acting as acid/base and as nucleophile, respectively. In the first step (glycosylation), the glycosidic oxygen is protonated by the carboxyl group acting as general acid, whereas the second catalytic residue, a carboxylate group, performs a nucleophilic attack at the anomeric carbon. A glycosyl enzyme intermediate with inverted anomeric configuration is formed via a transition state featuring a (more or less) planar (trigonal) anomeric carbon. In the second step (deglycosylation), the carboxylate group corresponding to the catalytic acid residue activates a water molecule that attacks at C-1 of the glycosyl enzyme to yield the hemiacetal and the free enzyme, againvia a transition state with a trigonal anomeric carbon (6McCarter J.D. Withers S.G Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Many carbohydrate derivatives with a planar anomeric carbon and a half-chair or a distorted half-chair conformation inhibit glycosidases. Three such inhibitors, d-glucono-1,5-lactone (Refs. 7Conchie J. Gelman A.L. Levvy G.A Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 8Levvy G.A. Snaith S.M Adv.

Ed. 1999; 38: 750-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myrosinase belongs to family 1 of the glycoside hydrolases (13Henrissat B. Bairoch A Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 14Henrissat B. Bairoch A Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 15Davies G.J. Henrissat B Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar) but is an unusual member of this family in that it lacks the acid/base residue in its active site. Although classical glycosidases activate the glycosidic oxygen by the catalytic acid residue in the glycosylation step, no such activation appears necessary nor indeed possible for myrosinase. Once the glycosyl enzyme intermediate is formed, the glutamine residue that replaces the catalytic glutamate residue of the classical β-glucosidases ensures the correct positioning of a water molecule, without deprotonating it. This positioning is sufficient to allow hydrolysis of the glycosyl enzyme intermediate and the release of the products (16Burmeister W.P. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Iori R. Palmieri S. Henrissat B Structure. 1997; 5: 663-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate of β-glycosidases can be trapped using substrates that are fluorinated at C-2 (i.e.adjacent to the scissile glycosidic bond) and that carry an aglycon with good leaving group ability (17Withers S.G. Rupitz K. Street I.P J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7929-7932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Withers S.G. Warren R.A.J. Street I.P. Rupitz K. Kempton J. Aebersold R J. Am. Chem.

Biol. 1999; 294: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 f). Even though myrosinase shows considerable activity in absence ofl-ascorbic acid, its activity is enhanced by ascorbate, as first described by Nagashima and Uchiyama (22Nagashima Z. Uchiyama M J. Agric. Chem. Soc. Japan. 1959; 33: 980-984Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this activation stems from an optimal effect byl-ascorbate compared with its derivatives (23Ettlinger M.G. Dateo G.P. Harrison B.W. Mabry T.J. Thompson C.P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzyme has evolved to work with the naturally occurringl-ascorbate. A physiological role of the activation by ascorbate is further evidenced by the ascorbate concentration needed for optimal activation of about 1.5 mm, in the range of the global ascorbate concentration in the concerned plant tissues,e.g. 2 mm in horseradish root (24Grob K. Matile P Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1980; 98: 235-243Crossref Google Scholar). Ascorbic acid is stored in the vacuoles of plant cells (25Matile P Biochem. Physiol. Pflanzen. 1980; 175: 722-731Crossref Google Scholar) where the local concentration is much higher (24Grob K. Matile P Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1980; 98: 235-243Crossref Google Scholar). A 25-fold increase of the enzymatic activity of Brassica juncea seed myrosinase on the natural substrate sinigrin upon addition of 1 mm ascorbic acid has been found (26Tsuruo I. Hata T Agric. Biol. Chem. 1967; 31: 27-32Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Ohtsuru M. Hata T Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ettlinger et al. (23Ettlinger M.G. Dateo G.P. Harrison B.W. Mabry T.J. Thompson C.P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) observed a 400-fold acceleration of the reaction rate for a crude myrosinase preparation fromSinapis alba grains upon addition of ascorbate, using sinigrin as the substrate. Variable degrees of activation, ranging from 1.8- to 11-fold depending on the source of myrosinase (Brassica napus, Brassica campestris, andS. alba), the isoenzyme used, and the substrate have been reported by Björkman and Lönnerdal (28Björkman R. Lönnerdal B Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 327: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These authors also found an increase in Km upon activation by ascorbate and concluded that the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex was reduced, presumably because of an increase in the rate constant for the formation of the product. More recently, Shikita et al. (29Shikita M. Fahey J.W. Golden T.R. Holtzclaw D. Talalay P Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described a 140-fold increase of Vmax in the presence of 0.5 mm ascorbate for the cleavage of sinigrin by myrosinase from Raphanus sativus. This increase inVmax was paralleled by an increase ofKm, an observation that has been interpreted as the result of a noncompetitive activation, because of binding of ascorbate to the enzyme-substrate complex. All the authors quoted above noticed the dual behavior of ascorbate, which activates myrosinase at 0.1–1.0 mm and acts as a competitive inhibitor at higher concentrations, typically above 1.5 mm. Ettlinger et al. (23Ettlinger M.G. Dateo G.P. Harrison B.W. Mabry T.J. Thompson C.P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have studied the specificity of myrosinase activation by different derivatives ofl-ascorbate, concluding that an acidic group is essential for the activation and that activation is independent of the reducing property of ascorbate. These investigators suggested that ascorbate plays the role of the catalytic acid/base. We have initiated a program to analyze the details of the mechanism of action of myrosinase and the effect of l-ascorbate using a myrosinase from white mustard (S. alba) grains. This enzyme is a dimer with a mass of 130 kDa, of which 30 kDa are due to glycosylation (16Burmeister W.P. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Iori R. Palmieri S. Henrissat B Structure. 1997; 5: 663-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A detailed view on the enzymatic mechanism of myrosinase is derived from high resolution (1.2–1.6 Å) x-ray crystal structure analysis of binary and ternary complexes of myrosinase with inhibitors mimicking the transition state, with ascorbic acid, and with the stable 2-fluoro-glucosyl enzyme intermediate. 2-F-GTL1(Fig. 1 b) was synthesized as described previously (30Cottaz S. Rollin P. Driguez H Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 298: 127-130Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). d-Glucono-1,5-lactone (Fig. 1 c) and ascorbic acid (Fig. 1 g) were purchased from Sigma. Gluco-tetrazole (Fig. 1 d) and gluco-hydroximolactam (Fig. 1 e) were synthesized as described (9Ermert P. Vasella A Helv. Chim. Acta. 1991; 74: 2043-2053Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Hoos R. Naughton A.B. Thiel W. Vasella A. Weber W Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 2666-2678Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). C-GTL, the C-glycosidic analogue of glucotropaeolin (Fig. 1 h), was synthesized as a mixture of Z- and E-stereoisomers as described earlier (31Aucagne V. Gueyrard D. Tatibouët A. Quinsac A. Rollin P Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 2647-2654Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Myrosinase crystals were prepared as described (16Burmeister W.P. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Iori R. Palmieri S. Henrissat B Structure. 1997; 5: 663-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using ammonium sulfate as precipitant. The purified myrosinase remained suitable for crystallization after storage for 3 years at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.5. For cryoprotection, a crystal was transferred to a solution containing 66% (v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate, 100 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Before freezing in a nitrogen stream at 100 K, the crystal was dipped for a few seconds into a solution containing 20% glycerol. For some trials glycerol was replaced by ethylene glycol. The inhibitors were bound by soaking crystals in artificial mother liquor containing the compound. To obtain the 2-fluoro-glucosyl enzyme, the native crystals were soaked overnight with 2.5 mm 2-F-GTL as the hydrolysis of this compound is slow. For the ternary complex with 2-F-GTL and ascorbate, the ascorbate was introduced subsequently in the cryoprotectant containing 10% glycerol. Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) on experimental station ID14-3 using a 133-mm MarCCD detector or on ID14-1 using a Mar345 detector (gluconolactone data set). Data were processed with MOSFLM (32Leslie A.G.W. Wolf W.M. Wilson K.S. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EADBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography , no. 26. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar) and the CCP4 package (33Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Time-dependent reactivation of the 2-fluoro-glucosyl enzyme covalent intermediate in absence or in presence of ascorbic acid was determined essentially as described previously (5Cottaz S. Henrissat B. Driguez H Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15256-15259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Myrosinase was inactivated with 2.5 mm2-F-GTL (30Cottaz S. Rollin P. Driguez H Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 298: 127-130Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for 18 h at 40 °C, followed by four successive ultrafiltrations on Nanosep 30 kDa (Pall Filtron Corp.) to remove the excess of inactivator. The inactivated enzyme was incubated at 25 °C without or with ascorbic acid (at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mm), and reactivation was monitored using aliquots (20 μl) from the solutions of inactivated enzyme at appropriate time intervals. The samples were assayed by usingp-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (36Botti M.G. Taylor M.G. Botting N.P J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20530-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as the substrate, following the variation of absorbance at 430 nm (λ = 7002 m−1·cm−1 for 4-nitrophenol). First-order rate constants (kreact) were determined by fitting the recovered activity as a function of time. The inhibition constants for gluco-tetrazole and gluco-hydroximolactam have been determined with sinigrin as substrate. The hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled enzyme system was used to assay myrosinase activity by measuring glucose release, following the variation of absorbance at 340 nm (37Wilkinson A.P. Rhodes M.J.C. Fenwick G.R Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Myrosinase was preincubated at 34 °C (10 μl at appropriate dilution) in the absence or presence of inhibitor (38 μl at final concentrations of 0.4, 0.8, and 2 mm for the gluco-tetrazole and 0.125, 0.5, and 1 mm for the gluco-hydroximolactam). Reactions were initiated by addition of substrate (332 μl at final concentration of 0.17, 0.24, 0.35, and 0.7 mm in 50 mm Mes buffer, pH 6.5, containing 3 mm MgCl2, 0.55 mm ATP, 0.72 mm NADP, 0.56 unit/ml hexokinase, and 0.35 unit/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). Kinetic data were fitted to a competitive inhibition model (38Dixon M. Webb E.C Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Longmans, London1964: 92-100Google Scholar). All reagents were purchased from Sigma. Three established or putative transition state analogues, gluco-tetrazole, d-glucono-1,5-lactone, and gluco-hydroximolactam were soaked into the crystals. The resulting electron densities (Fig. 2,a–c) show that the three inhibitors bind similarly, with all hydroxyl groups involved in identical hydrogen bonds. This recognition is similar to that observed for the 2-fluoro-glucosyl enzyme intermediate (Fig. 2 d), except that the three inhibitors display a somewhat distorted half-chair conformation, whereas the glucose ring in the 2-fluoro-glycosyl enzyme has a clear4 C1 chair conformation (Fig. 3). d-Glucono-1,5-lactone binds in a distorted half-chair conformation (Fig. 3) with O-1 of the lactone in van der Waals' contact with Oε1 of Gln 187 (Fig. 2 a). The binding ofd-glucono-1,5-lactone with full occupancy at a concentration of 20 mm in the active site at the exact position of the glucose moiety of the substrate is in contradiction with the experiments by Botti et al. (36Botti M.G. Taylor M.G. Botting N.P J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20530-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), who concluded that the d-glucono-1,5-lactone is a noncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki of 5 mm. The inhibition constants for gluco-tetrazole (Ki = 0.7 mm) and gluco-hydroximolactam (Ki = 0.6 mm) were determined using sinigrin as substrate (data not shown). The gluco-tetrazole binds in a pure half-chair conformation (Figs. 2 b and 3). There is a hydrogen bond from Gln187 Oε1 to N1 of the tetrazole for which there is no equivalent for the gluconolactone inhibitor. This hydrogen bond is in the plane of the tetrazole moiety and may explain why the gluco-tetrazole inhibitor is bound at a slightly higher position in the active site than the other inhibitors. It is noteworthy that the residue equivalent to myrosinase Gln187 in relatedO-glucosidases, such as the cyanogenic β-glucosidase from white clover (39Barrett T. Suresh C.G. Tolley S.P. Dodson E.J. Hughes M.A Structure. 1995; 3: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), is the catalytic acid/base glutamate that would be in an appropriate position for an “in plane” protonation of the substrate as predicted by Heightman and Vasella (12Heightman T.D. Vasella A.T Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 750-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the complex with gluco-hydroximolactam shows a slightly distorted half-chair conformation for the inhibitor (Fig. 3). In addition to the inhibitor, a sulfate ion was found bound in the active site. This sulfate ion forms salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to Arg259 Nη2, Gln187 Nε2, and the hydroxyl group of the hydroximo group (Fig. 2 c). The N1 nitrogen atom of this group is in van der Waals' contact with the oxygen Oε1 of the carbonyl group of Gln187. Several, albeit unsuccessful, experiments have been undertaken to observe substrate binding directly. The diastereomeric mixture of C-GTL (Fig. 1 h) did not inhibit at concentrations up to 20 mm (enzyme assays; data not shown), nor did it bind in the crystal at concentrations of up to 100 mm. We also attempted to take advantage of the slow hydrolysis of 2-F-GTL by myrosinase and to trap the enzyme-substrate complex using flash freezing of the crystals. Cottaz et al. (5Cottaz S. Henrissat B. Driguez H Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15256-15259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) determined inactivation parameters Ki of 0.9 mm andki of 0.083 min−1 for 2-F-GTL. These data suggest that it should be possible to observe the enzyme-substrate complex. A number of experiments using different soaking times (5–20 min) and different pH values of the buffer (pH 4.2–6.5) did not lead to the observation of any electron density corresponding to the substrate analogue. The nonglucosylation of Glu409 confirms that myrosinase is only very slowly inactivated by 2-F-GTL. To study the intriguing activation of myrosinase by ascorbate, myrosinase crystals were soaked with ascorbate alone. Omit maps showed clearly the presence of ascorbate together with a glycerol molecule in the active site (Fig. 4 a). Ascorbate is recognized by a salt bridge between Arg259Nε and the O-1 oxygen and by a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group at position 2 and Arg259 Nη2. O-3 forms a hydrogen bond with Nε2 of Gln187 (Fig. 4 a). A portion of the ascorbic acid molecule is located in the hydrophobic pocket, which binds the hydrophobic part of the glucosinolates. This pocket is formed by the residues Ile257, Phe331, Tyr330, Phe371, and Phe473, which are invariant in the nine known myrosinase sequences with exception of Phe331. Another conserved residue, Arg194 (Lys in one sequence), is not directly in contact but may play an electrostatic role. The binding of ascorbate is remarkably similar to the binding of the sulfate ion in the gluco-hydroximolactam inhibitor structure. A soak with a mixture of gluco-hydroximolactam and ascorbic acid showed that there is indeed competition between the binding of sulfate and ascorbate. The structure shows a partial occupancy for ascorbate (q = 0.6) and for sulfate (q= 0.4) (Fig. 4 b). Two of the oxygen atoms of the sulfate ion are in positions similar to O-2 and O-3 of ascorbate, interacting with Nε2 of Gln187 and Arg259 Nη2. From their common position, it is obvious that ascorbate and the intact substrate cannot bind together in the active site. However, the presence of both ascorbate and gluco-hydroximolactam (Fig. 4 b) or of ascorbate in the 2-fluoro-glucosyl enzyme (Fig. 4 c) shows that ascorbate can bind once the aglycon of the substrate has diffused away. In the presence of the 2-fluoro-glucosyl group or of the gluco-hydroximolactam, a hydrogen bonds is formed between the O-6 hydroxyl group of glucose and the O-6 hydroxyl group of ascorbic acid (Fig. 4, b and c). Ascorbate is placed ideally to act as a catalytic base and to activate a water molecule, substituting for the general acid/base in the canonical mechanism of retaining glycoside hydrolases. Such a water molecule is visible in Fig. 4 c. It is bound at a distance of 2.56 Å to O-3 of ascorbate, whereas the distance to the C-1 atom of the 2-fluoro-glucosyl enzyme is 3.22 Å. The water molecule is placed 3.70 and 3.99 Å away from Gln187 Nε2 and Oε1, respectively, making a contribution of this residue unlikely. In the 2-fluoro-glucosyl enzyme and in the absence of ascorbate, the water molecule is closer to Gln187 (3.27 and 2.79 Å away from Nε2 and Oε1, respectively) and 3.40 Å from C-1 of the glucose ring. The activation of the hydrolysis of the glucosyl enzyme by ascorbate has been verified using the 2-F-GTL-inactivated enzyme. In the absence of ascorbate, half-reactivation required 53 h. Addition of 1 mm ascorbate resulted in a 14-fold activation, shortening the half-reactivation time to 3.6 h (Fig. 5) and demonstrating that activation concerns hydrolysis of the glucosyl enzyme. The good affinity displayed by the transition state analogous inhibitors (gluco-tetrazole and gluco-hydroximolactam) is in agreement with the hypothesis that the reaction mecha"

IKKα and IKKβ share significant sequence homology and contain three identical structural domains, namely a protein kinase domain at their N termini, a leucine zipper (LZ) and a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif at their C termini. IKKγ does not contain a catalytic domain and is composed of three large α-helical regions, including a leucine zipper.Purified recombinant IKKα and IKKβ are both able to phosphorylate IκBα and IκBβ and can form homo- and heterodimers through their LZ motifs. Mutations interfering with this dimerization abolish kinase activity (11Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Moreover, IKK complexes assembled in vivo in cells expressing a truncated IKKγ lacking its C-terminal LZ were not responsive to cytokine-mediated activation (13Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). These results clearly highlight the importance of IKKγ in the activation of NF-κB and suggest that the C-terminal region of this protein is necessary for engagement by upstream activators. However, the mechanism by which the IKK complex is activated remains to be elucidated.TNFα induces NF-κB activation through binding to two distinct receptors, p55 TNF-R1 and p75 TNF-R2, which are expressed in almost all cell types (25Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4304-4307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of the TNF receptors by TNFα promotes the assembly of two distinct signaling complexes via recruitment of different signaling proteins to the cytoplasmic tails of TNF-R1 and TNF-R2. Among these proteins TRADD, TRAF2, RIP, and FADD (26Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 27Hsu H.

However, the events following assembly of the TNF-R1 or TNF-R2 complexes that lead to activation of the IKK complex need to be addressed.Recently, NEMO/IKKγ has been shown to interact with RIP (15Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Ye J. Xie X.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), an adapter protein that associates with the p55 receptor. RIP contains three major domains: a kinase domain at its N terminus, an intermediate domain, and a death domain at its C terminus. The use of RIP-deficient cell lines has highlighted the indispensable role of RIP in the p55 TNFα receptor-induced NF-κB activation (38Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 39Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Whereas RIP possesses a serine/threonine kinase domain capable of autophosphorylation, the kinase activity of RIP is not required for NF-κB activation (27Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 38Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) Indeed, expression of a RIP mutant consisting of only its intermediate domain is sufficient to activate NF-κB (27Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Zhang and co-workers (37Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the intermediate domain of RIP is the region involved in the binding of this protein to IKKγ. It seems therefore possible that the role of RIP could be that of a signaling molecule in the TNFα signaling pathway, recruiting and channeling the signal from the TNF-R complex to the IKK complex.Here we investigated the potential role of oligomerization in activation of the IKK complex. We show that the IKK complex undergoes oligomerization in response to TNFα stimulation and that RIP may regulate the activity of the IKK complex through oligomerization of IKKγ. Other evidence presented here demonstrate that IKKγ-mediated oligomerization of the IKK complex or enforced oligomerization of any of the IKK components is sufficient to activate the IKK kinase complex and the NF-κB pathway.DISCUSSIONThe cellular response to TNFα depends on cell type and the presence of specific signaling molecules. Engagement of the TNF receptors, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, leads to the activation of two competing pathways: a pro-apoptotic pathway and an anti-apoptotic pathway (49Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic pathway, which involves the activation of NF-κBvia the IKK complex, is known to be initiated by recruitment of adaptor and effector molecules like TRADD, RIP, and TRAF proteins on the trimerized TNF receptors. Very recently RIP has been shown to bind to IKKγ in a stimulus-dependent manner (37Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, its is not yet clear how interaction of RIP with IKKγ could result in activation of the IKK complex.A potential model that could explain how the IKK complex is activated after TNF-R1 ligation is activation by oligomerization. In support of this model, we have shown that following TNFα stimulation, the IKK complex undergoes a structural change that leads to a significant increase in its molecular mass, as observed using gel filtration. Interestingly, only the highest molecular weight complexes possessed IKK activity. This molecular mass increase could not be attributed to a stimulus-dependent, stable association of the IKK complex with the TNF receptor components, because these eluted in later fractions. Moreover, although a small amount of the IKK complex co-eluted with the activated TNF-R1 components in some fractions, no IKK activity was associated with these fractions. A previous study also reported that the activity of the IKK kinases found in the TNF-R1 complex after immunoprecipitation with a TNF-R1-specific antibody was significantly less than that found in the IKK complex after direct immunoprecipitation with an IKKγ specific antibody after TNF stimulation (37Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), suggesting that the released and oligomerized IKK complex is the active form of IKK. Thus, prior to TNF stimulation, the IKK components exist as a ∼650-kDa heteromeric complex of IKKγ, IKKβ, and IKKα. Following TNF stimulation, TNF-R1-bound RIP recruits this IKK complex through interaction with IKKγ and induces its oligomerization. This oligomerization results in activation of the IκB kinases. The activated, high molecular mass ∼1.3 MDa′ IKK complex is then released from the TNF receptor and is able to phosphorylate the IκB proteins.Because IKKγ has been shown to interact with the intermediate domain of RIP (37Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), it is therefore conceivable that the death domain of RIP functions as a receptor docking domain and an oligomerizer of the intermediate domain, which in turn could induce clustering-dependent activation of the associated IKK complex upon receptor trimerization. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that enforced oligomerization of the intermediate domain of RIP can activate the IKK complex and NF-κB. Moreover, using rat embryonic fibroblasts lacking IKKγ, we demonstrated that IKKγ is essential for NF-κB activation by the oligomerized RIP intermediate domain. These results suggest that TNFα signal transduction involves oligomerization of the intermediate domain of RIP, which promotes activation of the proximal IKK complex, and that IKKγ is required to transduce this activation signal.The C-terminal half of IKKγ interacts with the intermediate NF-κB effector domain of RIP, whereas its N-terminal half interacts with IKKα and IKKβ. Tax, another known activator of the IκB kinases, has also been shown to activate the IKK complex by interacting with the C-terminal part of IKKγ (36Ye J. Xie X. Tarassishin L. Horwitz M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9882-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the N-terminal half of IKKγ constitutes the effector domain of this molecule, whereas the C-terminal domain is likely to function as an oligomerization domain whose major role, after connection to upstream activator like RIP, is to induce clustering-dependent activation of IKKs (Fig. 8). This hypothesis was tested using several C-terminally truncated IKKγ fused to a 3-fold repeat of the oligomerization cassette FKBP12. The first 200 N-terminal residues constituted the minimal sequence required for IKK and NF-κB activation following oligomerization with AP1510. Thus, clustering of the N-terminal effector domain of IKKγ is sufficient for activation of the downstream IKKs.Because AP1510 may induce extensive oligomerization of the IKK complex, which might be taken as a nonphysiological stimulus, it was therefore important to validate our observations, to examine the effect of a more “physiological” oligomerization of IKKγ. For this purpose, we constructed a DR4ΔDD-IKKγ () chimera, where the cytoplasmic DD of DR4 (TRAIL-R1) was replaced with the first 200 residues of IKKγ, and tested its ability to induce IKK and NF-κB activation following TRAIL stimulation. Like TNFα, the biologically active form of TRAIL is a homotrimer as suggested by its crystal structure (46Cha S.S. Kim M.S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.J. Shin N.K. Shin H.C. Sung Y.C. Oh B.H.

It is therefore reasonable to assume that trimerization of DR4 by its ligand constitutes a physiological transmembrane signaling. Interestingly, ligation of the DR4ΔDD-IKKγ () chimera induced NF-κB as well as IKK activation in the IKKγ-deficient 5R cells (Fig. 4). Importantly, this activation was comparable or superior in magnitude to the one obtained using the IKKγ-FKBP12 chimeras. This result shows that regulated clustering of the N-terminal effector domain of IKKγ is sufficient for activation of the downstream IKKs and that the upstream activation signal must be relayed to the IKKs through the N terminus of IKKγ.Previous studies showed that IKKγ is associated with IKKα and IKKβ in unstimulated cells (12Yamaoka S.

Because IKKγ may oligomerize by binding to RIP, this interaction induces activation of the kinases perhaps via oligomerization. Interestingly, direct oligomerization of either IKKα or IKKβ by SCD deletion mutants fused to the inducible FKBP12 oligomerization cassette activated both kinases. Based on this we postulate that the function of IKKγ is to transmit the upstream oligomerization signal to the IKKs through its interaction with their SCDs. Given that IKKγ is physically associated with the SCD of IKKs, any stimulus that could induce oligomerization of IKKγ would also lead to oligomerization of the IKKs themselves. Consistent with this, we found that the SCD of IKKα or IKKβ are potent dominant negative inhibitors of TNFα- and RIP-induced NF-κB activation, perhaps because of their ability to block the sites of interactions between IKKγ and the IKKs. Moreover, SCD-truncated IKKα or IKKβ were unable to be activated following TNF stimulation, demonstrating that the SCD plays an essential role in transmitting the activation signal to the kinases.Activation of the IKK complex depends on phosphorylation of IKKα/β, because treatment of the purified activated IKK complex with the protein phosphatase 2A results in its inactivation (9DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Phospho-peptide mapping of IKKβ revealed that phosphorylation occurs at serines 177 and 181 located in the T-loop and in the SCD (40Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In the case of IKKβ, conversion of the two phosphoacceptors Ser177 and Ser181 to alanines prevents its activation, whereas conversion to phospho-mimetic glutamate residues causes its constitutive activation (40Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of these serines is essential for activation. However, it is not known whether this phosphorylation is due to the action of an upstream kinase or to autophosphorylation. Three kinases, NIK, MEKK1, and Akt (19Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C.

Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), have been proposed to regulates NF-κB activation. However, very recent observations raise doubts about their involvement in the physiological regulation of IKK activation (40Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 52Israel A. Trends Cell.

Henson P. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7272-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because direct oligomerization of the SCD-truncated IKKs in the absence of any other stimuli induces activation of these kinases, we believe that oligomerization triggers autophosphorylation of the T-loop serines. This process could be explained by the proximity model of activation. IKKs have low basal kinase activity in the unphosphorylated ∼650-kDa IKK complex. Oligomerization could change the conformation of IKKs bringing the T-loop serines of one precursor molecule in close proximity to the kinase active site of an adjacent molecule resulting in autophosphorylation of the T-loop in trans (Fig. 8). Once the T-loop serines are phosphorylated, the IKKs become fully active. In support of this model, we demonstrated that mutations of the T-loop serines to alanine inhibit oligomerization-induced activation of the IKKs. Furthermore, overexpression of native IKKα or IKKβ in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells has been shown to lead to their activation in the absence of extracellular stimuli, and this activity was abolished when mutations preventing LZ-mediated dimerization were introduced (11Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 24Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result can be explained by postulating that overexpression of IKKα or IKKβ results in their oligomerization and autophosphorylation, thereby mimicking IKKγ-induced oligomerization after cytokine treatment. In our case, direct oligomerization of the IKK kinases bypasses the initial steps in TNFα signaling, resulting in IKK autophosphorylation, activation, and induction of NF-κB.Although we have provided strong evidence that oligomerization of the IKK complex plays an important role in its activation, we cannot ignore the possibility that other mechanisms of activation might also be important. Direct phosphorylation of IKKα/β by other kinases such NIK, MEKK1, or Akt could also activate the IKK complex, providing a second level of regulation to this important survival pathway. In unstimulated cells, the transcription factor NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with inhibitory proteins known as IκBs (1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines like TNFα, IκBs undergo phosphorylation at specific serine residues by kinases known as IκB kinases (IKKs).1 Phosphorylation marks IκBs for ubiquitination and degradation via the proteosome pathway (2Brown K.

This finding prompted us to investigate whether MCL1, in addition to its anti-apoptotic function, has an effect on cell cycle progression. A bromodeoxyuridine uptake assay showed that the overexpression of MCL1 significantly inhibited the cell cycle progression through the S-phase. The S-phase of the cell cycle is also known to be regulated by PCNA. A mutant of MCL1 that lacks PCNA binding (MCL1Δ4A) could not inhibit cell cycle progression as effectively as wild type MCL1. In contrast, MCL1Δ4A retained its anti-apoptotic function in HeLa cells when challenged by Etoposide. In addition, the intracellular localization of MCL1Δ4A was identical to that of wild type MCL1. An in vitro pull-down assay suggested that MCL1 is the only Bcl-2 family protein to interact with PCNA. In fact, MCL1, not other Bcl-2 family proteins, contained the PCNA-binding motif described previously.

The integrated molecular mechanism to control apoptosis and cell cycle progression, namely the existence of regulatory molecule(s) that interface between apoptosis and cell cycle progression, has been implicated and extensively investigated. One such protein participating in the regulation of both apoptosis and cell cycle progression is p53, a tumor suppresser protein. Intriguingly, p53 transcriptionally activates both p21Waf1/Cip1, a cell cycle inhibitor (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar), and pro-apoptosis genes, such as bax (2Miyashita T. Reed J.C.

Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). The p21Waf1/Cip1 is a dual cell cycle inhibitor, functioning as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 and of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activation ofbax, noxa, fas, and p53-inducible genes causes cells to undergo apoptosis (2Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 3Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N.

Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which p53 preferentially activates genes related to either cell cycle progression or apoptosis induction is unclear, an emerging body of evidence suggests that the phosphorylation of p53 plays a critical role in the selective activation of certain genes by inducing the distinctive conformational change to and modifying the binding site preference of p53 (6Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Another example of molecules that participate both in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation is the E2F (7Field S. Tsai F. Kuo F. Zubiaga A. Kaelin Jr., W. Livingston D. Orkin S. Greenberg M. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) family proteins. Transcription factors of the E2F family, composed of E2F-1-E2F-5, have been suggested to play a key role in the regulation of cell cycle progression (8Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Importantly, E2F transcriptionally activates both genes that regulate the S-phase entry, including c-myc (9Hiebert S.W. Lipp M. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3594-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), cyclin D (10Sala A. Nicolaides N.C. Engelhard A. Bellon T. Lawe D.C. Arnold A. Grana X. Giordano A. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1402-1406PubMed Google Scholar), cyclin E (11DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), and genes related to DNA synthesis, including dihydrofolate reductase (12Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), thymidine kinase (13Dou Q.P. Markell P.J. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3256-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and DNA polymerase α (10Sala A. Nicolaides N.C. Engelhard A. Bellon T. Lawe D.C. Arnold A. Grana X. Giordano A. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1402-1406PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its cell cycle regulatory function, E2F-1, one of the E2F family proteins, also functions as an apoptosis regulator. The overexpression of E2F-1 triggers apoptosis. The E2F-1−/− mice exhibit an excess of mature T cells due to a defect in thymocyte apoptosis (7Field S. Tsai F. Kuo F. Zubiaga A. Kaelin Jr., W. Livingston D. Orkin S. Greenberg M. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Taken together, E2F family proteins may function as both apoptosis and cell cycle regulators. Still another example of the integrated control of apoptosis and cell cycle progression is Survivin, one of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family members (14Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar). Originally, Survivin was found to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis upon cytokine deprivation (14Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that Survivin was highly up-regulated in the G2/M-phase of the cell cycle (15Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Survivin was found to be associated with microtubules and sustained cell survival during the G2/M-phase (15Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Thus, Survivin functions as a cell cycle regulatory protein and as an apoptosis inhibitor. The above evidence, along with other evidence, suggests that the molecules that regulate apoptosis can participate in the cell cycle regulation and vice versa. It is possible that proteins originally thought to regulate apoptosis may also have a role in cell cycle regulation. The B-cell lymphoma-leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) protein family represents one of the major groups of apoptosis regulatory proteins, sharing the same structural characteristics (16Cleary M.L. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1986; 47: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). At least 15 Bcl-2 family members have been identified in mammalian cells (18Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarities, Bcl-2 family members can either facilitate cell survival (pro-survival Bcl-2 subfamily) or promote cell death (pro-apoptosis Bax and Bcl-2 homologous 3 subfamilies) (18Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). MCL1 (myeloidcell leukemia 1) is a 37.3-kDa protein originally cloned from a differentiating myeloid leukemia 1 cell line (19Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Structurally and functionally, MCL1 belongs to the pro-survival Bcl-2 subfamily (20Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that also includes Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w (18Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). However, MCL1 possesses two unique features that make it outstanding among the pro-survival Bcl-2 subfamily proteins. First, MCL1 is inducible upon proliferative (21Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C.F. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson Jr., J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) and differentiating (19Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) stimuli. Second, the half-life of MCL1 is short (19Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 21Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C.F. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson Jr., J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) most likely because MCL1 contains two PEST sequences (22Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). These PEST sequences are not present in other Bcl-2 family proteins (19Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W.

Interestingly, the PEST sequence is present in a number of cell cycle proteins, including cyclin D1, E (23Langenfeld J. Kiyokawa H. Sekula D. Boyle J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In order to investigate the mechanism of action and the potentially undiscovered functions of MCL1, we screened a human HeLa cell library with a yeast two-hybrid system using MCL1 as bait. Here we report a specific interaction between MCL1, an anti-apoptotic protein and a cell cycle regulatory protein, PCNA (28Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In this report, we propose that MCL1 is not only an anti-apoptotic protein but also a cell cycle regulator and that the cell cycle regulatory function of MCL1 is at least partially mediated through its interaction with PCNA. Transformed human embryonic kidney (293T) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HeLa and U2OS cells (an osteosarcoma cell line) are generous gifts from Dr. Limin Gong (Institute of Molecular Medicine for Prevention of Human Diseases, Houston, TX). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA fragments of MCL1, PCNA, Survivin, Bcl-xL, Bak, and Bax were obtained by a standard PCR technique (29Ausubel, F., Brent, R., Kingston, R., Moore, D., Seidman, J., Smith, J., and Struhl, K. (1998) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Chanda, V. B., ed) unit 15.1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar) using appropriate primer sets. These cDNA fragments were then ligated in-frame to appropriate yeast and mammalian expression vectors. A mutant of MCL1, MCL1Δ4A, was generated by PCR-based strategies as described previously (30Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In all cases, the authenticity of cloned constructs was confirmed by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing (SeqWright Co., Houston, TX). The full-length MCL1 was cloned into pAS2.1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), a vector that encodes GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and was used as bait.Saccharomyces cerevisiae PJ69-2A cells (MATa,CLONTECH) were transformed with pAS2.1-MCL1, using the lithium acetate method (31CLONTECHYeast Handbook. CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA1997: 30-34Google Scholar). We then performed yeast mating between PJ69-2A cells containing pAS2.1-MCL1 and Y187 cells (MATα) containing a human HeLa cell library on pGAD GH (a vector that encodes GAL4 DNA-activating domain) for 27 h, according to the manufacturer's instructions (31CLONTECHYeast Handbook. CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA1997: 30-34Google Scholar). Diploid yeast cells were selected for growth on synthetic dropout (SD) plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (SD/−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp) for 14 days at 30 °C. Positive colonies were screened for β-galactosidase activity using a X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) filter lift assay (31CLONTECHYeast Handbook. CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA1997: 30-34Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs were then isolated from colonies that activated all three yeast reporter genes (HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ) using the lyticase method (31CLONTECHYeast Handbook. CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA1997: 30-34Google Scholar), propagated in the Escherichia coli, and analyzed by restriction digest and automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing (SeqWright). S. cerevisiae SFY526 cells (CLONTECH) were co-transformed with pAS2.1 containing full-length MCL1 or empty pAS2.1 and pGAD GH containing M01, the C-terminal half (137th to 261st amino acids) of PCNA or empty pGAD GH. Transformed cells were selected on SD/−Trp/−Leu plates for 7 days and subjected to the X-gal filter lift assay as described above. The blue color that developed within 8 h was considered to represent a positive interaction. Radiolabeled proteins for anin vitro binding assay were generated by a TNT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction, using [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a labeling agent. DNA templates were either circular plasmids or gel-purified PCR products, containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The in vitro translated, influenza hemagglutinin-tagged PCNA (HA-PCNA) and another in vitrotranslated protein were added to Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.001% Nonidet P-40, 50 μm MG132, 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and allowed to form a complex at 4 °C for 90 min. HA-PCNA was then pulled down with rat anti-HA antibody (Clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sheep anti-rat polyclonal antibody conjugated to DynabeadsTM (M480, Dynal, Lake Success, NY). Immune complexes were then washed 5 times with Buffer A and once with Buffer B (Buffer A with 0.01% Nonidet P-40). Finally, precipitated proteins were eluted into SDS gel loading buffer (50 mmTris·Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol), boiled for 5 min, subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and visualized by fluorography and a PhosphorImager system (Bio-Rad). The cDNA of MCL1 was cloned in-frame intoEcoRI and PstI sites of pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) to express MCL1 fused to the C terminus of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Approximately 1 × 106 293T cells were transfected with pEGFP-MCL1 or empty pEGFP using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty hours after the transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and lysed by a nitrogen cavitation method (32Eichinger L. Bahler M. Dietz M. Eckerskorn C. Schleicher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12952-12959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (PARR Instrument Co, Moline, IL) in Buffer C (phosphate-buffered saline containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and a mammalian cell protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). At least a pressure of 2000 pounds/square inch was applied. The disruption of both cell wall and nuclear membrane was confirmed under microscopy. The total cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation. An aliquot of approximately 2 × 105cells was incubated either with anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (PC-10, IgG2, PharMingen, San Diego, CA) or with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Clone 3E6, IgG1, Quantum Biotechnology Inc., Montreal, Canada). Formed immune complexes were then precipitated by sheep anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to DynabeadsTM(M-280, Dynal). The precipitated complexes were washed 6 times with cold Buffer C, eluted into SDS gel loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to a 12% SDS-PAGE. After the Western transfer, proteins on the nitrocellulose membrane were probed with anti-PCNA (PC-10) and anti-GFP (Clones 7.1 and 13.1, both IgG1, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) monoclonal antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using subtype-specific rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase with the ECLTM detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 2 × 107 HeLa cells were harvested by trypsinization and suspended in Buffer A. Cells were then mechanically disrupted by the nitrogen cavitation with a pressure of 3000 pounds/square inch as described earlier. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and 500 μl of each was aliquoted into two tubes. Five micrograms of anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (PC-10) were added to the first tube, and the same amount of control monoclonal antibody was added to the second tube. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Dynabeads™ (M-280, Dynal) was added to the tubes, followed by an incubation of 1 h. The beads were washed six times with Buffer A. Immune complexes were eluted into SDS gel loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE in duplicate, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoprobed with anti-PCNA (PC-10) and anti-MCL1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies, and visualized by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed as described previously (33Liu J.L. Ye Y. Qian Z. Qian Y. Templeton D.J. Lee L.F. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, U2OS cells were seeded in 4-well Lab-Teck™ glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). The cells were fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, briefly treated with methanol/acetone mixture (1:1 v/v) at −20 °C, blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and probed with rabbit anti-MCL1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound primary antibodies were detected by goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Rhodamine Red X (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Stained cells were analyzed with the Fluoview confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY), using the × 60 objective lens. The same analysis was performed to determine the intracellular localizations of overexpressed wild type and MCL1Δ4A, a mutant MCL1. The experiment was performed in duplicate. HeLa cells were seeded in 4-well Lab-Teck™ chamber slides, transfected either with pFLAG-MCL1, pFLAG-MCL1Δ4A, or pFLAG-LacZ using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), challenged with 5 μg/ml Etoposide for 12 h, and stained for the FLAG epitope using anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Rhodamine Red X (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The nuclei were stained with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma). Cells were then examined under a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd, Herts, UK), using appropriate filter sets. Cells that emitted red fluorescence were evaluated for their nuclear morphology. The condensed or fragmented nuclei were counted as apoptotic. An apoptotic index was then calculated as the number of red cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology divided by the number of total red cells counted. This experiment was performed in duplicate. Approximately 10,000 HeLa cells were seeded in 4-well Lab-Teck™ chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). The next day, cells were transfected with pFLAG-LacZ, pFLAG-p21Waf1/Cip1, pFLAG-MCL1, or pFLAG-MCL1Δ4A using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's instruction. Cells were exposed to DNA-FuGENE6 complex for 5 h. Eighteen hours after the media change, cells were pulsed with 50 μm BrdUrd solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Harvested cells were first stained for incorporated BrdUrd, using a BrdUrd staining kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In this procedure, bound anti-BrdUrd antibody was detected by goat anti-mouse Rhodamine Red X antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were then stained for FLAG-tagged proteins with rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and goat anti-Rabbit-Cy2 antibody. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The slides were examined under the Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd.), using appropriate filter sets. At least 150 cells (average = 364) were counted per chamber. The BrdUrd incorporation was defined as the number of green cells with red nuclei (FLAG- and BrdUrd-positive) divided by the number of green cells (FLAG-positive). Statistical analysis was performed using a generalized linear model with Duncan multiple comparison at the significance level of 0.05. In order to identify the protein(s) interacting with MCL1, we screened a human HeLa cell cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Among the 2 × 106 independent clones screened, one clone, named “M01,” not only grew on histidine-adenine dropout plates but also activated the β-galactosidase reporter gene by an X-gal colony lift assay. A DNA sequence analysis revealed that the clone M01 represents the C-terminal 124 amino acid residues of human PCNA, which is fused in frame to the GAL4 activation domain (Fig. 1 A). The presence of both MCL1 and M01 was necessary and sufficient for β-galactosidase reporter gene to be activated in yeast SFY526 cells (Fig. 1 A). Thus, we concluded that MCL1 specifically interacted with the C-terminal half of PCNA in the yeast two-hybrid system. We then performed an in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assay to test whether MCL1 would interact with the full-length PCNA. Here, we incubated in vitro translated, radiolabeled, influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PCNA with either in vitrotranslated, radiolabeled MCL1 or Survivin. Survivin is a member of inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, another anti-apoptotic protein family structurally unrelated to Bcl-2 family proteins (14Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar, 15Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 1 B, PCNA co-precipitated MCL1 (lanes 1 and 5) but not Survivin (lanes 2 and6). Moreover, MCL1 could not be precipitated in the absence of PCNA (lanes 3 and 7). Thus, MCL1 specifically interacted with full-length PCNA in vitro. We proceeded to test if MCL1 would interact with PCNA in mammalian cells in vivo. We transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells with a plasmid encoding the cDNA of either the EGFP-tagged MCL1 or EGFP alone. As a result, EGFP-MCL1 and EGFP were found plentifully expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and2, top panel). On the other hand, PCNA was found abundantly expressed in these cells without forced overexpression (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2, bottom panel). When we immunoprecipitated PCNA in the cell lysate by an anti-PCNA antibody (lanes 3 and 4, bottle panel), only EGFP-MCL1, not EGFP, was co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA (lanes 3 and 4, top panel). When we immunoprecipitated EGFP or EGFP-MCL1 in the cell lysate by anti-EGFP antibody (lanes 5and 6, top panel), only EGFP-MCL1, but not EGFP, co-immunoprecipitated PCNA (lanes 5 and 6,bottom panel). Thus, MCL1 specifically interacted with PCNA in mammalian cells in vivo. So far we have shown that MCL1 and PCNA interacted specifically with each other in overexpression systems (Fig. 1, A–C). We wished to evaluate whether this interaction could be demonstrated in a non-overexpression, native system. To this end, the lysate from 2 × 107 HeLa cells was incubated with anti-PCNA antibody or with control antibody at the same concentration. As is shown in Fig. 1 D, the lysate contained an equal amount of native MCL1 and PCNA as is shown in the bottom two panels (Total Cell Lysate (Input)). When the precipitated immune complexes were probed with anti-PCNA antibody, PCNA was found successfully precipitated by anti-PCNA antibody but not by the control antibody (Fig. 1 D, 2nd panel). When the immune complexes were probed with anti-MCL1 antibody, MCL1 was found co-precipitated with PCNA (Fig. 1 D, top panel, 1st column). There was no MCL1 precipitated in the absence of PCNA (Fig. 1 D,top panel, 2nd column). This result strongly suggests that MCL1-PCNA interaction is biologically significant since it can be demonstrated in native, non-overexpression system as well as an overexpression system. We then evaluated whether PCNA interacted with other Bcl-2 family proteins. By using the same system as the one described in Fig. 1 B, we tested the ability of PCNA to co-precipitate other pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins including Bcl-xL, Bak, or Bax. As is shown in Fig. 2, PCNA co-precipitated only MCL1 and not Bcl-xL, Bak, or Bax. Thus, MCL1 is an unusual Bcl-2 family protein that is capable of interacting with PCNA, a cell cycle regulatory protein.Figure 2MCL1 is unique among Bcl-2 family member proteins in its ability to interact with PCNA. The binding betweenin vitro translated, [35S]Met-labeled HA-PCNA and another in vitro translated, [35S]Met-labeled protein (i.e. MCL1, Bcl-xL, Bak, or Bax) was assessed in the system described in Fig. 1 B. Only MCL1 (lanes 1 and 6) and not Bcl-xL (lanes 2 and 7), Bak (lanes 3and 8), or Bax (lanes 4 and 9) was co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA in vitro.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functionally, PCNA serves as a cofactor to DNA polymerase δ (34Bravo R.

Among 1000 spots resolved in two-dimensional gels, comparison of control versus apoptotic cells revealed that the signal intensity of 19 spots decreased or even disappeared, whereas 38 novel spots emerged. These proteins were further analyzed with respect tode novo protein synthesis, phosphorylation status, and intracellular localization by metabolic labeling and analysis of subcellular protein fractions in combination with two-dimensional Western blots and mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests. We found that e.g. hsp27, hsp70B, calmodulin, and H-ras synthesis was induced upon Fas signaling. 34 proteins were affected by dephosphorylation (e.g. endoplasmin) and phosphorylation (e.g. hsc70, hsp57, and hsp90). Nuclear annexin IV translocated to the cytosol, whereas decreasing cytosolic TCP-1α became detectable in the nucleus. In addition, degradation of 12 proteins was observed; among them myosin heavy chain was identified as a novel caspase target. Fas-induced proteome alterations were compared with those of other cell death inducers, indicating specific physiological characteristics of different cell death mechanisms, consequent to as well as independent of caspase activation.

Aberrations of apoptotic mechanisms were causally implicated in severe diseases such as cancer (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar, 2Evan G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because apoptosis was characterized by morphological features such as membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (3Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar), it became evident that various proteins are affected during this process. The specific proteolytic activities of caspases, cysteinyl-aspartate proteases normally expressed as latent zymogens and activated during apoptosis, were recognized as responsible for many of these morphologic alterations (4Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways, beginning with the activation of surface receptors ultimately resulting in the activation of caspases and hence the cellular demise, have been well characterized (6Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, several proteins became known to potentially inhibit (7Jäättelä M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) or promote (8Levy-Strumpf N. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3331-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) the onset of apoptosis by different means. Malignant diseases have been characterized by the imbalance of proliferation and cell death, resulting in a net gain of tumor mass (10Schulte-Hermann R. Bursch W. Low-Baselli A. Wagner A. Grasl-Kraupp B. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Schulte-Hermann R. Bursch W. Marian B. Grasl-Kraupp B. IARC ( Int. Agency Res. Cancer) Sci. Publ. 1999; 146: 273-285Google Scholar), with regulatory cross-talk between these processes being evident (12Guo M. Bruce A.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). During malignant transformation of cells, resistance to apoptosis may develop by the expression of antiapoptotic proteins (13LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), thus giving spreading tumor cells a higher chance to develop metastasis (14Glinsky G.V. Glinsky V.V. Cancer Lett. 1996; 101: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study we addressed the question whether cells induced to undergo apoptosis would solely follow the cell death program or alternatively employ additional mechanisms unrelated with caspase activation. Potential intrinsic antiapoptotic responses could help explain how cells proceed during the establishment of resistance to apoptosis leading to diseases. To gain a broad overview of cell activities upon apoptosis induction, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis to study Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. This cell system was chosen because much is known about the cell death initiation mechanisms (6Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), because the onset of apoptosis occurs in a quite synchronous manner, and because virtually all cells are committed to cell death and finally die, as described previously (15Gotzmann J. Meissner M. Gerner C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To observe specificities with respect to the cell death induction mechanism, the data were compared with those obtained with staurosporine, camptothecin, and oligomycin. The totality of proteins expressed from the genome of a cell is referred to as proteome (16Anderson N.L. Anderson N.G. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The proteome is highly dynamic and depends on many different parameters affecting cells. Proteome analysis may be performed by high resolution 2D1 gel electrophoresis, separating proteins according to their molecular weight and electric charge, which yields highly reproducible and characteristic 2D protein patterns (17Gerner C. Sauermann G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several studies have already focused on apoptosis-related proteins in apoptotic cells (18Charriaut-Marlangue C. Dessi F. Ben-Ari Y. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 19Brockstedt E. Rickers A. Kostka S. Laubersheimer A. Dorken B. Wittmann-Liebold B. Bommert K. Otto A. J. Biol.

Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated whether proteome alterations during apoptosis originated from new protein synthesis, protein translocation, or the formation of new protein isoforms or degradation products. The focus was on cytosolic proteins; data obtained with regard to other protein fractions will be presented elsewhere. 57 of more than 1000 protein spots resolved were found to be altered during Fas-induced apoptosis. Synthesis of hsp70B, for example, was newly but transiently induced. The translation rate of several signal transduction and cytoskeletal proteins was significantly increased. Phosphorylation of some chaperones and signaling proteins was accompanied by the dephosphorylation of others. Caspase-mediated protein degradation was evidenced by different means for 12 proteins. Investigation of proteome alterations using other apoptosis inducers revealed that the same proteins were cleaved, whereas protein translation and (de)phosphorylation profiles differed somewhat. Necrosis displayed few similarities with apoptosis, such as calpain-mediated protein degradation and a potential stress response. This study demonstrates that many data on a large number of proteins may be obtained by high throughput proteome analysis, providing new insights into the fate of cells during apoptosis. Anti-caspase 3 polyclonal IgG and anti-Fas (CD95) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Clone CH-11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); anti-hsp27 mAb (Clone G3.1) was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA); anti-hsp60 mAb (Clone LK-1) and anti-hsp57 (FKBP59) mAb (SRA-1400) was from StressGen (Victoria, Canada). Anti-hsp70 mAB (Clone W27) was purchased from NeoMarkers; anti-hsp90 mAb (Clone 3G3) was from Alexis (San Diego, CA); anti-gelsolin mAb (Clone GS-2C4) was from Sigma (Sigma); anti-Rho-A mAb (26C4) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-H-ras mAb (M0637) was from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Jurkat cells were routinely cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For induction of apoptosis, Jurkat cells were washed in serum-free medium and re-seeded at a density of 105cells/ml in medium containing 1% FCS. Apoptosis was induced in Jurkat cells 15 min thereafter by addition of either anti-Fas (CD95) antibody (50 ng/ml) camptothecin (Sigma) to final concentrations of 5 μm or Staurosporine (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) at 1.25 μm. Induction of necrosis with oligomycin was done as described by Leist et al. (22Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), except that the medium contained 1% FCS and was free of glucose. Cells were harvested by combining floating and moderately adhering cells, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 10 min in 2% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 min, and stained in 1 μg/ml Hoechst-33258 (Calbiochem) for 2 min. The percentage of cells displaying typical apoptotic nuclear morphology (crescent-shaped condensed chromatin lining the nuclear periphery; apoptotic bodies), referred to as the apoptotic index, was then determined empirically under the fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300). The trypan blue (Sigma) exclusion assay was used to determine cellular viability. Apoptotic and control Jurkat cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Total cellular lysates were obtained by dissolving the cell pellet (170 g, 5 min) in 2DE sample buffer (10 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol) with subsequent sonication. For preparation of cytosol, cells were lysed in 0.05% Nonidet P-40 in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2). Nuclei were pelleted at 400 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 60 min to yield the supernatant cytosol, which was ethanol precipitated, and the cytosol pellet, which was directly dissolved in sample buffer. The nuclear matrix protein fraction was prepared as has been described in detail (23Gerner C. Holzmann K. Grimm R. Sauermann G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the case of the control, Jurkat cells were washed in serum-free medium and re-seeded at a density of 105 cells/ml in medium containing 1% FCS. After 3 h, cells were washed and re-seeded in methionine- or phosphate-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and complemented with 1% FCS at a density of 106 cells/ml. Labeling occurred by addition of 0.8 mCi/107 cells 35S protein labeling mix (NEG-072, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 2.5 mCi/107 cells 32P orthophosphoric acid (NEX054, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In the case of Fas-induction, 15 min after re-seeding Jurkat cells at a density of 105 cells/ml in medium containing 1% FCS, apoptosis was induced by addition of 50 ng/ml anti-CD95 antibody. Again, after 3 h, cells were washed and re-seeded in methionine-free medium complemented with 1% FCS and 50 ng/ml anti-CD95 antibody at a density of 106 cells/ml. Labeling occurred as in control cells. After a 2-h labeling time, cells were collected by centrifugation and fractionated. All cell experiment, labeling, and 2D gel electrophoresis results presented were reproduced. High resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out by modification of the method of Hochstrasser et al. (24Hochstrasser D.F. Harrington M.G. Hochstrasser A.C. Miller M.J. Merill C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) using the Protean II xi electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). The protein samples were dissolved in 10 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 2% (v/v) ampholyte, pH 7–9 (Merck). Isoelectric focusing of 70-μg protein samples was performed at 15.500 V-h in a stepwise fashion (2 h at 200 V; 3 h at 500 V; 17 h at 800 V) in 4% acrylamide (Gerbu, Gaiberg, Germany), 0.1% piperazine diacrylamide (Bio-Rad) 1.5-mm × 16-cm tube gels. The gel buffer contained 1.55% CHAPS and 0.52% Nonidet P-40 and 2% ampholytes (Merck) (1 volume pH 3.5–10; 1 volume pH 4–8; 2 volumes pH 5–7). Degassed 20 mm NaOH served as catholyte, and 6 mmH3PO4 served as anolyte. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the extruded tube gels were placed on top of 1.5-mm thick 12% polyacrylamide slab gels. After a 3-min equilibration with 2.9% SDS, 70 mm Tris-HCl, 0.003% bromphenol blue, the gels were run at 15 °C in electrode buffer (0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 200 mm glycine). Gels were silver-stained by the method of Wray et al. (25Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). After silver staining, gels were equilibrated for 20 min with Enlightning NEF974G (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in case of35S autoradiography. Then gels were laid on Whatman 3MM chromatography paper, covered with Saran Wrap, and dried at 60 °C using the Slab Gel Dryer SE1160 from Hoefer (San Francisco, CA). Exposition of BIOMAXTM MR x-ray films (Kodak, Rochester, NY) occurred at room temperature in autoradiography cassettes with amplifying screens. Scanning of gels and films and comparative spot pattern analysis were accomplished with the BioImage Investigator system (BioImage, Ann Arbor, MI), using the 2-D Analyzer™ V 6.1 software package. For semiquantitative estimation of protein translation rates, the integrated optical densities of individual spots of 2D autoradiographs were calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total integrated spot intensities (%IOD). Increased translation was concluded in the case of an at least 1.5-fold increase of the %IOD of a spot. Identification of proteins by 2D Western blotting was performed as described recently (26Gotzmann J. Gerner C. Electrophoresis. 1999; 21: 523-525Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry fingerprinting, Coomassie Blue-stained proteins were directly cut out of preparative gels. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight of tryptic protein hydrolysates was carried out essentially as described by Fountoulakis and Langen (27Fountoulakis M. Langen H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Protein identification was accomplished by means of PeptIdent software (28Wilkins M.R. Williams K.L. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 186: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) made accessible by ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System). Proteins were considered as identified by means of mass spectrometry fingerprinting when a) at least 8 peptides b) representing at least 70% of the obtained peptide peaks c) covering at least 20% of the whole sequence gave hits with d) compatible molecular mass/pI values calculated or published in 2D data bases and e) exemplifying a significant difference in the number of matched peptides to the next potential hit. Indeed, several mass spectrographs did not yet allow unequivocal identification of the respective proteins (data not shown). Calculation of molecular weight and pI data of proteins and peptides was performed by means of Compute pI/Mw software (29Bjellqvist B. Hughes G.J. Pasquali Ch. Paquet N. Ravier F. Sanchez J.-Ch. Frutiger S. Hochstrasser D.F. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) made accessible by ExPASy. Jurkat cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with anti-CD95 antibody. As demonstrated previously (15Gotzmann J. Meissner M. Gerner C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), virtually all of the cells were committed to die by apoptosis; almost 100% chromatin condensation was observed after 12 h. Indeed, we were unable to recover vital cells when we repeatedly washed the cells with fresh medium 3 h after addition of antibody (data not shown). Proteome analysis was performed with cells 5 h after antibody treatment. At this time, cells displayed an apoptotic index of about 50%, whereas the overall translation rate was found to be only slightly affected. This time was chosen to allow potential transcriptional regulations to become manifest at the protein level. Indeed, translational up-regulations became evident at that time that were no longer detectable at later time points (see Table II). Cytosol was isolated from control and apoptotic cell populations and analyzed by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Computer-assisted comparative analysis of the respective silver-stained spot patterns revealed 19 spots with decreasing intensity (marked by hexagons in Figs. 1 and2), 38 new spots or spots with strongly increased intensity (marked by circles in Fig. 2), and more than 1000 spots that apparently remained unaffected (Figs. 1 and 2; see TableII). These data were reproduced in two additional independent experiments. The decrease of protein spot intensities was rather slight at 5 h after anti-Fas treatment but much more pronounced at 8 (data not shown) and 12 h after apoptosis induction (see TableII). The affected proteins were investigated by 2D Western blotting as described previously (26Gotzmann J. Gerner C. Electrophoresis. 1999; 21: 523-525Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and mass spectrometry of tryptic digests, resulting in the identification of those listed in TableI. Further experiments were performed to deduce whether the altered spots were due to protein synthesis, modification, translocation, or degradation. In addition, the proteome alteration profile of Fas-induced cells was compared with that of staurosporine-, camptothecin-, and oligomycin-induced cells. Control and apoptotic Jurkat cells were metabolically labeled for 2 h with a mixture of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys, beginning 3 h after antibody treatment. The resulting, previously silver-stained 2D gels were autoradiographed, which allowed us to record relative35S incorporation rates for each protein resolved. Comparison of the spot intensities of control and apoptotic samples, considering the respective silver-stained spot intensities, gave a measure for changes of translation rates during apoptosis. As expected, the 35S incorporation rates of those proteins degraded during apoptosis were found to be decreased. Calmodulin, gelsolin, kinesin heavy chain, vimentin, and a few unknown proteins displayed increased 35S labels, as exemplified for calmodulin in Fig. 3 A. Most significantly, some of the newly appearing protein spots displayed high35S labels (Table II). H-ras, one of these, was found present as well in the cytosol pellet fraction of control cells. The complete absence of such proteins in other fractions of control cells indicated that de novo synthesis of hsp27 (Fig. 3 A), hsp70B, and two further unknown proteins at 16 kDa/pI 6.1 and 18 kDa/pI 4.4 (Fig. 2, Table II) occurred during Fas-induced apoptosis.Table IIComparison of protein alterations with respect to death signal, metabolic label, and subcellular distributionProteins with decreasing spot intensity during apoptosisProteinConFas (5 h)Fas (12 h)STS (6 h) vs. conOM (5 h) vs. con35S AR (Fas vs.con)32P AR (Fas vs.con)CYTPNMInterpretationConApoConApoα-Actinin+++−<=<−++++/−ModificationCaspase-3+++−<=<−−−−−ProcessingCaspase-8+−−<=<−−−−−ProcessingEF-1β+++−<==<++−−PhosphorylationEIF-4G+−−<=<<−−−−Degradation(p-)Endoplasmin+++−<<<<−−−−Dephosphorylationhsp90+++−<=<>++−+Aggregationhsp110++++<==<++−−AggregationIκB-α+++−<<=−−−−−Phosph./Degrad.Importin-β3+−−<=−<−−+−DegradationMyosin 1c+++−<<=<−−−−Phosph./Degrad.p19/6.2++++<==−−−−−Degradationp32/5.9+++−<==−−−−−Phosphorylationp70/7.1+−−<==<++−−DephosphorylationPDI++++<==−++++AggregationPP2A++++++<==<−−−−Degradationrho GDI 2++++++<==−++−−DegradationTCP-1α++++==<−−−−+TranslocationTM30-NM++++<==−++−−Degrad./AggregationNew protein spots emerging during apoptosisProteinConFas (5 h)Fas (12 h)STS (6 h)OM (5 h)35S AR32P ARCYTPNMInterpretationConApoConApoα-Actinin modified−+++−−−−+−−Modification*Actin−++++−−−−+−+Degrad. prod.*Caspase-3−+++−−−Cleavage prod.(p-)EF-1β−++++++++−−PhosphorylationEndoplasmin+++++++++−−+−+Dephosphorylationhsp27−++−−+−−−−+Synthesis(p-)hsp27−+−+−++−−−−Syn./Phosph.hsp70–6−+−−−+−−−−−SynthesisH-ras−++−−−−++−−Syn./Transl.(p-)IκB-α−+−++−+−−−−Phosph./Degrad.(p-)Myosin 1c−+−++++−−−−Phosphorylation*NMMIIC-A−++++−−−−+−−Degrad. prod.p16/6.1−+++−+−−−−+Mod./Syn.p18/4.4−+++−++−−−+Mod./Syn.p23/6.6−++++−+−−−−−Degrad. prod.p28/4.6−++++−+−−+−+Degrad. prod.p32/5.7−+−+−−+−−−−Phosphorylationp39/5.0−+−+−+−−−−−Degrad. prod.p41/4.6−+−+−−−−+−−Degrad. prod.p42/4.4−+++++−−−−−Modificationp44/4.2−+−−−−+−−−Phosphorylationp49/5.1−++++−++−−−−Modificationp52/6.0−+++−−−−−−−Degrad. prod.p54/5.8−++++−−−−−−−Degrad. prod.p54/5.9−++++−−−−−−−Degrad. prod.p67/6.2−+−−−++−−−−Phosphorylationp80/4.9−+−−−−−−+−−Degrad. prod.p85/4.8−+++−+−−+−−Degrad. prod.p92/4.7−+−−−−−++++Translocationp95/4.6−+−−−−+−−++TranslocationRFC-36−+−+++−+++++Syn./Trans.(p-)rho GDI 1−+++−−+−+−−Phosphorylation*rho GDI 2.24 kDa−++++−+−−−−−Degrad. prod.*rho GDI 2.22 kDa−++++−+−−−−−Degrad. prod.*Spectrin 150 kDa−+++++−−−+−−Degrad. prod.*Spectrin 120 kDa−++++−−−−+−−Degrad. prod.*α-Tubulin−+++−+−−+−+Degrad. prod.*Vimentin−++++−−−−+−+Degrad. prod.(p-), phosphorylated isoform; *, degradation product of; Fas, anti-CD95 antibody-treated; STS, staurosporine-treated; OM, oligomycin-treated (for the indicated time); con, control; vs., in comparison with; +, spot present; ++, high intensity; +++, very high intensity; =, intensity not significantly changed; <, decreased intensity; >, increased intensity; AR, autoradiography; CYTP, cytosol pellet; NM, nuclear matrix; Apo, apoptosis; Phospho., phosphorylation; Degrad., degradation; prod., product; Syn., synthesis; Mod., modification; −, spot absent.

Jurkat cells were washed in serum-free medium and re-seeded at a density of 105 cells/ml in medium containing 1% FCS. After 3 h, cells were washed and re-seeded in methionine-free medium complemented with 1% FCS at a density of 106 cells/ml. Labeling occurred for an additional 2 h by addition of 0.8 mCi/107 cells 35S protein labeling mix. This silver-stained 2D gel of the cytosol protein fraction was subsequently autoradiographed (see Fig. 3).

If not indicated otherwise, the protein samples referred to as control and Fas correspond to those of Fig. 1and Fig. 2, respectively. A, induced protein synthesis evidenced by 35S autoradiography and silver staining. After silver staining, gels were equilibrated with Enlightning, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. The 35S label corresponds to the translaton rate of the respective protein. Note that the increased translation of calmodulin is not reflected at the silver stain level and that hsp27 is not detectable in control cells. B, (de)phosphorylation evidenced by 32P autoradiography and silver staining. 32P labeling was performed analgous to35S labeling, utilizing phosphate-free medium and 2.5 mCi/107 cells [32P]orthophosphoric acid. After silver staining, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. Two isoforms of the indicated proteins are encirled, the more acidic isoform labeled by autoradiography, hence phosphorylated, and the basic isoform unphosphorylated, not labeled, and observed only by silver staining. Note that dephosphorylation of endoplasmin is indicated by a decrease of the 32P label and a more prominent appearance of the basic, dephosphorylated isoform by silver staining. Phosphorylation of heat shock cognate 70 (hsc70) is indicated by the increased 32P label and a more prominent appearance of the more acidic, phosphorylated isoform by silver staining.C, translocation evidenced by comparison of subcellular fractions. Cytosol was obtained by the lysis of cells in 0.05% Nonidet P-40 in hypotonic buffer, pelleting of nuclei, and ultracentrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 100,000 × g for 60 min; the pellet corresponds to the cytoplasm pellet. The nuclear matrix protein fraction was prepared as described in detail (23Gerner C. Holzmann K. Grimm R. Sauermann G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Whereas annexin IV appeared as new in the cytosol during apoptosis, it disappeared from the nuclear matrix protein fraction. On the other hand, TCP-1α decreased in the cytosol during apoptosis, concomitantly becoming more prominent in the nuclear matrix fraction. During chromatin condensation, the nuclear matrix fraction displayed various other spot alterations that will be described in detail elsewhere.View Large Image Figure"
https://openalex.org/W2332316926,"Cellular resistance to multiple proapoptotic stimuli and invasion of surrounding brain tissue by migrating tumor cells are main obstacles to an effective therapy for human malignant glioma. Here, we report that the Wnt family of embryonic differentiation genes modulate growth of malignant glioma cells in vitro and in vivo and inhibit cellular migration in vitro. sFRPs (soluble Frizzled-related proteins) are soluble proteins that bind to Wnt and interfere with Wnt signaling. We find that sFRP-1 and sFRP-2 are produced by the majority of longterm and ex vivo malignant glioma cell lines. Glioma cells that ectopically express sFRPs exhibit increased clonogenicity and enhanced resistance to serum starvation. In contrast, sFRPs do not modulate glioma cell susceptibility to apoptosis induced by the cytotoxic cytokines, CD95 (Fas/APO-1) ligand (CD95L) or Apo2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL), or various cytotoxic drugs. sFRP-2 strongly promotes the growth of intracranial glioma xenografts in nude mice. In contrast, enhanced expression of sFRPs inhibits the motility of glioma cells in vitro. sFRP-mediated effects on glioma cells are accompanied by decreased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. Thus, sFRPs promote survival under non-supportive conditions and inhibit the migration of glioma cells. We suggest that the regulation of these cellular processes involves expression of MMP-2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. These data support a function for Wnt signaling and its modulation by sFRPs in the biology of human gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2075185645,"Glutamate transporters from the central nervous system play a crucial role in the clearance of the transmitter from the synaptic cleft. Glutamate is cotransported with sodium ions, and the electrogenic translocation cycle is completed by countertransport of potassium. Mutants that cannot interact with potassium are only capable of catalyzing electroneutral exchange. Here we identify a residue involved in controlling substrate recognition in the neuronal transporter EAAC-1 that transports acidic amino acids as well as cysteine. When arginine 447, a residue conserved in all glutamate transporters, is replaced by cysteine, transport of glutamate or aspartate is abolished, but sodium-dependent cysteine transport is left intact. Analysis of other substitution mutants shows that the replacement of arginine rather than the introduced cysteine is responsible for the observed phenotype. In further contrast to wild type, acidic amino acids are unable to inhibit cysteine transport in R447C-EAAC-1, indicating that the selectivity change is manifested at the binding step. Electrophysiological analysis shows that in the mutant cysteine, transport has become electroneutral, and its interaction with the countertransported potassium is impaired. Thus arginine 447 plays a pivotal role in the sequential interaction of acidic amino acids and potassium with the transporter and, thereby, constitutes one of the molecular determinants of coupling their fluxes.

Studies of the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal half of the glutamate transporters indicate a non-conventional topology containing two reentrant loops, two transmembrane domains, 7 and 8, long enough to span the membrane as α-helices as well as an outward facing hydrophobic linker (23Grunewald M.

Moreover, tyrosine 403 behaves as if it is alternately accessible to either side of the membrane (28Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Analysis of GLT-1 mutants where serine 440, located in one of the reentrant loops, has been modified indicates that at least part of this loop is crucial for the coupling of sodium and glutamate fluxes and that it is close to the glutamate binding site (29Zhang Y.

They found that mutation of arginine 479 to threonine, which occupies the same position in ASCT-1, abolishes glutamate uptake, but they noted that there may be other reasons underlying such a defect (30Conradt M. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25207-25212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nevertheless the idea of a role of the arginine in glutamate binding remained viable, especially after the subsequent cloning and sequencing of the isotransporter ASCT-2 revealed that it contains a cysteine residue at the equivalent position (33Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 34Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Fei Y.J. Torres Zamorano V. Sinha S. Yang Feng T.L. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18657-18661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We reason that mutation of this arginine in a glutamate transporter, which also transports a non-dicarboxylic acid substrate, might leave the transport of this substrate intact. It was shown that EAAT-3, the human homologue of EAAC-1 (35Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also exhibits considerable transport of cysteine (36Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We report here that mutation of the equivalent arginine 447 of EAAC-1 to neutral or negative amino acid residues completely abolishes transport of l-glutamate and d- and l-aspartate without impairing cysteine transport. Surprisingly, this cysteine transport is electroneutral rather than electrogenic. This appears to be due to a defective interaction with potassium. We propose that arginine 447, by sequentially participating in the binding of glutamate and potassium, is enabling the coupling of their fluxes. Complementary DNAs encoding the histidine-tagged EAAC-1 and its derived mutants, subcloned in the oocyte expression vector pOG2 (see below), were linearized with SacI, and cRNA was transcribed from each of the cDNA constructs with T7 polymerase and capped with 5′7-methyl guanosine by use of the mMESSAGE mMACHINE (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Approximately 50 ng of the various cRNAs was injected into defolliculated stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes (36Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and expression was assayed 3–5 days later by two-microelectrode voltage clamp recording (15Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and/or radiotracer flux experiments (see below). Uptake ofd-[3H]aspartate (10.5 Ci/mmol) andl-[3H]serine (21.7 Ci/mmol) (both from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) andl-[3H]glutamate (60 Ci/mmol),l-[3H]aspartate (32 Ci/mmol), andl-[35S]cysteine (1075 Ci/mmol) (all from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) was performed by placing 5 X. laevis oocytes per determination in 500 μl of frog Ringer's solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1 μCi of the radiolabeled amino acids, except for cysteine, where 10 μCi was used. The amino acids were used carrier-free unless indicated otherwise. After 20 min at room temperature (uptake was linear with time for at least 30 min), the oocytes were washed by passing through 4 wells filled with 1 ml of Ringer's solution followed by a 15-min incubation in 10% SDS (500 μl/oocyte). Radioactivity was determined in a Kontron liquid scintillation counter. Each experiment was performed 3–8 times with different batches of oocytes, and representative experiments based on five oocytes per determination are shown. During two-microelectrode voltage clamp recording (15Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), oocytes were perfused with frog Ringer's solution with and without amino acid substrates. In experiments where the external chloride concentration was replaced or varied, equimolar anion substitution was employed, and recordings were made with the bath grounded via a 3 m KCl/agar bridge connected to a 3m KCl reservoir containing an Ag/AgCl electrode. In the figures, records from representative oocytes (n = 3–8, at least 2–3 different batches) are presented. The chloride equilibrium potential was determined by measuring the reversal potential of endogenous calcium-dependent chloride channels after activation with A23187 (37Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Current measurements were made during superfusion of 30 μml-[35S]cysteine (2.27 × 1014 cpm/mol) onto oocytes voltage-clamped at −23 mV for 150 s. After washout of the bath for 1 min, oocytes were transferred to a scintillation tube, lysed, and measured for radioactivity. Currents induced byl-[35S]cysteine were recorded using chart software (AD Instruments). The chloride equilibrium potential measured in two different oocytes of the batch used was −21 and −23 mV. The EAAC-1 cDNA, residing in pBluescript SK−, was generously donated by Dr. Mathias Hediger. A tail of nine histidines was engineered at its carboxyl using site-directed mutagenesis using uracil-containing single strand DNA (38Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Briefly, the parent DNA, EAAC-1 or EAAC-1H9 (see below), was used to transform Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut−, ung−). From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil containing DNA was isolated upon growth in a uridine-containing medium according to the standard protocol from Stratagene using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently, the mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. Our original intention was to replace the last residue (phenylalanine) by methionine and to add a deca-histidine tail. However after sequencing throughout the entire coding region from both directions, it appeared that a single error had occurred, causing a frame-shift. As a consequence, instead of a tail of 10 histidines, it contained only 9, and the open reading frame was extended by the sequence SLEALASQDCHEGPSMRVIS before reaching the new stop codon TAG (EAAC-1H9). Expression of this transporter in HeLa cells using the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus (40Keynan S. Suh Y.J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) gave rise to identicald-[3H]aspartate transport as the original EAAC-1 cDNA. The EAAC-1H9 construct served as the parent construct (wild type) for subsequent site-directed mutagenesis (38Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar), except for the R447C mutant, for which the original EAAC-1 cDNA served as a parent construct. The histidine-tagged EAAC-1H9, the original EAAC-1, and the R447C-EAAC-1 were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pOG2, which contained a 5′-untranslated Xenopusβ-globin sequence and a 3′-poly(A) signal, using XhoI andBglII. This causes a reduction of the 3′-untranslated region of EAAC-1 from 1621 to 730 base pairs (EAAC-1H9-pOG2). The mutants were identified by diagnostic restriction sites and subcloned into the EAAC-1H9-pOG2 constructs using the restriction enzymes AgeI and SpeI. A similar subcloning was also done for the R447C mutation from the EAAC-1 to the EAAC-1H9 constructs. The subcloned cDNAs were then sequenced from each direction between the two restriction sites. In the case of the mutant R447C, which was the first one prepared for this study, initial characterization of its properties was carried out by comparing oocytes injected with cRNA transcribed from R447C-EAAC-1 and EAAC-1 (both without the histidine tail). The features of radiotracer uptake and cysteine currents in these oocytes were the same as those shown in Figs. 1 and 4 for EAAC-1H9 and R447C-EAAC-1H9 (therein labeled as R447C). Thus the R447C mutant does not behave differently because of the presence of the 20 extra amino acids and the 9 histidines present in EAAC1H9.Figure 4Currents mediated by wild type (wt) and R447C transporters. Subtracted records showing currents induced by d-aspartate (A andB) and l-cysteine (D andE) of representative oocytes expressing EAAC-1H9 wild type (A and D) and R447C (B andE). Currents recorded in the absence of substrate during 250 ms voltage pulses from −100 to +40 mV were subtracted form those during superfusion of 1 mmd-aspartate orl-cysteine. The prepulse potential was −30 mV. Voltage dependence of steady state currents taken at 200 ms induced byd-aspartate (C) or l-cysteine (F) is shown in wild type (squares) and R447C mutant (circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) X. laevis oocytes injected with R447C-EAAC-1H9 cRNA exhibit strikingly different transport properties from their counterparts injected with EAAC-1H9 wild type cRNA (Fig.1). The mutant transporters are almost totally defective in the transport ofd-[3H]aspartate,l-[3H]aspartate, andl-[3H]glutamate. All three acidic amino acids are substrates for the wild type transporter (Fig. 1 A). Significantly, R447C transporters are capable of taking upl-[35S]cysteine, as is the wild type (Fig. 1,A and B). There is no significantl-[3H]serine uptake in oocytes injected with wild type cRNA as compared with uninjected oocytes (Fig.1 C), but l-[3H]serine uptake is observed with the R447C mutant (Fig. 1 C). Uptake of bothl-[3H]serine andl-[35S]cysteine is fully sodium-dependent (Fig. 1, B and C). Not only are the acidic amino acids not taken up by the R447C transporters, but they are unable to bind them. This is exemplified by the inability of unlabeled l-aspartate to compete withl-[35S]cysteine uptake in the mutant (Fig.2). Whereas the wild typel-[35S]cysteine uptake is potently inhibited by 100 μml-aspartate (4–10-fold the reported K m for this substrate (20Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 35Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)),l-aspartate does not inhibitl-[35S]cysteine uptake by the mutant, even at 1 mm (Fig. 2). Similarly, no inhibition ofl-[35S]cysteine uptake in the mutant is observed with l-glutamate or d-aspartate (data not shown). l-[35S]Cysteine uptake is not inhibited by nonrelated compounds like γ-aminobutyric acid, neither in the mutant nor in the wild type (Fig. 2). The data presented in Fig.2 also indicate that the mutant has a higher affinity for cysteine than the wild type, and the same phenomenon is observed with serine (Fig.2). That this is indeed the case is seen from the apparentK m values, measured as the ability to induce steady state currents (see “Electrophysiological Characterization of the R447C Mutant” below). The inability of the R447C mutant to interact with acidic amino acids is caused by the removal of the arginine rather than the introduction of a cysteine at this position. Mutants in which arginine 447 has been replaced by glutamate (R447E), lysine (R447K), glycine (R447G), and serine (R447S), retain the ability to take upl-[35S]cysteine, although it is reduced in R447K (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, none of them, with the exception of R447K, is able to transportd-[3H]aspartate (Fig. 3 B). However, even though in R447K transporters the positive charge at this position is maintained, these mutant transporters exhibit a markedly reduced uptake of this acidic amino acid (Fig. 3 B). The absence of the positive charge at position 447 is correlated with the ability to exhibit significant l-[3H]serine transport; this is observed with all mutants except R447K (Fig.3 C). We have tried to restored-[3H]aspartate transport to R447C using the positively charged sulfhydryl reagents (2-aminoethyl)methane thiosulfonate (2.5 mm), which would be expected to introduce a lysine-like structure at this position, and [(2-trimethylammonium)ethyl] methane thiosulfonate (10 mm). No effects on the transport of any of the substrates was observed after 5-min preincubations of oocytes expressing R447C with these reagents or the negatively charged (2-sulfonatoethyl)methane thiosulfonate (10 mm) (data not shown). Uptake of excitatory amino acids by all glutamate transporter clones thus far characterized results in the activation of a current reflecting the sum of the inward current (resulting from cotransport of coupled ions such as sodium) together with a chloride current flowing through a thermodynamically uncoupled conductance pathway (21Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 37Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of the currents mediated by wild type EAAC-1H9 and its mutant R447C has been determined by clamping oocytes expressing the transporters at potentials between −100 and +40 mV (increments of 20 mV) in the presence and absence of the substratesd-aspartate and l-cysteine. In the wild type EAAC-1H9, steady state d-aspartate (Fig.4 A) and l-cysteine currents (Fig. 4 D) are observed that reverse at potentials greater than +30 mV (Fig. 4, C and F). The behavior of R447C is quite different. No significant currents are observed with d-aspartate (Fig. 4 B) andl-glutamate and l-aspartate (data not shown), consistent with the inability of R447C transporters to take up acidic amino acids (Figs. 1 A and 3 B). Withl-cysteine, transport currents are observed (Fig.4 E), but the l-cysteine currents of R447C exhibit a reversal potential around −25 mV, similar to the chloride equilibrium potential (Fig. 4 F). The apparentK m value for cysteine was 27.9 ± 7.9 μm for the R447C-EAAC-1H9 mutant (measured at +20 mV,n = 3) and 110 ± 24 μm for the wild type (measured at −80 mV, n = 3). The corresponding values for serine- and alanine-induced currents in the mutant were 13.9 ± 4.1 and 17.9 ± 3.1 μm, respectively (n = 3). In the wild type, 1 mm each of the latter two amino acids induced very small currents (<10% of those with d-aspartate), consistent with the very low affinities observed with its human EAAT-3 homologue (36Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to the steady state current, a transient cysteine-induced current is observed with R447C (Fig. 4 E). This transient current appears to be capacitative, because the charge movements, estimated by subtraction of the steady state currents, after following hyperpolarizing or depolarizing pulses are equal to those following the return to the original potential (Fig.5). Neither steady state nor transient cysteine currents were observed in the absence of sodium (lithium or choline substitution) and also not in uninjected oocytes (data not shown). Similar observations have been made on oocytes injected with R447E-EAAC-1H9 cRNA, although the outward currents are smaller than when cysteine occupies this position (data not shown). Varying [Cl−]o shifted the reversal potential of R447C by 48 mV/10-fold change in [Cl−]o (Fig.6). Furthermore, in R447C, substitution of Cl− by gluconate in the Ringer's solution bathing the oocytes abolishes the outward current at positive potentials up to +70 mV (data not shown). These observations suggest that in R447C, Cl− ions carry the major part of the current activated byl-cysteine superfusion.Figure 6Dependence of the reversal potential of steady state cysteine currents by R447C transporters. Currents induced by 1 mm cysteine with 250-ms voltage pulses between +80 and −120 mV were recorded in oocytes expressing R447C transporters (n = 3) using perfusion media of varying chloride concentrations (gluconate substitution). The error bars (S.E.) are smaller than the size of the symbols. The dashed line gives the predicted chloride dependence of the reversed potential for the mutant according to the Nernst equation for chloride.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The selective loss of the ability of the R447C mutant to catalyze the inwardly rectifying electrogenic transport current (Fig. 4 E) indicates that the uptake of l-[35S]cysteine is electroneutral rather than the electrogenic process observed with the wild type. Evidence supporting this idea is presented in Fig.7. Oocytes expressing wild type EAAC-1 or R447C were voltage-clamped at −23 mV, near the equilibrium potential of chloride, and superfused with 30 μml-[35S]cysteine. This non-saturating concentration, around the apparent K m for cysteine, was used to enable the uptake measurements without having to add excessive amounts of radiolabel. Currents recorded simultaneously during radiolabeled uptake are dramatically different between the two groups of cells (Fig. 7). Although uptake ofl-[35S]cysteine in the two groups is similar, an electrogenic uptake current is only observed in wild type EAAC-1 (Fig. 7 A) but not in the mutant (Fig. 7 B). The behavior of R447C is reminiscent of that of mutants E404D (15Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and Y403F (27Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They are locked in the electroneutral exchange mode because they cannot interact with potassium, which is required for the return of the unloaded transporter. We have previously used reconstitution of solubilized membrane proteins from HeLa cells expressing wild type GLT-1, E404D, and Y403F to show that d-[3H]aspartate uptake is defective with internal potassium (net flux) but not with unlabeled glutamate or aspartate (exchange) on the inside (15Kavanaugh M.P.

In earlier kinetic studies, Barter and Jones (1Barter P.J. Jones M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 238-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ihm and colleagues (2Ihm J. Quinn D.M. Bush S.J. Chataing B. Harmony J.A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1328-1341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the interactions of CETP with low density lipoproteins (LDL)versus high density lipoproteins (HDL) markedly differ. Hence, at a constant amount of HDL, the rate of the CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester exchange rises with increasing amounts of LDL until a maximal constant value is reached with high LDL to HDL cholesteryl ester ratios. Although at a fixed amount of LDL the rate of cholesteryl ester exchange also tended to increase with moderate amounts of HDL, a potent and significant inhibition of the CETP-mediated lipid transfer process was observed with higher HDL/LDL cholesterol ratios (1Barter P.J. Jones M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 238-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ihm J. Quinn D.M. Bush S.J. Chataing B. Harmony J.A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1328-1341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, the inhibitory effect of HDL has been explained in terms of a greater interaction of CETP with HDL than with LDL, favoring the HDL-HDL exchanges over the LDL-HDL exchanges (1Barter P.J.

More recently, purified HDL apolipoproteins were shown to modulate the cholesteryl ester transfer reaction, and in particular apoA-I and apoA-II;i.e. the two major HDL apolipoproteins were alternatively described as neutral, inhibitory, or activating factors of the cholesteryl ester transfer process (3Moulin P.

In fact, the quest for a CETP inhibitor in plasma HDL over the last decade led to inconsistent observations, and no clear identification and characterization of an inhibitory protein in human HDL has been provided so far. Comparative studies of the ability of HDL from control mice and transgenic mice expressing human HDL apolipoproteins revealed that the lipid transfer-inhibitory activity associated with control mouse HDL can be completely lost as the result of the apoA-I and apoA-II overexpression in the transgenic mouse models (9Masson D. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Lagrost L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24287-24293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It appears therefore that neither apoA-I nor apoA-II can account for the strong inhibitory activity associated with plasma HDL, and observations in transgenic animals strongly support the existence of a distinct inhibitor protein in the HDL fraction. Recently, Wang et al. (10Wang X. Driscoll D.M. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1814-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) identified human apoF as a lipid transfer inhibitor protein. It is noteworthy, however, that apoF is not an HDL apolipoprotein, and no direct evidence for the blockade of lipid transfer-inhibitory activity in HDL with anti-apoF antibodies was provided (10Wang X. Driscoll D.M. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1814-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Given that the putative lipid transfer inhibitors that were previously proposed are rather heterogenous in terms of molecular mass (ranging from 3 up to 41 kDa (11Son Y.S.C. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim.

Acta. 1998; 1391: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), the entire spectrum of human HDL apolipoproteins was explored in the present study. This exhaustive experimental approach led to the preparation of up to 30 distinct protein fractions with molecular masses ranging from 2 up to 80 kDa. Among all of the isolated proteins, one single candidate was shown to account for most of the lipid transfer-inhibitory activity that is associated with human plasma HDL. The present work reports the purification and the characterization of the lipid transfer-inhibitory protein in human plasma HDL, providing a new explanation for the known concentration-dependent ability of HDL to inhibit the CETP-mediated lipid transfer process. Fresh citrated plasmas from normolipidemic subjects were provided by the Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine (Hôpital du Bocage, Dijon, France). The anti-human apolipoprotein C-I antiserum from goats was purchased from Europa Research Products. Affinity-purified anti-human apoC-I immunoglobulins from goats were purchased from Biodesign International. Affinity-purified anti-human apoC-III immunoglobulins were purchased from Rockland. LDL were ultracentrifugally isolated from normolipidemic human plasmas as the 1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml fraction, with one 17-h, 50,000-rpm spin at the lowest density and one 24-h, 50,000-rpm spin at the highest density in a 70.Ti rotor in an L90-K ultracentrifuge (Beckman). HDL were ultracentrifugally isolated from normolipidemic human plasmas as the 1.070 < d < 1.210 g/ml fraction, with one 24-h, 45,000-rpm spin at the lowest density and one 24-h, 50,000-rpm spin at the highest density in a 70.Ti rotor in a L90-K ultracentrifuge. Densities were adjusted by the addition of solid KBr. The isolated lipoproteins were dialyzed overnight against a 10 mmol/liter Tris, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 3 mmol/liter NaN3, pH 7.4, buffer (TBS buffer). Cholesteryl ester transfer activity was determined by quantitating the transfer of radiolabeled cholesteryl esters from [3H]CE-LDL to unlabeled acceptor HDL or from [3H]CE-HDL3 to unlabeled acceptor LDL as described previously (6Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human LDL and HDL were biosynthetically radiolabeled as described previously (17Lagrost L. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A protein fraction containing purified CETP activity and devoid of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and phospholipid transfer protein activities was prepared by a sequential chromatographic procedure as described previously (18Lagrost L. Athias A. Gambert P. Lallemant C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cholesteryl ester transfer assays, donor (cholesterol, 2.50 nmol) and acceptor lipoproteins (cholesterol, 0.62–20.00 nmol) were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of partially purified CETP (4.5 μg) in a final volume of 50 μl. Following the incubation, the d < 1.068 and thed > 1.068 g/ml fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation and transferred into counting vials containing 2 ml of scintillation fluid. The radioactivity was assayed for 2 min in a Wallac 1410 liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recovery of total radioactivity in the d < 1.068 and in the d > 1.068 g/ml fractions was greater than 95%. Cholesteryl ester transfer rates were calculated from the known specific radioactivity of the donor and the accumulation of [3H]CE in the d < 1.068 or thed > 1.068 g/ml acceptor fraction, after deduction of blank values from control mixtures that were incubated at 37 °C without CETP. Data were expressed as the amount of cholesteryl ester transferred per ml of incubation mixture per h (nmol/ml/h). Ultracentrifugally isolated HDL were delipidated using ethanol/acetone (1:1, v/v) according to the general procedure of Jackson and Holdsworth (19Jackson R.L. Holdsworth G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The aqueous solution containing delipidated apolipoproteins was dialyzed overnight against TBS buffer. HDL particles (5 mg of protein) were incubated for 15 min at 56 °C with 3 volumes of TBS containing SDS (20 g/liter) and dithiothreitol (33 g/liter). HDL apolipoproteins were separated by SDS electrophoresis in a 100–250 g/liter polyacrylamide gradient gel. Proteins of known molecular weight were electrophoresed in an adjacent well (Low Molecular Weight Calibration Kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The electrophoresis was performed overnight in a 1 g/liter SDS, 50 mmol/liter Tris, 380 mmol/liter glycine buffer. The distinct HDL apolipoproteins were recovered from the polyacrylamide gradient gel by using the Whole Gel Eluter system (Bio-Rad), which allows proteins to migrate through the thickness of the gel by delivering a perpendicular electric current. HDL apolipoproteins were electroeluted as recommended by the manufacturer into 30 distinct narrow chambers, and they were finally recovered in a nondenaturing elution buffer (60 mmol/liter Tris, 40 mmol/liter CAPS). Each fraction was subsequently concentrated (Microsep 3K, Filtron) to a final volume of 200 μl. Pure apoC-I was obtained by using the chromatofocusing method of Tournier et al. (20Tournier J.-F. Bayard F. Tauber J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 804: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, delipidated HDL apolipoproteins (up to 50 mg) were dialyzed against a histidine buffer (25 mmol/liter, pH 6.2), and they were applied to a 20 × 1-cm inner diameter column of Polybuffer exchanger 94 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was preequilibrated at 4 °C with the same buffer. Under these experimental conditions, all of the HDL apolipoproteins bound to the column, with the exception of apoC-I that eluted with the void volume. Finally, pure apoC-I was dialyzed against TBS buffer. Affinity-purified anti-apoC-I antibodies (Biodesign) were covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a ratio of 4 mg of protein/g of gel as recommended by the manufacturer (21Cheung M.C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12201-12209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal binding capacity of the column approximated 0.3 mg of apoC-I. Native HDL particles (approximately 4 mg of protein) were applied at room temperature at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. Particles that did not bind the immunosorbent column were washed off with TBS buffer until the absorbance returned to base line. ApoC-I-containing HDL were subsequently eluted with a 0.1 mol/liter, pH 3.0, acetic acid solution before neutralization by Tris (1 mol/liter). In order to ensure optimal removal of apoC-I-containing particles, HDL from the same batch were passed twice through the immunoaffinity column. Protein samples were diluted 1:4 in TBS buffer containing SDS (25 g/liter), dithiothreitol (33 g/liter), and they were incubated for 15 min at 80 °C. Samples were subsequently applied on SDS-polyacrylamide high density gels (Phastsystem; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and migrations were conducted as recommended by the manufacturer. Proteins were subsequently silver-stained by using Merril's method (22Merril C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Apparent molecular weights of individual protein bands were determined by reference to protein standards (Ultra Low Range Molecular Weight Markers; Sigma). Protein samples (0.3 pg) diluted in borate buffer (50 mmol/liter, pH 9.3) containing SDS (1 g/liter) were pressure-injected in an untreated fused silica capillary (effective length, 50 cm; diameter, 50 μm) and electrophoresed at 30 kV and 25 °C (HP3D Capillary Electrophoresis System, Hewlett Packard) in the same buffer. Absorbance was continuously monitored at 214 nm. Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide high density gels as described above and were further transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Phast semidry electrophoretic transfer system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 10% low fat dried milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween, and washed with TBS-Tween. The blots were developed by successive incubations with affinity-purified anti-apoC-I antibodies (Biodesign) and with peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibodies (Sigma) as described previously (9Masson D. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Lagrost L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24287-24293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Blots were finally developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The N-terminal sequence of protein samples was determined by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473A microsequencer. Samples purified by high pressure liquid chromatography were loaded on Polybrene-treated and precycled glass fiber filters (23Metz-Boutigue M.-H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 145: 659-676Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified by chromatography on a phenylthiohydantoin C18 column (2.1 × 200 mm). Protein mass spectrometry analyses were carried out by using either a MALDI-TOF-MS or a single quadrupole mass detector. In the former case, determination of mass was carried out as described previously (24Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Kieffer B. Lefevre J.-F. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29847-29856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) on a Brucker Biflex MALDI-TOF-MS equipped with SCOUT High Resolution Optics with X-Y multisample probe, a gridless reflector, and the HIMAS linear detector. In the second case, protein samples (0.3 mg/ml) were diluted in a water/formic acid solution (99:1, v/v). Mass spectrometry was performed on an MSD 1100 (Hewlett-Packard) single quadrupole mass detector using the positive electrospray ionization mode, and injections were carried out as follows: flow injection analysis mode at 100 μl/min; capillary voltage, 4000 V; capillary exit voltage, 150 V; nitrogen drying gas flow, 8 liters/min, 325 °C. All chemical assays were performed on a Cobas-Fara Centrifugal Analyzer (Hoffmann-La Roche). Total cholesterol was measured by an enzymatic method using Roche Molecular Biochemicals reagents. Protein concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce) according to Smith et al. (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Mixtures containing purified human CETP and various amounts of isolated plasma LDL and HDL were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. As shown in Fig.1 A, the rate of transfer of radiolabeled cholesteryl esters from a constant amount of [3H]CE-HDL3 (cholesterol, 50 nmol/ml) to LDL increased gradually as the LDL cholesterol levels rose from 12.5 up to 400 nmol/ml. At a constant amount of [3H]CE-LDL (cholesterol, 50 nmol/ml), a rise in cholesteryl ester transfer could be observed only with low amounts of unlabeled HDL acceptors, not exceeding 25 nmol/ml HDL cholesterol. In direct contrast with LDL, and for HDL cholesterol levels greater than 25 nmol/ml, cholesteryl ester transfers were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). An approximately 75% inhibition of CETP activity was reached with the highest HDL cholesterol dose (400 nmol/ml) as compared with the maximal cholesteryl ester transfer rate measured with the optimal 25 nmol/ml cholesterol dose (Fig. 1 B). Total HDL apolipoproteins from normolipidemic human plasma were separated on a polyacrylamide gradient gel, and up to 30 distinct protein fractions, with mean molecular masses ranging from approximately 80 down to 2 kDa, were finally obtained after electroelution in CAPS buffer (see “Materials and Methods”). Individual protein fractions were then analyzed for their ability to inhibit the CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester transfer reaction as measured from [3H]CE-LDL toward HDL. As shown in Fig.2, several fractions displayed a substantial inhibitory activity, with fraction 26 showing the strongest inhibition. The nearly complete blockade of the lipid transfer process that was obtained with fraction 26 contrasted clearly with the discrete, approximately 25% inhibition that was observed with the same volume of other protein fractions of larger size (Fig. 2). Fraction 26 was then further purified and concentrated through a second passage on the preparative electrophoresis apparatus. The analysis of the protein composition of fraction 26 by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a major protein component with an apparent molecular mass that was slightly lower than 6.5 kDa (Fig.2). After automatic Edman degradation, a predominant sequence of 26 residues (XPDVSSALDKLKQFGNTLEDKARELI) was determined, together with a minor sequence resulting from a proteolytic cleavage between P2 and D3. Comparison with sequences included in the SWISS PROT Data Bank was performed using the ClustalV multiple alignment program (26Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the deduced sequence was identified as the N-terminal fragment of the processed apolipoprotein C-I (P 02654; Ref. 27Shulman R.S. Herbert P.N. Wehrly K. Frederickson D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 182-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF-MS indicated an experimental value of 6627, corresponding to the m/z ratio of processed apoC-I. An N-terminal threonine residue could not be identified, and a glutamine residue in position 13 took the place of a glutamic acid. The inhibitory potency of fraction 26 was completely blocked with specific anti-apoC-I antibodies (Fig. 3). In addition, it is noteworthy that cholesteryl ester transfer activity in control mixtures was even further increased in the presence of anti-apoC-I antibodies, with an approximately 40% increment in cholesteryl ester transfer rates in anti-apoC-I-treated mixtures as compared with controls (p < 0.05; Fig. 3). In contrast to anti-apoC-I antibodies, anti-apoC-III antibodies did not alter the inhibitory effect of fraction 26 (Fig. 3).Figure 2Determination of the ability of isolated HDL apolipoprotein fractions to inhibit CETP activity. HDL apolipoprotein fractions (numbers 6–30) were obtained by preparative electrophoresis as described under “Materials and Methods.” [3H]CE-LDL (50 nmol/ml), HDL (200 nmol/ml), and partially purified CETP (4.5 μg) were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the absence or in the presence of a 15-μl aliquot of individual HDL apolipoprotein fraction. Inhibition of CETP activity was expressed as the percentage of reduction in the cholesteryl ester transfer rate relative to control mixtures in which the 15-μl apolipoprotein aliquot was replaced by 15 μl of CAPS buffer. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Effect of anti-apoC-I and anti-apo-C-III antibodies on cholesteryl ester transfer inhibition by fraction 26. Mixtures containing [3H]CE-LDL (cholesterol, 50 nmol/ml) and HDL (cholesterol, 200 nmol/ml) were preincubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of fraction 26 (3.8 μg of protein; + fraction #26 samples), in the presence of anti-apoC-I antibodies (10 μg of IgG; + anti C-I samples), in the presence of anti-apoC-III antibodies (10 μg of IgG; + anti C-IIIsamples), in the presence of both fraction 26 and anti-apoC-I antibodies (+ fraction #26 + anti C-I samples), or in the presence of both fraction 26 and anti-apoC-III antibodies (+ fraction #26 + anti C-III samples). 50-μl mixtures were supplemented with partially purified CETP (4.5 μg) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cholesteryl ester transfer rates were determined as described under “Materials and Methods,” and data were expressed relative to control mixtures containing only CETP and lipoprotein substrates. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations (significantly different from control: p< 0.0001 (a), p < 0.01 (b),p < 0.05 (c); significantly different from+ fraction #26: p < 0.0001 (d); Mann-Whitney test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In complementary experiments, apolipoprotein C-I was completely purified by using an independent, chromatofocusing procedure that took advantage of the high isoelectric point of apoC-I as compared with other HDL apolipoprotein components. Purified apoC-I appeared as a homogenous band on polyacrylamide gel with the same apparent molecular weight as the main protein component of fraction 26 (Fig.4). Its molecular mass determined by the MSD 1100 single quadrupole mass detector was 6630 kDa, and partial analysis of the N-terminal sequence matched the apoC-I sequence (results not shown). In incubation mixtures containing LDL, HDL, and purified CETP, pure apoC-I could completely block cholesteryl ester transfer activity, with an IC50 value of approximately 100 nmol/liter (Fig. 5).Figure 5Concentration-dependent inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer activity by apoC-I.50-μl mixtures containing [3H]CE-LDL (cholesterol, 50 nmol/ml), HDL (cholesterol, 200 nmol/ml) and partially purified CETP (4.5 μg) were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of increasing amounts of purified apoC-I (0–3.7 μg/ml). Cholesteryl ester transfer rates were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods,” and data were expressed as relative to control. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to determine the inhibitory effect of apoC-I not only as a pure apolipoprotein but also as one component of the HDL protein moiety, the effect of total delipidated HDL apolipoproteins on CETP activity was further studied. As shown in Fig.6, total delipidated HDL apolipoproteins could markedly inhibit the rate of transfer of cholesteryl esters. The inhibition could be completely blocked by anti-apoC-I antibodies, whereas anti-apoC-III antibodies were without any effect. Total native plasma HDL were subsequently passed through an anti-apoC-I affinity column. As a result, most of the apoC-I bound to the anti-apoC-I immunoaffinity column, and the unbound HDL fraction retained most of the protein composition of normal HDL, with apoA-I and apoA-II constituting the two major components (results not shown). The bound fraction contained mainly apoC-I, together with apoA-I that constituted the most abundant coeluted protein. Again, native plasma HDL could markedly inhibit CETP activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory potency of HDL was strongly diminished as the result of the reduction in the apoC-I content of HDL, and a considerable rise in cholesteryl ester transfer rates was constantly observed along the HDL concentration range studied (results not shown). The removal of most of apoC-I from HDL of six distinct plasma samples was accompanied by a mean 43% increase in the rate of cholesteryl ester transfers that were measured in the presence of 200 nmol/ml HDL cholesterol (p < 0.005) (Fig. 7). In human plasma, one single protein, i.e. the CETP, accounts for the exchange of neutral lipid species between lipoprotein particles. CETP can interact with all the plasma lipoprotein fractions, and the velocity as well as the direction of net mass transfers are actually dependent on several parameters, including the concentration of CETP as well as the relative proportions and compositions of lipoprotein donors and acceptors (28Lagrost L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 209-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As shown in the present study, there is a major difference between HDL and LDL in terms of their ability to exchange cholesteryl ester molecules through the CETP-mediated lipid transfer reaction. Unlike LDL, HDL can markedly reduce the lipid transfer reaction in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to the blockade of the CETP-mediated transfer between LDL and HDL in the presence of high HDL concentrations. These observations are in good agreement with former kinetic studies that were conducted by Barter and Jones (1Barter P.J. Jones M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 238-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with lipoprotein-free plasma as a CETP source, and by Ihm et al.(2Ihm J. Quinn D.M. Bush S.J. Chataing B. Harmony J.A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1328-1341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by using purified lipid transfer complex. Initially, the HDL-mediated inhibition of CETP activity was explained in terms of a greater interaction of CETP with HDL than with LDL, favoring HDL-HDL transfers at the expense of LDL-HDL t"

In contrast, the mechanism of the transfer of folates into mitochondria, presumably from the cytosol, is largely unknown as is the release of folates back into the cytosol from the mitochondria. Once the folate monoglutamates, the form of folate found in the circulation, enter the mammalian cells they are quickly metabolized to poly-γ-glutamate derivatives by cytosolic folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), a process needed to promote the retention of folate cofactors in cells (9Shane B.

The cDNA encoding this protein was isolated from a human library by complementation of a mutant cell line, which lacked this function (15Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Arch. Biochem.

The cDNA complemented both the cellular phenotype, converting transfectants to prototrophy for glycine (Fig. 4), and the biochemical deficiency, allowing folate transport into mitochondria in transfectants (Table I). This finding appears to rule out complementation of the auxotrophy by an indirect effect of the expressed gene. Overall, this manuscript describes the first human protein identified to transport folates or, to our knowledge, any vitamin across the inner mitochondrial membrane (32Scharfe C. Zaccaria P.

The active form of the carriers is thought to form homodimers (38Klingenberg M. Nature. 1981; 290: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), which together create a 12-TM unit similar to plasma membrane transporters, such as the reduced folate carrier (39Dixon K.H.

Saier M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The predicted hMFT protein has several properties, which identify it as a new member of the family of inner mitochondrial membrane transport proteins. The protein has a predicted size within the range for the several previously reported inner mitochondrial membrane transporters (28–34 kDa) (24Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 25Kuan J. Saier M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33Saraste M.

Chem. 1982; 363: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and has a predicted primary structure suggestive of six TM domains. Inner mitochondrial membrane transporters can be divided into three repeated segments, each of about 100 amino acids in length. The repeats consist of two TM domains and a mitochondrial ES motif, PX(D/E)X(L/I/V/A/T)(R/K)X(L/R/H)(L/I/V/M/F/Y)(Q/G/A/I/V/M) (24Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 26Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 42Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which is found immediately after TM domains 1, 3, and 5. These signals are thought to be required for mitochondrial targeting, translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane, and insertion into the inner membrane (43Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 44Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The hMFT carrier contains three repeat segments, each containing a consensus ES motif located precisely after TM domains 1, 3, and 5 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the first ES motif located after TM1 is a perfect match to the consensus, whereas the second and third motifs do not have a Asp or Glu at position 3. The second motif has a Trp at position 3, and the third motif has a Gln at position 3; these same deviations from the overall consensus are seen for the flx-related family members (Fig. 3). Given that the function of the second and third ES signals is thought to involve binding to inner membrane proteins necessary for tracking and insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane (44Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), this structural difference apparently unique to the flx subfamily is very intriguing. A recent comparison of sequence homologies among 200 recognizable mitochondrial carrier open reading frames (42Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) identified a small group of proteins, which have PIW or PLW in the second energy signature motif; hMFT clearly belongs to this subgroup. Alignment of these repeats in hMFT with other members of the PIW-PLW subgroup of this protein family revealed regions of high homology and several residues that are absolutely conserved among the family members (Fig. 3). Thus, in addition to the PX(D/E)XX(R/K) energy signature immediately after TMs 1, 3, and 5, there are two other recognizable conserved regions in this limited series: an ES-related weaker consensus of Y(D/E)XX(K/R) is located after TMs 2, 4, and 6, and a (D/E)GX(R/K)G-(L/F)Y(K/R)G motif is located immediately before TMs 2, 4, and 6. These homologies help the assignment of TM domains within the sequence and presumably involve interactions that are essential to transporter membrane positioning and function, such as the charge interactions previously described (42Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Open reading frames closely related to hMFT were easily identified by computer searches against those genomes sequenced to date. A systematic search of the yeast database (42Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) identified 35 inner mitochondrial membrane transporters based on homology to known family members of which the function of eight can currently be assigned. BLAST searches of the yeast genome revealed several proteins homologous to hMFT. The most closely related yeast putative transporters were YEL006w and YIL006w (Fig. 3), which were each 27% identical to hMFT at the amino acid level. However, when we cloned these genes from yeast DNA by PCR and transfected them individually and together intoglyB cells in the pcDNA3 vector, they were unable to support the growth of glyB cells under selective conditions (data not shown). A BLAST search performed against theCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes using the hMFT protein sequence as probe, identified at least 25 related members in each genome based on homology in the placement of ES motifs in a tripartite protein and the position of critical amino acids.It is interesting to note that glyB cells do not accumulate folates in the cytosol to the same extent as either the wild type CHO-K1 cells from which they were derived or the CHO-derived viral transductant or plasmid transfectants with the hmft gene (Table I). This observation would appear to support the concept that folate polyglutamates made in the mitochondria can support folate metabolism in the cytosol of mammalian cells apparently by direct transfer of folate polyglutamates that are intact from the mitochondria. This transfer had been hypothesized (45Qi H.A.I. Xiao S. Choi Y.J. Tobimatsu T. Shane B. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) based on the fact that the naturally occurring transcripts for mitochondrial FPGS (11Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar) or indeed the artificial transcripts constructed by ligation of model mitochondrial leader sequences to human cytosolic FPGS (46Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) can support both cytosolic and mitochondrial folate metabolism. At face value, the data of Table I suggest that half of the folate pool in the cytosol stems from the activity of mitochondrial FPGS. This fact raises questions about the ability of folate antimetabolites to use the hMFT and also whether mitochondrial folate polyglutamates use this transporter for efflux to the cytosol.The fact that mammalian cells, which lack folate transport into mitochondria, are glycine auxotrophs (15Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but can otherwise survive leads to the somewhat surprising conclusion that all mitochondrial folate metabolism can be dispensed with except for the folate-dependent supply of glycine. The glyBphenotype is not peculiar to these cells. AUXB1 cells, which lack all FPGS activity, can be reconstituted with cDNAs encoding only the cytosolic isoform of FPGS; these transfectants have intact cytosolic folate metabolism but are unable to accumulate folates in the mitochondria and are simple glycine auxotrophs (11Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, exogenous glycine can be delivered to the mitochondria, presumably through the cytosol, and can easily penetrate the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Hence, the glycine auxotrophy ofglyB cells indicates that cytosolic SHMT cannot supply glycine for mitochondrial metabolism at any appreciable concentration. This finding is in accordance with the current thought that cytosolic SHMT is kinetically controlled and funnels serine to glycine for the production of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for cytosolic 1-carbon metabolism (47Kastanos E.K. Woldman Y.Y. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, other reactions, e.g. de novo purine synthesis and cytosolic protein synthesis, must consume cytosolic glycine as soon as it is produced. It should be noted that the experiments of Taylor and Hanna (15Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showed that the glycine auxotrophy of the glyB cells can be reversed by high concentrations of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, a fact that has never been explained. Thus, the operation of mitochondrial folate metabolism and the related interconversions of glycine and serine have yet to be well understood despite decades of experimental work. In mammalian cells, the processes of folate metabolism are distributed between the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments (1Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial folates amount to about 35% of the total cellular pool (2Cook R.J. Blair J.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Wang F.K. Kock J. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochem. Z. 1967; 346: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar) and are used as cofactors for a mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT)1 by the glycine cleavage system and for the synthesis of the formylmethionine initiator of mitochondrial protein synthesis. The transport of folates through the plasma membrane into the cytosol has been extensively studied (4Kamen B.A. Wang M. Streckfuss A.J. Peryea X. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13602-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 6Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S.

Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of the transfer of folates into mitochondria, presumably from the cytosol, is largely unknown as is the release of folates back into the cytosol from the mitochondria. Once the folate monoglutamates, the form of folate found in the circulation, enter the mammalian cells they are quickly metabolized to poly-γ-glutamate derivatives by cytosolic folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), a process needed to promote the retention of folate cofactors in cells (9Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 263-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). FPGS is also present in the mitochondrial compartment of mammalian cells (10Lin B.-F. Huang R.-F. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21674-21679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) translated from transcripts from the FPGS gene, which add a mitochondrial leader sequence to the coding region of the protein found in the cytosol (11Freemantle S.J.

Inner mitochondrial membrane transporters can be divided into three repeated segments, each of about 100 amino acids in length. The repeats consist of two TM domains and a mitochondrial ES motif, PX(D/E)X(L/I/V/A/T)(R/K)X(L/R/H)(L/I/V/M/F/Y)(Q/G/A/I/V/M) (24Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 26Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 42Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which is found immediately after TM domains 1, 3, and 5. These signals are thought to be required for mitochondrial targeting, translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane, and insertion into the inner membrane (43Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 44Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The hMFT carrier contains three repeat segments, each containing a consensus ES motif located precisely after TM domains 1, 3, and 5 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the first ES motif located after TM1 is a perfect match to the consensus, whereas the second and third motifs do not have a Asp or Glu at position 3. The second motif has a Trp at position 3, and the third motif has a Gln at position 3; these same deviations from the overall consensus are seen for the flx-related family members (Fig. 3). Given that the function of the second and third ES signals is thought to involve binding to inner membrane proteins necessary for tracking and insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane (44Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), this structural difference apparently unique to the flx subfamily is very intriguing. A recent comparison of sequence homologies among 200 recognizable mitochondrial carrier open reading frames (42Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) identified a small group of proteins, which have PIW or PLW in the second energy signature motif; hMFT clearly belongs to this subgroup. Alignment of these repeats in hMFT with other members of the PIW-PLW subgroup of this protein family revealed regions of high homology and several residues that are absolutely conserved among the family members (Fig. 3). Thus, in addition to the PX(D/E)XX(R/K) energy signature immediately after TMs 1, 3, and 5, there are two other recognizable conserved regions in this limited series: an ES-related weaker consensus of Y(D/E)XX(K/R) is located after TMs 2, 4, and 6, and a (D/E)GX(R/K)G-(L/F)Y(K/R)G motif is located immediately before TMs 2, 4, and 6. These homologies help the assignment of TM domains within the sequence and presumably involve interactions that are essential to transporter membrane positioning and function, such as the charge interactions previously described (42Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Open reading frames closely related to hMFT were easily identified by computer searches against those genomes sequenced to date. A systematic search of the yeast database (42Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) identified 35 inner mitochondrial membrane transporters based on homology to known family members of which the function of eight can currently be assigned. BLAST searches of the yeast genome revealed several proteins homologous to hMFT. The most closely related yeast putative transporters were YEL006w and YIL006w (Fig. 3), which were each 27% identical to hMFT at the amino acid level. However, when we cloned these genes from yeast DNA by PCR and transfected them individually and together intoglyB cells in the pcDNA3 vector, they were unable to support the growth of glyB cells under selective conditions (data not shown). A BLAST search performed against theCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes using the hMFT protein sequence as probe, identified at least 25 related members in each genome based on homology in the placement of ES motifs in a tripartite protein and the position of critical amino acids.It is interesting to note that glyB cells do not accumulate folates in the cytosol to the same extent as either the wild type CHO-K1 cells from which they were derived or the CHO-derived viral transductant or plasmid transfectants with the hmft gene (Table I). This observation would appear to support the concept that folate polyglutamates made in the mitochondria can support folate metabolism in the cytosol of mammalian cells apparently by direct transfer of folate polyglutamates that are intact from the mitochondria. This transfer had been hypothesized (45Qi H.A.I. Xiao S. Choi Y.J. Tobimatsu T. Shane B. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) based on the fact that the naturally occurring transcripts for mitochondrial FPGS (11Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar) or indeed the artificial transcripts constructed by ligation of model mitochondrial leader sequences to human cytosolic FPGS (46Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) can support both cytosolic and mitochondrial folate metabolism. At face value, the data of Table I suggest that half of the folate pool in the cytosol stems from the activity of mitochondrial FPGS. This fact raises questions about the ability of folate antimetabolites to use the hMFT and also whether mitochondrial folate polyglutamates use this transporter for efflux to the cytosol.The fact that mammalian cells, which lack folate transport into mitochondria, are glycine auxotrophs (15Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but can otherwise survive leads to the somewhat surprising conclusion that all mitochondrial folate metabolism can be dispensed with except for the folate-dependent supply of glycine. The glyBphenotype is not peculiar to these cells. AUXB1 cells, which lack all FPGS activity, can be reconstituted with cDNAs encoding only the cytosolic isoform of FPGS; these transfectants have intact cytosolic folate metabolism but are unable to accumulate folates in the mitochondria and are simple glycine auxotrophs (11Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, exogenous glycine can be delivered to the mitochondria, presumably through the cytosol, and can easily penetrate the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Hence, the glycine auxotrophy ofglyB cells indicates that cytosolic SHMT cannot supply glycine for mitochondrial metabolism at any appreciable concentration. This finding is in accordance with the current thought that cytosolic SHMT is kinetically controlled and funnels serine to glycine for the production of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for cytosolic 1-carbon metabolism (47Kastanos E.K. Woldman Y.Y. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, other reactions, e.g. de novo purine synthesis and cytosolic protein synthesis, must consume cytosolic glycine as soon as it is produced. It should be noted that the experiments of Taylor and Hanna (15Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showed that the glycine auxotrophy of the glyB cells can be reversed by high concentrations of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, a fact that has never been explained. Thus, the operation of mitochondrial folate metabolism and the related interconversions of glycine and serine have yet to be well understood despite decades of experimental work. We hereby report the isolation of a novel gene encoding a protein that facilitates the translocation of folates from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix of mammalian cells. The cDNA encoding this protein was isolated from a human library by complementation of a mutant cell line, which lacked this function (15Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cDNA complemented both the cellular phenotype, converting transfectants to prototrophy for glycine (Fig. 4), and the biochemical deficiency, allowing folate transport into mitochondria in transfectants (Table I). This finding appears to rule out complementation of the auxotrophy by an indirect effect of the expressed gene. Overall, this manuscript describes the first human protein identified to transport folates or, to our knowledge, any vitamin across the inner mitochondrial membrane (32Scharfe C. Zaccaria P. Hoertnagel K. Jaksch M. Klopstock T. Dembowski M. Lill R. Prokish H. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Mewes H.W. Meitinger T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The family of inner mitochondrial membrane transport proteins from yeast and vertebrates consists of several well characterized members, which transport cations (glutamine, acylcarnitines/carnitine, spermine, and ornithine), anions (ATP/ADP, oxoglutarate, citrate, pyruvate, dicarboxylates, Pi, aspartate/glutarate, and branched keto acids), and flavins as well as the H+ ions involved in the uncoupling reaction; each of these proteins is a six-TM domain transporter (33Saraste M.

The active form of the carriers is thought to form homodimers (38Klingenberg M. Nature. 1981; 290: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), which together create a 12-TM unit similar to plasma membrane transporters, such as the reduced folate carrier (39Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the thiamine carrier (40Fleming J.C. Tartaglini E. Steinkamp M.P.

The predicted hMFT protein has several properties, which identify it as a new member of the family of inner mitochondrial membrane transport proteins. The protein has a predicted size within the range for the several previously reported inner mitochondrial membrane transporters (28–34 kDa) (24Palmieri F.

https://openalex.org/W1973949165,"Members of the Ikaros family of transcription factors, Ikaros, Aiolos, and Helios, are expressed in lymphocytes and have been implicated in controlling lymphoid development. These proteins contain two characteristic clusters of zinc fingers, an N-terminal domain important for DNA recognition, and a C-terminal domain that mediates homo- and heterotypic associations between family members. The conservation of these domains is such that all three proteins recognize related DNA sequences, and all are capable of dimerizing with other family members. Here we describe two additional Ikaros family proteins, Eos and Pegasus. Eos is most highly related to Helios and shares its DNA binding and protein association properties. Pegasus is related to other Ikaros proteins in its C-terminal dimerization domain but contains a divergent N-terminal zinc finger domain. Pegasus self-associates and binds to other family members but recognizes distinct DNA-binding sites. Eos and Pegasus repress the expression of reporter genes containing their recognition elements. Our results suggest that these proteins may associate with previously described Ikaros family proteins in lymphoid cells and play additional roles in other tissues.

Moore D.D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Ikaros was shown to play a crucial role in regulating the production of T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells (2Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.H. Molnár A. Wu P. Winandy S. Sharpe A. Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 3Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev.

The full-length Ikaros transcript encodes a zinc finger protein (Ik-1), containing a cluster of four fingers near its N terminus and two additional fingers at its C terminus, but alternative splicing generates at least five additional isoforms (Ik-2 to Ik-6), which contain different subsets of the N-terminal fingers (5Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The N-terminal zinc finger domain has been shown to be the major determinant of DNA recognition in vitro, and it has been demonstrated that, in general, only splice isoforms that contain three or more N-terminal zinc fingers bind DNA (6Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Although the sequence specificity of these isoforms varies slightly, they all recognize related elements containing the central core sequence GGGA (the consensus recognized by splice forms Ik-1, -2, and -3 in vitro is tGGGAatacc, where uppercase letters show the most highly conserved residues). Unlike the N-terminal zinc fingers, the two C-terminal fingers are present in all Ikaros splice isoforms. It is thought that the major role of these fingers is to mediate the self-association of Ikaros proteins (7Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The full role of dimerization in Ikaros activity is not completely understood, but it is known that dimerization contributes to the ability of Ikaros to bind DNA. Ikaros monomers, containing only the N-terminal zinc fingers, however, recognize the same sites as dimers (6Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), so dimerization is clearly not essential for DNA binding. Composite double (direct repeat or palindromic) Ikaros binding sites have also been described, and it may be that dimerization is particularly important in the recognition of these elements. The zinc fingers may also be involved in the formation of larger DNA-protein complexes, and there is evidence that higher order complexes containing multiple Ikaros proteins may exist (8Kim J. Sif S.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The in vivo relevance of the Ikaros dimerization domain has been demonstrated by experiments in cell lines, mice, and investigations of human leukemia. It has been shown that mutant Ikaros isoforms, containing only the C-terminal dimerization domain, behave as dominant negative mutants that impair the ability of Ikaros to activate transcription in cellular assays (6Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and give rise to an aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia in mice (4Winandy S. Wu P. Georgopoulos K. Cell. 1995; 83: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Human infants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia have also been shown to express an aberrant Ikaros mRNA, encoding the two C-terminal fingers but lacking the region encoding the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (9Sun L. Heerema N. Crotty L. Wu X. Navara C. Vassilev A. Sensel M. Reaman G.H. Uckun F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Sun L. Goodman P.A.

Oncol. 1999; 17: 3753-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal zinc fingers of any Ikaros isoform can mediate interactions with any other Ikaros isoform (7Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or indeed with additional Ikaros family members (see below) and potentially influence their DNA binding and transcriptional properties, the precise mechanism by which these dominant negative mutants function in vivohas not been easy to determine. In addition to the six Ikaros isoforms, there are two well characterized Ikaros related proteins encoded by distinct loci. The first to be described was Aiolos (11Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N. Andrikopoulos K. Ikeda T. Gonzales E. Wu P. Neben S. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2004-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Like the longest splice isoform of Ikaros (Ik-1), Aiolos contains four N-terminal zinc fingers and two C-terminal fingers. The homology to Ikaros in these domains is such that Aiolos exhibits the same DNA binding specificity and dimerization activities as Ikaros. No splice variants of Aiolos have been reported in mammals. The next protein to be isolated was Helios (12Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I.L. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 782-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Kelley C.M. Ikeda T. Koipally J. Avitahl N. Wu L. Georgopoulos K. Morgan B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 508-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two splice forms of Helios have been reported; the first is similar to full-length Ikaros (Ik-1) in that it encodes four N-terminal zinc fingers and two C-terminal zinc fingers, and the second is analogous to Ik-2 in that it is missing the first zinc finger of the N-terminal domain. Again the conservation between Helios and Ikaros in the zinc finger domains is high, and Helios has been shown to bind the same DNA recognition elements as Ikaros and to homodimerize and heterodimerize with Ikaros or Aiolos. The molecular mechanisms by which Ikaros family proteins regulate gene expression are being intensively investigated. Ik-1 and Ik-2 are predominantly nuclear, and they have been shown to be transcriptionally active (6Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 7Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts transfected with expression plasmids Ik-3 and Ik-4 are localized predominantly to the cytoplasm, and their roles and the functions of Ik-5 and Ik-6, the less abundant isoforms, are less clear (although they may be involved in down regulating the activity of Ik-1 and Ik-2) (6Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Available data suggest that Ik-1 and -2 function as only modest activators in transient transfection experiments, as does Helios, whereas Aiolos behaves as a stronger activator in these assays (6Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 11Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N. Andrikopoulos K. Ikeda T. Gonzales E. Wu P. Neben S. Georgopoulos K.

Biol. 1998; 8: 508-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent results have highlighted the role of Ikaros as a repressor of transcription, at least in certain cell types. Ikaros has been found to localize with inactive genes in centromeric heterochromatin, suggesting a possible role in gene silencing (12Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R.

A. 1998; 95: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Examination of the protein partners bound by Ikaros has revealed that Ikaros can associate with the Sin3 co-repressor proteins (14Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) or be part of the large Mi-2 complex that contains histone deacetylase and chromatin remodelling enzymes (8Kim J. Sif S.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). More recently it has been reported that an N-terminal domain of Ikaros associates with the co-repressor protein CtBP (17Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As described above, the known members of the Ikaros family share many similar features and are all expressed in lymphoid cells. It is notable, however, that Ikaros and Helios are also expressed at low levels in other hematopoietic lineages, such as erythroid cells (12Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I.L. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 782-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Kelley C.M. Ikeda T. Koipally J. Avitahl N. Wu L. Georgopoulos K. Morgan B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 508-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been noted that the C-terminal zinc finger domain of Ikaros is related to the Drosophila regulatory protein Hunchback (1Georgopoulos K. Moore D.D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 18Kehle J. Beuchle D. Treuheit S. Christen B. Kenniston J. Bienz M. Muller J. Science. 1998; 282: 1897-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that Ikaros is a member of an ancient family and that other Ikaros related proteins may exist in mammals and may have roles in diverse cell types. To identify novel Ikaros family proteins, we carried out a two-hybrid screen against a bait protein encompassing a typical C-terminal zinc finger dimerization domain. We chose the domain from Aiolos, because we found that it could readily be expressed at appropriate levels in yeast. Two Ikaros related proteins were identified, and following the convention of assigning names from Greek mythology, we refer to these proteins as Pegasus and Eos, after the winged horse and the goddess of Dawn, who is reputed to have ridden upon his back. Here we report the first characterization of these proteins, their protein binding, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities and compare their expression profiles to those of human Ikaros and Helios. The bait plasmid for use in the two-hybrid screen was generated by cloning the region encoding amino acids 447–507 of murine Aiolos immediately downstream of the segment encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the yeast expression vector, pGBT9 (CLONTECH) to create pGBT9.Aiolos. The other bait plasmids pGBT9·Pegasus, pGBT9·Eos, and pGBT9·Ikaros-2 that were used for assessing interactions between these family members were similarly constructed and contained the full-length coding sequences of these proteins. The corresponding prey plasmids consisted of the Gal4 activation domain in the yeast expression vector pGAD10 upstream of and in frame with the respective sequences encoding full-length Eos, Pegasus, and Ikaros-2. GST1 fusion proteins were produced by inserting relevant cDNA fragments into the plasmid pGEX2T and derivatives (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX2T·Pegasus·F1–3 and pGEX2T·Eos·F1–4 contained the region encoding amino acids 69–173 of Pegasus and 101–230 of Eos, respectively, in frame and downstream of the GST gene. pGEX2T·Pegasus F4–5, pGEX2T·Eos F5–6, pGEX2T·Ikaros F5–6, and pGEX2T·Aiolos F5–6 contained amino acids 361–418, 473–532, 365–431 (Ikaros-2 sequence), and 447–507, respectively, in frame and downstream of the GST gene. Luciferase reporter vectors pGL2-(Ik/Eos)1TK and pGL2-(Peg)2TK contained either a single copy of a typical Ikaros/Eos recognition element (GTACCTCCATAGGGAAAATTATCCTAG) or a double Pegasus recognition site (GATCCCAGCTTTTGAGAATGTAGTACTTCATTCTCTGTCG) upstream of the TK promoter in the vector pGL2-TK (Promega), respectively. The full-length cDNAs of Pegasus and Eos were also subcloned into the multi-cloning site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to create pcDNA3·Pegasus and pcDNA3·Eos, respectively. TheCLONTECH two-hybrid system was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A human K562 erythroleukemia cDNA library in the Gal4 activation domain fusion vector, pGAD10·Gal4AD, was transfected into the yeast strain HF7c, harboring the bait plasmid pGBT9·Aiolos. DNA was recovered from yeast colonies that grew on Trp/Leu/His-deficient medium and used to transform Escherichia coli strain HB101. Plasmid DNA was purified and sequenced. Interactions between Pegasus and Eos and other Ikaros family proteins were investigated by co-transforming HF7c with appropriate bait and prey plasmids. The resulting transformants were selected on Leu/Trp-deficient plates and patched onto Leu/Trp/His-deficient plates. Growth was monitored after incubation at 29 °C for 30 h, and β-galactosidase production was assessed according to standard methods (CLONTECH Matchmaker system protocol). Recombinant GST-Pegasus F4–5, GST-Eos F5–6, GST-Ikaros F5–6, and GST-Aiolos F5–6 were produced in the E. coli strain BL-21, purified as described (19Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. 5 μl of35S-labeled Pegasus or Eos was mixed with 5 μl of agarose bead-protein complex equivalent to 5 μg of fusion protein in 300 μl of pull-down buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μm ZnSO4, 0.1 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, washed four times with pull-down buffer, resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). cDNA from Mo7e/Il-3 cells and the reverse primer 5′-CAGCATGGAGTCTGGCACCATCTC (nucleotides 727–750) were used to obtain Eos full-length clone using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) as described by manufacturer. [35S]Methionine-labeled Pegasus and Eos proteins were produced in vitro using the plasmids pcDNA3·Pegasus and pcDNA3·Eos in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and T7 RNA polymerase (TNT Lysate Coupled Transcription/Translation Protocol, Promega). The reaction products were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Control GST protein and the Pegasus DNA-binding domain GST fusion protein, comprising amino acids 69–173 of Pegasus downstream of GST, were produced in the E. coli strain BL-21. For site selection experiments a degenerate oligonucleotide with a core of 26 random nucleotides flanked by conserved sequences containingBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites was used: CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCG-(N)26-GAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC. The PCR primers used were: primer F, GCTGCAGTTGCACTGAATTCGCCTC, and primer R, CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCG. The random oligonucleotide was rendered double-stranded by annealing with primer F and extension with Klenow enzyme for 30 min at room temperature. Briefly, 110 μg of polyacrylamide gel purified template was mixed with 75 μg of primer F in 1× Klenow reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl) and annealed by boiling and cooling. Deoxynucleotides were added to a final concentration of 400 μm plus 25 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and 25 units of Klenow, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 1× Klenow buffer. The double-stranded template was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 5 μg of GST-Pegasus () bound to GSH beads (5 μl) was incubated on ice for 30 min with 1 ng of the purified random oligonucleotide library and 10 μl of binding buffer (0.2 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), 0.2 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs), 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mmKCl, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) (20Zweidler-McKay P.A. Grimes H.L. Flubacher M.M. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The beads were centrifuged and washed 4 times with binding buffer and boiled for 5 min in 15 μl H2O. The DNA was eluted by boiling, and following 15 cycles of PCR amplification using primers F and R, the product was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used for further binding reactions. After four rounds of selection a gel retardation experiment was carried out using soluble fusion protein. The shifted band was excised, and the DNA amplified as before, digested with EcoRI andBamHI, subcloned into pBlueScriptKS, and sequenced. Gel retardation experiments were carried out using oligonucleotides labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). 500 ng of fusion proteins and labeled probes (10,000 cpm) were incubated in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ZnSO4, 5% glycerol) for 20 min on ice. Then samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C for 2.5 h at 12 V/cm on a native polyacrylamide gel (6%, (19:1) bis: acrylamide in 0.5× TBE). NIH 3T3 and 293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of the reporter plasmids pGL2-TK, pGL2-(Ik/Eos)1TK, or pGL2-(Peg)2TK and increasing amounts of pcDNA3·Pegasus or pcDNA3·Eos (500 ng, 1 μg, 3 μg) using the calcium phosphate method (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.36Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured 24 h post-transfection in a Turner Designs model TD 20/20 luminometer using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). All data are the result of three independent experiments and have been normalized to Renilla luciferase levels derived from a co-transfected plasmid, pRL-CMV (Promega). K562 cells were transfected using electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II system set at 270 V and 960 microfarads. Total RNA was isolated from approximately 5 × 107 cells of the various cell lines by guanidinium isothiocyanate lysis (Trizoll Life Technologies, Inc). Poly(A)+ RNA was then isolated using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 2-μg samples were separated by electrophoresis through formaldehyde agarose gels. The RNAs were then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).32P-Labeled probes containing fragments of Eos (aHindIII-BamHI fragment, nucleotides 686–1092 where the A in the initiating ATG is 1), Pegasus (either a fragment extending from nucleotides 16–347, or aKpnI-SacI fragment, nucleotides 489–924, with numbering starting from the initiating ATG), Ikaros (GenBankTM accession number U40462, nucleotides 1705–2203), and Helios (GenBankTM accession numberAF130863, nucleotides 949–1297) were used as probes, and hybridization was performed under high stringency conditions using ExpressHyb (CLONTECH). The fragments of Eos and Pegasus were also used to probe a commercial Northern filter (CLONTECH) containing RNA samples purified from human tissues. The region encoding the C-terminal dimerization domain of Aiolos was amplified by PCR and cloned into a yeast expression vector downstream of a segment encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to generate a bait for use in a two-hybrid screen. We then carried out the screen using a cDNA library constructed from the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Two partial clones encoding zinc fingers related to the C-terminal fingers of Ikaros family proteins were identified. Full-length clones were then obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (in the case of Eos) and by reverse transcription-PCR after reference to the expressed sequence tag data bases (in the case of Pegasus). In both cDNAs the putative translation initiation sequence conforms well to the Kozak consensus, and in the case of Pegasus, in frame stop codons are found upstream of the first AUG indicating that this is the most 5′ possible start codon. The amino acid sequences of Pegasus and Eos and the other human Ikaros family proteins are shown in Fig. 1. The putative initiation methionine in human Eos is conserved in a related murine Eos sequence that has recently been reported but not yet been analyzed in detail (22Honma Y. Kiyosawa H. Mori T. Oguri A. Nikaido T. Kanazawa K. Tojo M. Takeda J. Tanno Y. Yokoya S. Kawabata I. Ikeda H. Wanaka A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and also aligns well with the first methionine in the related human proteins Ikaros, Helios, and Aiolos. The human Pegasus and Eos cDNAs encode proteins with pI values of 7.27 and 6.86 and predicted molecular weights of 46.5 and 58.5 kDa, respectively. In vitro transcription and translation of these cDNAs produces proteins that migrate at the expected positions on denaturing gels (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1and 2). The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to GenBankTM with accession numbers AF230808 (Pegasus) andAF230809 (Eos).Figure 2Pegasus and Eos physically interact with other Ikaros family proteins. A, lanes 1 and2y show in vitro translated35S-labeled Pegasus and Eos, respectively; the proteins migrate at the predicted molecular weights of 46.5 and 58.5 kDa, respectively. A GST pull-down experiment comparing the ability of the dimerization fingers of Pegasus, Eos, Ikaros, and Aiolos to retain35S-labeled Pegasus and Eos is shown in lanes 3–12. Lanes 3 and 8 show the background retention by GST alone, and the other lanes show that all the fusion proteins were able to retain both Pegasus and Eos.

The potential of the fusion protein Gal4 DNA binding domain/Pegasus to interact with Gal4 activation domain fused to full-length Pegasus, Eos, mIkaros-2, or mAiolos(447–507) was tested. Growth in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (−L−T−H) is indicative of a positive interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As can be seen from Fig. 1, all proteins contain two clusters of zinc fingers but have only limited homology elsewhere. The C-terminal zinc fingers are highly conserved in all proteins, whereas the N-terminal cluster is conserved only in Ikaros, Helios, Eos, and Aiolos. Pegasus, on the other hand, possesses only three N-terminal fingers with quite distinct amino acid sequences. Alternative splicing of exons encoding the N-terminal zinc finger cluster region has been reported in the case of Ikaros and Helios. To ascertain whether Eos and Pegasus were also alternatively spliced in this region we amplified this segment by PCR but have as yet found no evidence for alternate splice forms (data not shown). Eos and Pegasus both contain two C-terminal zinc fingers with considerable homology to the two fingers in the C-terminal dimerization domains of previously reported Ikaros family proteins. We next sought to compare the protein binding ability of Eos and Pegasus C-terminal fingers with those of other Ikaros family members. We prepared purified GST fusions of the C-terminal dimerization domains of Pegasus, Eos, Ikaros, and Aiolos (Fig. 2 B) and tested their ability to retain full-length in vitrotranscribed/translated Pegasus and Eos (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 A, all the C-terminal zinc finger domains tested efficiently retained both Eos and Pegasus. Similar results were obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system. In Fig. 2 C a bait plasmid encoding the two C-terminal zinc fingers of Pegasus is tested and shown to interact with Ikaros, Aiolos, Helios, Eos, and Pegasus itself. The zinc finger domain of Eos has been similarly tested, and it too was found to be capable of mediating interactions with all known Ikaros family members (data not shown). These results demonstrate that both Eos and Pegasus contain functional dimerization domains that can mediate both homotypic interactions and heterotypic associations with other family members. We next investigated the DNA binding activities of these proteins. We first tested the proteins for their ability to bind a typical Ikaros recognition element (GGGAA) that is recognized by all previously described Ikaros family proteins. Given that the N-terminal finger domain has been shown to dictate DNA binding specificity and that GST fusion proteins containing only the N-terminal fingers of Ikaros bind DNA with the expected specificity (6Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), we produced the N-terminal domains of Eos and Pegasus as GST fusions (Fig. 3 B) and tested them for their ability to bind a consensus Ikaros recognition site. As shown in Fig. 3 A (lanes 1–3), the GST-Eos fusion protein recognized and bound this element with high affinity, whereas the GST-Pegasus fusion and control GST protein alone showed no binding. To further examine the DNA binding specificities of Eos and Pegasus, we then tested three sequences previously reported to be recognized by Ikaros in vitro: the T-cell receptor-α promoter site (TGGAGGGAAGTGGGAAACTTTT), the NF-κB promoter site (CAGGGAATCTCCCTCTCCAT) and CD3-δ promoter site (GTTTCCATGGACATCATGAATGGGAGT). Mobility shift assays showed that in each case GST-Eos was able to recognize these sequences. GST-Pegasus, however, did not bind any of these sites with high affinity (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–12). These results indicate that the Eos DNA-binding domain functions similarly to those of Ikaros and previously reported family members. On the other hand Pegasus appeared to bind the Ikaros recognition sites very weakly if at a"

We have analyzed this structure in chicken follicles and laid eggs and have identified a 95-kDa component of the pvm, which, by protein sequencing, shows homology to mammalian zona pellucida proteins. Surprisingly, we could not detect this protein in ovarian granulosa cells or oocytes but instead found high levels in the liver of the laying hen. In contrast, it is absent in rooster liver but can be efficiently induced by estrogen treatment of the animal. An immunoscreen of a liver λ-ZAP library yielded a cDNA coding for a protein of 934 amino acids. It displayed significant homology to members of the ZP1/ZPB family from other species, notably to mouse and rat ZP1, and was therefore designated chkZP1. It is clearly different from a protein designated chkZPB that had been deposited in the data base previously. Alignment of the known members of the ZP1/ZPB family demonstrated the existence of at least three subgroups, with representatives of both the ZP1 and the ZPB sequence homology group occurring in vertebrates. Northern blot analysis of liver extracts revealed the presence of a single 3.2-kilobase mRNA coding for chkZP1, distinct from the chkZPB transcript detectable in follicles. Immunohistochemical analysis of follicle sections demonstrates that chkZP1 can be found in the blood vessels of the theca cell layer as well as in the pvm surrounding the oocyte. Thus, in the chicken, at least one of the major pvm components is synthesized in the liver and is transported via the bloodstream to the follicle.

Zool. 1999; 285: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This structure represents the initial sperm-binding site, participates in the induction of the acrosome reaction, and mediates the prevention of polyspermy. In mammals, the zona pellucida is composed of three component glycoproteins, called ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, (also known as ZPB, ZPA, and ZPC, respectively) (5Harris J.D. Hibler D.W. Fontenot G.K. Hsu K.T. Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. DNA Seq. 1994; 4: 361-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), that show significant conservation across all species studied. The classification of these proteins often has been difficult because of their extensive heterogeneity, which is due to multiple posttranslational modifications. In many cases it has been possible to make unambiguous assignments to particular gene families only after isolation of the cDNAs. Although the different polypeptides are highly conserved, they show large differences in their functional properties (6Prasad S.V. Skinner S.M. Dunbar B.S. Coufaris C. Mastroianni L. New Horizons in Reproductive Medicine. Parthenon Publishing, New York1997: 129-144Google Scholar). Thus, the primary sperm receptor in mouse appears to be ZP3 through its O-linked oligosaccharides (7Wassarman P.M. J. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 1990; 42: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the rabbit the ZP1 homologue (8Prasad S.V. Wilkins B. Skinner S.M. Dunbar B.S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 43: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and in the pig, a heterodimer between ZPB (ZP1) and ZPC (ZP3), is thought to possess sperm binding activity (9Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. Gupta S.K. Xu N. Gage D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7488-7494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sperm binding in the pig appears to be mediated not by O-linked but rather byN-linked carbohydrates (10Yonezawa N. Mitsui S. Kudo K. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Yonezawa N. Aoki H. Hatanaka Y. Nakano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Oocytes of oviparous species are large when compared with those of mammals. In the chicken, the pvm1 is composed of two layers, an inner layer, deposited in the preovulatory phase, and an outer layer, added during passage through the oviduct; these layers are separated by a thin membrane (2Bellairs R. Harkness M. Harkness R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1963; 8: 339-359Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This membrane and the outer layer are added to the inner membrane only after ovulation, i.e.during migration of the oocyte through the oviduct (12Back J.F. Bain J.M. Vadehra D.V. Burley R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Kido S. Morimoto A. Kim F. Doi Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For successful fertilization to occur, sperm first has to bind to the pvm, a process that is species-specific (14O'Rand M.G. Gamete Res. 1988; 19: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and then penetrate it (15Liu D.Y. Baker H.W. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The outer layer appears to be involved in a block to polyspermy via the acrosome reaction (16Barros C. Crosby J.A. Moreno R.D. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite the long history of ultrastructural studies on the chicken follicle (2Bellairs R. Harkness M. Harkness R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1963; 8: 339-359Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), little is known about the molecular details of the composition of the pvm. Of the major bands obtained on SDS-polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis of laid egg pvm under reducing conditions, all but two are outer layer components. Of these two, one protein of 34 kDa has been characterized (17Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Takeuchi Y. Nishimura K. Aoki N. Adachi T. Sato C. Kitajima K. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This protein is a homologue of the mammalian ZP3/ZPC; it has been demonstrated to be synthesized exclusively by the granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte and is secreted in a polarized fashion (17Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The nature of the other band had been unclear. In this paper, we report the characterization, molecular cloning, site of expression, and localization of this protein and its identification as an avian ZP1 homologue. We also show that it is clearly different from a related protein designated chkZPB. 30–40-week-old Derco-brown laying hens and roosters (Heindl Co., Vienna, Austria) were used as a source for eggs, follicles, and tissues. Antibodies were raised in adult female New Zealand White rabbits (see below). Perivitelline membranes from chicken eggs or ovarian follicles were obtained as described (17Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, for isolation of pvm from freshly laid eggs, yolk was drained from oocytes by puncturing the membranes after removal of egg white. The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.6) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 200 mm Tris·maleate (pH 6.5), 2 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm leupeptin, and 1.4% Triton X-100. After centrifugation for 40 min at 4 °C at 300,000 × g, the detergent-pretreated membranes were solubilized in the equivalent of 0.2 ml/egg of Tris-buffered saline containing 2% SDS and 50 mm dithiothreitol. Insoluble constituents were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. For isolation of pvm from follicles, ovaries were dissected from mature laying hens immediately after decapitation. Granulosa cell sheets containing the inner pvm as well as granulosa cells and basement membranes were prepared from follicles larger than 2 cm in diameter as described (19Gilbert A.B. Evans A.J. Perry M.M. Davidson M.H. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1977; 50: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The protocol for subsequent solubilization was identical to the one for pvm from laid eggs. Chicken pvm proteins were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE (4.5–18%) under reducing conditions. The 95-kDa band was cut out and eluted electrophoretically at 180 V for 8 h in 25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, pH 8.3, containing 0.1% SDS. Microsequencing of tryptic digests was performed essentially as described (20Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three sequence fragments were characterized, designated 95.1 (the N-terminal peptide, LLQYHYDCRDFGMQLLAYP), t2 (TQLVPVGPATLQLPF), and t3.1 (PGLXXPGLPSXPGLVS), respectively. A 190-kDa band present under nonreducing conditions (see Fig. 2) had the same N-terminal sequence as the 95-kDa species and is presumably a dimeric form of this protein. Subsequently, synthetic peptides were obtained corresponding to fragments 95.1 and t2, coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce), and used to raise antisera in rabbits. Three series of intradermal injections of 500 μg of each of the antigens in a total volume of 400 μl, mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete (day 0) or incomplete (days 14 and 35) adjuvant were administered to the animals. Additionally, an antiserum directed against the entire gel-purified 95-kDa protein (anti-p95 antiserum) was raised according to the same protocol. Preimmune and immune sera were stored at −80 °C. A laying hen liver λ ZAPII cDNA library (Takara) was grown and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-soaked filters. 1 × 106 plaques were screened with polyclonal anti-p95 antiserum (see above) according to standard methods (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) as modified by the picoBlue™ immunoscreening kit (Stratagene). Four positive clones were picked, and the released phage particles were grown in XL1-Blue MRF′ cells that were coinfected with ExAssist™ helper phage for in vivo excision using the ExAssist/SOLR system (Stratagene). All clones obtained were sequenced on both strands. The phage were digested with several restriction enzymes and recloned into BlueScript vectors, and the contig sequences were determined on an ABI sequencer. Contigs were assembled with the help of Assembly Line (Oxford Molecular) and alignments were determined by ClustalW (MacVector 6.5.3). Chickens were sacrificed by decapitation, and tissues were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. For estrogen treatment, roosters were injected intramuscularly with 10 mg/kg 17-β-estradiol (dissolved in 1,2-propanediol at 20 mg/ml) 48 h prior to removal of tissues; control roosters received vehicle only. Total RNA was extracted using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) and was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel in the presence of glyoxal (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), followed by blotting onto positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemical). RNA was covalently bound to the dried membrane by UV cross-linking. A 2921-base pair fragment of chkZP1 was used as hybridization probe and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridization was performed at a probe concentration of 2 × 106 cpm/ml in a buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS, 0.5m sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 16 h. Washes were performed at 65 °C, first in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA and then in 1% SDS, 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), and 1 mm EDTA. The blot was subsequently exposed to X-Omat Blue XB-1 (Kodak) film with intensifying screen at −80 °C. To obtain a chicken ZPB (accession number AB025428)-specific probe, total RNA was isolated from small follicles using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of this RNA was then reverse transcribed using the SuperscriptTM preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.), and an aliquot of the obtained cDNA was used as a template for PCR. Primers were chosen to amplify a 510-base pair region of the chicken ZPB cDNA (forward primer, 5′-TTGGAGCTGTGTTCTTCTTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGTTGTAACAACAGCCTCGC-3′). PCR was performed for 30 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing was performed for 1 min at 58 °C, and primer extension was performed for 1.5 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and its identity was verified by sequencing. It was then labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming and used as a hybridization probe for Northern blotting as described above. Freshly obtained chicken tissues were homogenized in 5 ml/g of buffer A (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm leupeptin) using an Ultra Turrax T25 and then centrifuged at 1,500 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was passed through cheesecloth and spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A and aspirated through 18- and 22-gauge needles. After recentrifugation, cells were resuspended in extraction buffer (125 mm Tris·maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupetin, 160 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). Serum was delipidated prior to gel electrophoresis by treatment with a 20-fold excess of precooled chloroform/methanol (2:1). After 30 min at 4 °C, the mixture was spun for 15 min at 4000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge, followed by dissolution of the pellet in the original volume of sample buffer. Protein extracts and sera were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for immunoblotting. Transfers were performed in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol for 1 h at 17 V at room temperature or overnight at 6 V and 4 °C. The membranes were blocked in 80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl (PBS), 0.1% Tween, 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, followed by incubation with antiserum in PBS-t (PBS with 0.1% Tween). After three washes in PBS-t, the membrane was incubated with protein A-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) for 1 h. Bands were visualized by the enhanced chemoluminescence procedure as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The positions of migration of molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) were determined by staining with Ponceau S (0.5% in 1% acetic acid). Perivitelline membranes from follicles were obtained as described above, washed in Tris-buffered saline, and taken up in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS. After addition of 1 milliunit ofN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; fromFlavobacterium meningosepticum)/100 μl of suspension and subsequent incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described. For differential interference contrast microscopical analysis of tissue sections after immunohistochemistry, procedures were as described (24Stockinger W. Hengstschlager-Ottnad E. Novak S. Matus A. Huettinger M. Bauer J. Lassmann H. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32213-32221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, chickens were anesthetized with 2 ml of nembutal and perfused via the left ventricle with 300 ml of PBS, followed by 300 ml of a solution containing 75 mml-lysine, 75 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 2% paraformaldehyde, and 2.4 mg/ml sodium meta-periodate. Specimens were embedded in paraffine using a Tissue-Tek VIP (Miles Scientific) embedding machine, and 3-μm slices were cut on a Microm HM335E microtome. Slices were deparaffinized in xylol exchange medium XEM-200 (Vogel) and rehydrated by consecutive washes in 96, 70, and 50% ethanol and pure water. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubating the slices in 3% H2O2 for 5 min. Unspecific binding of antibodies was inhibited by blocking with a solution of 1% milk powder and 3% total goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Polyclonal anti-p95 antiserum was applied at a dilution of 1: 800 in PBS for 1 h. After three washes in PBS, the following incubations were performed at room temperature: goat anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution for 1 h, five washes with PBS, peroxidase-labeled avidin (Sigma; 1:200 in 1% milk in PBS) for 1 h, and three final washes with PBS. For the color reaction, slices were incubated in 0.1 msodium acetate (pH 5.1) containing 150 μl of 30% H2O2 and 20 mg of 3-amino 9-ethylcarbazole/100 ml of buffer. The staining process was followed under the microscope and stopped by immersing the slides in water. Results were observed on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. In a previous communication, we had demonstrated that SDS-dissolved chicken perivitelline membranes from laid eggs, when subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, show four major protein bands with apparent molecular weights of 5,000, 13,000, 34,000, and 95,000, respectively (17Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the N termini and of tryptic fragments of the proteins indicated that the 5- and 13-kDa species represent chicken vitelline membrane outer protein I and lysozyme, respectively, whereas the 34-kDa protein is an avian homologue of the mammalian zona pellucida component known as ZP3 or ZPC (17Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The nature of the 95-kDa protein (p95) was not immediately clear. Although BLAST searches of public data bases revealed that the N-terminal sequence had homology to proteins of the ZP1/ZPB family, an internal tryptic fragment (t3.1) showed no similarity to known zona pellucida components of other species. Rather, it resembles glutamine-, proline-, and glycine-rich proteins such as fibroin or glutenin, so that an unambiguous assignment to the zona pellucida protein family was not directly possible. Furthermore, during the course of this work, a chicken ZPB sequence had been deposited in the public data bases (accession number AB025428); however, it did not contain any of the fragments we had sequenced. To characterize the 95-kDa band, we first raised polyclonal antisera against the entire protein as well as against synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the sequences we had obtained (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 1 shows identical samples run on the same gel probed with three different antibodies. As is evident in panel A, the antiserum against the entire protein (lane 1) as well as the one against the N-terminal peptide 95.1 (lane 2) recognize only a single band of the expected size on immunoblots of chicken pvm. Although the same polypeptide is recognized by the antiserum against the internal peptide t2, we consistently also observed reactivity toward two polypeptides of 43 and 48 kDa, respectively (lane 3). The nature of these bands is unclear; however, Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels of pvm extracts show the 95-kDa protein as well as the 34-kDa ZP3 but do not exhibit major proteins migrating at these positions (17Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To test for the possibility that p95 is a glycoprotein, the pvm was treated with N-glycosidase F and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, the band detected by the antibody directed against the entire protein was shifted to an apparent molecular mass of approximately 93 kDa (lane 2). This increase in mobility indicates the presence ofN-linked sugars on p95. Surprisingly, the pvm is not the only tissue where p95 can be detected. As can be seen in Fig.2, it is also present at high levels in the liver and serum of laying hens but is lacking from the liver and serum of roosters. Because for this immunoblot, SDS-PAGE had been performed under nonreducing conditions, an additional band migrating at approximately 190 kDa representing a dimeric form of p95 (17Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was observed. In mammals and most other species studied to date, zona proteins are synthesized either in the oocyte itself or in the follicle cells surrounding it. In some species of fish, however, the liver has been reported to be the site of synthesis for components of the piscine equivalent of the zona pellucida. These proteins are then transported to the oocytes via the blood stream (25Oppen-Berntsen D.O. Hyllner S.J. Haux C. Helvik J.V. Walther B.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 36: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar, 26Oppen-Berntsen D.O. Gram-Jensen E. Walther B.T. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 135: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Lyons C.E. Payette K.L.

Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results of Fig. 2suggest that a similar situation exists in the chicken, a finding that is unexpected in light of the site of synthesis of chicken ZP3, namely ovarian granulosa cells (17Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 also demonstrates that p95 expression is sex-specific, because it is largely absent from rooster liver and rooster serum. These data strongly suggest that the liver is the site of synthesis for p95 and raise the possibility that the gene is under estrogen control. Indeed, estrogen treatment of roosters resulted in a dramatic induction of p95 synthesis in liver and serum to levels comparable with those in the laying hen (Fig. 2). The notion that p95 might be synthesized by hepatic tissues prompted us to screen a λ-ZAP laying hen liver cDNA library with our antiserum raised against purified p95. We obtained several candidate clones, which were sequenced on both strands (see “Materials and Methods”). All clones were overlapping, apparently representing different parts of a single transcript of 2932 nucleotides in length. The sequence has been deposited in the public data bases under accession number AJ289697. It contains a long open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 934 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 100 kDa (Fig.3 A). Comparison of the sequence of this protein with the sequence of the N-terminal peptide (95.1; see above) indicates that Leu-25 of the precursor protein represents the N terminus of the mature protein found in the laid egg. In fact, theoretical calculations using the algorithm of von Heijne and co-workers (30Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) predict a signal peptide with the most likely cleavage site at the sequence GLA↓LL at exactly this position. For this reason and on the grounds of sequence alignments, we believe that the first ATG in the cDNA (position 9) indeed represents the initiator codon. In addition, we find a consensus furin cleavage site (RX(K/R)R↓) at position 900–903. The protein contains 21 cysteines, as well as three consensus sites forN-linked glycosylation (Asn in positions 65, 121, and 723). The putative mature protein lacking the signal sequence and the C terminus would have a molecular mass of 94 kDa, in excellent agreement with the results obtained by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Comparative analysis of the protein sequence with the data bases using the BLAST algorithm revealed high scoring matches with the ZP1/ZPB family of proteins. Alignment of the chicken sequence with ZP1/ZPB proteins from other organisms shows a highly conserved hydrophobic region, called the zona pellucida domain (31Bork P. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), in the C-terminal part of the molecule. Further similarities are the presence of a so-called trefoil domain (32Hoffmann W. Hauser F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 239-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and the above-mentioned furin cleavage site. In addition, the extreme N terminus also has significant homology to some other ZP1/ZPB family members, notably to those found in mouse and rat. In contrast, the central part of the p95 sequence, which contains one of the tryptic fragments (t3.1) that we had sequenced initially, shows no apparent similarity to any of the mammalian zona pellucida components. Taken together, the alignment demonstrates that the chicken isolate is highly homologous to ZP1/ZPB proteins in both the N- and the C-terminal domains but contains an additional central region with some resemblance to several other extracellular proteins like fibroin or wheat glutenin. The similarity of p95 to other zona proteins and the fact that we had originally isolated it as one of two major components of the inner pvm support its assignment to the family of zona pellucida proteins. The sequence data also clearly distinguish this protein from a sequence deposited in the data base called chicken ZPB. In fact, the dendrogram in Fig. 3 Bshows that the sequence obtained here appears to be more closely related to the mouse, rat, and human ZP1 proteins than to the chicken or human ZPB polypeptides. This indicates that it represents a distinct avian gene related to the ZP1 family, and we therefore designate it chicken zona pellucida protein 1 or chkZP1. The dendrogram further suggests that, according to sequence homologies, we can distinguish between several distinct subgroups in the ZP1/ZPB gene family. One group comprises the mouse, rat, human, and chicken ZP1 proteins (ZP1 group), one contains the human, rabbit, chicken, cat, andXenopus ZPB proteins, as well as the marmoset and macaque ZP1 orthologues (ZPB group), and a third group encompasses the fish homologues from winter flounder, medaka, and Atlantic salmon (Fig.3 B). Using a probe spanning the entire coding region of the cDNA, we then performed Northern blotting experiments on various chicken tissues (Fig. 4). It is obvious that the only major site of synthesis of chkZP1 mRNA is the liver. Some transcripts are also detectable in the adrenal glands, but at low levels when compared with hepatic tissues (Fig.4 A). The probe hybridizes to a single transcript of approximately 3.2 kilobases, suggesting that major splice variants are not expressed in the tissues studied. In accordance with the results obtained by immunoblotting (Fig. 2), the chkZP1 transcript is absent in rooster liver but can be induced by estrogen treatment of the animal to levels comparable with those detected in mature females (Fig.4 B). It is noteworthy that we could not detect significant expression in gonadal tissues, such as follicles (Fig. 4 B) or"
https://openalex.org/W1991274073,"Since protection of cells from stress-induced apoptosis by the heat shock protein Hsp72 involves suppression of stress kinase JNK, we suggested that Hsp72-mediated JNK inhibition might also be critical for myocardial protection from ischemia/reperfusion. Transient energy deprivation of H9c2 myogenic cells, used as an in vitro model of myocardial ischemia, led to cell death that had morphological features of apoptosis and necrosis and was independent of caspases. Surprisingly, this unusual type of cell death was regulated by JNK and ERK kinases. In fact, specific inhibition of JNK increased cell survival; specific inhibition of ERKs enhanced deleterious consequences of energy deprivation, whereas inhibition of p38 kinase had no effect. Hsp72 suppressed activation of JNK and did not increase ERK activity, suggesting that inhibition of JNK is the important component of Hsp72-mediated protection. Upon transient energy deprivation, activation of JNK proceeds via two distinct pathways, stimulation of JNK phosphorylation by a protein kinase SEK1 and inhibition of JNK dephosphorylation. Remarkably, in cells exposed to transient energy deprivation, Hsp72 enhanced the rate of JNK dephosphorylation but did not affect SEK1 activity. Therefore, it appears that Hsp72 specifically down-regulates JNK by accelerating its dephosphorylation, which reduces the susceptibility of cardiac cells to simulated ischemia/reperfusion."

Styelin D had remarkably extensive post-translational modifications, containing two novel amino acids, dihydroxyarginine and dihydroxylysine, and two distinctly unusual ones, 6-bromotryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. In addition, the peptide exhibited microheterogeneity because of differential mono- and dihydroxylation of several lysine residues. The primary sequence of one variant was: GW*LR**K**AAK**SVGK**FY*Y*K**HK*Y*Y*IK*AAWQIGKHAL-NH2, where W* is 6-bromotryptophan, R** is dihydroxyarginine, Y* is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, K* is 5-hydroxylysine, and K** is dihydroxylysine. Styelin D exhibited activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and this activity was retained in 200 mm NaCl. The role of the extensive modifications may be to preserve activity at low pH and/or high salinity because, under these conditions, the native peptide was considerably more active against the Gram-positive bacterial strains than its unmodified synthetic analogue. The peptide was also hemolytic and quite cytotoxic to eukaryotic cells. These broad ranging activities, combined with its relative abundance in ascidian hemocytes, suggest that styelin D plays a significant role in the innate immune mechanisms of S. clava.

Although ascidians lack the immunoglobins and T cell receptors found in higher vertebrates, their hemocytes can recognize and destroy foreign materials such as antigens or non-self-tissues that penetrate their tunic or contact their internal tissues (1DeLeo G.

Two families of antimicrobial polypeptides, clavanins and styelins, were identified from hemocytes of the stolidobranch ascidian,Styela clava. The former are histidine-rich, α-helical polypeptides with 23 amino acid residues and C-terminal amidation (11Lee I.H. Zhao C.Q. Cho Y. Harwig S.S.L. Cooper E.L. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The latter are phenylalanine-rich peptides with 32 amino acid residues (12Lee I.H. Cho Y. Lehrer R.I. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118B: 515-521Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whereas styelins demonstrated a broad pH optimum in killing bacteria, the clavanins showed optimal antibacterial activity at pH 5.5. The initial 20 amino acid residues of styelins A and B were sequenced and indicated an unusual structure consisting of several unidentified amino acid residues and hydroxylysine residues that are common only in collagen-like polypeptides. Although they were not specifically identified, the absorbancy of styelins at 280 nm suggested that methylated or otherwise modified tyrosine residues were present. Amino acid sequences corresponding to both the clavanins and styelins were identified using partial sequences and a cDNA library prepared from hemopoietic pharyngeal tissue (13Zhao C.Q. Liaw L. Lee I.H. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Zhao C.Q. Liaw L. Lee I.H. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although cDNA for styelins A and B were not detected, a closely related cDNA sequence was identified and designated as styelin C. Two additional sequences, styelins D and E, were identified by these cloning studies. Styelins D and E closely resembled each other, differing by only two residues in the sequence of the mature peptide, but differed significantly from styelins A-C (see Table I). In contrast to styelins A and B, styelins C–E had not been previously isolated as peptides. Overall, these studies established that styelins are highly basic polypeptides whose prepropeptides have a signal sequence and a polyanionic C-terminal extension whose charge counter balances the cationic residues in the mature peptide domain. Similarities were found in the gene sequences with cecropins, antimicrobial polypeptides found in many insects, and the pig intestine (15Lee J.Y. Boman A. Sun C.X. Andersson M. Jörnvall H. Mutt V.

The peptide exhibits in vitro cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity and possesses extensive post-translational amino acid modifications. The abundant evidence that ascidian hemocytes exert cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity (19Kelly K.L. Cooper E.L. Raftos D.A. J. Exp.

Because most previous researchers have concentrated on extracting cytotoxic secondary metabolites from intact tunicates (see Ref. 24Vervoort H. Fenical W. Epifanio R.d.A. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 782-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and references therein), less attention has been devoted to detailed characterizations of active polypeptides known to be in aqueous extracts of ascidian hemocytes (25DeLeo G.

After severing the base of the animals' stalks, blood was filtered through 70-μm mesh into iced 50-ml centrifuge tubes and spun at 800 × g for 20 min in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4 °C. The plasma was decanted and the pellet extracted in ∼1 ml 5% acetic acid solution containing 8m urea and 0.1 m EDTA (saturated). Extracts were subjected to acetic acid urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) followed by parallel Coomassie staining for polypeptide and nitroblue tetrazolium staining for redox active amino acids such as DOPA and TOPA (16Taylor S.W. Kammerer B. Nicholson G.J. Pusecker K. Walk T. Bayer E. Scippa S. deVincentiis M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Taylor S.W. Ross M.M. Waite J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Purification involved one or two HPLC runs. The crude extract was directly loaded onto a Phenomenex 250 × 10 mm Jupiter C-18 column and eluted with water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid)/acetonitrile (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid) gradients. Redox active polypeptides (later identified as mature styelins D and E) eluted around 30 min using a linear gradient of 0–20% over 5 min followed by 20–60% mobile phase over 40 min (see Fig. 1). Fractions absorbing at 280 nm were collected, freeze dried as a white powder, and resuspended in water (0.001% trifluoroacetic acid) and then stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Further purification of the polypeptides was carried out by a second HPLC step on an analytical Phenomenex 250 × 4.6 mm Jupiter C-18 column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min column using linear gradients (see Fig. 2). Purity was monitored by AU-PAGE (see Fig. 2, inset). Synthetic (unmodified) styelin D (C-terminal amide) was produced by Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL) and also purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC on C-18 using acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid gradients.Figure 2RP-HPLC chromatogram of the styelin variants. Inset, AU-PAGE of the fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fractions containing a single band on AU-PAGE were directly subjected to mass spectrometry on a Bruker Daltonics Esquire ion trap mass spectrometer to determine molecular masses. Sequencing of pure fractions by Edman degradation was performed on a Procise 494 PE ABI protein sequencer. In addition to the standard 20 amino acids, we used dl- anddl-allo-5 hydroxylysine (Fluka), l-DOPA (Sigma), dl-5-bromotryptophan (Aldrich), anddl- 6-bromotryptophan (Biosynth AG, Staad, Switzerland) as standards. A modified gradient system was employed which differentiates between the PTH-derivatives of the 5- and 6-bromotryptophan isomers. 2W. H. Fischer, unpublished results. Styelin D (1.75 mg) obtained after the first HPLC step was proteolytically digested with a high concentration of chymotrypsin (∼1:1 substrate to enzyme) for 1.25 h at ambient temperature in 0.1 m Tris-ascorbate buffer, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 275 μl. The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 20% trifluoroacetic acid, and the mixture was directly loaded onto a semi-preparative C-18 column and eluted with a 0–40% gradient of mobile phase over 60 min (see Fig. 3). The peptide fragments were identified based on Edman sequence analysis and MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. The styelin D (1.0 mg) obtained after the first HPLC step was hydrolyzed using the fast acid hydrolysis method (5 mHCl with 8% trifluoroacetic acid and 8% phenol in vacuo at 155 °C for 45 min) of Tsugita and co-workers (27Tsugita A. Uchida T. Mewes H.W. Ataka T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 102: 1587-1592Google Scholar). The solvent was subsequently evaporated using a stream of dry, high purity nitrogen at 60 °C. A subsequent wash with ethanol and re-evaporation yielded clean hydrolysate. The volatile N-trifluoroacetyl,O-methyl derivatives of the amino acids were prepared as described previously (16Taylor S.W. Kammerer B. Nicholson G.J. Pusecker K. Walk T. Bayer E. Scippa S. deVincentiis M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and subjected to GC-MS on a Hewlett Packard 5988 instrument using a Chirasil-Val column (28Frank H. Nicholson G.J. Bayer E. J. Chromatogr. 1978; 167: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A synthetic collagen amino acid standard mixture (Sigma) was similarly prepared for the sake of comparison. CD spectra were recorded on a AVIV 61DS spectropolarimeter with a 0.5-nm bandwidth, 0.5-nm step size, and a 4.0-s time constant over a wavelength range of 300–205 nm to assess the conformation of the peptide backbone in the presence an absence of trifluoroethanol. The instrument was calibrated with a standard solution of 10-camphorsulfonic acid. Antimicrobial testing was performed by two-stage radial diffusion assays (29Steinberg D. Lehrer R.I. Shafer W.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 169-187Google Scholar). Underlay gels contained 1% agarose, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 0.3 mg/ml trypticase soy broth powder, and either 100 or 200 mm NaCl. The sample wells were 3.2 mm in diameter and received 8-μl aliquots of the peptide, serially diluted in acidified water containing 0.01% albumin. Overlay gels were poured after 3 h, and zone sizes were read to the nearest 0.1 mm (1 unit) after an overnight incubation. In radial diffusion assays, the x intercept of a least mean squares regression line (log10 concentrationversus zone diameter) corresponds to the minimal inhibitory concentration. Hemolytic activity was tested by incubating a 2.5% (v/v) suspension of washed human or sheep red blood cells for 30 min with serial 2-fold dilutions of the peptides (maximum concentration, 80 μg/ml). The tubes were centrifuged, and hemoglobin release to the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at 460 nm. Peptide free and 100% lysis controls (0.1% Triton X-100) were included, and the percentage of lysis was calculated conventionally. Cytotoxicity was measured in 96 well culture plates by a tetrazolium technique, using Cell Proliferation Kit 1 according to the manufacturer's (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) instructions. Briefly, wells were seeded with 5 × 103 cells in 0.1 ml of RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2 mml-glutamine. After 5 h, peptide was added, and the plates were incubated in 5% CO2 and room air for 20 h at 37 °C. Then, MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reagent was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 4 h before the solubilizer was added so that the optical density could be read. Bacterial membrane permeabilization was measured spectrophotometrically, using Escherichia coli ML-35p as the target. This organism, which is lactose-permease deficient, contains a periplasmic β-lactamase and a cryptic cytoplasmic β-galactosidase. Nitrocefin (20 μm) was used in place of PADAC (7-(thienyl-2-acetamido)-3(2-(4-N,N-dimethyl amino phenylazo)-pyridinium-methyl)-3-cephen-4-carboxylic acid which is no longer available) to detect outer membrane permeabilization, ando-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside was used to detect inner membrane permeabilization, as described previously (30Lehrer R.I.

Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Approximately 8.7 mg of styelin D (with styelin E as a minor contaminant) was obtained from 108 medium sized individuals collected from Mission Bay, San Diego in November, 1999. Typical RP-HPLC profiles for the styelins are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The styelins were observed as two closely migrating bands that were stained with Coomassie and with nitroblue tetrazolium. In theinset of Fig. 2, styelin D runs above styelin E, because of its lower positive charge, resulting from the substitution of an uncharged Gln-26 for the charged Lys/5-hydroxylysine (TableI). Interestingly, styelin E (the lower band) was the major variant isolated during preliminary studies on East Coast S. clava specimens collected from Stone Harbor, New Jersey in summer, 1997. 3S. W. Taylor, unpublished results. N-terminal Edman sequencing of fraction 4 (Fig. 2) covered the first 29 residues: GW*LX(K*/Z)AA(K*/Z)SVG(K*/Z)FY*Y*(K*/Z) HK*Y*Y*I(K/K*)AAWQIGK, where X and Z were not any of the common amino acids and the PTH-derivatives of residues in parentheses co-eluted in their respective cycles. Based on the cDNA sequence observed by Lee and co-workers (Table I), this fraction was proposed to closely correspond to that of styelin D. However, extensive post-translational modification and microheterogeneity appeared to be present in the peptide. The PTH-derivative in the second cycle was found to elute at an identical position to 6-bromotryptophan and not 5-bromotryptophan. PTH-DOPA was detected as the sole amino acid in cycles 14, 15, 19, and 20 by comparison with an authentic standard. The presence of PTH-hydroxylysine and nonstandard peaks was indicated in cycles 5, 8, 12, 14, and 15 (cycle 18 appeared to contain PTH-hydroxylysine alone). A trace of PTH-arginine was observed in the cycle corresponding to residue 4; however, the yield was far less than expected compared with the other residues (glycine, bromotryptophan, leucine), suggesting that it was not the major amino acid in this position. Electrospray ionization mass spectra indicated molecular masses of 4081, 4096, 4112, 4127, and 4144 (±1) Da (calculated from the +5 and +6 ions, data not shown). Based on the MS and the chemical sequence analysis, we proposed that there was microheterogeneity of the peptide because of differential hydroxylation of styelin D. HPLC purified styelin D was digested for preparative peptide mapping studies using chymotrypsin at high enzyme to substrate ratios. Two N-terminal peptide fragments were identified by the presence of doublets of equal intensity separated by 2m/z for the molecular ion peaks in the electrospray ionization mass spectra consistent with the presence of bromine. Edman sequence analysis showed that the late eluting peak in Fig. 3 corresponded to the N-terminal peptide (1 → 13) GW*LX(Z/K*)AA(Z/K*)SVG(Z/K*)F. The electrospray ionization mass spectrum showed four variants, each 16 Da different in molecular mass. As we increased our enzyme to substrate ratio, the N-terminal octapeptide (1 → 8) GW*LX(Z/K*)AA(Z/K*) having two variants differing by 16 Da increased in relative concentration. We immediately noted that the molecular masses observed for the variants of peptide (1 → 13) were 32, 48, 64, and 80 mass units higher than expected for GW*LRK*AAK*SVGK*F (where K* is 5-hydroxylysine). Similarly, the variants of peptide (1 → 8) were 48 and 64 mass units higher than expected for fully hydroxylated GW*LRK*AAK*. Clearly, hydroxylation of lysine to 5-hydroxylysine could not account for the masses observed (i.e. two to five extra sites of hydroxylation in the respective peptides; see cDNA sequence data in Table I). We characterized both variants of peptide (1 → 8) by MS/MS. The fragmentation pattern observed for the [M+2H]2+ ion of the more hydroxylated variant (molecular mass, 1102, 1104) shown in Fig. 4 was consistent with the sites of extra hydroxylation occurring on residues 4, 5, and 8. The b4 (m/z, 623, 625) ion indicates that 32 Da of extra mass is associated with the residue in the fourth position, whereas the b5 (m/z, 783, 785)/b7 (m/z, 925, 927) and b82+ (m/z, 543, 544) ions are consistent with dihydroxylation of Lys-5 and Lys-8, respectively. Edman sequence analysis of peptide (1 → 8) contained unidentified PTH-derivative peaks only in cycles 4, 5, and 8, ruling out further modifications to the other amino acid residues. MS/MS of the lesser hydroxylated variant of peptide 1 → 8 (molecular mass, 1086, 1088) was indicative of an isobaric mixture, also with dihydroxylation of Arg-4, but with differential hydroxylation of 5-hydroxylysine at positions 5 and 8, respectively (data not shown). This indicated that differential hydroxylation of 5-hydroxylysine to dihydroxylysine is a source of microheterogeneity. Similarly, MS and MS/MS of other proteolytic fragments revealed a variant with an additional 16 Da localized on 5-hydroxylysine-16 (data not shown). We obtained additional evidence for the presence of dihydroxylysine by GC-MS analysis of volatile derivatives of acid hydrolysates of the styelins (Figs. 5 and6). Dihydroxylysine elutes after 5-hydroxylysine (which has an identical elution time and MS fragmentation pattern to one of the 5-hydroxylysine diastereoisomers in an authentic synthetic standard) on Chirasil-Val (Fig. 5). In the absence of a suitable standard for dihydroxylysine, the amino acid qualitatively appears to be present in the polypeptides at similar levels to 5-hydroxylysine with the Lys content being much less. The fragmentation pattern of theN-trifluoroacetic acid, O-Me derivative is fully consistent with trifluoroactelyation of the two amines and two side chain hydroxyls of dihydroxylysine (Fig. 6). Neither Arg nor dihydroxyarginine were observed because of their lability during derivatization (28Frank H. Nicholson G.J. Bayer E. J. Chromatogr. 1978; 167: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Finally, the last feature of the microheterogeneity was differential hydroxylation of Lys to 5-hydroxylysine at residue 22. The absence of a brominated I(K/K*)AAW (21 → 25) fragment in the digest indicated that only the N-terminal tryptophan was modified as has been previously observed in a 33-residue bromosleeper peptide from Conus radiatus (32Craig A.G.

The helix shown should convey considerable amphiphilicity to the molecule as observed for the antimicrobial melittin, magainins and cecropin peptides (33Bechinger B. Membrane Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The mean hydrophobic moment is likely to be substantially increased by these post-translational modifications, because bromotryptophan is more hydrophobic than tryptophan, and hydroxy- and dihydroxy-lysine are more hydrophilic than lysine. It is this amphiphilicity that has been associated with the efficacy of this group of polypeptides as antibiotics, giving the molecules the ability to interact with and disrupt bacterial membranes (33Bechinger B. Membrane Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Native and synthetic styelin D showed activity against methicillin-resistant and susceptible strains ofS. aureus (Fig. 8). However, whereas the activity of the synthetic peptide diminished considerably if the acidity or salinity of the assay medium increased, the native peptide was unaffected by these changes. Both native and synthetic styelin D were equally active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa(Table III), and neither pH nor salinity affected their behavior significantly.Table IIIActivity of native and synthetic styelin D against P. aeruginosa MR3007Styelin D100 mM NaCl200 mM NaClpH 5.5pH 6.5pH 7.4pH 5.5pH 6.5pH 7.4Native2.15.74.92.84.28.1Synthetic1.15.92.41.55.44.8The data show minimal inhibitory concentration values (μg/ml), from radial diffusion assays performed with underlay gels that contained 100 or 200 mm NaCl at pH 5.5, 6.5, or 7.4. Open table in a new tab The data show minimal inhibitory concentration values (μg/ml), from radial diffusion assays performed with underlay gels that contained 100 or 200 mm NaCl at pH 5.5, 6.5, or 7.4. We noted that styelin D acted sequentially on the outer and inner membranes on E. coli to make the former permeable to nitrocefin (a β-lactamase substrate) and the latter permeable too-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (a β-galactosidase substrate) (Fig. 9). Similar effects have been demonstrated with many other antimicrobial peptides, including clavanins, the other family of antimicrobial peptides found in S. clava hemocytes. Styelin D was also cytotoxic to HCT-116 cells (IC50, 10.1 μg/ml) and to human ME-180 cervical epithelial cells (EC50, 50 μg/ml). In addition, it was potently hemolytic toward human (EC50, 10 μg/ml) and sheep (EC50, 40 μg/ml) erythrocytes (Fig. 10). This impressive combination of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity suggests that styelin D could play multiple roles in the innate immune responses of S. clava. Although there have been extensive studies on the immune systems of marine invertebrates, not until recently have some of the actual effector molecules been characterized. The most extensive work in this area involves tachyplesins, a family of molecules identified in hemocytes of the horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus(Limulus polyphemus is its more familiar counterpart). These cationic peptides are composed of 17–18 amino acid residues and have a C-terminal arginine α-amide. They adopt a fairly rigid conformation, constrained by two disulfide bridges in a hairpin β-sheet-like structure. The tachyplesins are active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans (see Ref. 34Iwanaga S. Muta T. Shigenaga T. Seki N. Kawano K.

Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms have been shown to modulate VEGF expression in a multitude of cell types. Here we report that when protein kinase C (PKC) pathways were activated in human glioblastoma U373 cells by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), VEGF mRNA expression was up-regulated via a post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization mechanism. PMA treatment exhibited no increase in VEGF-specific transcriptional activation as determined by run-off transcription assays and VEGF promoter-luciferase reporter assays. However, PMA increased VEGF mRNA half-life from 0.8 to 3.6 h which was blocked by PKC inhibitors but not by protein kinase A or cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitors. When U373 cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotide sequences to the translation start sites of PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, or -ζ isoforms, both PKC-α and -ζ antisense oligonucleotides showed substantial inhibition of PMA-induced VEGF mRNA.

VEGF expression has been shown to be controlled by environmental factors such as the limited availability of oxygen or glucose (2Claffey K.P. Robinson G.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Alternatively, growth factors like platelet-derived growth factor and acidic/basic fibroblast growth factor or cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α and transforming growth factor family members also have been shown to stimulate VEGF synthesis (2Claffey K.P. Robinson G.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is clear that VEGF expression is tightly regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (2Claffey K.P. Robinson G.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 3Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19761-19766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar); however, the signal transduction pathways that regulate these mechanisms remain largely unknown. The protein kinase C (PKC) family consists of 12 phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases that mediate signals from the cell surface to the nucleus and play key roles in cellular signaling pathways (4Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 5Casabona G. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 21: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These isoenzymes have been grouped into three functional classes based on the structures of their regulatory domains and their requirements for activation by phosphatidylserine, calcium, and diacylglycerol (DAG) (4Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 5Casabona G. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 21: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The first class, the conventional PKCs (cPKCs, isoforms α, βI, βII, and γ), require Ca2+ and DAG to be activated. The second class, the novel PKCs (nPKCs, isoforms δ, ε, η, and θ), are Ca2+-independent. The third class, the atypical PKCs (aPKCs, isoforms ζ, λ, τ, and μ), are dependent on phosphatidylserine but not Ca2+ or DAG. PKC isoenzymes exhibit distinct tissue distribution patterns, and most cell types express PKC-α, -δ, and -ζ, whereas other isoforms are restricted to some specific tissues (4Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 5Casabona G. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 21: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several reports have indicated that activation of PKC by the tumor promoter, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), up-regulates VEGF expression in a variety of cell types including astrocytes, fibroblasts, umbilical vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (6Ijichi A.

However, the relative importance of individual PKC isoforms to transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF expression remains unclear. Human glioblastomas are one of the most rapidly growing angiogenic tumors corresponding to high mortality and morbidity rates. Here we show that when U373 glioblastoma cells were treated with PMA, VEGF mRNA expression was up-regulated through a post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization mechanism but not transcriptional activation. We show that PKC-α and -ζ are involved in the induction of VEGF expression as defined by antisense oligonucleotide inhibition and overexpression studies. This study indicates that PKC isoform activation, especially PKC-α and -ζ, are important upstream events resulting in increased VEGF mRNA stabilization. Monoclonal antibodies to different PKC isoforms were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The chicken anti-hVEGF polyclonal antibody was raised to human baculovirus-expressed human VEGF165. The mouse anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All of the antisense PKC oligonucleotides to PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, and -ζ were synthesized as phosphorothioate derivatives from Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA). Seven different kinase inhibitors were used and purchased from Calbiochem as follows: protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine (highly specific inhibitor of PKC) (10Jones K.T. Sharpe G.R. J. Cell.

Human glioblastoma cell line, U373-MG, was routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured under either normoxic conditions (5% CO2, 21% O2, 74% N2) or hypoxic conditions (5% CO2, 2% O2, 93% N2) in a humidified triple gas incubator (Heraeus model 6060, Hanau, Germany) at 37 °C. Cytoplasmic extracts were obtained as described (17Claffey K.P. Shih S.-C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, U373 cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS before lysis with buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 0.2 mm NaVO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The cytoplasmic extract was collected after centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 15 min, denatured under reducing conditions, and proteins separated in 8% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-PKC monoclonal antibodies followed by a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The blots were then developed with ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For luciferase reporter assays, stably transfected U373 cells containing the VEGF promoter construct (−1226 to +298 base pairs upstream of luciferase reporter) (18Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) were lysed with passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured with a Luciferase Assay kit following the supplier's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In a 96-well plate (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA), 100 μl of chicken anti-hVEGF polyclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml in PBS) was coated overnight at 4 °C. The plate was then blocked with blocking buffer (0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mm EDTA in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Conditioned media (100 μl) or recombinant hVEGF standard (R & D System) was added and incubation continued for another 2 h at 37 °C. Mouse anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody (R & D System) was added (100 μl of 0.5 ng/ml) to each well after washing the plate with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 solution and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Detection antibody, a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the plates were washed again with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. MBT substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was used to develop color and quantitated with a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Transcription run-off assay were performed as described earlier (17Claffey K.P. Shih S.-C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, U373 cell nuclei were collected in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.35% sucrose, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged for 3 min at 500 × g. Nuclei were then suspended in reaction buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm rATP/CTP/GTP, 0.7 μm rUTP, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 units RNasin) in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP and incubated at 30 °C for 23 min. Total RNA was extracted by the addition of 40 μg of glycogen carrier and 0.8 ml of Trizol reagent. The radiolabeled RNA pellets were collected after phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation (0.5 volume) and dissolved in 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol solution. Slot blots used for RNA hybridizations were prepared with VEGF, 36B4 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs (5 μg/slot). The cDNAs were denatured with 100 mm NaOH at 100 °C for 10 min, neutralized with NH4OAc to 1 m final concentration, and directly blotted onto nylon membranes (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) using a slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were subsequently washed twice with 2× SSC, baked at 80 °C for 15 min, and prehybridized for 6 h at 65 °C in hybridization buffer ([50 mm pipes, pH 6.5, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 5% SDS, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA). Hybridizations were performed with equal amounts of labeled nuclear RNA (1 × 106cpm/ml) in hybridization buffer for 20 h at 65 °C. Blots were then washed once at room temperature for 20 min and twice at 55 °C for 20 min in 1% SDS, 1× SSC. Blots were then exposed to Kodak MR film. VEGF mRNA was normalized to 36B4 expression using PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, and -ζ (0.1, 0.5, or 1 μm) or FLAG epitope-tagged PKC-ζ overexpression vector (19Pal S. Claffey K.P. Cohen H.T. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26277-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were transfected into U373 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the supplier's instructions. Total RNA was extracted by using RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Northern blot was performed as described previously (17Claffey K.P. Shih S.-C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of total RNA (10 μg/lane) were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde. RNA was blotted by capillary transfer to a nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products) in 10× SSC. Blots were cross-linked with UV Stratalinker (Stratagene), baked at 80 °C for 15 min, and prehybridized for 2–4 h at 65 °C. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled human VEGF165 AccI/NcoI fragment (823 base pairs) encompassing the coding region and 330 base pairs of 3′-untranslated region. A ribosome-associated protein cDNA, 36B4, was used as a control. Probes were prepared by the random-primed synthesis method using the Multiprime Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were washed at high stringency (1% SDS, 1× SSC at 60 °C) and exposed to Kodak MR film. VEGF mRNA was normalized to 36B4 expression using PhosphorImager analysis. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added to U373 cells and total RNA isolated at various time intervals (30 min and 1, 2, and 4 h). Total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot, and VEGF signal was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The VEGF signal was normalized to ribosomal associated protein 36B4 signal. Least squares regression analysis of the resulting line was performed (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA), and half-life values were determined from the regression curves. The in vitro PKC activity assays were performed as described (20Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Medo M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, U373 cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS followed by lysis in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was incubated with rabbit anti-human PKC-α, -δ, or -ζ polyclonal antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by another 2-h incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with the lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The immunocomplexes were suspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm phenylphosphate) containing 2 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were denatured and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by exposure to Kodak MR film. MBP and 32P-MBP signals were quantified by densitometer and PhosphorImager analysis, respectively. To determine the relative contribution of protein kinase C (PKC) activation to the induction of VEGF mRNA expression in human glioblastoma U373 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used to activate PKCs, and steady-state VEGF mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot. As shown in Fig.1 A, VEGF mRNA levels were increased 5.8-fold with 4 h PMA treatment when compared with U373 cells without PMA activation. The 4-h PMA-induced VEGF mRNA expression was approximately half of the 18-h hypoxia-induced signal (Fig. 1 A). In a time course study of PMA treatment (100 nm), induction of VEGF mRNA can be observed at 1 h which increased to a maximum level at 8 h (Fig. 1 B) and then slowly decreased afterward (data not shown). Furthermore, this response was dependent upon cell confluence, showing a PMA induction of VEGF mRNA expression that varied from 3- to 10-fold at 4 h (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that PMA strongly up-regulates VEGF mRNA expression in U373 cells, and the activation requires prolonged PMA treatment with maximum VEGF mRNA levels reached at 8 h. To study whether PMA up-regulation of VEGF mRNA expression correlates to VEGF protein synthesis and secretion, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of U373-conditioned media with and without the addition of PMA for 4 h. The conditioned media of control cells contained 0.313 ± 0.076 ng/ml VEGF, and PMA-treated cells contained 0.79 ± 0.124 ng/ml VEGF. This is a 2.5-fold induction of VEGF secretion in only 4 h and is statistically significant in a Student's t test (p ≤ 0.0047). Thus, increases observed in VEGF mRNA levels with PMA treatment correlate well with increases in VEGF protein synthesis and secretion. The PKC isoforms α, δ, and ζ, representing cPKC, nPKC, and aPKC classes respectively, are universally expressed (4Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that prolonged PMA treatment can repress cPKCs and nPKCs but not aPKCs synthesis (4Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 21Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to determine the effect of PMA on the three universally expressed PKC isoforms in U373 cells. Fig.2 A is a representative Western blot showing PMA regulation of PKC synthesis. Both PKC-α and -δ protein levels decreased over time with PMA treatment, and PKC-α reached almost undetectable levels after 4 h of PMA exposure. In a similar but less effective manner, PKC-δ decreased by 50% with 8 h PMA treatment. In contrast, PKC-ζ protein showed a substantial increase and almost doubled after 30 min and remained elevated up to at least 8 h (Fig. 2 A) and then slowly decreased afterward (data not shown). By using an in vitroPKC activity assay (Fig. 2, B and C), specific immunoprecipitation followed by phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP), PKC-α activity reached a maximum of 141% over control at 15 min PMA and then decreased sharply over 4 h PMA treatment to 53% of control. PKC-δ activity showed a slower induction than PKC-α and reached maximum of 121% over control at 30 min PMA and then slowly decreased over the time of PMA treatment to 91% of control at 4 h PMA. In contrast, PKC-ζ activity gradually increased during PMA treatment and remained elevated up to 4 h PMA with a maximum of 158% over control at 4 h PMA exposure. These results suggest that PMA differentially regulates not only PKC isoform synthesis but also selectively modulates their activity in U373 cells. A transient, rapid activation of PKC-α activity, followed by stable up-regulation of PKC-ζ activity over the 4-h PMA treatment, suggests that a constant total PKC activity may be necessary to functionally up-regulate VEGF mRNA expression in U373 cells. In order to study further the involvement of PKC isoforms to the phorbol ester-induced VEGF mRNA expression, we employed several kinase inhibitors at active concentrations and studied PMA-induced VEGF mRNA levels. A representative result is shown in Fig. 3; the broad PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and calphostin C, strongly decreased PMA-induced VEGF mRNA expression. However, PKC inhibitors selective to cPKCs (Go6967) or to both cPKCs and nPKCs (bisindolemaleimide I) were less effective in repressing PMA-induced VEGF mRNA. This suggests that the aPKC isoforms may also play a role in the PMA-induced VEGF mRNA expression. Application of a broad serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7 showed significant reduction of PMA-induced VEGF mRNA expression, whereas the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 did not show any suppression. This indicates that protein kinase A is not involved in the PMA activation of VEGF mRNA expression, and inhibition of VEGF mRNA accumulation by the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7 is likely mediated through PKC. The cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, H8, interestingly showed an increase in VEGF mRNA levels, indicating that blocking of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase may favor PMA activation pathways and VEGF mRNA accumulation. Taken together, these results suggest that the induction of VEGF mRNA expression by PMA is mainly mediated through a cascade of PKC isoform activation, including aPKCs. To determine whether increased VEGF mRNA expression by PMA is specifically due to transcriptional activation, two studies were performed. First, VEGF mRNA transcription in U373 cells was measured by run-off transcription assay. As shown in Fig.4 A, only hypoxic conditions showed measurable activation of VEGF mRNA transcription, whereas 4 h of PMA treatment did not when compared with control. This experiment has been repeated three times with identical results. Second, U373 cells were transfected and selected for a stable integrated human VEGF promoter construct (−1226 to +298 base pairs) upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. These cells were then treated with PMA and analyzed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig.4 B, there was little or no increase in luciferase activity from 1 to 12 h PMA treatment, whereas 12 h of hypoxia showed a 2.5-fold transcriptional activation. Thus, the VEGF promoter/reporter construct is functional and responsive to hypoxia, and PMA does not activate VEGF promoter transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that PMA-induced VEGF mRNA accumulation is not mediated through transcriptional activation as is the case for hypoxic stress. To determine whether post-transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in the PMA induction of VEGF mRNA expression, we treated U373 cells with PMA for 3 h prior to the addition of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, and we determined the VEGF mRNA half-life with quantitative Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.5, VEGF mRNA half-life increased from 0.8 to 3.6 h after treatment of U373 cells with PMA. Since the broad PKC inhibitor staurosporine showed a strong inhibition of PMA up-regulation of VEGF mRNA expression (Fig. 3), the inhibitor was also added during the course of PMA treatment, and VEGF mRNA stability was measured. As shown in Fig. 5, staurosporine limited the PMA-induced VEGF mRNA half-life to 1.3 h (Fig. 5). This result suggests that increased VEGF mRNA expression by PMA is regulated predominantly through a post-transcriptional mechanism, and the activation of PKC plays an important role in this mechanism. Of the 12 PKC isoforms identified to date, 8 PKC isoforms were detected in the U373 cells by Western blot analysis, and the PKC-βI, -βII, -η, and -θ isoforms were excluded (data not shown). To delineate the PKC isoforms contributing to PMA-induced VEGF mRNA stability, six antisense (AS) oligonucleotides were selected from the three subclasses of PKC isoforms to access their individual functions. The AS oligonucleotides were designed against the translation start site of each PKC isoform (Fig. 6 A). To improve intracellular stability and effectiveness, the AS oligonucleotides were synthesized as phosphorothioate derivatives. To ensure the AS oligonucleotides were effective in repressing their respective PKC isoform expression, we performed Western blot analysis on transfected cells. A representative result is shown in Fig. 6 B, all six of the AS oligonucleotides (0.5 μm) substantially reduced their specific PKC protein levels. PKC-α and -ζ AS oligonucleotides decreased their respective protein levels approximately 80–90%, whereas PKC-γ, -δ and -ε AS oligonucleotides repressed their isoforms by about 40–50%. Given the effective reduction of PKC-α and -ζ isoforms by their specific AS oligonucleotides, we examined whether down-regulation of either of these PKC isoforms would interfere with PMA-induced VEGF mRNA expression by quantitative Northern blot. As a control, cells were transfected with AS oligonucleotide to PKC-β, which is not expressed by U373 cells. As shown in Fig.7 A, cells transfected in triplicate with PKC-α or -ζ AS oligonucleotide showed a dose-dependent reduction of PMA-induced VEGF mRNA level, whereas the control PKC-β AS oligonucleotide was ineffective. With the exception of the lowest concentration (0.1 μm), both 0.5 and 1 μm AS oligonucleotide transfection to PKC-α or -ζ showed a statistically significant reduction in PMA-induced VEGF mRNA expression (Fig. 7 A,p < 0.05). Fig. 7 B is a representative Northern blot showing a dose-dependent repression of PMA-induced VEGF mRNA level by PKC-α or -ζ AS oligonucleotide transfection. The U373 cells transfected with PKC-δ or -ε AS oligonucleotides did not demonstrate any significant repression of PMA-induced VEGF mRNA expression when performed in triplicate (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that both PKC-α and -ζ isoforms are crucial mediators in the PMA activation of VEGF mRNA expression in U373 cells. Studies have suggested that PKC isoforms may regulate their activity through direct or indirect cross-talk (22Kim S.-J. Chang Y.-Y. Kand S.-S. Chun J.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Given the effectiveness of transient transfection of either PKC-α or -ζ AS oligonucleotides for limiting the PMA induction of VEGF mRNA expression and the overlap in PMA-induced activity between the two isoforms, it was of interest to detect a possible cross-talk between the two isoforms in U373 cells. A representative Western blot is shown in Fig.8 A, identifying that the transfection of U373 cells with PKC-α AS oligonucleotide not only blocked its own protein synthesis but also significantly reduced PKC-ζ protein levels. Conversely, AS oligonucleotide to PKC-ζ also strongly inhibited PKC-α protein levels after the transfection. In contrast, the control AS oligonucleotide to PKC-β did not show any significant effect on the synthesis of either PKC-α or -ζ. By using an in vitro PKC activity assay to access PKC isoform activities with AS oligonucleotide transfection (Fig. 8 B), the reduction of PKC-α protein level by both PKC-α and -ζ AS-oligonucleotide also showed concomitant decreases in PKC-α"

In this paper, we define the site and mechanism of action of several previously identified inhibitors of bacterial two-component systems. We show that the most potent inhibitors target the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of the sensor kinase and exert their affect by causing structural alterations of the kinase leading to aggregation.

https://openalex.org/W2055810955,"The RET proto-oncogene is often activated through somatic rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Three main rearranged forms of RET have been described: RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, which arise from a paracentric inversion and RET/PTC2, which originates from a 10 : 17 translocation. We previously developed a dual-color FISH test to detect these RET rearrangements in interphase nuclei of thyroid lesions. This approach allowed us to detect a novel translocation involving the RET region, which was not detectable by RT - PCR with specific primers for known rearrangements. A combination of RT - PCR and RACE analyses finally led to the identification of the fusion gene, which involves the 5' portion of PCM-1, a gene coding for a centrosomal protein with distinct cell cycle distribution, and the RET tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. FISH analysis confirmed the chromosomal localization of PCM-1 on chromosome 8p21-22, a region commonly deleted in several tumors. Immunohistochemistry, using an antibody specific for the C-terminal portion of PCM-1 showed that the protein level is drastically decreased and its subcellular localization is altered in thyroid tumor tissue with respect to normal thyroid. However, heterozygosity is retained for seven microsatellite markers in the 8p21-22 region, suggesting that the non-rearranged PCM-1 allele is not lost and that the translocation is balanced.

RGS9-1 is the GAP required for rapid recovery of light responses in vertebrate photoreceptors and the only mammalian RGS protein with a defined physiological function. It belongs to an RGS subfamily whose members have multiple domains, including Gγ-like domains that bind Gβ5 proteins. Members of this subfamily play important roles in neuronal signaling. Within the GAP complex organized around the RGS domain of RGS9-1, we have identified a functional role for the Gγ-like-Gβ5L complex in regulation of GAP activity by an effector subunit, cGMP phosphodiesterase γ and in protein folding and stability of RGS9-1. The C-terminal domain of RGS9-1 also plays a major role in conferring effector stimulation. The sequence of the RGS domain determines whether the sign of the effector effect will be positive or negative. These roles were observed in vitro using full-length proteins or fragments for RGS9-1, RGS7, Gβ5S, and Gβ5L. The dependence of RGS9-1 on Gβ5 co-expression for folding, stability, and function has been confirmed in vivo using transgenicXenopus laevis.

GTPase-accelerating protein cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) G protein γ-like polymerase chain reaction glutathioneS-transferase enhanced green fluorescent protein Most pathways for transducing signals from the cell surface to amplified second messenger cascades within cells of animals are organized around G proteins. Sufficient information is now available from the genomes of nematodes and humans to conclude that heptahelical transmembrane proteins of the G protein-coupled class constitute by far the largest class of receptors in these animals. The burden of communicating complex signals from this enormous variety of receptors must be borne by the relatively small number (on the order of 20) of distinct G protein α subunits (Gα) found in these genomes. It is hard to imagine such a scheme operating successfully unless the G proteins are helped in their task of encoding this information by additional regulatory proteins. Indeed, a family of proteins, comparable in size to the Gα family, have been found to be capable of exerting such regulation on activated Gα; these are the RGS (regulators ofG protein signaling) family of GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs)1 (1Koelle M.R.

Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and it is now established that it works by increasing the activity of RGS9-1 (3Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I.

PDEγ is able to exert its GAP-enhancing effect on the RGS9 catalytic core, but the effect is much weaker than observed for endogenous RGS9-1 (6He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G.

In addition to PDEγ, the photoreceptor-specific Gβisoform Gβ5L has also been implicated in RGS9-1 function. RGS9-1 is extracted from rod outer segments as a complex with Gβ5L (11Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and RGS9-1 knockout mice are completely lacking Gβ5L.

In addition, RGS9-1 contains a unique C-terminal domain, produced partly by the alternative RNA processing, which distinguishes RGS9-1 from the striatal isoform RGS9–2 (21Rahman Z. Gold S.J.

The experiments described here establish roles for different domains and for Gβ5L in regulation of GAP activity and effector coupling and in protein folding and stability. Compositions were as follows. GAPN buffer, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol; and lysis buffer, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40. The DNA fragments of bovine RGS9-1 encoding residues 1–484 (9NGDC), 1–219 (9N), 214–280 (9G), 214–484 (9GDC), and 291–484 (9DC), the DNA fragment of bovine RGS7 encoding residues 1–469 (7NGDC), the DNA fragment of murine RGS7 encoding residues 318–469 (7DC), and the DNA fragment of murine Gβ5L encoding residues 1–395 were amplified from the corresponding cDNAs by PCR using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The initial condons of these fragments were replaced by NdeI restriction sites, and BamHI restriction sites were inserted at their 3′ ends. These fragments were then cloned in frame into NdeI/BamHI sites of pET14b (Novagen) or modified pGEX-2TK (23Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar) vector to express N-terminal His6-tagged or GST-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. These fragments with N-terminal His6 or GST tags were subsequently cloned into pVL1392 (PharMingen) to generate recombinant baculoviruses for expression in Sf9 cells. The fragment from bovine RGS9 encoding residues 1–295 (9NG) was digested by NdeI/Eco47 III from the fragment of RGS9 encoding residues 1–484, cloned into pAS2 (CLONTECH) to obtain a BamHI site to the 3′ end, and then cloned into pVL1392. The mouse Gβ5L cDNA was excised usingEcoRI/XbaI digestion from the plasmid, pcDNAI-amp-Gβ5L (24Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and then cloned into pVL1392 to generate recombinant baculoviruses for expression of untagged Gβ5L proteins in Sf9 cells. The fragment from bovine RGS9 encoding residues 276–431 (9D) was amplified by PCR. BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were inserted at its 5′ end and 3′ end, respectively. Then thisBamHI/EcoRI fragment was subcloned intoBglII/EcoRI sites of a modified pGEX-2T plasmid, which has a polylinker,BamHI-His6-BglII, appending to itsBamHI site. pVL1392-g9GD (residues 214–431) and pVL1392-g9NGD (residues 1–431) were made by removing the RGS9-C domain from pVL1392-g9GDC and pVL1392-g9NGDC. TheNcoI/BamHI RGS9 fragments in pVL1392-g9GDC and pVL1392-g9NGDC were replaced by the NcoI/EcoRI RGS9 fragment of pGEX-9D. The BamHI end of the vector andEcoRI end of the RGS9 fragment were filled with Klenow large fragment before ligation. The pXOP-EGFP-RGS9-1 and pXOP-Gβ5Lexpressing plasmids were constructed as follows. The pXOP-C1-EGFP vector (a kind gift from Dr. Barry Knox, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse) was cut by AgeI andApaLI to collect the 1.7-kilobase fragment including a 1.4-kilobase Xenopus rhodopsin promoter sequence. The promoter sequence was then ligated to theAgeI/ApaLI pEGFP-C2 backbone to produce pXOP-C2-EGFP. A bovine RGS9-1 cDNAEcoRI/BamHI fragment was subcloned in frame intoEcoRI/BamHI sites of pXOP-C2-EGFP to generate pXOP-EGFP-RGS9-1 expression plasmid. To construct pXOP-Gβ5L, aEcoRI/SacII Gβ5LcDNA fragment was subcloned in frame intoEcoRI/SacII sites of pXOP-C2-EGFP to generate pXOP-EGFP-Gβ5L. Then the EGFP sequence was removed by digestion of AgeI/BglII. The sticky ends were filled with Klenow large fragment and religated to generate pXOP-Gβ5L expression plasmid. Recombinant baculoviruses were isolated following cotransfection of the linearized BaculoGold viral DNA (PharMingen) and the transfer vector into Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cells were grown as monolayers in 150-mm culture dishes in Insect-Xpress medium (Bio Whittaker) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin and infected with recombinant viruses at 80% confluency and harvested 48 h later. Cell pellets were suspended to a density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in lysis buffer and protease inhibitors (0.03 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.017 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.005 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.03 mg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and solid phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were sonicated and then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) depending on the tag used. For His6-tagged proteins, 20 mm imidazole was added to the supernatant to reduce nonspecific binding to the resin. The resin was washed with lysis buffer and GAPN buffer plus 20 mm imidazole, and His6-tagged protein was eluted with 250 mmimidazole in GAPN buffer. For GST-tagged proteins, the resin was washed with GAPN buffer, and the protein was eluted with 40 mmglutathione in GAPN buffer. The purified proteins were stored in −20 °C in 40% glycerol. For Gβ5expression, we routinely used a virus encoding untagged Gβ5L and found that both long (∼60%) and short (∼40%) forms were consistently produced and co-purified with RGS9-1. Because the short form reacts with monospecific antibodies to a common epitope in Gβ5S and Gβ5L (see Fig. 2), has identical mobility to Gβ5S produced by a different virus (see Fig.4 A), and is not observed when a Gβ5L expression construct differing in its ribosome binding site and in the presence of an N-terminal His6 fusion peptide is used (see Fig. 4 A), we conclude that the short form is likely Gβ5Sformed by alternative translation initiation at the second ATG in the coding sequence.Figure 4The GAP activity of the complex of GST-tagged RGS9-1 (g9NGDC) and G β5. A, purification of g9NGDC·Gβ5, g9NGDC·Gβ5S, g9NGDC·hG·β5L, g7NGDC· Gβ5S, and g7NGDC·hGβ5L complexes. g9NGDC and Gβ5, g9NGDC and Gβ5S, g9NGDC and hGβ5L, g7NGDC and Gβ5S, or g7NGDC and hGβ5L were coexpressed in Sf9 cells and then purified by GSH affinity column. No detergent was present in the elution buffer. Pellets of cell lysates (lanes a), supernatants of cell lysates (lanes b; 10% relative tolanes a), and the purified complexes (lanes c; g9NGDC·Gβ5, 0.6 μg; g9NGDC·Gβ5S, 1.0 μg; g9NGDC·hGβ5L, 1.0 μg; g7NGDC·Gβ5S, 1.5 μg; g7NGDC·hGβ5L, 1.0 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue.

Endogenous RGS9-1·Gβ5L was supplied as isotonically washed rod outer segment membranes at a finalR* concentration of 15 μm. Single turnover GTPase assays of Gtα were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recombinant proteins were also expressed in E. coli using BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and standard procedures. g9DC and h9DC were expressed in insoluble form, so they were solubilized from inclusion bodies using 6 m guanidinium chloride. g9DC was renatured by step dialysis before purification. h9DC was first allowed to bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin under denaturing conditions and then renatured on the resins according to the manufacturer's (Qiagen) instructions. h9D was generated from the thrombin cleavage of purified gh9D following the standard protocol and then purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Single turnover Gtα GTPase assays were carried out as described with or without exogenous PDEγ (26Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, urea washed rod outer segments were mixed with purified transducin, various amount of recombinant RGS proteins and PDEγ in GAPN buffer. Then GTP hydrolysis was initiated by adding 7 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to 14 μl of the above mixture by vortexing. The reaction was quenched by 100 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid at various times, and Pi released from hydrolyzed GTP was determined by activated charcoal assay. Final concentrations were: 15 μm rhodopsin, 1 μm transducin, and 0 or 2 μm recombinant His6-PDEγ. The first order rate constant for GTP hydrolysis (k inact) was obtained by fitting data to single exponentials. Polyclonal anti-RGS9-1c and polyclonal anti-Gβ5 antisera were generated as described (6He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 24Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-RGS9-N rabbit antisera were raised (Bethyl Labs) against recombinant bovine h9N protein. Western blot analyses were performed as described (6He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The following dilutions of primary antibodies were used: 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal anti-RGS9-1c antiserum, 1:500 dilution of polyclonal anti-RGS9-N antiserum, and 1:500 dilution of polyclonal anti-Gβ5 antiserum. For transgenesis, DNA was purified using the Qiagen midi-prep protocol, and pXOP-EGFP-RGS9-1 was digested withRsrII and pXOP-Gβ5L withApaLI. The linearized plasmids were purified after digestion (Qiaex II, Qiagen), with final elution in water. TransgenicXenopus laevis embryos were prepared by restriction enzyme-mediated integration as described (27Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the amounts of restriction enzyme used (NotI) and egg extract were reduced to 0.15 units and 2 μl/transgenesis reaction, respectively. Restriction enzyme-mediated integration was carried out in 0.4× MMR (28Peng H.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) containing 6% (w/v) Ficoll. 1× MMR contains 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Embryos were transferred to 0.1× MMR, 6% Ficoll at the 4–8 cell stage. Properly gastrulating embryos were raised in 0.1× MMR until approximately stage 42 (29) and then transferred to dechlorinated water. Tadpoles were anesthetized in 0.01% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma) and monitored for green fluorescent protein expression using an Olympus fluorescent dissecting microscope. To extract genomic DNA, tadpoles were sacrificed and incubated over night at 55 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS and 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.). After phenol-chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated by adding 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. The DNA pellets were washed in 1 ml of 70% ethanol, dried by speed vacuum, and resuspended in TE. About 0.4 μg of genomic DNA was used as template in PCR reactions. To dissect the roles of individual protein modules in the RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex, we expressed and purified a number of protein fragments and complexes (Fig.1). Full-length RGS9-1 is readily expressed at high levels in either bacterial (6He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) or baculovirus (Fig.2) systems but is produced almost entirely in an insoluble form (data not shown). In the detergent Nonidet P-40, RGS9-1 and Gβ5 can be extracted from insect cells into solution for affinity purification. We observed a striking difference between the behavior of RGS9-1 with and without Gβ5: RGS9-1 is eluted from the affinity matrix in soluble form without detergent when bound to Gβ5, (Figs. 2, A and B, and 4 A) but in the absence of Gβ5can only be eluted when detergent is added. Moreover, once purified, RGS9-1 without Gβ5 precipitates when Nonidet P-40 is removed, whether by dilution or slow dialysis. It precipitates even when Nonidet P-40 is exchanged for either of two detergents shown previously to solubilize the RGS9-1·Gβ5Lcomplex from photoreceptor membranes in active form, octyl glucoside (3Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or lauryl sucrose (11Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Gβ5L also displayed a dependence on RGS9-1 for solubility, but it was less stringent. Some hGβ5L could be recovered in soluble form without RGS9-1, but the amount was significantly reduced (Fig.2 B). The formation of the RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex is clearly mediated through the GGL domain of RGS9-1. All GST-tagged fragments containing the GGL domain co-purified with co-expressed Gβ5 (Fig. 2 C), including a GST-GGL construct (g9G), whereas constructs containing either the RGS9-1 domains N-terminal to the GGL domain (g9N) or those C-terminal to the GGL domain (g9DC) or both (g9NDC) did not bind co-expressed Gβ5. RGS7, which also contains a GGL domain, also co-purified with Gβ5 (see Fig.4 A). Efficient formation and stability of the RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex required co-expression (Fig. 2 D). When cells were simultaneously infected with viruses expressing RGS9-1 and Gβ5, the complex was readily co-purified. In contrast, when extracts of cells separately infected with the two different virus preparations were mixed, very little of the complex formed as revealed by the much lower amount of Gβ5 co-purifying with RGS9-1. Thus, Gβ5 is required during or immediately after translation for efficient formation of the RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex. Further evidence for a dependence on Gβ5 for production of functional RGS9-1 was provided in vivo by transgenesis experiments in X. laevis. In five trials in which a construct directing expression of a EGFP-RGS9-1 fusion (f9NGDC; Fig.3 A) was used for fertilization without a Gβ5L construct, none of the surviving tadpoles displayed detectable EGFP signal in their eyes. Genotyping of 19 revealed that 11 had the transgene inserted in their genomes. In four trials in which f9NGDC and Gβ5L constructs were co-injected, at least one tadpole with detectable retinal EGFP signal (Fig. 3 C) was obtained every time. Genotyping of five animals with integrated f9NGDC construct and detectable retinal EGFP signal revealed that the Gβ5L construct was also integrated in all (Fig. 3 B). No animals expressing detectable levels of EGFP-RGS9-1 have been found to date that do not have the Gβ5L construct integrated, although two tadpoles containing integrated EGFP-RGS9-1 but not Gβ5L were found among the tadpoles without detectable signal from one co-injection trial. In all these trials we have not found a single animal that has both f9NGDC and Gβ5L constructs integrated but that displays no retinal EGFP signal. Thus, just as Gβ5Lprotein expression in murine photoreceptor cells requires the presence of RGS9-1 (4Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), RGS9-1 expression (or at least, detectable overexpression of our construct) in Xenopus photoreceptors requires the presence of Gβ5L. Once sufficient amounts of the RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex had been purified from infected SF9 cells (Fig. 4 A), we were able to check it for catalytic activity. It has been previously suggested (30Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the rod outer segment GAP, or the RGS9-1·Gβ5L complex, has no GAP activity in the absence of PDEγ. As shown in Fig. 4 B, just as rod outer segment membranes exhaustively washed to remove PDE show significant GAP activity toward Gtα (31Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1993; 11: 939-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), recombinant RGS9-1·Gβ5 significantly accelerates GTP hydrolysis by Gtα in the absence of any subunits of PDE. Thus, the GAP activity of this complex does not have an absolute requirement for PDEγ. However, PDEγ does enhance its GAP activity greatly. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the enhancement is very similar to that observed for the endogenous GAP in rod outer segment membranes, in marked contrast to previous observations for the core RGS domain (5McEntaffer R.L. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4931-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G.

A. 2000; 97: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As with other RGS proteins, the core RGS domain of RGS9-1 is sufficient to accelerate GTP hydrolysis by Gtα. However, enhancement of the GAP activity of the RGS domain of RGS9 by PDEγ is very modest. Thus, the additional protein modules in the RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex must contribute most of the interactions required for regulation by PDEγ. The constructs described in Fig. 1 allowed us to assess the relative contributions of different protein modules in the RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex to GAP activity with and without PDEγ (Fig. 5). Interestingly, when assayed at 6 μm, in the presence of PDEγ, the GAP activities of all constructs in Fig. 5(A–D) were similar, with none differing from any other by more than a factor of two. The most striking differences were observed in the absence of PDEγ. GAP preparations containing the GGL domain·Gβ5 complex (Fig. 5, Aand D) had lower basal GAP activity than those containing only the RGS core domain or the RGS domain plus the C-terminal domain (Fig. 5, B and C), especially at concentrations above 1 μm. Comparison of the results from different proteins assayed in Fig. 5 suggests that the GGL domain·Gβ5 complex confers most of the effector sensitivity and does so primarily by inhibition of GAP activity in the absence of PDEγ. Because the complex containing only the short form of Gβ5(g9NGDC·Gβ5S; Fig. 5 A) had identical activity to that of the complex containing a mixture of Gβ5 isoforms (g9NGDC·Gβ5) with about 60% Gβ5L, the additional 42 amino acid residues on the long isoform do not play an important role in regulating GAP activity or PDEγ enhancement. The N-terminal domain, containing the DEP module, also seems to play a role through a modest enhancement of PDEγ-stimulated GAP activity as revealed by comparison of Fig. 5 (A and D). We also compared h9NGDC·Gβ5 to g9NGDC·Gβ5 and found little difference (<11%) i"
https://openalex.org/W2071895262,"The erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which consists of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr/erbB1), erbB2 (neu), erbB3 and erbB4, has been shown to be important for both normal development as well as neoplasia. The expression of rat erbB2 was targeted to the basal layer of mouse epidermis with the bovine keratin 5 promoter. Overexpression of wild type rat erbB2 in the basal layer of epidermis led to alopecia, follicular hyperplasia and sebaceous gland enlargement as well as hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis. Spontaneous papillomas, some of which converted to squamous cell carcinomas, arose in homozygous erbB2 transgenic mice as early as 6 weeks of age with >90% incidence by 6 months. Analysis of several proliferation/differentiation markers indicated that erbB2 overexpression led to epidermal hyperproliferation and a possible delay in epidermal differentiation. Transgenic mice were also hypersensitive to the proliferative effects of the skin tumor promoter, 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and were more sensitive to two-stage carcinogenesis. Elevations in EGFr and erbB2 protein as well as erbB2:EGFr and erbB2:erbB3 heterodimers were observed in skin of the erbB2 transgenic mice. Phosphotyrosine levels of the EGFr, erbB2 and erbB3 proteins were also elevated. These results indicate an important role for erbB2 signaling in epidermal growth, development and neoplasia."

Although the fundamental mechanisms of mitochondrial protein import seem to be conserved from lower eukaryotes to mammals, only limited information is available for higher eukaryotic systems. Several mammalian counterparts have been identified and their roles are being studied: TOM20 (17Hanson B. Nuttal S. Hoogenraad N.J. Eur. J.

In addition, several novel components that are thought to function as import receptors have also been found in mammalian mitochondria. Human TOM34 was cloned using a degenerate tetratricopeptide repeat sequence present in Tom70 and Tom20 (24Nuttall, S. D., Hanson, B. J., Mori, M., and Hoogenraad, N. J. (1997) DNA. Cell Biol. 1067–1074.Google Scholar). Metaxin is the 35-kDa C-terminal tail-anchor protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane (25Armstrong L.C. Komiya T. Bergman B.E. Mihara K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6510-6518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The antibodies raised against a 37-kDa outer membrane protein of rat liver mitochondria (OM37), inhibited preprotein import into the rat mitochondria (26Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). OM37 is anchored to the outer membrane through the N-terminal signal-anchor sequence. 2M. Maeda and K. Mihara, unpublished observations. These results suggest that features of the preprotein import system are unique to mammalian mitochondria and require further characterization. In the present study, we isolated the rat homolog of Tom40 and characterized it as a component of the TOM complex of rat liver mitochondria. Antibodies against cytochrome P450(M1), cytochrome H450, monoamine oxidase, rTIM23, and rTOM20 were prepared as described previously (20Iwahashi J. Yamazaki S. Komiya T. Nomura N. Nishikawa S.

(Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. The monoclonal antibody against HSP60 was purchased fromStressGen (SPA807). HSP70 was purified from rat liver cytosol according to the method of Deshaies et al. (33Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar).125I-Labeled preadrenodoxin (pAd) was prepared using Iodo-Beads (Pierce Chemical Co.) as described previously (26Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A 641-bp cDNA sequence encoding part of mouse TOM40 was assembled from two partial mouse EST nucleotide sequences (dbEST numbers 631778 and 757235). Based on this assembled sequence, the following oligonucleotides were synthesized: TOM40-1, 5′-GATGAATTCCCAACCCGGGGACGTT-3′ (coding strand); TOM40-2, 5′-CAGAAGCTTTGTGATGCTCTGGAGGTA-3′ (anticoding strand). Underlining in TOM40-1 and TOM40-2 indicates the restriction sites of EcoRI and HindIII, respectively. A 458-bp cDNA fragment was amplified from rat liver poly(A)+-RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using TOM40-1 and TOM40-2 as the primers. This cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen the λgt10 rat cDNA library for rTOM40, and a ∼1.6-kilobase pair cDNA encoding the entire rTOM40 was obtained. A 1086-bp cDNA fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using rTOM40 cDNA as the template and the following oligonucleotides as the primers: TOM40-3, 5′-ATCATATGGGGAACGTGTTGGC-3′ (coding strand); TOM40-4, 5′-GGAGGGGATCCCCGATGGTGAGGCCAA-3′ (anticoding strand). Underlining in TOM40-3 and TOM40-4 indicates the restriction sites of NdeI and BamHI, respectively. The obtained fragment was subcloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) to create pET28a-NHIS40, which tags (His)6to the N terminus of the expressed protein. His-tagged rTOM40 was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells as inclusion bodies, which were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained band was excised from the gel and used to raise antibodies in rabbits using the Ribi Adjuvant system (RIBI Immunochem Research Inc.). Subcellular fractionation of rat liver was performed as described previously (32Iwahashi J. Takaichi S. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Submitochondrial fractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed as follows. Mitochondria were diluted into 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmEDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin) and incubated at 0 °C for 30 min. The mixture was sonicated on ice 5 times for 30 s each time, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the supernatant. This fraction was layered over a linear gradient (0.6 to 1.6 m) of sucrose in hypotonic buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (22Ishihara N. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, normal rat kidney cells grown on glass coverslips in culture dishes were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMX Ros (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were fixed with 50% methanol, 50% acetone for 2 min at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated with IgGs against rat TOM40 at room temperature for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit IgG. The images were obtained and analyzed using the confocal microscope, Radiance 2000 (Bio-Rad). The mitochondrial outer membranes were incubated with 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% (w/v) digitonin, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10% (v/v) glycerol (solubilization buffer) at 0 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant pretreated with Protein A-Sepharose was incubated with anti-rTom20 or rTom40 IgG-bound Protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min and the precipitates were washed 3 times with the solubilization buffer and suspended in the SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the gels were analyzed by immunoblotting or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Blue native PAGE was performed essentially as described previously (34Schägger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 35Schägger H. William A.C. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial outer membranes (50 μg) were solubilized in 50 μl of solubilization buffer and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was mixed with 5 μl of sample buffer (5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 100 mmbis-Tris (pH 7.0), 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid), and electrophoresed through 5 to 16% polyacrylamide gradient gels. For the second dimensional gel analysis, each individual lane was excised from the first gel and subjected to Tricine/SDS-PAGE. The reaction mixtures containing 25 μg of mitochondria and 125I-pAd or35S-pAd-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were incubated in 50 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm ATP, 20 mm sodium succinate, 5 mm NADH, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitor mixture at 30 °C for 30 min. When the import of125I-pAd was assayed, 1/10 volume of rabbit reticulocyte lysate was added to the reaction mixture to provide cytoplasmic chaperones. After import, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged, the precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were analyzed with a Bioimage Analyzer FLA2000 (Fuji). 35S-pAd-DHFR synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate was incubated at 0 °C for 10 min in the import buffer (50 μl) in the presence of 10 μm methotrexate plus 1 mm NADPH and then 50 μg of mitochondria were added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated further at 30 °C for 30 min. The mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation and solubilized with the hypotonic buffer containing 1% (w/v) digitonin, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture at 0 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The reconstituted outer membrane vesicle was prepared as described previously with a slight modification (32Iwahashi J. Takaichi S. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial outer membranes were solubilized with 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1.5% (w/v) heptyl-β-thioglucoside (HTG), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture at 0 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated with Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C overnight to reconstitute the outer membrane vesicles. Immunodepletion was performed as follows. Aliquots of the HTG-solubilized supernatant fractions were incubated at 4 °C for 6 h with preimmune IgG-, anti-rTOM20-, or anti-rTOM40-IgG-bound Protein A-Sepharose. The Protein A-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was subjected to the reconstitution of membrane vesicles. MPP was loaded in the mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles according to the method of Mayer et al.(36Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Mayer A. Driessen A. Neupert W. Lill R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Purified yeast MPP (1.5 mg/ml) was added to the outer membrane vesicles in 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 6.5) and the mixture was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then placed on ice to allow the mixture to thaw slowly. A one-fifth volume of 100 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) was added to the mixture, and this was then incubated at 30 °C for 5 min and layered over a discontinuous gradient of 0.3, 0.88, and 1.5 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmEDTA and 150 mm NaCl, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The MPP-loaded membrane vesicles were recovered from the 0.88–1.5 msucrose interphase. The outer membrane vesicles (10 μg) were suspended in 50 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.22m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, 50 mmNaCl, 0.2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml HSP70 and incubated with 125I-pAd at 0 or 30 °C for 30 min. After the binding reaction, the mixtures were diluted 3-fold with HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mm NaCl (final concentration 150 mm NaCl), and ultracentrifuged to separate the supernatant and the membrane fractions. Both fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the gels were analyzed using a Bioimage Analyzer FLA2000 for pAd. When the processing of pAd by the MPP-loaded outer membrane vesicles was to be monitored, 2 mmMnCl2 was added to the reaction mixture. Two sequences that partially overlapped and that were predicted to encode the partial amino acid sequence of the mouse counterpart of fungal Tom40 (dbEST numbers 631778 and 757235) (38Kiebler M. Phaller R. Söllner T. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Nature. 1990; 348: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39Vestweber W. Brunner J. Baker A. Schatz G. Nature. 1989; 341: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) were found in the EST data base. We screened the rat λgt10 cDNA library for the rat counterpart using the assembled nucleotide sequence as the probe and obtained a cDNA clone of ∼1.6-kilobase pair that carried a putative open reading frame of 1086 bp encoding a 37918-Da protein. We concluded that this clone encoded the entire region of the authentic protein (OM38), because (i) the nucleotide sequence around the putative initiator methionine fit well with the Kozak motif (ACCATGG for (A/T)XXATGG), and (ii) the in vitro translated protein and the authentic protein as detected by immunoblotting exhibited the same mobility on SDS-PAGE and the molecular size estimated from the mobility coincided well with that calculated from the predicted sequence. The sequence identity of OM38 to N. crassa and S. cerevisiae Tom40 was 28.6 and 26.8%, respectively (Fig.1 A). The predicted sequence of OM38 exhibited a similar hydropathy profile as fungal Tom40, and also contained no obvious α-helical hydrophobic segments (Fig.1 B). Because OM38 appeared to be buried deeply in the mitochondrial outer membrane as described below, it was likely inserted into the membrane in a β-barrel structure, as has also been speculated for fungal Tom40. OM38, as demonstrated by the experiments described below, constitutes a structural and functional homolog of fungal Tom40 and, hereafter, we refer to this protein as rTOM40. While this study was in progress, the amino acid sequences of the predicted human and mouse homologs of Tom40 with 92 and 81% identity to the rat sequence, respectively, were deposited into the data base (GenBank accession numbers AF043250 and AF044249, respectively).Figure 1Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of Tom40 from rats, N. crassa, and S. cerevisiae.

Emi Y. Kawabata S. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1359-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and cytosol (28Ishihara S. Morohashi K. Sadano H. Kawabata S. Gotoh O. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 2 A). Immunofluorescence microscopy also revealed that rTOM40 colocalized with MitoTracker as a filamentous structure in normal rat kidney cells (Fig. 2 B). In order to examine the submitochondrial localization of rTOM40, mitochondria were sonicated under hypotonic conditions and then subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. rTOM40 was co-fractionated with monoamine oxidase, but not with rTIM23, an intrinsic inner membrane protein (22Ishihara N. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). rTOM40 was resistant to alkaline carbonate (pH 11.5) extraction and high salt treatment of the mitochondria, and was solubilized from the membrane only in the presence of detergent (Fig.3 A). The intrinsic inner membrane protein, rTIM23, behaved similarly to rTOM40 during these treatments, whereas HSP60, the soluble protein in the matrix, was easily solubilized by alkaline carbonate treatment. The topology of rTOM40 in the outer membrane was then probed by proteinase K treatment of the mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 3 B, rTOM40 was resistant to the externally added proteinase K, whereas rTOM20, which is the major import receptor and is anchored to the outer membrane through the N-terminal transmembrane segment extruding the bulk portion to the cytosol (20Iwahashi J. Yamazaki S. Komiya T. Nomura N. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18467-18472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was completely digested by this treatment. rTOM40 was also resistant to the treatment of trypsin added from outside the mitochondria (data not shown). rTOM40 was completely digested by proteinase K, however, under hypotonic conditions. The integrity of the inner membrane was preserved under these conditions, because proteinase K degraded only the N-terminal segment of rTIM23 that extrudes into the intermembrane space (22Ishihara N. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the matrix-localizing HSP60 was resistant to the treatment (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). Thus, rTOM40 is an integral membrane protein embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane in a conformation that is inaccessible to the protease from the outside, although it is accessible from the inside. Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies raised against SDS-denatured rTOM40 at a concentration as high as 300 μg/ml did not inhibit the import of pAd into the mitochondrial matrix. In contrast, antibodies raised against rTOM20 inhibited the import almost completely at a lower concentration (Fig. 4), indicating that rTOM40 is inaccessible to polyclonal antibodies added from outside the mitochondria. Taken together, rTOM40 acquires a conformation in the outer membrane that does not allow access to either proteases or antibodies. Similar properties have been noted for N. crassaTom40; i.e. it is not accessible to either trypsin or to antibodies, but is accessible to proteinase K (38Kiebler M. Phaller R. Söllner T. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Nature. 1990; 348: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast,S. cerevisiae Tom40 assumes a topology that allows access to both proteases and antibodies (39Vestweber W. Brunner J. Baker A. Schatz G. Nature. 1989; 341: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Figure 4Polyclonal antibodies against rTOM40 did not inhibit mitochondrial preprotein import. Mitochondria were preincubated with preimmune IgG (PI), anti-rTOM40 IgG (α40), or anti-rTOM20 IgG (α20) at 0 °C for 30 min, reisolated, and subjected to the import of125I-pAd. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the gels were analyzed by FLA2000. The import efficiencies were calculated as relative amounts of mature adrenodoxin (mAd), setting the amount of mAd imported into the untreated mitochondria as 100%. Inp: 100% of 125I-pAd used.ND, not determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess the function of rTOM40 in preprotein import, we examined whether the import-arrested preprotein actually interacted with rTOM40. The pAd-DHFR fusion was imported into the mitochondria in a Δψ-dependent manner and the mature portion was protected against externally added proteinase K (Fig.5 A, lane 4). In contrast, in the presence of methotrexate, which induces tight folding of DHFR, the mature form as well as the precursor was completely digested by proteinase K (lane 6), indicating that the mature form had not translocated the outer and inner membranes and remained stacked in the translocation machinery, exposing a significant portion outside the mitochondria. The pAd-DHFR-stacked mitochondria were solubilized with digitonin and subjected to immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.5 B (lane 3), antibodies against rTOM40 precipitated pAd-DHFR and the mature form. Since rTOM40 is contained in the ∼400-kDa TOM complex in digitonin-solubilized membrane (see below), these results indicate that the preprotein in transit to the matrix is actually integrated into the TOM complex, although the direct interaction of the preprotein with rTOM40 has yet to be shown. In contrast, the mature form was not precipitated at all in the absence of methotrexate, indicating that the mature protein had already exited the TOM complex stage. S. cerevisiae Tom40 forms ∼400-kDa complex with Tom22, Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5 in the digitonin-solubilized membrane (5Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Muller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas the majority of the import receptors were not found in this ∼400-kDa complex. A similar complex was detected in N. crassamitochondria, although Tom5 was not identified (40Künkele K.-P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In N. crassa, the TOM core complex composed of Tom40, Tom22, Tom7, and Tom6 was isolated after dodecyl maltoside solubilization of the outer membrane (41Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the interaction of rTOM40 with other import components of the rat mitochondrial outer membrane using immunoprecipitation. The outer membrane from rat liver mitochondria was solubilized with 2% digitonin and subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies against rTOM20 or rTOM40, and then the import components of the outer membrane in the precipitates and the supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.6 A, antibodies against rTOM40 efficiently precipitated rTOM20 and rTOM22. In contrast, there was no significant interaction between rTOM40 and the other import components of the outer membrane, rTOM70, 3H. Suzuki and K. Mihara, unpublished observations. metaxin, and OM37. Upon SDS-PAGE, the immunoprecipitates produced Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands of rTOM40, rTOM20, and rTOM22 (Fig. 6 B), which were confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). In addition, several protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 10 (OM10), 7.5 (OM7.5), and 5 (OM5) kDa were detected. Because these bands were not detectable in the precipitates with preimmune IgG, they were considered to be the components of the preprotein import machinery of the rat mitochondrial outer membrane. We then determined the size of the TOM complex by subjecting the digitonin-lysed mitochondrial outer membrane to blue native PAGE, which allows separation of the protein complex under native conditions. As shown in Fig. 6 C, the major fraction of rTOM40 migrated as a ∼400-kDa complex and the small fraction migrated as a ∼190-kDa complex. rTOM22 was contained in the ∼400-kDa complex firmly associating with rTOM40, but not in the ∼190-kDa complex. In contrast to the results obtained using immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 6 A), rTOM20 was mostly dissociated from the ∼400-kDa complex. A similar phenomenon was observed for the N. crassa TOM complex; following blue native PAGE, the import receptors, Tom70 and Tom20, were mostly dissociated from the holo complex composed of Tom70, Tim40, Tom22, Tom20, and two small Tom subunits (41Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Negative charges provided to the complex by Coomassie Brilliant Blue are thought to have destabilized the complex (41Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The involvement of rTOM40 in mitochondrial preprotein import was further assessed using the reconstituted outer membrane vesicles. For this purpose, the preprotein import activity of the isolated outer membrane vesicles was examined. When125I-labeled pAd was incubated with the outer membrane at 30 °C, pAd was inserted into the vesicles in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion, becoming resistant to salt extraction (Fig. 7 A). These results suggest that pAd was partly translocated from the salt-labilecis-site of the membrane to reach the trans-site to acquire salt resistance at 30 °C (36Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 42Rapaport D. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18725-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To confirm this further, outer membrane vesicles were prepared in which purified MPP was enclosed by freezing and thawing (37Mayer A. Driessen A. Neupert W. Lill R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After incubation with125I-labeled pAd, the vesicles were recovered by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The vesicles prepared in the presence of MPP, but without freezing-thawing, bound to pAd in a temperature-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B, lanes 2and 3) without any processing of pAd. On the other hand, vesicles prepared by freezing-thawing in the presence of MPP processed pAd in a temperature-dependent manner (lanes 5and 6). The processed form of pAd was completely degraded by externally added proteinase K (lane 7). These results indicate that the presequence portion including the MPP-processing site was translocated across the outer membrane and processed by the MPP present in the lumen, whereas the mature portion remained untranslocated and was thus degraded by proteinase K, confirming a previous report (37Mayer A. Driessen A. Neupert W. Lill R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Of note, however, a substantial fraction of the precursor that had reached the salt-resistant trans-site remained unprocessed by MPP. We speculate that the mitochondrial matrix proteins may be required in the lumen of the vesicles to facilitate access of the cleavage site of partly translocated preprotein to MPP. We then examined the function of rTOM40 with the reconstituted outer membrane vesicles using salt-resistant binding of pAd to the membrane as the criterion. For this purpose, the 1.5% HTG-solubilized outer membranes were subjected to immunodepletion using antibodies against rTOM40 or rTOM20. Then the supernatants were treated with Bio-Beads to remove the HTG and to reconstitute the outer membrane vesicles (32Iwahashi J. Takaichi S. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Antibodies against rTOM40 depleted rTOM40 almost completely, whereas rTOM20 was unaffected by the treatment, and vice versa (Fig.8 A, lanes 3 and 4). As shown in Fig. 8 B, the reconstituted vesicles prepared from the rTOM40- or rTOM20-depleted extracts exhibited only marginal, if any, translocation activity for pAd as assessed by salt-resistant pAd binding (Fig. 8 B, lanes 6–9). The possibility that import components other than rTOM40 or rTOM20 were depleted from the reconstituted vesicles by these treatments was ruled out because 1.5% HTG dissociated the TOM complex and rTOM40 migrated as a dimer in blue native PAGE (data not shown). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with anti-rTOM40 IgG revealed that rTOM22 as well as rTOM20 was completely dissociated from rTOM40 (data not shown). Thus, participation of rTOM40 in the preprotein import reaction could be demonstrated. Reconstitution of the import activity using the HTG-solubilized and rTom40-depleted fraction and recombinant rTom40 was unsuccessful. Although detailed findings have now been obtained regarding the import machinery of fungal mitochondria, very little is known about the import machinery of mammalian mitochondria. We have identified rat TOM40 as a component of the mammalian TOM complex. The amino acid sequence of rTOM40 was 28.6% identical with that of N. carassa Tom40. Despite this low identity, there are several common characteristics. (i) They are both deeply embedded into the outer membrane, since they assume a conformation that does not allow access for proteases or polyclonal antibodies added to the mitochondria from the outside. (ii) They have no predictable transmembrane segments with a potential α-helical structure. (iii) Rat TOM40, like its N. crassa counterpart, is associated with rTOM20 and rTOM22, and is present in the ∼400-kDa complex in the digitonin-solubilized outer membrane together with several other components, OM10, OM7.5, and OM5. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with the import-arrested preprotein as well as experiments with the rTOM40-depleted and reconstituted outer membrane vesicles demonstrated that rTOM40 functions as a component of the preprotein translocation machinery of the rat mitochondrial outer membrane. We thus conclude that rTOM40 is the major component of the TOM machinery of mammalian mitochondria and functions as the translocation channel, as is also the case for fungal Tom40. Our attempts at complementation of the function of Δtom40yeast cells by rTOM40 were not successful. Immunoprecipitation with IgGs against rTOM40 or rTOM20 as well as blue native PAGE revealed that the rat TOM complex contained several unidentified components, in addition to rTOM40, rTOM22, and rTOM20: OM10, OM7.5, and OM5. We speculate that these components might correspond to the small Tom proteins of the fungal TOM complex and we are currently characterizing them. These results suggest that the TOM complex of mammalian mitochondria resembles the fungal Tom complex, but is distinct from the plant TOM system: the ∼230-kDa complex containing Tom40, Tom20, and Tom7, but not Tom22 or Tom37 in a digitonin-solubilized state (43Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17251-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tom22 and Tom37 have not been identified in plant mitochondria (43Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17251-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Further experiments are necessary to precisely define the structure and function of the mammalian TOM complex in order to clarify its similarity to and distinction from the TOM machinery of other organisms. We thank Drs. Masao Sakaguchi, Naotada Ishihara, and Nobuhiro Nakamura of this laboratory for valuable discussions. We also thank Maki Maeda for the generous gift of antibodies against metaxin and OM37, and Shinichiro Yoshimura for technical assistance with fluorescence microscopy."

Purification of the enzyme utilized six column matrices, including a pterin-6-carboxylic acid affinity column. Treatment of crude rat liver extracts with EDTA or heat decreased the specific activity of the enzyme by up to 85%. Peptides generated from the purified protein were sequenced and found to be identical to primary sequences present within rat light chain or heavy chain ferritin. Commercial rat ferritin did not display catabolic activity, but activity could be acquired with iron loading. The purified enzyme contained 2000 atoms of iron/ferritin 24-mer and displayed similar electrophoretic properties as commercial rat liver ferritin. The ferritin-catalyzed reaction displayed burst kinetics, and the enzyme catalyzed only a single turnover in vitro. Expression of rat heavy chain ferritin cDNA resulted in increased rates of folate turnover in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and human mammary carcinoma cells and reduced intracellular folate concentrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results indicate that ferritin catalyzes folate turnover in vitro and in vivoand may be an important factor in regulating intracellular folate concentrations.

Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 273-335Google Scholar, 2Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Chemically, THF consists of a quinazoline ring that is bridged to a p-aminobenzoylglutamate (pABG) moiety through the C-9 methylene group (see Scheme FS1). In cells, THF exists in several chemically modified forms. The quinazoline ring can be oxidized to yield dihydrofolate, the product of the thymidylate synthase reaction, and the N-5 and N-10 of the cofactor are modified with single carbon units at the oxidation state of methanol (5-methyl-THF), formaldehyde (5,10-methylene-THF), and formate (10-formyl-THF, 5-formyl-THF, and 5,10-methenyl-THF). Each derivative serves a particular metabolic function in cytoplasmic folate metabolism. 5-Methyl-THF is required to remethylate homocysteine to methionine, whereas 5,10-methylene-THF is required to convert dUMP to dTMP. 10-Formyl-THF supplies C-2 and C-8 for purine ring biosynthesis. 5-Formyl-THF does not serve as a cofactor for folate-dependent anabolic reactions, but is an effective inhibitor of several folate-dependent reactions (3Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). THF is unstable in vitro and readily undergoes oxidative degradation. Solutions of THF can be stabilized in vitro by the addition of reduced thiols or antioxidants, including ascorbate. Oxidation can occur by at least two distinct mechanisms that are essentially irreversible. The quinazoline ring can be sequentially oxidized to dihydrofolate and then to folic acid through a quinonoid dihydrofolate intermediate (5Reed L.S. Archer M.C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1980; 28: 801-805Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Chippel D. Scrimgeour K.G. Can. J. Biochem. 1970; 48: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This mechanism is also shared by tetrahydropterin oxidation (7Moad G. Luthy C.L. Benkovic S.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1978; 26: 2271-2274Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Archer M.C. Vonderschmitt D.T. Scrimgeour K.G. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The site of oxidation has been proposed to occur through a 4a-carbinolamine intermediate, and chemically stable deazatetrahydropterin 4a adducts have been synthesized (7Moad G. Luthy C.L. Benkovic S.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1978; 26: 2271-2274Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and shown to be analogous to intermediates associated with the nonenzymatic oxidation of tetrahydropterins. Similar intermediates are also seen for the phenylalanine hydroxylase-catalyzed oxidation of tetrahydropterins (7Moad G. Luthy C.L. Benkovic S.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1978; 26: 2271-2274Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Davis M.D. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8585-8596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-Mercaptoethanol and other reduced thiols, which serve to protect reduced folates from oxidation (10Zakrzewski S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2957-2961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are proposed to protect this site from oxidation by forming transient 4a adducts. This notion is supported by studies demonstrating that lyophilized samples of pure THF contain 1 atom of sulfur/THF molecule (10Zakrzewski S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2957-2961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, THF or dihydrofolate can undergo an oxidative scission reaction at the C-9–N-10 bond. Electron extraction at N-10 results in the formation of an intermediate N-10 nitrenium ion that rapidly converts to the more stable C-9–N-10 Schiff base. Upon hydrolysis of the Schiff base, the scission products 6-formyltetrahydropterin (or 6-formyldihydropterin) and pABG are generated (5Reed L.S. Archer M.C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1980; 28: 801-805Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One carbon substitution at N-5 or N-10 can alter the reactivity of THF to oxidative degradation (11Maruyama T. Shiota T. Krumdieck C.L. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 277-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Lewis G.P. Rowe P.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 5-Formyl-THF is the most stable derivative of THF, and its stability has been attributed in part to steric protection of the C-4a oxidation site. Neither the role nor biochemical mechanisms of folate turnover in regulating intracellular folate concentration have been widely investigated. Humans turn over <1% of total body folate per day (13von der Porten A.E. Gregory III, J.F. Toth J.P. Cerda J.J. Curry S.H. Bailey L.B. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and folate turnover has been assumed to be due to nonenzymatic degradation of labile folate cofactors (SchemeFS1). Urinary pABG and its acetylated derivative, p-acetamidobenzylglutamate, have been demonstrated to be suitable indicators of folate catabolism (14Geoghegan F.L. McPartlin J.M. Weir D.G. Scott J.M. J. Nutr. 1994; 125: 2563-2570Google Scholar), the measurement of which reflects folate status in rats and humans (15Wang C. Song S. Bailey L.B. Gregory J.F. Nutr. Res. 1994; 14: 875-884Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Once the cleavage reaction occurs, folate is no longer a viable metabolic cofactor. Increases in folate catabolic rates are associated with pregnancy and growth rate in rats (16McNulty H. McPartlin J.M. Weir J.M. Scott J.M. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1089-1093PubMed Google Scholar, 17McNulty H. McPartlin J.M. Weir J.M. Scott J.M. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 99-103PubMed Google Scholar) and anticonvulsant drug therapy (18Maxwell J.D. Hunter J. Stewart D.A. Ardeman S. Williams R. Br. Med. J. 1972; 1: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Scott J.M. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1.

These increases in folate catabolic rates result in lower intracellular folate levels (15Wang C. Song S. Bailey L.B. Gregory J.F. Nutr. Res. 1994; 14: 875-884Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17McNulty H. McPartlin J.M. Weir J.M. Scott J.M. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 99-103PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in folate catabolism associated with certain physiological states suggests that folate catabolism is a regulated, enzyme-mediated event. However, attempts to purify enzymes from mammalian tissue that catabolize folate derivatives have not been successful, most likely due to high rates of nonenzymatic catabolism (19Scott J.M. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 307-328Google Scholar). The following study describes the identification and purification of an enzyme from rat liver that catabolizes folate and influences intracellular folate concentrations in cultured cells. (6S)-[3H]Folinic acid (5-formyl-THF; 40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (6R,6S)-5-Formyl-THF was from SAPEC, and (6R)-5-formyl-THF and (6S)-5-formyl-THF were the generous gift of Eprova AG. MES, HEPES, ATP, and rat liver ferritin were purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals were reagent grade. Fetal bovine serum, minimal essential medium (MEM), and its α-modification (α-MEM) lacking sodium bicarbonate, folate, ribosides, ribotides, deoxyribosides, and deoxyribotides were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories. G418 sulfate was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Y17 anti-recombinant mouse heavy chain ferritin antiserum and recombinant mouse heavy chain ferritin were generous gifts from Dr. Paolo Santambrogio. All procedures were performed at room temperature, except centrifugation and dialysis steps, which were performed at 4 °C. Throughout the purification, the catalytic activity was monitored in all fractions by incubating the protein solutions (50–500 μl) with 2 mm (6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF for 1 h at 37 °C. The amount of pABG generated was determined by the Bratton-Marshall assay (21Bratton A.C. Marshall E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1939; 128: 537-550Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) described below. Throughout the purification, >90% of the 5-formyl-THF catabolic activity was associated with a single fraction, with the exception of hydroxylapatite chromatography. Folic acid, 5-formyl-THF, and pterin-6-carboxylic acid affinity columns were synthesized as described previously (22Maras B. Stover P. Valiante S. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18429-18433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation and purification of intact mitochondria from fresh rat livers were performed as described previously (22Maras B. Stover P. Valiante S. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18429-18433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 fresh-frozen rat livers were thawed and homogenized in 1 liter of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. The homogenate was centrifuged, and the pellet was discarded. Polyethylene glycol 8000 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 17% (w/v), and the solution was centrifuged. The supernatant did not contain any 5-formyl-THF catabolic activity and was discarded. The pellet was dissolved in 500 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 30%. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). Only this fraction contained 5-formyl-THF cleavage activity. The protein solution from Step 1 was directly applied to a 10 × 10-cm phenyl-Sepharose matrix equilibrated with 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The column was washed with 500 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5) until the A 280 of the eluant was <0.1. The flow-through and wash fractions did not contain detectable 5-formyl-THF catabolic activity. The enzyme activity was eluted from the matrix with 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The activity eluted as a sharp red band. Active fractions were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% saturation). Following centrifugation, the protein pellet was resuspended in 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The protein solution from Step 2 was applied to a 5.5 × 8-cm Butyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) until the A 280 of the eluant was <0.2. The enzyme activity was eluted with a linear gradient; buffer A (200 ml) was 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), and buffer B (200 ml) was 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The activity eluted midway through the gradient as a red band. Active fractions were pooled (∼100 ml), precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% saturation), and dialyzed overnight against 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). The dialyzed protein solution from Step 3 was applied to a 5 × 10-cm hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). The enzyme activity was eluted with a linear gradient; buffer A (100 ml) was 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), and buffer B (100 ml) was 200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The most active fraction (see Fig. 2) eluted midway through the gradient as a red band. This fraction was diluted with water to give a final potassium phosphate concentration of 10 mm. The active protein fraction from Step 4 was applied to a 2.5 × 5-cm DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient; buffer A (200 ml) was 5 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.2), and buffer B (200 ml) was 200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The activity eluted as a red band midway through the gradient. Active fractions were pooled (∼100 ml), precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% saturation), and dialyzed overnight against 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The dialyzed protein from Step 5 was applied to a 1.5 × 4-cm pterin affinity column pre-equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) (buffer A). The column was washed with buffer A until theA 280 was <0.1. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient; buffer A was the equilibration buffer, and buffer B (100 ml) was 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). The activity eluted near the end of the gradient as a red band. Active fractions were pooled, precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% saturation), and dissolved in 300 μl of 20 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.2). The dialyzed protein from Step 6 was immediately applied to a 1.5 × 30-cm Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.5). 1-ml fractions were collected, and active fractions were pooled. Amino acid sequencing was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Purified protein was applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using Laemmli running buffer at 4 °C. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.25%, w/v), 10% methanol, and 10% glacial acetic acid. The protein band(s) of interest were then removed and soaked in 50% acetonitrile for 5 min. The acetonitrile was removed, and the gel slices were sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for Lys-C digestion, peptide purification, and sequencing. Additionally, tryptic peptides were generated and sequenced at the Cornell Biotechnology Facility. Purified ferritin (3.6 μg) containing 5-formyl-THF catabolic activity and commercial rat liver ferritin (3.1 μg) were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were boiled in a final solution of 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8) prior to electrophoresis. An isoelectric focusing gel analysis of the purified protein was performed. A 0.75-mm denaturing acrylamide (30%, w/v) gel containing Bio-Rad ampholyte mixtures (pH 4–6) was prepared as described previously (23Robertson E.F. Dannelly K. Malloy P.J. Reeves H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Protein samples were mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (8 m urea, 2% (v/v) ampholyte, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) prior to loading. The upper chamber and wells were filled with the anode solution (25 mm H3PO4). The lower chamber was filled with the cathode solution (50 mm NaOH), and electrodes were reversed to match the polarity consistent with the electrode solutions. When electrophoresis was complete, gels were rinsed and then fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Gels were stained in a solution of 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 45% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. Purified ferritin or cell extracts (0.1–1 ml) were incubated at 37 °C with varying concentrations of 5-formyl-THF for various time intervals. The generation of pABG, a primary aromatic amine, was quantified in the clarified solutions using the Bratton-Marshall assay (21Bratton A.C. Marshall E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1939; 128: 537-550Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Following the reaction, the samples were incubated at 100 °C for 2 min to precipitate protein present in the samples. This step was omitted when assaying the purified protein. 15 μl of 1.0n HCl and 5 μl of 1% (w/v) sodium nitrite (Sigma) were added to a 50-μl sample. Samples were vortexed for 5 min. 5 μl of 3% (w/v) ammonium sulfamate (Sigma) was added, and samples were vortexed for an additional 10 min. The samples were clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed, and 10 μl of 1% (w/v)N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine in 50% ethanol (Sigma) was added. The sample was vortexed briefly, and the absorbance at 550 nm was determined. The pABG generated was quantified relative to a standard curve. All absorbance values were corrected with control reactions that lacked 5-formyl-THF and others that lacked cell extract or purified protein. The purified enzyme was analyzed for the presence of protein-bound metals. The protein solution (0.5 mg of protein in 500 μl of 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2)) was dialyzed for 24 h against 1 liter of 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.2) with several buffer changes. The metal content of the purified protein and dialysis buffer was determined at the Cornell Nutrient Analysis Facility using an inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometer. The instrument detects the presence of 23 different metals. The metal content of the protein sample was determined relative to metal standards and corrected for any metal content present in the dialysis buffer. Iron was quantified in crude and partially purified protein fractions by modifying the colorimetric method developed by Liu et al.(24Liu Z.D. Lu S.L. Hider R.C. Biochem.

A 5-μl protein sample was diluted with 10 μl of 10 n HCl and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The reaction was diluted to a final volume of 1 ml with Milli-Q water. 51 μl of sample or standard was treated with 9 μl of 800 mm nitrilotriacetic acid for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation, 15 μl of 120 mm thioglycolic acid and 15 μl of 60 mmbathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium salt were added. After incubation for 30 min, the absorbance was determined at 537 nm. Exterior iron bound to purified ferritin and free iron in the protein preparation were removed by incubation with 10 mmEDTA for 1 h on ice. The EDTA was removed from the protein solution by dialysis in 1 liter of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) for 12 h with five buffer changes. Control samples of purified ferritin were incubated with a volume of water equivalent to the EDTA and treated in a parallel manner. Following dialysis, the activity of the EDTA-treated and control protein samples was determined using the Bratton-Marshall assay (21Bratton A.C. Marshall E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1939; 128: 537-550Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). EDTA-treated purified or commercial ferritin solutions were incubated with 500 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate for 1 h at 22 °C. Control samples were treated in a similar manner, but without ferrous ammonium sulfate. Excess iron was removed by dialyzing the samples against 0.5 liters of 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.2) for 12 h with five buffer changes. Following dialysis, the activity of the iron-loaded and control protein samples was determined using the Bratton-Marshall assay (21Bratton A.C. Marshall E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1939; 128: 537-550Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Total RNA isolated from rat liver (CLONTECH) was converted to cDNA using Tth polymerase (Promega). The open reading frame of heavy chain ferritin (HCF) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The forward primer was 5′-CAGTTGGGTACCATGACCACCGCGTCTCCCTC-3′ and contained aKpnI restriction enzyme site (underlined). The reverse primer was 5′-CGCCGGAATTCTTAGCTCTCATCACCGTGTC-3′ and contained an EcoRI restriction enzyme site (underlined). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into theKpnI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 and verified by nucleotide sequencing. The pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) utilizes the cytomegalovirus major intermediate-early promoter/enhancer and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. A G418 resistance gene in pcDNA3 allows for selection of stable transformants. The HCF construct (2.5 μg) was transfected into ∼1 × 107 CHO-WTT2 or MCF-7 cells by electroporation (0.22 kV and 950 microfarads; Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II). Cells were cultured in MEM for 24–48 h prior to the addition of 400 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Over 20 colonies from each cell line exhibited resistance to G418 sulfate; eight were isolated and passaged until a stable line was generated, and two colonies were chosen at random for subsequent study. CHO-WTT2 cells were obtained from Dr. Barry Shane (University of California, Berkeley, CA); MCF-7 cells were from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. G418 sulfate was added to the medium for selection of stable cell colonies that integrated the HCF construction. For folate turnover studies, fetal bovine serum was dialyzed against 10 volumes of PBS at 4 °C for 24 h with buffer changes every 4 h to deplete serum glycine, folate, and other small molecules. The serum was then charcoal-treated to remove any remaining folate. Defined culture medium was used (α-MEM lacking glycine, serine, and folate), which allows variation in the concentration of nutrients with relevance to folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism. For total folate analyses, defined culture medium lacking folic acid and supplemented with charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum was used. Cells were cultured in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum or in α-MEM supplemented with charcoal-treated 10% fetal bovine serum and glycine. The medium was refreshed every 48 h as necessary. Cells were harvested at defined time points by removing the culture medium and washing cell monolayers three times with PBS. Cell pellets were obtained by trypsinization of cell monolayers. The pellets were washed three times and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was divided into two equal aliquots, centrifuged, and stored at −70 °C. Total protein was measured in one fraction, whereas total folate was measured in the other. Protein was extracted by boiling in a buffered solution containing 2% SDS and 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8), and protein was quantified (25Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Total folates were measured by the procedure of Horne (26Horne Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, pellets were resuspended in a buffered solution containing 2% (w/v) sodium ascorbate, 0.2m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 m HEPES, and 0.05m CHES (pH 7.85). The solution was vortexed and boiled for 10 min. Samples were cooled and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated at 37 °C following the addition of 0.25 volumes of rat plasma conjugase for 3 h. Following incubation, the samples were boiled to precipitate protein, and the solution was cooled and clarified by centrifugation. The experimental supernatants, as well as standards, ranging from 0 to 198 fmol of (6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF were aliquoted into black 96-well ViewPlates (Packard Instrument Co.) containing 8.1 μl of working buffer (1.6 g of sodium ascorbate, 0.5 ml of 1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 6.1), and 9.5 ml of distilled water), 152 μl of folic acid Lactobacillus casei medium (Difco), and Milli-Q water for a total of 300 μl in each well. 20 μl of undiluted L. casei inoculum was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Growth of L. casei was measured at 550 nm by a MRX Microplate Reader II (Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA). Protein from cultured cells was extracted and quantified (25Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). In preparation for electrophoresis, 120 μg of protein was boiled in a final solution of 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8). SDS-PAGE was carried out using a 5% stacking gel and a 12% separating gel. Proteins were transferred overnight to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) in a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. The membrane was then blocked overnight in blocking buffer containing 5.0% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) in PBS. To detect HCF, sheep serum containing anti-heavy chain ferritin polyclonal antibodies generated against a highly conserved peptide (SQVRQNYHQDSEAA) (Chiron) or Y17 anti-recombinant murine HCF antiserum was used at a 1:4170 dilution in blocking buffer during incubation overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with 0.1% Tween in PBS before incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed with 0.1% Tween in PBS and visualized using the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce). Cell monolayers at 50% confluence were washed with PBS and cultured for an additional 12 h in α-MEM lacking folate and glycine and supplemented with 106 counts/ml (6S)-5-[3H]formyl-THF (25 nm). Cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS and then trypsinized and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in α-MEM lacking folate and glycine, and cells were counted with a hemocytometer. About 0.2–1 × 106 cells were aliquoted into 100-mm culture plates containing 10 ml of α-MEM supplemented with 1 mm(6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF or MEM containing 2 μm folic acid. Cells were harvested at defined time points. The medium was removed, and the tritium was quantified. Cell monolayers were washed with PBS and lysed with 0.2 mammonium hydroxide. Tritium remaining in the cells was quantified using a Beckman LS 8100 scintillation counter. Cellular THF derivatives are chemically unstable and readily undergo oxidation in vitro, with the exception of 5-formyl-THF. 5-Formyl-THF is stable at physiological pH and therefore is an ideal substrate to identify enzymes that catalyze folate catabolism while avoiding high nonenzymatic rates of folate oxidative degradation. Soluble tissue extracts derived from rat liver homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) were found to catalyze the formation of pABG when incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with (6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF. The generation of pABG from 5-formyl-THF was not influenced by the addition of 1 mm NADP+, NAD+, or FAD to the rat liver extract, but all activity was lost when EDTA at 1 mm was included in the homogenization buffer. Heating the crude rat liver extract to 70 °C for 5 min decreased pABG formation by >95%, demonstrating that the catabolism of 5-formyl-THF is enzyme-catalyzed and is not due to small molecule oxidants present in liver. The 5-formyl-THF catabolic activity was purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (TableI). The activity had been purified by this method >10 times starting from 100 fresh-frozen rat livers. The purification could be completed in 4 days and required the use of six column matrices. Throughout the purification, the 5-formyl-THF catabolic activity was associated with a single, red-colored fraction for all precipitation and chromatography steps, with the exception of the hydroxylapatite column. Fig.1 displays the three major protein fractions that eluted from the hydroxylapatite column (as determined by the A 280), and all three fractions contained a chromophore as demonstrated by the A 310. Each fraction was found to contain high l"

The Moco consists of a mononuclear molybdenum or tungsten coordinated by the dithiolene moiety of a family of tricyclic pyranopterin structures, the simplest of which is commonly referred to as molybdopterin (MPT) (3Rajagopalan K.V. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 215-290PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The cofactor can exist in a mononucleotide as well as various dinucleotide forms, and either one or two copies of the different Moco variants ligate the metal. The dinucleotide forms of the cofactor appear to be present only in eubacteria. All known molybdoenzymes in Escherichia coli contain the bis-MGD form of the Moco that consists of two MGD molecules and a single molybdenum. Based on sequence similarities, all of these enzymes belong to the DMSOR family of Moco-containing enzymes (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The crystal structure ofRhodobacter sphaeroides DMSOR (9Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C.

Soc. 2000; 32: 7673-7870Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar) revealed that the bis-MGD Moco is deeply buried in the enzyme. The molybdenum is ligated by the sulfurs of both dithiolene groups with an approximate 2-fold axis of symmetry passing through the metal. Only the molybdenum and some of its coordinating ligands are accessible from the solvent through an active site funnel. Genes involved in Moco biosynthesis have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, and eukarya. Besides the evolutionarily conserved common aspects of Moco biosynthesis (19Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar, 20Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an additional step is present in eubacteria in which the MPT form of the cofactor is converted into a dinucleotide form (21Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, the mobAB locus is responsible for the final step in Moco biosynthesis. E. coli MobA, also referred to as protein FA, consists of 194 amino acids and is responsible for the conversion of MPT and GTP to MGD (21Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Proteins with homology to MobA are present in a variety of eubacteria (Fig. 1). It is currently unclear whether Moco-containing enzymes in all of these organisms utilize MGD or other dinculeotide forms of the cofactor. MobB is a GTP-binding protein, with weak intrinsic GTPase activity (23Eaves, D. J., Palmer, T., and Boxer, D. H. (1997)246, 690–697.Google Scholar). Reportedly, MobB is not essential forin vitro reconstitution of apo-nitrate reductase, but it appears to increase the yield of active nitrate reductase (24Palmer T. Santini C.-L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Figure 1Sequence alignment of six MobA proteins from different species. Strictly conserved and similar residues arehighlighted in black and enclosed in abox, respectively. The four signature sequences are labeledI–IV. These six sequences were chosen from a set of MobA sequences to include those organisms most likely to synthesize the MGD form of the Moco.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In all of the available crystal structures, the Moco is buried deeply inside the protein, suggesting that cofactor insertion is coupled to the final steps of protein folding. In the case of R. sphaeroides DMSOR, two forms of the apoenzyme have been characterized (27Masui H. Satoh M. Satoh T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One appears to be partially unfolded based on its altered mobility on native gels and gel permeation chromatography columns, while the other form is indistinguishable from active DMSOR using these techniques. In the absence of molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide, CO dehydrogenase from Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava will incorporate a variety of cytidine nucleotides (28Hänzelmann P. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and DMSOR from R. sphaeroideswill incorporate either GMP or GDP in the absence of MGD (29Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whereas some Moco-containing enzymes such as E. coli nitrate reductase require a specific chaperone for Moco insertion (24Palmer T. Santini C.-L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), others such as DMSOR only require MobA as single protein component forin vitro cofactor assembly and insertion. This latter aspect is clearly illustrated in the accompanying paper (29Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) on an in vitro reconstitution system in which MobA only requires GTP, MgCl2, and the MPT form of the cofactor to efficiently generate active bis-MGD-containing R. sphaeroides DMSOR from apoprotein. These studies also indicate that high concentrations of MobA inhibit the reconstitution reaction, presumably due to binding of MGD to MobA. In order to gain a better understanding of MGD biosynthesis and the subsequent incorporation of this cofactor into molybdoenzymes, we have determined the high resolution crystal structure of E. coliMobA, with and without bound Mn-GTP. The active site of MobA is located in a deep depression on the molecular surface, and the co-crystal structure of MobA with GTP identifies the substrate-binding site. MGD biosynthesis presumably occurs in an elongated groove on the surface of the enzyme that is well suited for binding MGD. MobA was overexpressed and purified as described previously (29Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Crystals of MobA were obtained by vapor diffusion of an enzyme solution at a concentration of 12 mg/ml against a reservoir containing 2.5–3m sodium acetate in 0.1 m cacodylic acid, pH 6.5. The crystals reached their final size of 0.1 mm in each dimension within 10–20 days. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group I422 with a = 124.1 Å and c = 67.0 Å and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure of MobA was solved by single isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering using a platinum derivative. The heavy atom derivative was prepared by soaking a crystal for 24 h in mother liquor containing 2 mm K2[PtCl4]. After transfer into a cryoprotectant containing 25% glycerol, the crystals were cryocooled, and diffraction data were collected to 1.65-Å (native) and 2.7-Å (platinum derivative) resolution at beam lines X26C and X12B, respectively, at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Both beam lines were equipped with an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector, and diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL software (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). The platinum data set was supposed to be part of a multiwavelength anomalous diffraction experiment, but due to time constraints only two data sets, one at the inflection point and one at a remote wavelength, were collected. Since the derivative and native data were isomorphous, the remote wavelength data set collected at 1.033 Å was chosen as the heavy atom-derivative data set. One major and three minor platinum sites were detected by direct methods using SHELX (31Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1990; 46: 467-473Crossref Scopus (19232) Google Scholar). Phase refinement was performed with SHARP (32DeLaFortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) at 2.7-Å resolution followed by solvent flattening and gradual phase extension to 1.7 Å with SOLOMON (33Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The packing density in the crystals is fairly low, the Matthew's coefficient is 3 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 59%, and this probably contributed to the fact that phases could be successfully extended by solvent flattening only. Subsequently, the resulting phases were used to autobuild the polypeptide chain using amplitudes to 1.65-Å resolution with ARP (34Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) after 5% of the data had been set aside to calculate the free R-factor. ARP was able to build 164 out of 194 residues in four chains. Most of the remaining residues and the side chains were fitted into the resulting electron density maps with the program O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The model was refined with REFMAC (36Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13811) Google Scholar), and water molecules were added with ARP. All data between 20 Å and the respective high resolution limits were included. Additional calculations were done with the CCP4 suite (37Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to soak nucleotides into MobA failed, and no density features reflecting a bound nucleotide could be detected. This was attributed to the fact that the high concentrations of sodium acetate necessary for crystallization interfered with nucleotide binding. Subsequently, the concentration of sodium acetate was reduced to 1 m, since the crystals were able to tolerate this decrease in salt concentration. Soaking experiments at a concentration of 20 mm GTP in the absence and presence of stoichiometric amounts of divalent cations (Mg2+ and Mn2+) were repeated under these low salt conditions. Diffraction data were collected from various soaked and cryocooled crystals at beam line X26C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Data were processed with the HKL suite (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). Refinement against all of these data sets was performed using REFMAC, and the same reflections as in the native data set were used for calculating the free R-factor. The nucleotide was most clearly defined in crystals soaked with GTP and Mn2+, and the model described here is derived from a 1.75-Å data set collected at beam line X26C from a crystal that was soaked in 20 mm GTP and 20 mm MnCl2. Refinement was performed with REFMAC and ARP as described above for the native data set. The crystal structure of MobA was solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (TableI) using a tetragonal crystal form (space group I422). The structure has been refined at 1.65-Å resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.206 (Rfree = 0.243) (TableII). The overall quality of the model is very good as judged by the low free R-factor, the low deviations from stereochemical ideality, and the appearance of the Ramachandran diagram. 89.2% of the residues were found in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran diagram as defined in PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Ser72 and Leu73 located in a flexible loop are the only residues in disallowed regions of Phi-Psi space. The final model of the apoenzyme contains residues 2–16 and 23–192, a zinc ion with 0.5 occupancy, an acetate ion, and 177 water molecules. Residues 17–22 and 193–195 are disordered, and the N-terminal Met is not present, presumably due to posttranslational removal.Table IData collection and structure solutionParametersNativePlatinumMn-GTPResolution limits (Å)50–1.6550–2.750–1.75Wavelength (Å)1.251.0331.1Rsym0.086 (0.411)0.086 (0.327)0.084 (0.441)Completeness0.978 (1.0)0.949 (0.959)0.996 (1.0)〈I〉/〈sigI〉9.4 (1.2)11.5 (2.3)14.0 (1.9)Phasing power1.28/1.46RCullis0.796FOM0.336/0.267Rsym = ∑hkl∑i‖Ii − 〈I〉‖/∑hkl∑i Ii , where Ii is the ith measurement and 〈I〉 is the weighted mean of all measurements ofI. 〈I/sigI〉 indicates the average of the intensity divided by its S.D.

MobA has an α/β structure and is composed of a central β-sheet containing seven strands (β1, β4–β9). With the exception of β8, which is located near the center of the sheet, all strands are parallel. The β-sheet is surrounded by three α-helices on either side with the C-terminal helix α7 located above the N-terminal end of the sheet (Fig. 2 A). β-Strands 1, 4, 5, and 6 and the surrounding α-helices 1–3 form the N-terminal half of MobA (residues 2–101) and have a βαβαβαβ topology typically observed in proteins containing the Rossman fold, but beyond β-strand 6, the structure of MobA is unrelated to the classical Rossman fold. An additional short β-hairpin is inserted into the first helix, which starts with one turn in 310 conformation followed by the hairpin, leading back into the remainder of the helix. The MobA monomer has a conical shape with a groove running across the base of the cone and the N terminus at the tip of the cone. The groove is about 25 Å long and has a maximum depth of ∼10 Å. It is very narrow (∼7 Å) and deep (∼10 Å) at its N-terminal end, but is considerably wider (∼15 Å) and shallow in the center. At the C-terminal end, the groove narrows down again and has a width of ∼10 Å. A view into the groove reveals a surprisingly large number of Pro residues, including the conserved prolines at positions 79, 103, and 133. Pro79 and Pro103 are located in two of the four signature sequence motifs described below. Pro133 is at the i + 1 position of a β-turn (residues 132–135), which interrupts β-strand 8. The presence of this turn allows the N-terminal end of this strand (β8A) to contact the adjacent strand β7 in a perpendicular fashion from outside the central β-sheet of MobA. After completion of the β-turn, the remainder of this strand (β8B) is inserted in an antiparallel fashion into the β-sheet. In all data sets examined, a prominent density feature linked to the side chain of Cys100 was observed in the 2Fo −Fc and Fo −Fc electron density maps, suggesting that this residue has been covalently modified. The exact type of modification could not be established based on the crystallographic data, but the sulfur of Cys is still present, since its position is the highest density feature of this residue. Sequence alignments of MobA proteins from different organisms reveal four highly conserved regions (Fig. 1) as follows: (i) a glycine-rich loop (residues 12–25) bearing a distant resemblance to the P-loop typically found in a variety of nucleoside triphosphate-hydrolyzing proteins (in the crystal structure of MobA, these residues form a loop that is partially disordered and connects the first β-strand and α-helix); (ii) residues 78–82, including the highly conserved Pro79 at the N-terminal end of helix α3; (iii) residues 100–103 in the loop following β6 (the covalently modified Cys100, the strictly conserved Asp101, and Pro103 are located in this motif); (iv) residues 176–182, including two conserved Asn residues at positions 180 and 182 located near the C-terminal end of a long loop, which leads into the C-terminal helix α7. In the three-dimensional structure of MobA, all four stretches form exposed loop regions located in the large groove on the molecular surface (Fig. 2 B). This region presumably represents the active site of MobA. The program DALI (39Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) was used to search the Protein Data Bank for structural homologues of MobA. The highest match with a Z-score of 9.5 was the nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferase SpsA from Bacillus subtilis (40Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For comparison, two dissimilar proteins will have aZ-score below 2.0, and MobA matched against itself has aZ-score of 38.8. SpsA is involved in the production of the mature spore coat during sporulation, but its detailed substrate specificity is undefined. The structural match between MobA and SpsA is stunning, 150 Cα atoms of MobA can be superimposed with corresponding residues in SpsA with a root mean square deviation of 3.3 Å (Fig. 3). SpsA has been co-crystallized with either Mg-UDP or Mn-UDP, and the nucleotide binds near the N-terminal ends of β-strands 1–4. The binding site for the sugar is located in the C-terminal half of the molecule and might be mimicked by a glycerol molecule present in the crystallization solution. The structural similarity between SpsA and MobA is lower in this C-terminal region, reflecting different binding partners, either a sugar in SpsA or MPT in MobA. Other noteworthy matches of DALI include several dehydrogenases containing the Rossman fold, but these proteins are more distantly related to MobA as reflected by their lower Z-scores (Z < 4.2). Dynamic light scattering data of the purified protein 2M. W. Lake and H. Schindelin, unpublished results. at concentrations between 1 and 2 mg/ml indicate an equilibrium between a monomeric and oligomeric form of the enzyme. The molecular weight of the oligomeric form is most consistent with a decamer, but given the presence of an octamer in the crystal and its structure (see below) the oligomeric form observed by dynamic light scattering presumably corresponds to an octamer. In the tetragonal crystals, the MobA protein is present as an octamer (Fig. 4 A), which has D4 symmetry and is entirely generated by crystallographic symmetry operations in the tetragonal space group. The octamer has overall main chain dimensions of 75 × 75 × 65 Å and contains a central channel that runs along its 4-fold axis. The width of the channel is nonuniform, since it is restricted at the entrances to a diameter of ∼10 Å, whereas it is twice as wide near the center of the octamer. The restrictions on opposite ends of the octamer are separated by ∼25 Å, thus creating a roughly spherical central cavity. The restrictions at the entrances are imposed by residues 115–119. His115 is the second to last residue in helix α4, and residues 117–120 form a β-turn with Asp119 at the i + 2 position. The interior of the channel is lined with several hydrophilic side chains as well as polar main chain atoms. The N terminus is pointing into the channel near its center. Each monomer interacts with four other monomers, two along the 4-fold axis and two additional monomers along the 2-fold axes of symmetry. Although each of these contact areas only covers about 4% of the total solvent-accessible surface of the monomer, a total of 16.6% of the monomer surface is buried upon formation of the octamer. Unexpectedly, a zinc ion could be located in a monomer-monomer interface formed along one of the 2-fold symmetry axis (Fig. 4 B). The metal was identified as zinc by an anomalous Fourier calculation using amplitudes from the native data set collected at a wavelength of 1.25 Å, close to the K-absorption edge of zinc at 1.2834 Å, and the experimental phases after phase refinement and solvent flattening. The resulting map revealed a peak with a height of ∼32 times the root mean square deviation at the position of the metal. The metal is coordin"

Formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond between cytochrome b and ISP is detected in membrane (intracytoplasmic membrane and air-aged chromatophore), and purified bc1 complex was prepared from the A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP) mutant cells. Formation of the intersubunit disulfide bond in this cysteine pair mutant complex is concurrent with the loss of its bc1 activity. Reduction of this disulfide bond by β-mercaptoethanol restores activity, indicating that mobility of the head domain of ISP is functionally important in the cytochromebc1 complex. The rate of intramolecular electron transfer, between 2Fe2S and hemec1, in the A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP) mutant complex is much lower than that in the wild type or in their respective single cysteine mutant complexes, indicating that formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond between cytochrome b and ISP arrests the head domain of ISP in the “fixed state” position, which is too far for electron transfer to heme c1.

Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochromec and concomitantly translocates protons across the membrane to generate a membrane potential and pH gradient for ATP synthesis. Recently the cytochrome bc1 complexes from bovine (2Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J.

The structural information obtained not only answered a number of questions concerning the arrangement of the redox centers, transmembrane helices, and inhibitor binding sites but also suggested movement of the head domain of the iron-sulfur protein (ISP)1 duringbc1 catalysis. This suggestion arose from observation of a particularly low electron density area in the intermembrane space portion of the complex, where the extramembrane domains of ISP and cytochrome c1 reside (2Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). This movement hypothesis was further supported by the observation of various positions for 2Fe2S in the different crystal forms (3Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 4Zhang Z.L. Huang L-S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y-I. Kim K.K. Huang L-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A.

A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In tetragonal I4122 crystals of native oxidized bovine cytochrome bc1 complex, the position of the 2Fe2S cluster is 27 Å from heme bL and 31 Å from heme c1 (the “fixed state” position) (2Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 5Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kachurin A. Zhang L.Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Binding of stigmatellin or 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole enhances the electron density of the anomalous scattering peak of 2Fe2S, suggesting that these inhibitors arrest the mobility of ISP in the fixed state position (5Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kachurin A. Zhang L.Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Conversely, binding of (E)-β-methoxyacrylate-stilbene or myxothiazol to the complex abolishes the electron density of the anomalous scattering peak of 2Fe2S, suggesting that these inhibitors increase the mobility of ISP in the crystal and that 2Fe2S has no predominant position (referred to as the “released” or “loose” position) in this inhibited state (5Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kachurin A. Zhang L.Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In orthorhombic crystals (P212121) of the chicken enzyme, binding of stigmatellin shifts 2Fe2S from the so-called “distal or c1 position” to the “proximal or b position” (4Zhang Z.L. Huang L-S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y-I. Kim K.K. Huang L-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S-H Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The b position in theP212121 crystal is believed to be the same as the fixed state position observed inI4I22 crystals. In bovineP65 crystals 2Fe2S is located between theb state and c1 state positions (the “intermediate” position) (3Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The observation of more than two positions (intermediate and c1 positions) of 2Fe2S in P65 crystals (3Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) supports the idea of one fixed position and other released (loose) positions, suggested by the I4I22 structure. If movement of the head domain of ISP is required forbc1 catalysis, locking the head domain of ISP in a given position should abolish the bc1 complex activity. One way to lock the 2Fe2S cluster of ISP in a fixed position is to form a disulfide bond (disulfide bridge) between a pair of genetically engineered cysteines on the interface between the head domain of ISP and cytochrome b. However, genetic manipulation of bovine heart mitochondria is not practical.Rhodobacter sphaeroides is an ideal system for studying the intersubunit disulfide bond formation by molecular genetics. The four-subunit bacterial complex is functionally analogous to the mitochondrial enzyme; the largest three subunits (cytochromeb, cytochrome c1, and ISP) are homologous to their mitochondrial counterparts, and this system is readily manipulated genetically. In addition, R. sphaeroidesexpressing His6-tagged cytochromebc1 complex has been prepared (6Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R. Gennis R.B. Crofts A.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 378-380Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This greatly speeds up the isolation of the bc1complex from wild type or mutant cells. In fact, the study of the neck region of ISP using this system (6Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Tian H. White S., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) provided the first functional evidence for movement of the head domain of ISP during bc1 catalysis. The molecule of ISP can be divided into three domains: head, tail, and neck, with the 2Fe2S cluster located at the tip of the head (9Iwata S. Saynovits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10Link T.A. Saynovits M. Assmann C. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. Von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the three-dimensional structures of the head and tail domains are rigid and are the same in the fixed and released states, a bending of the neck is required for movement of the head domain. For the neck region to bend, some flexibility is imperative. Mutants with increased neck rigidity, generated by deletion or double- or triple-proline substitution, have greatly reduced electron transfer activity with an increased activation energy (6Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Formation of a disulfide bond between two engineered cysteines, having only one amino acid residue between them, in the neck region near the transmembrane helix, also drastically reduces electron transfer activity (8Tian H. White S., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), presumably because of increased neck rigidity. Cleavage of the disulfide bond by reduction or alkylation restores activity to that of the wild type enzyme (8Tian H. White S., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate a need for neck flexibility in catalysis. To further establish that movement of the head domain of ISP is essential for the bc1 complex, we generated mutants expressing His6-tagged bc1complex with pairs of cysteine substituted (one cysteine each) at the interface between cytochrome b and the head domain of ISP. We predicted that formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond between the engineered cysteine pair would arrest the mobility of ISP to the fixed state and decrease electron transfer activity. Herein we report procedures for generating three cysteine pair mutants with one each on cytochrome b and ISP in close proximity (interface) to each other. Mutants with single cysteine substitutions at indicated positions were also generated and characterized to confirm that the generated cysteine pair mutants are not at critical positions in thebc1 complex and, hence, are suitable for this study. The photosynthetic growth behavior, cytochromebc1 complex activity, SDS-PAGE patterns, and EPR characteristics of the 2Fe2S cluster in purified complexes from wild type and mutant strains were examined and compared as were the rates of pH induced intramolecular electron transfer between 2Fe2S and heme c1. Cytochrome c (horse heart, type III) was purchased from Sigma.N-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside andN-octyl-β-d-glucoside were from Anatrace. 2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinol (Q2H2) was prepared in our laboratory as previously reported (11Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4096-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites system from Promega.

The presence of engineered mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing before and after photosynthetic or semi-aerobic growth of the cells. Expression plasmid pRKDfbcFmBmCHQ was purified from an aliquot of a photosynthetic or semi-aerobic culture using the Qiagen Plasmid Mini Prep kit. Because R. sphaeroides cells contain four types of endogenous plasmids, the isolated plasmids lack the purity and concentration needed for direct sequencing. Therefore, a 2.5-kilobase pair DNA segment containing the mutation sequence was amplified from the isolated plasmids by the polymerase chain reaction and purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The 2.5-kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction product was recovered from the gel with an extraction kit from Qiagen. DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide syntheses were performed by the Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility at the Oklahoma State University. E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. For photosynthetic growth of the plasmid-bearingR. sphaeroides BC17 cells, an enriched Siström's medium containing 5 mm glutamate and 0.2% casamino acids was used. Photosynthetic growth conditions for R. sphaeroides were essentially as described previously (6Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Cells harboring mutated fbc genes on the pRKDfbcFBCHQ plasmid were grown photosynthetically for one or two serial passages to minimize any pressure for reversion. For semi-aerobic growth of R. sphaeroides, an enriched Siström's medium supplemented with 20 amino acids and extra rich vitamins was used. These semi-aerobic cultures were grown in 500 ml of enriched Siström's medium in 2-liter Bellco flasks with vigorous shaking (220 rpm) for 26 h at 30 °C. The inoculation volumes used for both photosynthetic and semi-aerobic cultures were at least 5% of the total volume. Antibiotics were added to the following concentrations: ampicillin (125 μg/ml), kanamycin sulfate (30 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml forE. coli and 1 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides), and trimethoprim (100 μg/ml for E. coli and 30 μg/ml forR. sphaeroides). Chromatophore and intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) were prepared as described previously (6Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol until use. The His6-tagged cytochrome bc1complexes were purified from frozen chromatophores by the method of Tian et al. (6Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Purified cytochromebc1 complexes were stored at −80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol. To assay ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase activity, chromatophores, ICM, or purified cytochromebc1 complexes were diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl to a final concentration of cytochrome b of 5 μm. Five μl of the diluted samples were added to 1 ml of assay mixture containing 100 mm of Na+/K+phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm of EDTA, 100 μm of cytochrome c, and 25 μm of Q2H2. Activities were determined by measuring the reduction of cytochrome c (the increase of the absorbance at wavelength 550 nm) in a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC spectrophotometer at 23 °C, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 for calculation. The nonenzymatic oxidation of Q2H2, determined under the same conditions, in the absence of enzyme, was subtracted during specific activity calculations. The wild type or mutantbc1 complex was diluted in 3 ml of 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 200 mmNaCl and 0.01% dodecylmaltoside. The concentration of cytochromec1 was adjusted to about 10 μm. Different amounts of NaOH or HCl were added to give the indicated pH levels. Fully oxidized or reduced cytochrome c1and ISP was obtained by addition of K3Fe(CN)6or sodium ascorbate. Reduction of cytochrome c1was followed by measuring the increase of the α-absorption (553–545 nm) in a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC spectrophotometer. Reduction of ISP was followed by measuring the negative CD peak, at 500 nm, of partially reduced ISP minus fully oxidized complex in a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter (13Link T.A. Hatzfeld O.M.

Instrument settings for the spectropolarimeter were: scan speed, 100 nm/min; step resolution, 1 nm; accumulation, 10 traces for averaging; response, 1 s; bandwidth, 1.0 nm; sensitivity, 10 mdeg; and slit width, 500 μm. The redox status of heme c1 or the 2Fe2S cluster was determined as described above. The cytochrome c1partially reduced wild type and mutant bc1complexes were prepared and used for the absorption and CD measurements. The redox potentials of ISP were calculated from the redox statuses of heme c1 and 2Fe2S, at pH 8.0, using 230 mV for the redox potential of heme c1(16Yu L. Dong J.H. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 85 2: 203-211Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The method used is essentially the same as that previously reported (15Zhang L. Tai C-H., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7656-7661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged, cytochromec1 half-reduced cytochromebc1 complex was prepared as described for the preparation of the oxidized complex (6Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), except the cytochromec1 in the dodecylmaltoside-solubilized chromatophore was reduced 50% with sodium ascorbate before being applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The cytochromec1 half-reduced complex was diluted in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 6.8 or 8.9, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% dodecylmaltoside to a cytochromec1 concentration of around 10 μmand mixed with buffers of various pHs at room temperature in an Olis stopped flow rapid scanning spectrophotometer. Oxidation or reduction of cytochrome c1 was monitored by the decrease or increase of absorption at 553 nm minus 545 nm. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b (18Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1986; 85 2: 203-211Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) contents were determined according to published methods. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean dual slab vertical cell. Samples were digested with 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS, and 3% glycerol in the presence and absence of 0.4% β-ME for 2 h at 37 °C before being subjected to electrophoresis. The intersubunit disulfide bond linked adduct protein was obtained by electrophoretic elution (20Yu L. Wei Y-Y. Usui S. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24508-24515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of a protein band, with an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa, from SDS-PAGE of the purified A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP) mutant complex without β-ME treatment. Western blotting was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and ISP of the R. sphaeroides bc1 complex (6Tian H., Yu, L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The polypeptides separated by SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as the second antibody. EPR spectra were recorded in a Bruker ER 200D apparatus equipped with liquid Nitrogen Dewar, at 77 K. The instrument settings are detailed in the figure legends. Three pairs of amino acid residues: Ala185(cytb)/Lys70(ISP), Ile326(cytb)/Gly165(ISP), and Thr386(cytb)/Lys164(ISP) were selected for mutation to cysteines. These choices were based on the three-dimensional structural model of the four-subunit cytochromebc1 complex of R. sphaeroides (Fig. 1 A) constructed with coordinates from bovine cytochromes b andc1, ISP, and subunit XII (21Tso S-C. Shenoy S.K. Quinn B. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15287-15294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The distances between these three cysteine pairs are 6.1, 6.1, and, 7.5 Å, respectively, in the bacterial complex (Fig. 1 B). They are 6.5, 6.8, and 6.4 Å (Table I), respectively, when calculations are based on corresponding residues in the bovine enzyme. Mutants with a single cysteine substitution, at positions Ala185(cytb), Ile326(cytb), Thr386(cytb), Lys70(ISP), Gly165(ISP), or Lys164(ISP), were also generated and used as controls.Table ICharacterization of ISP and cytochrome b interface cysteine mutantsMutantsSingle mutationDouble mutant residue distance 1-aThe distances were measured from C-β to C-β (except with glycine, which is to C-α).Ps 1-bPs, photosynthetic growth. ++, the cells growth rate is essentially the same as that of the wild type cells; +, the cells can grow photosynthetically but at a rate slower than that of the wild type cells; −, no photosynthetic growth in 4 days.Enzymatic activity 1-cEnzymatic activity is expressed as μmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol cytochromeb at room temperature.Corresponding residues in bovineLocationIn bovine structureIn bacterial modelingChromatophorePurified complex 1-dThe cytochromebc1 complex was in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm histidine, and 0.5% octyl glucoside.ÅWild type++2.3 (100%)2.5 (100%)A185C(cytb)Ser169cd2++2.3 (100%)2.5 (100%)K70C(ISP)Lys95β3++1.3 (57%)1.4 (56%)A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP)6.56.1++1.3 (57%)0.3 (12%) 1-cEnzymatic activity is expressed as μmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol cytochromeb at room temperature.I326C(cytb)Ile284ef loop++0.8 (35%)0.8 (32%)G165C(ISP)Gly174Pro loop−NA 1-fNA, not applicable.NAI326C(cytb)/G165C(ISP)6.86.1−NANAT386C(cytb)Glu344gh loop++0.9 (39%)1.0 (40%)K164C(ISP)Lys173Pro loop+1.0 (43%)1.0 (40%)T386C(cytb)/K164C(ISP)6.47.5+0.8 (35%)0.8 (32%)e The cytochromebc1 complex activity of the A185C/K70C mutant complex was measured immediately after preparation.1-a The distances were measured from C-β to C-β (except with glycine, which is to C-α).1-b Ps, photosynthetic growth. ++, the cells growth rate is essentially the same as that of the wild type cells; +, the cells can grow photosynthetically but at a rate slower than that of the wild type cells; −, no photosynthetic growth in 4 days.1-c Enzymatic activity is expressed as μmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol cytochromeb at room temperature.1-d The cytochromebc1 complex was in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm histidine, and 0.5% octyl glucoside.1-f NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab e The cytochromebc1 complex activity of the A185C/K70C mutant complex was measured immediately after preparation. For a cysteine pair mutant to be useful in this study, the engineered cysteine positions must not be critical for cytochromebc1 complex activity. Because thebc1 complex is absolutely required for the photosynthetic growth of R. sphaeroides, whether or not the engineered cysteine positions are critical to the complex can be determined by assaying photosynthetic growth. Mutants with cysteine substitutions at critical positions in the complex will not grow photosynthetically, whereas mutants with substitutions at noncritical positions will grow. When mid-log phase, aerobically dark grown wild type and mutant cells were inoculated into enriched Siström's medium and subjected to anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions, the A185C(cytb), K70C(ISP), A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP), I326C(cytb), and T386C(cytb) mutants grew at rates comparable with that of wild type cells, the K164C(ISP) and T386C(cytb)/K164C(ISP) mutants grew at a retarded rate (60%), and the G165C(ISP) and I326C(cytb)/G165C(ISP) did not grow photosynthetically (Table I). Because Gly165 of ISP is a critical position, mutant I326C(cytb)/G165C(ISP) does not support photosynthetic growth and cannot be used to study the effect of disulfide bond formation on thebc1 complex. The structural importance of Gly165 was further investigated by substituting alanine or threonine at this position. The ISP:G165A or G165T substitution also results in cells that do not grow photosynthetically, indicating that the size of the amino acid side chain at position 165 of ISP is critical. A similar size-activity relationship was previously observed for Gly158 of cytochrome b in Rhodobacter capsulatus (22Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88 (496): 492Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Ser155 of cytochrome bin R. sphaeroides (23Tian H., Yu, L. Mather M.W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23722-23728Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP) and T386C(cytb)/K164C(ISP) support photosynthetic growth, indicating that the engineered cysteine positions are noncritical to the complex. Therefore, formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond between cytochrome b and the ISP head domain was examined with these two cysteine pair mutants. Chromatophores freshly prepared from the A185C(cytb), K70C(ISP), A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP), T386C(cytb), K164C(ISP), and T386C(cytb)/K164C(ISP) mutant cells have, respectively, 100, 57, 57, 39, 43, and 35% of the bc1 activity found in wild type chromatophores (Table I). When these chromatophore preparations were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against R. sphaeroides cytochrome b and ISP, no protein band corresponding to the adduct of cytochrome b and ISP was observed, indicating that no disulfide bond is formed between the two engineered cysteines in mutants A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP) and T386C(cytb)/K164C(ISP) during anaerobic photosynthetic growth. The lack of disulfide bond formation is expected because photosynthetic growth is under strict anaerobic conditions, whereas disulfide bond formation is an oxidative process. Without oxygen no disulfide bond can be formed even if the two cysteines are in favorable positions. When the His6-tagged bc1 complexes were purified from these six freshly prepared cysteine mutant chromatophores, all but the A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP) mutant complex have the same bc1 activity found in their respective chromatophores (Table I), based on cytochrome b content. The A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP) mutant complex, when assayed immediately after preparation, has about 23% of the bc1 complex activity found in its freshly prepared chromatophores. Activity in this cysteine pair mutant complex decreased during storage at 0 °C. About 7% of the activity remained after 24 h. Under identical conditions, no activity loss was observed for wild type and mutant complexes of A185C(cytb), K70C(ISP), T386C(cytb), K164C(ISP), and T386C(cytb)/K164C(ISP). To see whether or not the loss of bc1 complex activity observed for mutant A185C(cytb)/K70C(ISP) results from disulfide bon"

Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). The MPT molecule is a substituted pterin ring that coordinates the metal through a dithiolene linkage (Fig. 1 A). Additional variability of the molybdenum cofactor is found in bacteria with the attachment of GMP, AMP, IMP, or CMP to the phosphate group of MPT. In Escherichia coli, the final stage in cofactor biosynthesis is the linkage of GMP to MPT to form molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) (Fig. 1 B). This form of the cofactor is found in a number of enzymes essential to the global nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur cycles including dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DMSOR), nitrate reductase (NR), biotin sulfoxide reductase, and trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (2Kisker C.

This form of the cofactor is referred to as bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)molybdenum (bis(MGD)Mo). As first demonstrated in the crystal structure ofRhodobacter sphaeroides DMSOR (9Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor is deeply buried in the interior of the protein such that only the molybdenum atom and three of the coordinating sulfur ligands are accessible from the solvent.The conversion of MPT to MGD requires a gene product of themob locus. While wild-type cells contain both MPT and MGD,mob-deficient cells contain elevated levels of MPT but no detectable MGD (10Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, the mob locus contains two genes, mobA and mobB, that encode the 22-kDa protein MobA (also referred to as protein FA) and the 19-kDa protein MobB (11Plunkett G. Burland V. Daniels D.L.

The mobB gene is not essential for cofactor biosynthesis, since mobA alone can fully complement the deletion of both mob genes (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Studies of the conversion of MPT to MGD have been hampered by the extreme instability of both of these forms of the cofactor. In earlier studies, activation of E. coli NR expressed in amob − strain served as an indirect assay for MGD formation. Using this technique, it was demonstrated that the MobA-dependent activation of NR from a mob−strain was enhanced by the addition of GTP and MgCl2 to the soluble cell extract utilized for activation (16Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation also required the presence of the NarJ protein (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which appears to function as an NR-specific chaperone. (17Blasco F. Dos Santos J.-P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.-L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The MobB protein was not essential for this activation process, although its presence appeared to increase the extent of activation (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Despite the insight provided by these experiments regarding the role of MobA, activation of NR from a mob − strain using only purified, well defined components has not been achieved. In fact, most of the activation mixtures have included either a crude or soluble cell extract as an essential component. In the best defined activation mixtures, soluble cell extract was applied to a gel filtration column, and fractions from this column were added to NR purified from amob − strain, purified MobA, GTP, and MgCl2 (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, as mentioned by Palmeret al. (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the requirement for NarJ in the activation of NR from a mob − cell strain also complicated the use of this system for quantitative analysis of MGD formation. NarJ appears to play an NR-specific role in activation, since it does not influence MobA-dependent activation of trimethylamineN-oxide reductase (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Blasco et al. (17Blasco F. Dos Santos J.-P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.-L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) proposed that the main role of NarJ might be to maintain the NR complex in a suitable open conformation that is competent for molybdenum cofactor insertion. Although NarJ does not appear to be involved in formation of the MGD cofactor, it is difficult to separate the NR-specific role of NarJ as a chaperone and the more general cofactor biosynthesis role of the mob proteins, since both functions are required to form the active NR enzyme in these experiments.In view of the difficulties described above, the need was apparent for a new system for studying the conversion of MPT to MGD. The use ofR. sphaeroides DMSOR eliminated many of the complications associated with NR. DMSOR is a single subunit, soluble enzyme that contains bis(MGD)Mo as the sole prosthetic group (9Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), whereas NR is a membrane-bound, heterotrimeric complex that contains [Fe-S] clusters and a heme group in addition to the molybdenum cofactor (18Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recombinant DMSOR can also be heterologously expressed in E. coli (19Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

Okubo A. Yamazaki S. Satoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) ordorB (23Mouncey N. Choudhary M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7617-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that has been proposed to encode a chaperone for the DMSOR protein. However, heterologously expressed, recombinant DMSOR is active and incorporates the molybdenum cofactor in the absence of this proposed chaperone, indicating that a R. sphaeroideschaperone is not essential for successful expression of R. sphaeroides DMSOR in E. coli.In this paper, we present a completely defined in vitrosystem for studying the mechanism of assembly of the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor in R. sphaeroides DMSOR. The Rhodobacterenzyme has been expressed in E. coli in the absence of one or both of the mob gene products and activated using only purified components in a process that requires MobA, GTP, MgCl2, and MPT. After this in vitro activation, DMSOR from a mob − strain exhibited a maximum of 73% of the activity observed in recombinant DMSOR purified from a wild-type strain. The conversion of MPT to MGD by MobA has also been shown to occur in the absence of DMSOR.DISCUSSIONWe present here a fully defined, in vitro system for studying the mechanism of assembly of the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor. Thein vitro generation of activity in R. sphaeroidesDMSOR purified from a mob − strain serves as a sensitive and convenient assay of bis(MGD)Mo assembly and insertion into the apoprotein. Using this assay, it has been demonstrated that MobA, MPT, GTP, and MgCl2 are required and sufficient for the activation of mobAB − andmobA − DMSOR. Clearly, activation ofmobA − DMSOR, unlike that of E. coliNR, can proceed in the absence of a chaperone. Therefore, the specific roles of the mob proteins in the assembly of the DMSOR cofactor can be examined without the complication of the enzyme-specific role of a chaperone. In addition, the MobA-mediated conversion of MPT to MGD has been demonstrated directly for the first time without using the activation of a molybdoenzyme to indicate cofactor formation. This has also demonstrated that MGD formation can occur in the absence of a molybdoenzyme apoprotein.The Rhodobacter mobAB − andmobA − DMSOR proteins used in this activation assay were devoid of any detectable MPT or molybdenum. It was demonstrated previously that E. coli NR (29Rothery R.A. Magalon A. Giordano G. Buigliarelli B. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and DMSOR (30Rothery R.A. Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also do not contain any MPT or molybdenum when expressed in amob − strain. Therefore, the guanine moiety of the cofactors appears to play an essential role for binding of that cofactor in many MGD-containing proteins. Alternatively, the MPT-binding site could be latent in apo-DMSOR, although the binding sites for the two guanine moieties are obviously present as indicated by the presence of a full complement of guanine inmobA − DMSOR. Hänzelmann et al.(24Hänzelmann P. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have purified CO dehydrogenase, a molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide (MCD)-containing enzyme, from Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava grown in the absence of molybdenum or in the presence of tungstate, and they found that it was devoid of MCD while still containing a stoichiometric amount of cytidine moieties, including CDP, dCDP, CMP, dCMP, CTP, and dCTP (listed in order of abundance). Since only GMP and GDP were found in mobA − DMSOR, this may indicate a greater specificity in the guanosine binding pocket of DMSOR. The presence or absence of guanine moieties in E. coli DMSOR and NR expressed in the absence of MobA was not investigated in the studies mentioned earlier (16Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rothery R.A. Magalon A. Giordano G. Buigliarelli B. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It is unclear whether the guanine moieties present inmobA − DMSOR play any role in cofactor biosynthesis and insertion in vivo. However, the absence of MPT in apo-DMSOR shows that occupancy of the guanine nucleotide binding site does not by itself create the MPT binding site. The guanine moieties incorporated into the activated DMSOR originate from the GTP added to the activation mixture, as demonstrated by the use of radiolabeled GTP. Although the GMP and GDP are bound to apo-DMSOR strongly enough to be present stoichiometrically in the purified protein, the data presented here show that they can be replaced in the process of inserting the assembled bis(MGD)Mo cofactor into the protein. It may be that the guanine moieties found in mobAB − andmobA − DMSOR serve to stabilize the protein as a prelude to cofactor insertion, and one possible role for the proposed DMSOR chaperone is to catalyze the rapid exchange of the bound nucleotides for bis(MGD)Mo. It is also possible that, in vivo, the apoprotein interacts with a chaperone to prevent intermediate binding of GMP and GDP. Even with the guanine moieties present, heat sensitivity and overall low yield indicate thatmobA − DMSOR is less stable than the holoenzyme.As shown here, MPT is an essential component in the activation of DMSOR from a mobA − strain. MPT was not included in earlier studies on the activation of E. coli NR because inactive NR from a mob − strain was incorrectly believed to contain MPT (16Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to speculation on the source of the pterin component of the cofactor and to the suggestion that the lack of sufficient MPT may explain the low level of activation achievedin vitro with NR (29Rothery R.A. Magalon A. Giordano G. Buigliarelli B. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since cell lysate from amob − strain was included in most NR activation mixtures, the lysate may have served as a source of trace amounts of MPT. This is especially possible given the increased level of MPT found in a mob − strain and the low level of activation attained, only 15% of that for the wild-type enzyme (16Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), even in the presence of lysate. The failure to include a source of MPT also accounts for the inability to achieve activation using only purified components.It was surprising to find that high levels of MobA inhibit the activation of apo-DMSOR from a mob − strain. It is possible that a high concentration of MobA relative to that of available pterin makes it difficult for any two MGD moieties to assemble into a single bis(MGD)Mo cofactor. The MobA protein is able to form MGD in the absence of mobAB − DMSOR, as demonstrated by the formation of the form A-GMP derivative. However, this technique cannot distinguish between the synthesis of MGD and bis(MGD)Mo. Therefore, apoprotein may still be required for assembly of the complete bis(MGD)Mo cofactor. It is also unclear at this time whether MGD exists as an independent form of the cofactor or is only found as a protein-bound intermediate.The highest level of activation described here, 73% of that observed in recombinant DMSOR purified from a wild-type strain, requires a long incubation period. Preincubation of MobA, MPT, GTP, and MgCl2 did not change the rate of activation oncemobAB − DMSOR was added. It is likely that the rate-limiting step is the replacement of bound guanine nucleotides with the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor. In view of the requirement for the NarJ chaperone in the activation of mob − NR (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Blasco F. Dos Santos J.-P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.-L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to determine if the addition of the proposed R. sphaeroides DMSOR chaperone to the reactivation mixture increases the rate of enzyme activation. The role of a chaperone in cofactor insertion is especially intriguing, since, in holo-DMSOR, the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor is deeply buried in the interior of the protein (9Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Due to the larger size, multisubunit structure, and additional prosthetic groups present in NR, it is conceivable that such a chaperone is essential for cofactor insertion in NR while not required in the simpler DMSOR protein.E. coli MobB appears to play no role in the in vivo or in vitro activation of R. sphaeroides DMSOR. In contrast, MobB appears to enhance NR activation, although it is not required for the process (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Like the chaperone, MobB may not play as critical a role in cofactor production and insertion for the simpler molybdoenzymes. It may also be thatE. coli MobB may not be able to substitute for theRhodobacter counterpart in the reconstitution of R. sphaeroides DMSOR. Although the first 160 amino acids of R. sphaeroides MobB are highly similar to the entire sequence ofE. coli MobB, the R. sphaeroides protein contains 292 additional amino acids not found in the E. coli protein (31Palmer T. Goodfellow I.P.G. Sockett R.E. McEwan A.G. Boxer D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). E. coli and R. sphaeroides MobA are much more closely related, with 39% identity in their amino acid sequences. Whereas E. coli MobB is obviously not required for activation of mobA − DMSOR, it would be interesting to see whether the addition of R. sphaeroidesMobB to reconstitution assays would affect the rate or extent of DMSOR activation.Although this study does not focus on metal chelation to the MPT cofactor, the lack of MPT and molybdenum in recombinant DMSOR expressed in BL21(DE3) cells in the absence of supplemental molybdenum does seem to imply that metal chelation precedes dinucleotide attachment. This is especially likely in view of the inability of H. pseudoflavato produce MCD in the absence of molybdenum despite the presence of MPT in the cells (24Hänzelmann P. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the MobA protein in E. coli, and the analogous MCD-synthesizing protein in H. pseudoflavaare probably specific for Mo-MPT and are unable to attach the guanine or cytosine nucleotide to molybdenum-free MPT. Under the in vitro conditions described here, the pterin component acted upon by MobA is clearly Mo-MPT, since the cofactor is supplied by heat-denatured SO. This is supported by the inability of added molybdate to increase the extent of activation.A more complete model for cofactor biosynthesis and insertion can now be proposed for R. sphaeroides DMSOR. Molybdenum chelation to the pterin appears to precede dinucleotide formation. MobA then links the GMP moiety supplied by Mg-GTP to Mo-MPT to form Mo-MGD. Formation of Mo-MGD can proceed in the absence of an acceptor apoprotein. Subsequently, two Mo-MGD molecules are assembled to form bis(MGD)Mo, either on MobA or on the acceptor apoprotein. If both MGD moieties are already coordinated to molybdenum, the formation of bis(MGD)Mo would require elimination of one of these metal atoms. In the in vitro reconstitution procedure, neither MobB nor a DMSOR-specific chaperone is required in cofactor formation or insertion, although the presence of a chaperone may accelerate cofactor insertion. In all molybdenum-containing enzymes except nitrogenase, the metal is coordinated to the organic cofactor molybdopterin (MPT),1 which also serves as the cofactor for tungsten-containing enzymes (1Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). The MPT molecule is a substituted pterin ring that coordinates the metal through a dithiolene linkage (Fig. 1 A). Additional variability of the molybdenum cofactor is found in bacteria with the attachment of GMP, AMP, IMP, or CMP to the phosphate group of MPT. In Escherichia coli, the final stage in cofactor biosynthesis is the linkage of GMP to MPT to form molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) (Fig. 1 B). This form of the cofactor is found in a number of enzymes essential to the global nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur cycles including dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DMSOR), nitrate reductase (NR), biotin sulfoxide reductase, and trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In several MGD-containing enzymes, including Rhodobacter DMSOR (3Hilton J.C.

Haser R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the molybdenum atom is coordinated by two MGD molecules (Fig. 1 C). This form of the cofactor is referred to as bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)molybdenum (bis(MGD)Mo). As first demonstrated in the crystal structure ofRhodobacter sphaeroides DMSOR (9Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor is deeply buried in the interior of the protein such that only the molybdenum atom and three of the coordinating sulfur ligands are accessible from the solvent. The conversion of MPT to MGD requires a gene product of themob locus. While wild-type cells contain both MPT and MGD,mob-deficient cells contain elevated levels of MPT but no detectable MGD (10Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, the mob locus contains two genes, mobA and mobB, that encode the 22-kDa protein MobA (also referred to as protein FA) and the 19-kDa protein MobB (11Plunkett G. Burland V. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Iobbi-Nivol C. Palmer T. Whitty P.W. McNairn E. Boxer D.H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both MobA and MobB have been cloned, expressed, and purified (13Eaves D.J. Palmer T. Boxer D.H. Eur. J.

The mobB gene is not essential for cofactor biosynthesis, since mobA alone can fully complement the deletion of both mob genes (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Studies of the conversion of MPT to MGD have been hampered by the extreme instability of both of these forms of the cofactor. In earlier studies, activation of E. coli NR expressed in amob − strain served as an indirect assay for MGD formation. Using this technique, it was demonstrated that the MobA-dependent activation of NR from a mob−strain was enhanced by the addition of GTP and MgCl2 to the soluble cell extract utilized for activation (16Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation also required the presence of the NarJ protein (15Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which appears to function as an NR-specific chaperone. (17Blasco F.

We demonstrate here that hypoxia induced a time-dependent increase of both ADM mRNA and protein expressions in cultured astrocytes and endothelial cells from rat brain microvessels. Gene reporter analyses showed a 2-fold increase in ADM gene transcription which was suppressed when the ADM promoter was deleted of its hypoxia responsive element. Hypoxia increased 7-fold the stability of pre-formed ADM mRNAs. Rat brain microvessels expressed mRNAs coding for the different putative ADM receptors but they did not respond to exogenous ADM and calcitonin gene-related peptide by the formation of cAMP. In contrast, ADM and calcitonin gene-related peptide increased the formation of cAMP in astrocytes and their actions were potentiated about 2-fold after hypoxia. Messenger RNA species coding for three putative ADM receptors (the L1 orphan receptor, RDC-1, and calcitonin receptor-like receptor) and accessory proteins (receptor-activity modifying proteins) were present in astrocytes. Hypoxia selectively up-regulated expression of RDC-1 receptor mRNAs. The results indicate that ADM and RDC-1 are hypoxia-sensitive genes and that RDC-1 receptors may mediate some actions of ADM in hypoxic astrocytes."

These studies demonstrate that a CHO cell mutant (CT-60), which accumulates lysosomal cholesterol because of a defective NP-C1 protein, has approximately 5–10% of the acid sphingomyelinase activity of its parental cell line (25-RA) or wild type (CHO-K1) cells. The cholesterol-induced reduction in acid sphingomyelinase activity can be reproduced in CHO-K1 cells by incubation in the presence of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and progesterone, which impairs the normal egress of LDL-derived cholesterol from the lysosomal compartment.

There is convincing evidence from the Niemann-Pick group of diseases that the lysosomal hydrolase plays an important role in the intracellular relationship between cholesterol and sphingomyelin metabolism. In the type I forms of Niemann-Pick disease the absence of functional acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) results in the accumulation of numerous lipid species within the lysosomal compartment, including sphingomyelin, bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate, several glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol (20Spence M.W. Callahan J.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 1655-1676Google Scholar). In the type II form of Niemann-Pick disease, exemplified by Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C), cells are unable to release lipoprotein-derived free cholesterol from the lysosomal compartment because of a defect in the NP-C1 protein or possibly a separate gene product, NP-C2, which yields an identical phenotype. Despite the presence of a normal aSMase gene in NP-C fibroblasts, aSMase activity is reduced by as much as 80% (18Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Tokoro T. Butler J. Sokol J. Filling-Katz M.

Dis. 1989; 12: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) when these cells are grown in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, removal of lysosomal cholesterol by growth in medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) restores aSMase activity to normal levels (21Thomas G.H. Tuck-Muller C.M. Miller C.S. Reynolds L.W. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1989; 12: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Yoshikawa H. Sakuragawa N. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1992; 15: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This suggests that the elevated lysosomal cholesterol concentration of NP-C cells down-regulates or inhibits aSMase activity. Thus, regulation of aSMase by cholesterol is likely to play an important role in the regulation of cellular sphingomyelin concentrations and, therefore, in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. To gain insight into this process, studies were conducted in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant, CT60, that displays faulty regulation and maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis (23Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) because of a defect in the NP-C1 protein (24Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The absence of a functional NP-C1 protein in CT60 cells results in accumulation of cholesterol within the lysosomal compartment. A comparison of the CT60 cells and wild type CHO cells reveals that although cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes has a dramatic effect on aSMase activity, there is little change in the quantity of the aSMase protein. This conclusion is corroborated by studies in NP-C1 fibroblasts and normal CHO cells induced to accumulate intralysosomal cholesterol by incubation with LDL and progesterone. CT60 and 25-RA cells were kindly provided by Dr. T. Y. Chang (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). Wild type CHO cells (CHO-K1) and normal human skin fibroblasts (GM970) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Niemann-Pick Type C fibroblasts (GM110 and GM3123) were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). Bovine [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (54.5 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Stigmasterol was obtained from Steraloids (Wilton, NH). Tissue culture medium and supplements were obtained from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). FBS was obtained from Atlantic Biologicals (Norcross, GA). All tissue culture plasticware was obtained from Corning (Corning, NY).p-Phenylenediamine glycerol, nitrocellulose, peroxidase-conjugated goat α-rabbit IgG, and rabbit α-actin antibody (A2066) were obtained from Sigma. Formaldehyde and Kodak X-OMAT AR film were obtained from Fisher. Trypsin was obtained from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). FuGeneTM was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents and prestained broad range protein markers were obtained from Bio-Rad, and low molecular mass calibration kit markers were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mouse liver cDNA was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). All cell lines were grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks or dishes in a 37 °C, humidified incubator equilibrated with 5% CO2. CT60 and 25-RA cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in a 50/50 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium. NP-C and normal human skin fibroblasts were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earl's salts. All media were supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1% Eagle's vitamins, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and the indicated serum. Cells were routinely maintained in medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS that was heat inactivated by incubation at 56 °C for 1 h. In several experiments, cells were incubated in medium containing 10% (v/v) LPDS, which was obtained by density gradient centrifugation of heat-inactivated calf serum at a density greater than 1.215 g/ml. The full-length murine aSMase cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mouse liver cDNA. The primers used for the PCR reaction were based on the published sequence of the mouse aSMase cDNA (25Newrzella D. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1233-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These included a 36-nucleotide sense strand (including the initiating ATG) and an antisense strand corresponding to the 3′ terminal 24 nucleotides of the coding region. For cloning purposes, an EcoRI site was engineered into the sense primer, and a BamHI site was engineered into the antisense primer. The PCR product was made blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase and phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The purified PCR product was ligated into the EcoRV site of the plasmid pBluescript II KS and amplified in Escherichia coli. The authenticity of the cloned cDNA was verified by sequencing. The aSMase cDNA insert was transferred to the pCMV5 expression vector (26Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) utilizing the oligonucleotide encoded EcoRI and BamHI sites. COS-1 cells were transfected with the aSMase cDNA plasmid using the FuGene 6TM transfection reagent according to the manufacturers instructions using a 1:3 ratio of DNA to FuGene. To harvest cells for Western blotting and analysis of aSMase activity, medium was removed from the flask, and the cell monolayer was washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove residual medium. Cells were released from the flask by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cell suspension was transferred to a 15-ml screw cap tube, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g in a refrigerated centrifuge. The cell pellet was washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove residual medium and then stored at −20 °C. Two methods were used to disrupt cells and liberate intracellular contents. For method 1, the cell pellet was suspended in ice-cold water, and the cells were disrupted using a glass Dounce homogenizer. The protein content of the homogenized cells was determined by the method of Lowry (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. This method was used only for determination of aSMase activity. For method 2, the cell pellet was disrupted by repeated up and down pipetting with a Pasteur pipette in cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris Cl, pH 7.4) containing the following protease inhibitors at the indicated concentration: pepstatin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The disrupted cells were incubated on ice for an additional 20 min, and then nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and stored at −20 °C. aSMase activity was determined as described by Carre et al. (28Carre J.-B. Morand O. Homayoun P. Roux F. Bourre J.-M. Baumann N. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1294-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The appropriate volume of disrupted cell suspension was placed in a microcentrifuge tube, and the volume was adjusted to 90 μl with ice-cold water. If method 2 was used for disruption of cells, the volume was adjusted to 90 μl with cell lysis buffer. Unlabeled sphingomyelin in chloroform/methanol (2:1), Triton X-100, and [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin were mixed and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The dried residue was resuspended in 272 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.1). The solution was incubated in a 50 °C water bath for 1 min and then cooled in an ice bath until the solution became clear. 110 μl of this substrate solution was added to the 90 μl of cell suspension for a final assay volume of 200 μl. The final concentrations in the assay mixture were: 0.5 mm sphingomyelin (0.2 mCi/mmol) (except in Fig. 2 where various concentrations were used), 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm sodium acetate, and the protein concentration indicated in the figure legends. The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time and then cooled in an ice bath for 2 min. 100 μl of 10% bovine serum albumin, 100 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, and 800 μl of water were added with vortexing after each addition. The unhydrolyzed sphingomyelin was pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 4 min. 800 μl of the supernatant was removed and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter for the presence of [choline-methyl-14C]. Activity ofN-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase was determined by the method of Findlay et al. (29Findlay J. Levvy G.A. Marsh C.A. Biochem. J. 1958; 69: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) usingp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide as substrate.Figure 2Substrate concentration dependence of sphingomyelin hydrolysis in CHO-K1, 25-RA, and CT60 cells. CHO-K1 (▪), 25-RA (●), and CT60 (○) cells grown to near confluence in medium containing 10% FBS were harvested according to method 1 and analyzed for aSMase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that the concentration of sphingomyelin in the sphingomyelin/Triton X-100 micelles was varied as indicated. To achieve this, unlabeled sphingomyelin and [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin were mixed at the usual ratio, and aliquots were transferred to individual tubes prior to addition of the Triton X-100. The final sphingomyelin concentration in the assay ranged from 5 to 386 μm. The curves reflecting substrate concentration-dependent hydrolysis (A) were transformed by the method of Lineweaver and Burke (B) for calculation of apparent V max and apparentK m as shown in the inset in B. The inset in A shows the data for concentration dependent hydrolysis of sphingomyelin in CT60 cells with an expanded scale to reveal the curvilinear nature of the data at low concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Antibodies were obtained by inoculation of rabbits with synthetic peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Lampire Biologicals, Pipersville, PA). The peptides correspond to amino acids 613–627 (S-L-P-D-A-N-R-l-W-S-R-P-L-L-C) or 532–545 (K-R-L-Y-R-A-R-E-T-Y-G-l-P-D) of the mature mouse aSMase protein, and the antibodies are denoted as α-613–627 and α-532–545, respectively. The antisera from rabbits injected with peptide 532–545 were affinity purified by passing the rabbit antiserum over an Econo-PacIgG purification column according to manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The isolated IgG fraction was incubated with AffiGel-10 that was previously bound to the synthetic peptide by an overnight incubation with gentle rocking at 4 °C in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.5. After an overnight incubation, the antibodies were eluted from the column with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, containing 10% ethylene glycol and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-glycine, pH 10.5, dialyzed against PBS, and stored at −20 °C. Proteins in cell lysates, isolated as described above, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) using a 4% stacking and 10% resolving gel, transferred to nitrocellulose (2 h, 100 V), and incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. The quality of the transfer was monitored by brief staining with Ponceau S prior to the overnight blocking step. The blot was incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of antisera (α-613–627) or 25 μg/ml affinity purified α-532–545 in 2.5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween 20 followed by incubation with a 1:6000 dilution of peroxidase conjugated goat α-rabbit IgG. Bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Kodak X-Omat AR film. To ensure that subsaturating amounts of protein were applied to the gel, a preliminary experiment was performed with varying concentrations of cell lysate protein. The band intensity was linear at less than 200 μg of protein/lane. The relative density of the bands within each Western was determined using the Scion Image software (Scion Corporation, Fredrick, MD). The scanner (Hewlett-Packard ScanJetADF) was calibrated using a density step gradient (Kodak) prior to scanning the film. Cholesterol mass was determined following lipid extraction of cell homogenates by the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). A known amount of stigmasterol was included as an internal standard. Total and free cholesterol content was determined in lipid extracts by gas liquid chromatography as described by Klansek et al. (32Klansek J.J. Yancey P. St. Clair R.W. Fischer R.T. Johnson W.J. Glick J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2261-2266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph with autosampler. Separations were carried out at 240 °C with an inlet and detector temperature of 270 °C using a J & W Scientific 15-M megabore column coated with 50% phenylmethyl polysiloxane to a film thickness of 1.0 μm. Cholesterol ester mass was calculated as the difference between total and free cholesterol. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed by incubation in freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde, which was prepared by diluting stock formaldehyde (37%) with PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at room temperature with 0.005% filipin and then washed with PBS and mounted with p-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml) in glycerol. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope equipped with a DAPI filter set (excitation 365 nm, emission >420 nm) and a 63×, N.A. 1.4 planapochromat (UV transmitting) objective. The CT60 cell line, which contains a disrupted NP-C1 gene, was derived from another CHO mutant, 25-RA. 25-RA cells contain a gain-of-function mutation in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage activating protein (SCAP) gene (33Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The 25-RA cells were derived from wild type CHO cells. Therefore, aSMase activity was measured in cell homogenates from all three cell lines (Fig.1). In CHO-K1 and 25-RA cells, the rate of aSMase hydrolysis was approximately 1–1.5 nmol/min/mg cell protein. In homogenates from CT60 cells grown under identical conditions, activity was reduced by greater than 85% to 0.17 nmol/min/mg cell protein. The free cholesterol concentration was approximately 3-fold higher in the CT60 cells than in the 25-RA and CHO-K1 cells, and the majority of the excess free cholesterol was located in lysosomes as evidenced by the appearance of punctate, filipin-positive compartments dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown). Both the CT60 cells and the 25-RA cells had a 4.5-fold greater concentration of esterified cholesterol than CHO-K1 cells because of the presence of the SCAP mutation, which causes an elevated and unregulated rate of endogenous sterol synthesis. However, the 25-RA cells had normal aSMase activity (Fig. 1), indicating that the reduction in aSMase activity of CT60 cells resulted from the accumulation of excess free cholesterol and not from elevated cholesterol ester concentrations. Despite the low aSMase activity of CT60 cells, sphingomyelin hydrolysis was greater than background levels obtained when cell extracts were boiled prior to the assay. Moreover, sphingomyelin hydrolysis in CT60 cell extracts occurred in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, albeit at a much slower rate than seen in the 25-RA cell extracts (data not shown). Thus, the CT60 cells appear to have a normal aSMase gene but display dramatically reduced enzyme activity under normal (10% FBS) growth conditions. There were no differences in the activity ofN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase among the three cell lines, indicating that the low aSMase activity of CT60 cells does not reflect a generalized inhibition of lysosomal enzyme activity (data not shown). aSMase activity in CHO-K1 cell homogenates was not reduced by the addition of CT60 cell homogenate, thus ruling out the possibility that CT60 cells possess a soluble factor that inhibits or modifies the enzyme (data not shown). In cell extracts incubated with varying substrate concentrations, hydrolysis of sphingomyelin reached a plateau at ∼200 μm sphingomyelin or less in the CHO-K1 and 25-RA cells (Fig. 2 A). In the CT60 cells (Fig. 2 A, inset), the concentration required to achieve the half-maximal hydrolysis rate was similar to that seen for CHO-K1 and 25-RA cells. The apparent K m for the CHO-K1 and 25-RA cells was in the 65 μm range (Fig.2 B), whereas the apparent K m for the CT60 cells was approximately 50% lower, indicating that the low aSMase activity of the CT60 cells is not due to the presence of a competitive inhibitor. Increasing the substrate concentration did not restore aSMase activity to the level seen in CHO-K1 or 25-RA cells. The apparent V max in CT60 cells was nearly 15-fold lower than the V max in CHO-K1 cells and 9-fold lower than in 25-RA cells (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the amount of functional enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of sphingomyelin is considerably less in the CT60 cells than in CHO-K1 and 25-RA cells. Although the kinetic data suggest that there is less functional aSMase enzyme in the CT60 cells, these data cannot distinguish between lower amounts of the enzyme and potential modification by an effector molecule that functions as a negative allosteric regulator to inactivate the enzyme. To examine this possibility, experiments were conducted to determine whether aSMase activity correlates with aSMase mass. First, however, it was necessary to generate polyclonal antibodies for use in Western blot analysis. One antibody (α-613–627) was made to a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal region of aSMase. It is known that several lysosomal hydrolases become fully active only after removal of several carboxyl-terminal amino acids (34Hasilik A. Experientia. 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a terminal processing event that takes place within the lysosomal compartment. Therefore, an additional antibody (α-532–545) was made to an internal sequence. Both antibodies were tested for their ability to recognize aSMase in transfected COS-1 cells, which contain negligible endogenous aSMase activity. COS-1 cells were transfected with aSMase cDNA or control cDNA that encoded for an irrelevant fusion protein consisting of the amino terminus of preprolactin fused to an internal domain of complement C3 (35Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aSMase-transfected COS-1 cells displayed aSMase activity levels that were 35–100-fold greater than the endogenous activity of control-transfected cells (data not shown). Both α-532–545 and α-613–627 detected a prominent protein in the expected molecular mass range (60–70 kDa) in the aSMase-transfected cells (Fig. 3). A band of similar molecular mass was not present in the control-transfected cells verifying that both antibodies specifically recognize aSMase. A higher molecular mass band (approximately 100 kDa), perhaps representing a multimer, was occasionally seen in the transfected cells and in the CHO cells, but it was much less intense than the 60–70-kDa band. The molecular mass of aSMase is generally reported to be 70 kDa (36Newrzella D. Stoffel W. J. Biol.

In this study, we examined the effect of the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) on these processes. When inducibly expressed in PC12 cells, a kinase-proficient but not -deficient form of NIK promoted neurite process formation and mediated anti-apoptotic signaling. As expected, NIK expression led to IκB kinase activation and induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB. However, NIK-induced neurite outgrowth was only partially blocked by concomitant expression of a nondegradable form of IκBα that completely blocks NF-κB induction. In search of additional signaling pathways activated by NIK, we now demonstrate that NIK activates MEK1 phosphorylation and induces the Erk1/Erk2 MAPK pathway. Treatment of PC12 cells with PD98059, a MEK1 inhibitor, potently blocked neurite process formation; however, a dominantly interfering mutant of the upstream Shc adapter failed to alter this response. These findings reveal a new function for NIK as a MEK1-dependent activator of the MAPK pathway and implicate both the IκB kinase and MAPK signaling cascades in NIK-induced differentiation of PC12 cells.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3251-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activation may be principally a protective response by the host to enhance resistance to neuronal insults and modulate synaptic plasticity (18Mattson M.P. Culmsee C., Yu, Z.F. Camandola S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the NF-κB family member p50 are more sensitive to kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity (19Yu Z.F. Zhou D. Bruce-Keller A.J. Kindy M.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8856-8865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blocking NF-κB activation increases the sensitivity of neuronal cells to apoptosis induced in response to reactive oxygen species and TNFα (20Cheng B.B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The involvement of NIK in the central nervous system is revealed by a naturally occurring autosomal recessive mutation in the alymphoplasia (aly) allele of mice. Aly mice contain a point mutation in the carboxyl terminus of the NIK gene that affects its ability to interact with TNF receptor-associated factors (2Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These mice are immunodeficient because of a lack of lymph nodes but also develop progressive neurological abnormalities leading to hind limb paralysis (21Miyawaki S. Nakamura Y. Suzuka H. Koba M. Tasumizu R. Ikehara S. Shibata Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the gene encoding human NIK maps to chromosome 17 and more specifically to a locus associated with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism (22Arronson F.C. Magnusson P. Andersson B. Karsten S.L. Shibaski Y. Lendon C.L. Goate A.M. Brookes A.J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here we describe a series of studies examining intracellular signaling and responses in PC12 cells engineered to inducibly express NIK. PC12 cells are useful for the study of signaling events associated with neuronal survival, proliferation, and neuritogenesis (23Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 78: 2424-2428Crossref Scopus (4803) Google Scholar, 24Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the ecdysone-induced expression of kinase-proficient but not -deficient NIK promotes neurite formation, involving activation of the IKK and MAPK pathways. The expression vectors encoding IκBα S32A/S36A (SS/AA) and the dominant-negative Shc (Y239F/Y240F/Y317F) mutant have been described elsewhere (25Geleziunas R. Ferrel S. Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T.

Ecdysone-responsive (EcR) PC12 cells stably expressing WT Myc-NIK and kinase-deficient Myc-NIK (K429A/K430A) under the control of the ecdysone-inducible pIND vector (Invitrogen) were selected with hygromycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Parental PC12 EcR cells and those stably transfected with the pIND Myc-NIK constructs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were treated as indicated with ecdysone (5 μm) (Invitrogen), murine TNFα (20 ng/ml) (Sigma), mNGF (50 ng/ml) (Sigma), and the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (50 μm) (New England Biolabs). EcR WT NIK PC12 cells, EcR kinase-deficient (KD) NIK PC12 cells, and parental EcR PC12 cells were stimulated with ecdysone (5 μm) for 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in eukaryotic lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cleared lysates were incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-myc rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-myc antibodies. Approximately 2.5 × 105PC12 cells per well in six-well dishes were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a luciferase reporter plasmid DNA containing κB, AP1, CRE, or serum-response element (SRE) enhancer elements (Stratagene). After the indicated treatment and lysis in eukaryotic lysis buffer, luciferase activity was measured with the enhanced luciferase assay kit and a Microbeta 1450 Trilux luminescence counter (Wallac Company). All transfections included the pRC-β-actin LacZ plasmid to normalize for differences in gene transfer efficiency. Cleavage of genomic DNA occurring during apoptosis was detected in TUNEL assays with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, which catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides to free 3′ ends of DNA in a template-independent manner. Fluorescein labels incorporated in nucleotide polymers were detected and quantitated by fluorescence microscopy (in situ cell death detection kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PC12 cell differentiation and survival was measured by plating cells onto collagen-coated eight-chamber glass culture slides (Falcon), and the percentage of cells with neurite processes greater than two cell bodies in length were counted after relevant treatment. EcR WT NIK PC12 cells, EcR KD NIK PC12 cells, and parental EcR PC12 cells were stimulated with ecdysone (5 μm) for 24 h and lysed in eukaryotic cell lysis buffer. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-IKKα (H744, cross-reactive with IKKβ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glycerol-2-phosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 4 mm NaF, 1 mmDTT, 20 μm ATP), and incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) and 1 μg of recombinant GST-IκBα (1–62) as an exogenous substrate. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and exposed to hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were subsequently immunoblotted with anti-IKKα to determine the relative amount of immunoprecipitated kinase. Activated MEK1 was measured by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphorylated MEK1/2 antibody (New England Biolabs). Expression of this kinase was measured by blotting with anti-MEK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nuclear extracts were prepared, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with a consensus κB oligo (GGGGACTTTCCC) as a probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Atlas 1.2 cDNA arrays (CLONTECH) were used according to the manufacturer's protocol to assess the changes in gene expression in EcR WT NIK PC12 cells that were untreated or treated with ecdysone (5 μm) for 18 h. Probes are synthesized by reverse transcribing 1 μg of each RNA population using the cDNA synthesis primer mix and α-32P. Each radioactively labeled probe mix (1 × 106 cpm) is then hybridized to separate Atlas arrays. After high stringency washes the hybridization pattern can be analyzed by autoradiography and quantitated by phosphorimaging. To examine the effects of NIK, a potent upstream inducer of NF-κB, on the survival and differentiation of PC12 cells, we prepared PC12 cells containing a stably integrated, EcR kinase-proficient (WT) or KD NIK expression plasmid. NIK expression was not detected under basal conditions; however, the addition of ecdysone (5 μm) to either the EcR WT NIK PC12 cells or the EcR KD NIK PC12 cells readily stimulated the expression of these gene products. As expected, the lysates from the parental EcR PC12 cells did not inducibly express NIK (Fig.1 A). To assess the ability of the inducibly expressed WT and KD NIK proteins to activate NF-κB in PC12 cells, we transiently transfected a κB-luciferase reporter plasmid together with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. The EcR WT NIK, EcR KD NIK, and parental EcR PC12 cells were then stimulated with ecdysone (5 μm) for 24 h. Expression of WT NIK increased activity of the κB-luciferase reporter approximately 20-fold. Ecdysone did not increase luciferase activity in EcR KD NIK or parental EcR PC12 cells (Fig. 1 B). Although some nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling may occur, NF-κB present in complexes with IκB predominantly resides in the cytoplasm. After cellular stimulation and activation of the IKKs, IκB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome, freeing NF-κB for DNA binding in the nucleus (4Sun S.C.

We stimulated EcR WT NIK PC12 cells, EcR KD NIK PC12 cells, and parental EcR PC12 cells with ecdysome (5 μm for 24 h) and measured the activity of the endogenous IKK complex inin vitro kinase assays using GST-IκBα (1–62) as an exogenously added substrate. IκBα phosphorylation was substantially increased in WT NIK cells, but not in the KD NIK or parental PC12 cells (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with these results, we demonstrated that nuclear extracts from EcR WT NIK PC12 cells stimulated with ecdysone for 6, 18, and 24 h display κB-DNA binding activity at the latter two time points (Fig. 1 D). This slow and sustained response presumably reflects the kinetics of NIK protein synthesis following ecdysone stimulation. Growing evidence indicates that NF-κB exerts anti-apoptotic effects in neuronal cells and that a blockade of NF-κB activation is frequently associated with increased apoptosis (31Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar, 32Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). We assessed whether the induced expression of NIK could prevent apoptosis occurring in response to serum starvation. Apoptosis was measured using the TUNEL assay. EcR WT NIK and EcR KD NIK PC12 cell lines were cultured in the presence or absence of ecdysone (5 μm) for 24 h and then incubated for 24 h in medium containing 1% horse serum (Fig.2). Significant numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in KD NIK PC12 cultures in the presence or absence of ecdysone induction. Similarly in the absence of ecdysone stimulation, EcR WT NIK PC12 cells display marked TUNEL-positive staining. In contrast, the induced expression of WT NIK protected the PC12 cells from apoptosis accompanying serum starvation. Of note, WT NIK PC12 cells also formed neurite processes, a response not seen in unstimulated cells or cells expressing KD NIK (Fig. 2; comparepanel H with panels D and G). To explore whether neurite formation depended on NF-κB, we transiently cotransfected EcR WT NIK PC12 cells with expression plasmids encoding a nondegradable IκBα mutant (IκBα SS/AA), green fluorescent protein (GFP) to mark transfected cells, and a κB-luciferase reporter to assess the completeness of NF-κB inhibition by the IκBα mutant (Fig.3). IκBα SS/AA inhibited neurite formation by nearly 50% (left panel) under conditions that completely suppressed κB-luciferase induction (right panel). These results suggest that NF-κB plays a role in neurite formation but that other factors and pathways must be involved, as well. Because NF-κB induction may lead to NGF production (36Lindholm D. Heumann R. Meyer M. Thoenen H. Nature. 1987; 330: 658-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 37Hattori A. Tanaka E. Murase K. Ishida N. Chatani Y. Tsujimoto M. Hayashi K. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2577-2582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that NIK differentiates PC12 cells by an autocrine mechanism. However, transient expression of a dominant-negative Shc analogue (Shc YYY/FFF) failed to block WT NIK-mediated neurite formation even though it effectively inhibited NGF-stimulated differentiation (data not shown). Additionally, pretreatment of EcR WT NIK PC12 cells with anti-NGF antiserum had no effect on WT NIK-mediated neurite formation, and transfer of conditioned medium from NIK-expressing cells to new cultures failed to induce differentiation (data not shown). Together, these findings argue against an autocrine mechanism of NIK action involving the induced secretion of NGF. Several transcription factors have been implicated in the differentiation of PC12 cells, including Fos, Jun, Elk, and CREB (38Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). Fos and Jun form homo- or hetero-dimers and bind to AP1 sites, Elk binds to SRE, and CREB is able to bind to CRE sites (39Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of these signaling pathways in WT NIK-mediated differentiation of PC12 cells, we tested the ability of WT NIK to activate AP1-, CRE-, or SRE-luciferase reporter plasmids. In addition to activating NF-κB, ecdysone (5 μm for 24 h)-induced WT NIK expression also activated the SRE-luciferase reporter, suggesting involvement of the MEK1 pathway (Fig.4 A). Conversely WT NIK expression did not activate AP1-luciferase and stimulated minimal CRE-luciferase activity. As expected, stimulation of PC12 cells with NGF (50 ng/ml for 24 h) activated all three pathways, and TNFα (20 ng/ml for 24 h) stimulation produced an AP1-luciferase response but failed to enhance CRE- or SRE-luciferase activity. To explore the pathway leading to SRE-luciferase activation, we tested the ability of a dominantly interfering Shc mutant (YYY/FFF) to block NIK- and NGF-induced SRE-luciferase activity. This Shc mutant failed to inhibit the NIK response but significantly attenuated the NGF response (Fig. 4 B). Of note, pretreatment of WT NIK PC12 cells with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 markedly inhibited both WT NIK- and NGF-mediated activation of SRE-luciferase activity. To further test the involvement of MEK1 in the WT NIK response, we used a phospho-specific MEK1 antibody to monitor activation of this kinase (Fig. 4 C). Induction of WT NIK expression led to phosphorylation of MEK1, and this response was blocked by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (5 μm for 1 h). Probing the blot with anti-MEK1 confirmed equal loading of the lysates. MEK1 activity has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for PC12 cell differentiation (40Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 41Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested whether MEK1 activation is required for WT NIK-mediated PC12 cell differentiation; we pretreated EcR WT NIK PC12 cells with PD98059 (50 μm) for 1 h before stimulation with ecdysone for 24 h. PD98059 effectively blocked differentiation of PC12 cells expressing WT NIK (Fig. 4 D). These observations suggest that NIK acts downstream of Shc and upstream of MEK1. Because the activation loop sequences found in IKKα, IKKβ, and MEK1 are quite similar in structure, each might serve as a substrate for NIK (42Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). These data indicate that NIK exerts a broader range of effects than previously suspected, activating both the IKK complex and MEK1. We next surveyed WT NIK-mediated gene expression in PC12 cells using an Atlas cDNA array. Labeled cDNA probes from unstimulated EcR WT NIK PC12 cells and those treated with ecdysone for 18 h were hybridized to an Atlas 1.2 rat cDNA array, containing 588 different cDNAs. The genes up-regulated in response to NIK expression in PC12 cells included IκBα, cyclin D3, GSTμ, and the neuronal acetylcholine receptor protein (Table I). These data provide potential insights into the underlying mechanism by which NIK modulates signal regulation, cell-cycle progression, survival pathways, and neuronal cell function.Table INIK-mediated changes in PC12 cell gene expression following an 18-h ecdysone stimulation and hybridization to Atlas 1.2 cDNA arrayGene-Fold inductionGene-Fold inductionCasein kinase II4.5Glypican3.2Cyclin D3 1-aPublished report of NF-κB responsiveness (13).2.2VGF8A3.9Bcl-x 1-aPublished report of NF-κB responsiveness (13).3.4Synapsin II2.5GSTμ 1-aPublished report of NF-κB responsiveness (13).3.6Secretogranin V2.7Clusterin4.0uPA 1-aPublished report of NF-κB responsiveness (13).2.3IκBα 1-aPublished report of NF-κB responsiveness (13).8.6Acetylcholine receptor α34.81-a Published report of NF-κB responsiveness (13Pahl P.L.

Open table in a new tab Together, our findings raise the possibility that defective NIK function in Aly mice contributes to the progressive neurological degeneration observed in these animals. We hypothesize that cells from these mice do not respond normally when exposed to a ligand capable of activating NIK. In the absence of NF-κB to prevent neuronal apoptosis and the neuronal differentiation signals generated via both IKK- and MEK1-dependent pathways, these mice may develop progressive neurological deficits. A complete analysis of the neurological defect in the aly animals is currently underway. We thank John C. W.

https://openalex.org/W1968525137,"Ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) are serine/threonine kinases activated by mitogenic signals through the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases (MAPK/ERK). RSKs contain two heterologous complete protein kinase domains. Phosphorylation by ERK of the C-terminal kinase domain allows activation of the N-terminal kinase domain, which mediates substrate phosphorylation. In human, there are three isoforms of RSK (RSK1, RSK2, RSK3), whose functional specificity remains undefined. Importantly, we have shown that mutations in the RSK2 gene lead to the Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS). In this study, we characterize two monoclonal antibodies raised against phosphorylated forms of the N- and C-terminal domain of RSK2 (P-S227 and P-T577, respectively). Using these two antibodies, we show that stress signals, such as UV light, induce phosphorylation and activation of the three RSKs to an extent which is comparable to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-mediated activation. The use of specific kinase inhibitors indicates that UV-induced phosphorylation and activation of RSK2 is mediated by the MAPK/ERK pathway, but that the Stress-Activated Protein Kinase 2 (SAPK2)/p38 pathway is also involved. These results modify the view of RSKs as kinases restricted to the mitogenic response and reveal a previously unappreciated role of MAPKs in stress induced signaling. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4221 - 4229"
https://openalex.org/W2002888375,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are highly conserved approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that participate in both exocytic and endocytic vesicular transport pathways via mechanisms that are only partially understood. Although several ARF-like proteins (ARLs) are known, their biological functions remain unclear. To characterize its molecular properties, we cloned mouse and human ARL4 (mARL4 and hARL4) cDNA. The appearance of mouse ARL4 mRNA during embryonic development coincided temporally with the sequential formation of somites and the establishment of brain compartmentation. Using ARL4-specific antibody for immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that endogenous mARL4 in cultured Sertoli and neuroblastoma cells was mainly concentrated in nuclei. When expressed in COS7 cells, ARL4-T34N mutant, predicted to exist with GDP bound, was concentrated in nucleoli. Yeast two-hybrid screening and in vitro protein-interaction assays showed that hARL4 interacted with importin-alpha through its C-terminal NLS region and that the interaction was not nucleotide-dependent. Like ARL2 and -3, recombinant hARL4 did not enhance cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation. Its binding of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) was modified by phospholipid and detergent, and the N terminus of hARL4, like that of ARF, was myristoylated. Our findings suggest that ARL4, with its distinctive nuclear/nucleolar localization and pattern of developmental expression, may play a unique role(s) in neurogenesis and somitogenesis during embryonic development and in the early stages of spermatogenesis in adults."

In this study, the electronic relaxation of the heme, and the concurrent recombination between ligands and the heme at ∼280 K were examined in an effort to understand the environment around the heme and the dynamics of the ligands. Upon photoexcitation of the reduced CooA at 400 nm, electronic relaxation of the heme occurred with time constants of 0.8 and 1.7 ps. The ligand rebinding was substantially completed with a time constant of 6.5 ps, followed by a slow relaxation process with a time constant of 173 ps. In the case of CO-bound CooA, relaxation of the excited heme occurred with two time constants, 1.1 and 2.4 ps, which were largely similar to those with reduced CooA. The subsequent CO recombination process was remarkably fast compared with that of other CO-bound heme proteins. It was well described as a biphasic geminate recombination process with time constants of 78 ps (60%) and 386 ps (30%). About 10% of the excited heme remained unligated at 1.9 ns.

Though CO has been widely used as a probe to study the biochemical and biophysical properties of heme proteins, it has been thought to have no physiological role. CooA is the first example of a heme protein in which CO has a physiological function. Analysis of the dynamics of binding and escape of the ligand in heme proteins provides information on the intrinsic reactivity of the site for heme iron biding with the ligand, and how the reactivity and the pathway of the ligand are controlled by the protein. Observation of the motion of ligands such as O2, NO, and CO within heme proteins is facilitated by the simple photodissociation of diatom-heme protein complexes (9Martin J.-L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr G.N. Chem.

The dynamics of geminate rebinding, escaping, and bimolecular rebinding of ligands can be studied by various spectroscopic methods over a wide time range. Flash photolysis studies on CO-bound CooA will provide some useful information on the mechanisms of CO sensing by the heme and information on the regulation of CooA activity by CO. Measurement of transient absorption in the Soret band region on a tens of nanosecond or longer time scale has recently been carried out in studies on CooA, the results of which suggested a relatively high yield of geminate recombination (8Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study, we have revealed the details of the geminate recombination dynamics upon photodissociation of CO-bound CooA with subpicosecond resolution. Accurate measurements of the transient signals of CooA in both the presence and absence of CO has allowed us to reveal the multiexponential recombination dynamics of the ligands and to compare the unique features of CooA with those of other heme proteins. The expression and preparation of the recombinant CooA were performed as described previously (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, the recombinant CooA was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified by consecutive column chromatography steps, a Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a chelating-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, HR10/10). After removing salts by dialysis against an appropriate buffer, the sample was used for spectroscopic measurements. Reduced CooA was prepared by adding an excess amount of freshly prepared dithionite solution under an argon atmosphere to the protein solution. CO-bound CooA was prepared by introducing an excess amount of gaseous CO into the reduced sample. The transient absorbance changes were determined by measuring the transmission of a probe pulse through the samples under pump-on and pump-off conditions. The pump pulses centered at 400 nm were generated by the second harmonic generation of a femtosecond Ti/sapphire oscillator-amplifier system (800 nm, 1 kHz). The pump pulses were sent through computer-controlled delay optics to the sample. Femtosecond white light continuum pulses generated by the amplified 800-nm pulses were used to probe the absorbance changes in the 420–510-nm region (Fig. 1). Two different measurement schemes were used. In the first scheme (transient spectrum method), a dual photodiode array detector attached to the exit port of a monochromator with a fully opened output slit was used. One array monitored the probe pulse spectrum after transmission through the sample irradiated by the pump beam, and the other monitored the fluctuation of the probe pulse spectrum without transmission through the sample. The pump pulses were chopped at 5 Hz, and the spectra were synchronously recorded at 10 Hz. In the second scheme (single wavelength method), the dual photodiode array was replaced by two photodiode detectors. A mechanical chopper at half the repetition rate of the pulses (500 Hz) modulated the pump beam with a fixed phase to the pulse train. One photodiode detector monitored the energy of the white continuum pulse at 440 (±5) nm after transmission through the sample irradiated by the pump beam, and the other monitored the energy fluctuation of the same portion of the white continuum pulse without transmission through the sample. The probe and reference signals were carefully balanced and integrated by gated integrators for each laser shot. The difference signal between the two outputs of the gated integrators was sent to a digital lock-in amplifier. The amplitude of the modulation, which is synchronous to the pump pulse train was used to calculate the transient absorbance changes. The sample was continuously irradiated by the laser beams for at most 2 s to avoid build-up of photoproducts. A dark period of at least 1 s was introduced before measuring the transient absorbance change at each time delay. The instrument-response function and the time zero at each probe wavelength were estimated by optical Kerr effect (OKE) cross correlation between pump and white continuum pulses. Neato-dichlorobenzene in the sample cell was used as the OKE medium. The full width at half-maximum of the instrument-response function was 0.55–0.65 ps in the 420–510-nm region. The delay time where the OKE signal shows maximal intensity is defined to be −0.3 ps at each wavelength. With this definition, more than 90% of the instrumental-response limited transient absorption signal is developed at 0.0 ps. Curve-fitting analysis was applied to the data in the time region later than 0.0 ps. The angle between the pump and probe polarizations was set at the magic angle (54.7°) in all transient absorption measurements. The sample was introduced under nitrogen gas atmosphere into a gas-tight cylindrical cuvette with a path length of 2.5 mm. The CooA concentration was typically ∼25 μm on the basis of heme content. This cuvette was cooled (∼280 K) and rotated at ∼3 Hz during the measurements to ensure that each pair of pump-probe pulses would irradiate a new portion of the sample. The absorption spectrum before and after each measurement did not show any change. The energy of the pump pulse was 1.5 μJ in the transient spectrum method and 1 μJ in the single wavelength method. There was no essential change in the kinetics at 440 nm when the pump power was decreased to 0.4 μJ (data not shown). The probe pulse energy was <80 nJ. The diameters of the pump and probe beams at the sample positions were 0.3 and 0.2 mm, respectively. We estimated that at most 40% of the heme was excited by a 1 μJ pump pulse. The electronic absorption spectra of the reduced and CO-bound CooA, together with the probe wavelength range for flash photolysis, are shown in Fig. 1. Transient absorption spectra at representative delay times are shown in Fig. 2, a and b. Similar changes in the transient spectral shapes occurred in the case of both the reduced and CO-bound CooA within 5 ps upon excitation. After 5 ps, the spectral shape remained almost constant but the amplitude decayed. The decay seemed to be much faster in the case of reduced CooA than that in the case of CO-bound CooA. Transient absorption kinetics at representative wavelengths are shown in Fig. 3. The signal at 427 nm was dominated by photobleaching of the absorption of the six-coordinate heme in the ground state. Between ∼430 and ∼510 nm, the five-coordinate heme showed an absorption band (12Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The appearance of a positive absorbance change above 480 nm was instrument-response limited (e.g. at 488 nm in Fig. 3, a and b; Ref. 9Martin J.-L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There were two phases in the transient absorbance changes from 0.2–5.6 ps. The first phase was the growth of the positive signal at around 440 nm and the negative signal at around 425 nm (Fig. 2, a andb). Evidence of this phase was the delayed peak of the transient signals at 427 and 443 nm compared with that at 488 nm (Fig. 3, a and b). The second phase was observed from 1.2–5.6 ps in which the wavelength that gave the maximum positive absorbance change shifted from 441 nm to ≤438 nm (Fig. 2, aand b). The difference between the reduced and CO-bound CooA became clear at 23 ps and later times, where relatively larger transient absorbance changes remained in the case of CO-bound CooA.Figure 3Temporal profiles of transient absorption at representative wavelengths for reduced CooA (a) and CO-bound CooA (b). Each profile is calculated by averaging transient absorbance changes over a 4-nm bandwidth. The amplitudes of kinetics at 431 and 488 nm in a and at 488 nm in b are magnified by multiplication factors shown inparentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These complicated spectral changes were analyzed with the help of global curve fitting analysis. The kinetics over the whole wavelength region within 45 ps were simultaneously fit by the sum of triple exponential functions with common time constants. This yielded time constants of 0.8, 1.7, and 6.5 ps for the reduced CooA, and 1.1, 2.4, and 78 ps for the CO-bound CooA. For each time constant, the decay-associated spectrum (DAS),1 which is a plot of the exponential amplitude against wavelength, is given in Fig. 4. The single wavelength method was employed to study the long-lived transients in a more extended time region up to 1.9 ns (Fig. 5). The kinetic trace of the reduced CooA was fit by a sum of two exponential functions with time constants of 6.5 ps, 173 ps, and an offset (a very long time constant) (Fig. 5 a). The kinetic trace of the CO-bound CooA was fit by a sum of three exponential functions with time constants of 4, 78, and 386 ps and an offset (Fig. 5 b). The spectral shapes of the transient absorption spectra of the CO-bound CooA at time delays of 23, 110, and 630 ps were compared in Fig. 2 c. All of the above parameters obtained by the curve fit are summarized in TableI.Table IParameters of heme relaxation and ligand recombination in reduced and CO-bound CooASampletime rangeprobed rangetime constantspsnmamplitudesReduced0–45420–5100.8 ps, 1.7 ps, 6.5 ps (see Fig. 4)Reduced0–1900440 (±5)6.5 ps (93%), 173 ps (6%), offset (1%)CO-bound0–45420–5101.1 ps, 2.4 ps, 78 ps 1-aThe 78-ps time constant was a fixed parameter in the global curve analysis, since it was more accurately determined by the kinetic trace probed at 440 nm.

Open table in a new tab It has been reported that the dissociation of diatomic ligands from heme upon photoexcitation of cytochrome coxidase (13Stoutland P.O. Lambry J.C. Martin J.-L. Woodruff W.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 6406-6408Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), hemoglobin, or myoglobin (14Petrich J.W. Martin J.-L. Chem. Phys. 1989; 131: 31-37Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) occurs on a ∼0.1-ps time scale with a quantum yield close to unity. It is assumed that dissociation of ligands in CooA occurs within our instrumental response time with a quantum yield of unity. Rubtsov et al. 2I. V. Rubtsov, T. Zhang, H. Nakajima, S. Aono, G. I. Rubtsov, S. Kumazaki, and K. Yoshihara, submitted for publication. have studied the transient absorption changes in the mid-IR region after photolysis, and their study revealed an instrument-response limited bleaching of the vibrational band of the bound CO. This also supports our assumption. All of the time-resolved processes in this work are thus associated with relaxation of heme and/or rebinding of ligands. For both reduced and CO-bound CooA, we have resolved three exponentially decaying components within 45 ps (Table I). The fastest two of the three processes seem to be common to both the reduced and CO-bound CooA. This is supported by the following key points of the data. Firstly, the shortest two time constants of the reduced CooA, 0.8 and 1.7 ps, are similar to those of the CO-bound CooA, 1.1 and 2.4 ps, respectively. Secondly, the shapes of the DASs of the 0.8 and 1.7 ps components are also similar to those of the 1.1 and 2.4 ps components, respectively (Fig. 4). The dynamics of photodissociation and recombination between diatomic ligands and heme proteins have been extensively investigated for many heme compounds, such as myoglobin, hemoglobin, and cytochromec oxidase (9Martin J.-L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr G.N. Chem.

It seems to be most informative to compare the observed kinetics in this study with those obtained by Petrich et al. (12Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), because their experimental conditions were similar to ours. They measured the transient absorption spectra in the Soret band region for many diatom-heme protein combinations (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and protoheme with CO, NO, O2 or unligated) using 307- or 580-nm excitation pulses. They found 0.3-ps and 2.5–3.2-ps processes in the case of all heme protein complexes, including the unligated ones (12Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The spectral features of the 0.8–1.1-ps and 1.7–2.4-ps components observed here are in good agreement with those of the 0.3-ps and 2.5–3.2-ps components observed previously. The disagreement of the shortest time constants may result from our comparatively long instrument-response function. It thus follows that the 0.8–1.1-ps components and 1.7–2.4-ps components are attributable to relaxation of electronically excited five-coordinate heme. The 1.1 and 2.4 ps DASs of the CO-bound CooA are, however, blue-shifted by about 6 nm from the corresponding ones of the reduced CooA. This blue-shift may reflect the difference in the energy level of the excited heme after the dissociation of the ligand. This idea is supported by the relatively strong positive absorbance changes around 480 nm in the case of reduced CooA as compared with that in the case of CO-bound CooA (Fig. 2, a and b), because only highly excited five-coordinate heme shows absorption around 480 nm (12Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that a proximal ligand (His-77) is common to the reduced and CO-bound CooA (3Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the energy dissipation of the excited heme through CO dissociation in the CO-bound CooA is more effective than that of the distal ligand in the reduced CooA. The slowest-decaying components in Fig. 4 are very different in terms of time constants comparing the reduced CooA (6.5 ps) and CO-bound CooA (78 ps). It should also be noted that the DASs of the 6.5 and 78 ps components are similar to the difference spectrum between five- and six-coordinate heme (12Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These components are thus attributable to recombination of the ligand. Given the common proximal ligand for reduced and CO-bound CooA (3Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the great difference in the time constant probably results from the different natures of the distal ligands. It should be noted that heme itself undergoes a relatively slow relaxation process, like vibrational population relaxation, which affects the absorption spectrum in the Soret band region. The exponential decay time of vibrationally hot states of the electronically relaxed heme could be as slow as 6–16 ps (18Lim M. Jackson T.A. Anfinrud P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 12043-12051Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Science. 1997; 278: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The DASs for the 6.5-ps time constant may be affected by vibrational cooling processes. There is a minor component with a time constant of 173 ps in the kinetics of the reduced CooA (Fig. 5 a and Table I). In carbomonoxymyoglobin, there is a similarly slow relaxation process upon photodissociation of CO (20Xie X. Simon J.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3682-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Mizutani Y. Yamamoto K. Kitagawa T. Kuwajima K. Arai M. Old and New Views of Protein Folding. Elsevier Science, NY1999: 85-94Google Scholar). The ligation state of the proximal histidine changes with a time constant of 100 ps (probed by ν(Fe-His) Raman band shift, Ref. 21Mizutani Y. Yamamoto K. Kitagawa T. Kuwajima K. Arai M. Old and New Views of Protein Folding. Elsevier Science, NY1999: 85-94Google Scholar), and the restructuring of the asymmetric protein environment requires about 300 ps (probed by circular dichroism at 355 nm) (20Xie X. Simon J.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3682-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An even slower relaxation on the time scale of nano- to microseconds has been detected by probing weak iron-porphyrin charge transfer transitions (22Jackson T.A. Lim M. Anfinrud P.A. Chem. Phys. 1994; 180: 131-140Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar), though the major change is complete on the subnanosecond time scale. These are intrinsic to myoglobin, because such slow processes are not seen in the case of isolated heme in protein-free solution (21Mizutani Y. Yamamoto K. Kitagawa T. Kuwajima K. Arai M. Old and New Views of Protein Folding. Elsevier Science, NY1999: 85-94Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the 173-ps component observed here is indicative of a relaxation of the CooA polypeptide upon photoexcitation of the heme, which affects the heme absorption spectrum. The rebinding of the ligand to the reduced CooA is very fast (6.5 ps, Figs. 4 a and5 a). This recombination time seems to be comparable with that (7–20 ps) of the cytochrome a center in reduced cytochrome c oxidase (13Stoutland P.O. Lambry J.C. Martin J.-L. Woodruff W.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 6406-6408Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Jongeward K.A. Magde D. Taube D.J. Traylor T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the heme is six-coordinate with the axial ligands being histidine residues (23Martin C.T. Scholes C.P. Chan S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2857-2861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 6.5-ps rebinding indicates that both the proximal and distal ligands of the ferrous heme in the reduced CooA are endogenous ligands of high inertia, not exogenous small molecules or ions, for which recombination times of at least tens of picoseconds are expected. These results are consistent with the proposed coordination structure of the heme in CooA (25Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 3H. Nakajima, Y. Honma, T. Tawara, T. Kato, S. Y. Park, H. Miyatake, Y. Shiro, and S. Aono, submitted for publication. The fastest component of 4 ps in the 440-nm kinetics of CO-bound CooA (Fig. 5(b′)) seems to be associated with the relaxation process of excited heme (Fig. 4 and Table I). There seems to be no great change in the transient spectral shape of CO-bound CooA from 23–630 ps (Fig. 2 c). These findings lead us to conclude that the recombination dynamics of CO in CooA is multiexponential: 78 ps (60%) and 386 ps (30%). About 10% of the dissociated CO remains free at 1.9 ns. This overall rebinding dynamics is largely consistent with that obtained by mid-IR probing of the CO vibrational band (CO-bound CooA (0.5 mm) in D2O)2 or by resonance Raman probing (25Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A small but clear difference between our findings and the results reported by others is that more long lived five-coordinate heme was detected in the present study (25Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).2 We have studied the dependence of the decay dynamics of the five-coordinate heme on solvents (H2O or D2O) and on excitation intensities (0.4–1.0 μJ/pulse). Neither of these two experimental factors had effects strong enough to explain the discrepancy (data not shown). We have also observed that long continuous exposure (e.g. for a few minutes) of the CO-bound CooA sample to the excitation light changes the apparent decay dynamics of the five-coordinate heme (data not shown), and this is probably because of the accumulation of CO-free CooA in the sample cell. The rate and yield of the geminate recombination of the CO in CooA (Table I) are strikingly faster and higher than those of CO in wild-type myoglobin (∼180 ns, 4%, Ref. 26Henry E.R. Sommer J.H.

These parameters of CooA are almost comparable with those of NO in wild-type myoglobin, where the geminate rebinding time constants and amplitudes are 18.9 ps (41%), 126 ps (49%), and an offset (24Kholodeenko Y. Gooding E.A. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Hochstrasser R.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5918-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Regarding the much higher reactivity between NO and heme than that between CO and heme (15Quillin M.L. Li T. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Regan R. Carlson M. Gibson Q.H. Li H. Elber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 416-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), there must be a special mechanism responsible for the fast rebinding of CO in CooA. The geminate recombination between a diatom ligand and heme on a picosecond time scale (10–500 ps) has been best studied in the case of NO rebinding in myoglobin (10Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 15Quillin M.L. Li T. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Regan R. Carlson M. Gibson Q.H. Li H. Elber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 416-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Rapid NO recombination can be achieved by specific mutations in two ways: (i) removing steric restrictions directly adjacent to the iron atom and (ii) inhibiting ligand movement away from the iron atom by placing diffusional barriers. Recent results obtained by resonance Raman spectroscopic study and EXAFS analysis by this group have suggested that there are no distal amino acid residues that interact directly with the CO bound to the heme (8Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).3 Thus, there seem to be no steric restrictions affecting the binding of CO to heme at its binding site. In addition, we propose that the distal side of the heme pocket in CooA provides a much smaller free volume than that of myoglobin, which should cause a decrease of the CO recombination time by three orders of magnitude as compared with that in the case of myoglobin (26Henry E.R. Sommer J.H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The axial ligand trans to His-77 in the reduced CooA is replaced by CO upon CO binding (3Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).3 It is thus probable that the released ligand acts as a diffusional barrier against the dissociated CO. The rebinding dynamics of CO in CooA is clearly nonexponential. There are at least three models by which one can explain the nonexponential recombination kinetics (24Kholodeenko Y. Gooding E.A. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Hochstrasser R.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5918-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Quillin M.L. Li T. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Regan R. Carlson M. Gibson Q.H. Li H. Elber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 416-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). (i) The multiple-site modelinvokes several intermediate sites for CO after the photodissociation, which differ in terms of the potential barriers to recombination with heme. The microscopic origin probably arises from the complicated structure of the protein environment into which CO is ejected by photolysis. (ii) The relaxation modelincorporates a potential barrier that evolves as the heme and protein structure relax following photodissociation, which gives a time-dependent rate constant of CO-rebinding. (iii) In theinhomogeneous model, one assumes a distribution of rebinding rates arising from a static inhomogeneous energy barrier distribution. The NO rebinding rate in the case of myoglobin on the picosecond time scale is primarily determined by the details of the distal heme pocket structure (24Kholodeenko Y. Gooding E.A. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Hochstrasser R.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5918-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Quillin M.L. Li T. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Regan R. Carlson M. Gibson Q.H. Li H. Elber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 416-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The multiple-site model in which there are at least two intermediate states for the dissociated CO seems to be most plausible for the multiexponential rebinding dynamics of CO in CooA. The validity of this model, however, depends on the detailed structure of the distal heme pocket, which is not yet clarified. The applicability of the other two models is also considered as follows. In the case of reduced CooA, the 173-ps process seems to reflect heme protein relaxation. If this relaxation also occurs in the case of CO-bound CooA, it may change the reactivity between heme and CO or the structure of the distal heme pocket. The small change in the transient spectral shape at around 423 nm between 23 ps and 630 ps (Fig. 2 c) may be because of such heme protein relaxation. The 78 and 386 ps components in the recombination kinetics (Fig. 5 band Table I) could then represent recombination during and after the relaxation process with a ∼173-ps time constant, respectively (as in the relaxation model). Rubtsov et al. 2 have also found a similarly slow relaxation process in CO-bound CooA in D2O by probing CO vibrational bands, which also supports this model. It should be noted that the real rebinding dynamics could be caused by a mechanism consistent with the multiple-site and relaxation models combined. Conformers of CooA may show different recombination rates (as in the inhomogeneous model). However, there has been no report on CooA conformers with a population ratio comparable with the amplitude ratio of the 78 and 386 ps components of the CO recombination dynamics (Table I). In summary, this study has shown that CO geminate recombination proceeds with a high yield (90%) on a picosecond time scale. These features may be relevant to the physiological function of CooA which should hold CO tightly while it is activated to regulate transcription of the target DNA. The fast CO rebinding is possibly because of the crowded heme pocket in which the ligand released from the ferrous heme acts as a barrier against CO diffusion.3 The CO rebinding dynamics is multiexponential. This is explained by the presence of multiple intermediate states of the dissociated CO in the distal heme pocket and/or the time dependence of the reactivity of CO with the heme. We greatly appreciate valuable discussions with Drs. I. V. Rubtsov, T. Zhang, S. Takahashi, T. Uchida, and Y. Mizutani. We thank G. I. Rubtsov for writing one of the measurement programs."
https://openalex.org/W2329105219,"CD95-L, TNF-alpha and TRAIL are death-inducing ligands (DILs) which may signal apoptosis via crosslinking of their cognate receptors. The present study shows that treatment of cells with agonistic mAB alpha APO-1 (CD95), recombinant TRAIL or TNF-alpha leads to enhanced mRNA and protein expression of each DIL with concomitant death in target cells. Immunoprecipitation of CD95-L protein from supernatant as well as neutralizing antibodies suggest DIL proteins to be cooperatively acting mediators of these cytotoxic activity. Autoamplification of the death signal was blocked in cells with a defect in apoptosis signaling either due to a dysfunctional FADD molecule or to the failure to activate JNK/SAPKs. Phosphorylation and enhanced binding of cJun and ATF-2 to DIL promoters suggest JNK/SAPKs as activators of these transcription factors following death receptor triggering. In consequence, autocrine production of DILs allows the spread of death signals to sensitive target cells. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4255 - 4262"

However, the nature of the signal that is transmitted from the internal Ca2+ store to the plasma membrane to trigger activation or inactivation of SOCE is not yet known. Three main models have been proposed for the activation of SOCE: (i) activation by second messengers such as cGMP or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or mediators such as the calcium influx factor, which are either generated with, or in response to, the release of Ca2+ from the internal Ca2+ store; (ii) recruitment of channels into the plasma membrane by a process involving vesicle fusion; (iii) a physical interaction between the SOC channel in the plasma membrane and the IP3 receptor (IP3R) in the internal Ca2+ store membrane,i.e. the conformational-coupling hypothesis (1Berridge M.J.

Thus, although it is possible that some Trp proteins might be involved in SOCE, it remains to be established whether the Trps in fact form the SOCE channel. More importantly, studies with Trp proteins have provided data consistent with the conformational coupling hypothesis proposed for the regulation of SOCE.

We proposed that protein-protein interactions coordinated within this domain are involved in the activation or inactivation of SOCE. To determine which region of the Trp1 molecule is involved in the activation of SOCE, we have now expressed truncated forms of Trp1α that lack (i) the C-terminal domain aa 664–793 (ΔTrp1α) or (ii) the C-terminal domain aa 649–793, which includes the highly conserved EWKFAR sequence (Δ2Trp1α), in HSG cells and measured SOCE. The data demonstrate that activation of SOCE was not altered by expression of truncated Trp1. Importantly, SOCE was increased in these cells compared with those expressing full-length Trp1α, and IP3R3 was immunoprecipitated with ΔTrp1α. These data are novel and suggest that the C-terminal domain of Trp1 is involved in the modulation of Ca2+ influx via the SOCE pathway. The 3′-untranslated 1.5-kilobase pair region of htrp1αcDNA used previously (8Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J. O' Connell B.C. Wellner R.B. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

For the truncation, htrp1α was cleaved at the XhoI site (Δtrp1α, Fig.1 A), and religated. The plasmid was used to transform DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), and individual clones were selected. The truncated Trp1α protein (ΔTrp1α) has 9 amino acids (GGALFYSVT) carried over from the vector at the C-terminus, which is not homologous to any reported protein sequence. Another Δtrp1α construct, Δtrp1α v , lacking the vector sequence, was made by inserting a stop codon at the end of the Trp1 sequence by using a PCR-based strategy. In addition, Δ2trp1α, generated by PCR, lacked the C-terminal domain (), including the EWKFAR sequence conserved in all Trp proteins. Δ2Trp1α also had a 12-amino acid sequence (EGGPYSIVSPKC) that was carried over from the vector, which was different from that in ΔTrp1α. All of the constructs were analyzed using restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. HSG cells were cultured and stably transfected as described earlier (8Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P.

The C terminus of hTrp1α was deleted between aa 664 and 793 (see Fig. 1 A). Truncated hTrp1α (ΔTrp1α) and full-length (Trp1α; both with N-terminal HA tag) were stably expressed in HSG cells. Molecular sizes of the inserts (Fig. 1 B) were consistent with the predicted sizes,i.e. Δtrp1α was 387 base pairs less than the full-length gene. These inserts were further characterized by digestion with restriction enzymes and sequencing (data not shown). Fig. 1 C shows Trp1α and ΔTrp1α in crude membranes isolated from stably transfected cells. The lower band (78 kDa) corresponds to the expected molecular weight of ΔTrp1α. The proteins were also detected by the anti-Trp1 antibody. Notably, the relative level of endogenous Trp1 in ΔTrp1α-expressing cells was not higher than in Trp1α-expressing cells (data not shown). Fig. 1 D shows the immunolocalization of ΔTrp1α in HSG cells.

However, in cells stimulated with Tg in a Ca2+-free medium, peak [Ca2+]iincreases were lower, and the resting levels were reached within 4 min (Fig. 1 C). The transient [Ca2+]iincrease is the result of internal Ca2+ release. With external Ca2+, Tg-stimulated initial peak increase was significantly higher (about 1.5-fold) in HSG cells expressing Trp1α. Further, the sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i, measured at 7.5 min after stimulation was also increased in these cells (by about 3-fold). These results are consistent with our previous studies (8Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J. O' Connell B.C. Wellner R.B. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Importantly, cells expressing ΔTrp1α, also demonstrated an initial peak increase in [Ca2+]iin response to Tg stimulation, which was similar to Trp1α cells but significantly higher than in control cells. More interestingly, the sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i (at 7.5 min after stimulation) seen in these cells was about 1.5- and 4-fold higher than in Trp1α-expressing and control cells, respectively. Fig.2 C shows that Tg-stimulated similar [Ca2+]i changes when cells were stimulated in a Ca2+-free medium. Thus, the internal Ca2+ store status and Ca2+ release are similar in control, Trp1α-, and ΔTrp1α-expressing cells and do not account for the increase in Ca2+ influx. Additionally, the resting Ca2+permeabilities of the three sets of cells were similar. These were determined by the re-addition of 1.0 mm Ca2+ to cells in a Ca2+-free medium or by adding 5 or 10 mm Ca2+ to cells in a Ca2+-containing medium (data not shown). To exclude effects due to the vector sequence carried over in ΔTrp1α, another truncated Trp1 (ΔTrp1αv) was expressed in HSG cells, which lacked the vector sequence. Δ2Trp1α was also expressed, which lacked the C-terminal domain aa 649–793. Note that a vector sequence different from that in ΔTrp1α was carried over in Δ2Trp1α. Significantly, SOCE in cells stably transfected with these cDNAs, was similar to that in cells transfected with Δtrp1α (Fig. 2, D andE). In all three cases, SOCE was higher than in control cells and those expressing Trp1α. Thus, the increased SOCE in cells expressing the truncated Trp1(s) is not due to contributions from the vector sequence that was carried over. Interestingly, the EWKFAR sequence does not appear to significantly affect Trp1 function (Fig.2 E). In aggregate, the data from Fig. 2 show that the activation of SOCE by Tg is not affected in HSG cells expressing Trp1α lacking the C-terminal domain. Importantly, these cells have a higher level of SOCE than cells expressing the full-length protein. Carbachol (CCh)-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization was also measured in control and Trp1α and ΔTrp1α cells in Ca2+-containing (Fig. 3,A and B) and Ca2+-free (Fig. 3,C and D) medium. As seen with Tg, sustained [Ca2+]i increase (measured 5 min after stimulation was significantly higher in ΔTrp1α cells than in Trp1α cells and control cells, by 1.8 and 4.4-fold, respectively. However, the initial peak increase was not significantly different in the three sets of cell. Fig. 3 C shows that CCh-stimulated internal Ca2+ release is similar in all the cells. Thus, these data demonstrate that: (i) initial Ca2+ signaling events related to CCh stimulation of HSG cells are not altered by expression of ΔTrp1α or Trp1α; and (ii) the sustained Ca2+ increase seen in cells in Ca2+-containing medium, i.e. Ca2+ influx, is increased in cells expressing the ΔTrp1α proteins. The Ca2+ entry component was also assessed by adding Ca2+ to cells treated with either CCh or Tg in Ca2+-free medium. These results also demonstrated significantly (2-fold) higher [Ca2+]i elevation in ΔTrp1α cells compared with Trp1α cells (data not shown). In aggregate, the data from Figs. 2 and 3 clearly demonstrate that SOCE is increased in HSG cells expressing the Trp1α proteins. More significantly, the data show that higher levels of Ca2+ influx are achieved when the truncated Trp1 proteins are expressed. Our data also rule out the possibility that this increase in SOCE is due to changes in the status of internal Ca2+ stores, an increase in basal Ca2+ influx, or differences in the level of protein expression. To examine whether the C-terminal deletion alters the interaction of Trp1α with IP3R, an anti-HA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate either ΔTrp1α (Fig.4, lane 2) or Trp1α (Fig. 4,lane 1). The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using either anti-IP3R3 or anti-caveolin1. The reactions shown in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate that the relative level of IP3R3 or caveolin1 co-immunoprecipitated with ΔTrp1α is similar to that seen with Trp1α. We have previously reported that (i) expression of hTrp1 in HSG cells induces as increase in SOCE, and (ii) Trp1 in HSG cells interacts with IP3R and caveolin 1 (8Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J. O' Connell B.C. Wellner R.B. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 17Lockwich T.P. Liu X.

The main findings of this study are that deletions in the C-terminal region of Trp1α do not appear to alter its ability to increase SOCE in HSG cells. Further, the ability of Trp1α to interact with IP3R3 and caveolin 1 is also not altered, as shown by the coimmunoprecipitation of these proteins with ΔTrp1α. Importantly, the relative amounts of IP3R3 coimmunoprecipitated with ΔTrp1α or Trp1α were similar. Previous studies have shown that the IP3R N-terminal peptide (aa 1–787) induced spontaneous Trp3 channel activity, although when the IP3R N terminus was linked to the IP3R-transmembrane regions, IP3 was required for channel activation (15Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that Trp3 interactions with the IP3R under “resting” conditions inhibits the channel. When Ca2+ is released from the store in the presence of IP3, there was an alteration in the Trp3-IP3R interaction, resulting in opening of the channel. Another study (16Boulay G. Brown D.M Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a C-terminal domain of Trp3 (aa 777–797) is conserved among various Trps and is the putative site for interaction with IP3R. Expression of the Trp3 domain aa 742–795 induced an inhibition of agonist- and thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ influx in cells expressing Trp3. An N-terminal domain in the IP3R3 (aa 638–926) was identified as the region interacting with the C terminus of hTrp3. Two subdomains within this IP3R region, aa 751–821 and aa 669–698, were identified as having stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively, on Trp3 activity. Also, some homology was identified in these domains among the various IP3Rs. Based on these previous reports and our studies showing that Trp1 expression increases SOCE in HSG cells and Trp1 interacts with IP3R3 (8Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J.

Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 295: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (359) Google Scholar), we predicted the following possible outcomes of ΔTrp1α expression in HSG cells. (i) There would be no effect on SOCE if the Trp1 C terminus interaction with IP3R was required for opening the channel. In this case, ΔTrp1α would not interact with IP3R because of lack of the C terminus. (ii) There would be no effect on SOCE if Trp1 interacted with IP3R via another domain but gating was mediated via the C terminus. In this case, ΔTrp1α and IP3R would interact, but the channel would be silent. (iii) SOCE would be constitutively activated if IP3R interaction with the Trp1 C terminus during gating relieved an inhibition of the gate by the Trp1 C terminus. In this case, removing the inhibitory domain would allow the gate to be opened and ΔTrp1α would function as an open channel. (iv) Inhibition of SOCE would occur if the truncated channel could not be gated but it interacted with IP3R and competed with the endogenous SOCE channel, i.e. a dominant negative effect. All four of these possibilities were excluded by the data discussed above. We have shown that expression of ΔTrp1α induced no change in the ability of either carbachol or thapsigargin to induce SOCE in HSG cells, ruling out predictions i, ii, and iv. Further, no increase in basal Ca2+ permeability was noted in ΔTrp1α-expressing cells, ruling out possibility iii. Importantly, the level of SOCE seen in ΔTrp1α cells was greater than that seen in Trp1α-expressing cells. The data suggest that the difference in the SOC between ΔTrp1α and Trp1α cells is primarily in the sustained level of [Ca2+]i, indicating that there is relatively more Ca2+ entering the ΔTrp1α-expressing cells. The data described above suggest that the C terminus of Trp1 likely acts as an inhibitory domain of the SOCE channel and restricts the amount of Ca2+ entering the cells. This suggestion is based on the observation that there is an increase in SOCE when this domain is removed. As proposed previously, Trp1 might form the SOCE channel either by itself or in association with other subunits. Thus, the marked effects of the C-terminal truncation on SOCE are consistent with this proposal. Interestingly, a similar increase in Ca2+influx activity was reported following deletion of the C terminus of the α-subunit of the cardiac l-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (22Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda AE Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, electrophysiological measurements of single-channel events will be required to understand exactly how C-terminal deletion of Trp1 results in increased SOCE. It is possible that putative phosphorylation sites, or direct binding of lipids or proteins such as calmodulin, might be involved in the Trp1 C terminus-mediated feedback regulation of SOCE. Alternatively, as suggested by previous reports and analogous to Trp3 (15Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 16Boulay G. Brown D.M Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L.

Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), direct interactions of Trp1 with the IP3R could modulate Ca2+ influx. Because IP3R coimmunoprecipitates with ΔTrp1α, which lacks the C-terminal domain, our data suggest that IP3R might bind to other sites on Trp1. However, presently, we cannot rule out the possibility that ΔTrp1α indirectly associates with IP3R via interactions with endogenous Trp or other protein(s), which in turn is associated with IP3R. Despite how ΔTrp1α interacts with IP3R, the present data strongly suggest that the C-terminal region of hTrp1 exerts an inhibitory effect on SOCE, which likely provides a feedback regulation of Ca2+ influx. Further, we report here for the first time that the EWKFAR region in Trp1 does not contribute significantly to its functional effects on SOCE. In conclusion, we have shown that deletion of the C terminus of hTrp1α does not affect its ability to be activated via store-depletion and increase SOCE in HSG cells. Further, the levels of Ca2+ influx associated with the expression of the truncated Trp1 proteins are higher than that associated with the expression of the full-length Trp1. Thus, our data support the suggestion that the C-terminal of hTrp1 is involved in modulating SOCE, likely by exerting a feedback inhibitory effect.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the down-regulation of PKC eta, we expressed the novel PKCs eta and &theta; and various mutant forms in baby hamster kidney cells. Upon overexpression, constitutively active PKC eta, but not wild type or kinase-dead PKC eta, underwent rapid degradation to generate several lower molecular weight polypeptides. When co-expressed with active kinases, kinase-dead PKC eta with a pseudosubstrate site mutation designed to give an active conformation was down-regulated while the wild type PKC eta was not. These results suggest requirements for kinase activity and an active conformation for down-regulation of PKC eta. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitors N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal and lactacystin led to accumulation of PKC eta proteolytic products and potentially ubiquitinated forms. While wild type PKC eta localizes mostly to the detergent-soluble fraction of the cell, a significant portion of full-length constitutively active PKC eta and of kinase-dead, active conformation PKC eta were found in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Several proteolytic fragments of constitutively active PKC eta also were found in the detergent insoluble fraction. These full-length and proteolytic fragments of PKC eta in the detergent-insoluble fraction accumulated further in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. These data suggest that active conformation PKC eta accumulates in the detergent-insoluble compartment, is degraded by proteolysis in the presence of kinase activity, and that the cleavage products undergo further degradation via ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the proteasome.

The hypothesis that amelogenins may interact with the peptides that mimic GlcNAc is tested. GlcNAc-mimicking peptide (SFGSGFGGGY) but not its variants with single amino acid substitution at serine, tyrosine, or phenylalanine residues inhibited hemagglutination of amelogenins and the terminal tyrosine-rich amelogenin polypeptide (TRAP). The binding affinity of SFGSGFGGGY to amelogenins was confirmed by dosimetric binding of amelogenins or TRAP with [3H]peptide, specific binding in varying concentrations of the peptide, Scatchard plot analysis, and competitive inhibition with the unlabeled peptide. The ability of the peptide or GlcNAc to stoichiometrically inhibit TRAP binding of [14C]GlcNAc or [3H]peptide indicated that both the peptide and GlcNAc compete for a single binding site. Using different fragments of amelogenins, we have identified the peptide-binding motif in amelogenin to be the same as the GlcNAc-binding “amelogenin trityrosyl motif peptide.” The GlcNAc-mimicking peptide failed to bind to the amelogenin trityrosyl motif peptide when the tyrosyl residues were substituted with phenylalanine or when the third proline was replaced with threonine, as in some cases of human X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta.

Recent observations have indicated that the GlcNAc-binding motif of several lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and lectins from Datura stramonium, Lycopersicon esculentum,Solanum tuberosum, and Wisteria floribunda also recognize and bind to a specific peptide sequence that mimics GlcNAc found in cytokeratins (8Shikhman A.R.

The present study is based on the hypothesis that comparable interactions between the amelogenins and GlcNAc-mimicking peptides (GMp) may occur during amelogenesis with implications for the understanding of the control of normal enamel development and of the molecular lesions that underlie enamel pathologies such as the condition of amelogenesis imperfecta. In this investigation, we demonstrate that a conserved GMp motif of cytokeratins specifically binds to the amelogenin trityrosyl motif peptide (ATMP). Further, we have directly tested the likely biological relevance of GMp-amelogenin interactions showing that loss of function mutations of the ATMP sequence correlates with loss of interaction with GMp, specifically that the substitution of a proline residue of ATMP (with threonine) as recently observed in a case of human X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) (9Collier P.M.

The purified preparations (rM166) were devoid of or had negligible contamination with vector proteins. Synthetic GlcNAc-mimicking peptide (GM-peptide) with the cytokeratin amino acid sequence SFGSGFGGGY (GMp1) and its variants (GMp2 to -8) with single amino acid substitutions (Table I) were used in this investigation. These peptides are known to bind to anti-GlcNAc monoclonal antibody and also to GlcNAc-specific lectins such as WGA, U. europaeus 11 (UEA-II), and that of D. stramonium and S. tuberosum, expressing functional similarity to the carbohydrate (8Shikhman A.R.

In order to identify the amino acid residues of the peptide sequence critical for binding to the tyrosyl motif of amelogenins, the pentamers (first and second half) of the GMp1 (SFGSGFGGGY), “SFGSG” and “FGGGY,” were synthesized and used to inhibit the amelogenin or TRAP-mediated hemagglutination.Table IInhibition of hemagglutination of rM179 or TRAP by GlcNAc, its oligomers, GMps, and their fragmentsAmino acid sequence of peptidesGMpAtomic mass unitsrM179TRAPMinimal concentration requiredRelative inhibitory potencyMinimal concentration requiredRelative inhibitory potencySFGSGFGGGYGMp1935.15150 nm10500 pm100SFGSGFGGGKGMp2900.1550 μm<10.5 μm0.1SFGSGKGGGYGMp3916.1530 μm<15 μm<0.01SFGSGFGGGDGMp4887.06150 nm100.5 μm0.1DFGSGFGGGYGMp5963.1660 μm<150 μm<0.01SDGSGFGGGYGMp6903.06500 μm<1500 μm<0.01SFGDGFGGGYGMp7963.16>500 μm<1500 μm<0.01SFGSGDGGGYGMp8993.1515 μm<150 μm<0.01FGGGY499.644 mm<1>5 μm<0.01SFGSG453.534 mm<1>0.2 μm0.25SFGSG and FGGGY935.154 mm<1>5 μm<0.01GlcNAc22115 nm10010 nm5Chitobiose445150 nm10NDChitotetraose890150 nm10NDGlcNH22161 mm00.01 mm0BSA60 kDA150 μm0ND0Purified peptides (12.5 μl), serially diluted in TBS, pH 6.3, were added to microtiter wells and mixed with rM179 (6 μg/12.5 μl) or TRAP (3 μg/12.5 μl) previously adjusted to give two-well agglutination.

Open table in a new tab Purified peptides (12.5 μl), serially diluted in TBS, pH 6.3, were added to microtiter wells and mixed with rM179 (6 μg/12.5 μl) or TRAP (3 μg/12.5 μl) previously adjusted to give two-well agglutination. After 60 min of incubation of 25 °C, 25 μl of 1.5% suspension of fresh mouse erythrocytes (TBS, pH 7.2) were added to each microtiter well and mixed.

All of the polypeptides, (GMp variants, the two pentamers, TRAP, and LRAP) used in this investigation were synthesized by the USC microchemical Core Laboratory using an Applied Biosystems model 430A one-column peptide synthesizer with the modified Merrifield procedure (16Merrifield B. Science. 1996; 232: 341-347Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC (C4–214TP54 column or C18–291HS54 column; Vydac/The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) with a gradient of 35–50% B in 60 min (buffer B contained 60% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer A contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1.0 or 0.5 ml/min for small peptides depending on their size (5Ravindranath R.M.H. Moradian-Oldak J. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2464-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The decapeptide SFGSGFGGGY (GMp1) was also labeled with 3H (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to identify the specific binding to amelogenins. SFGSGFGGG[3H]Y was prepared from tritium gas by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The product was purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 300-Å (protein and peptide) (250 × 4.6 mm) column with a gradient of buffer A (0.01 mtrifluoroacetic acid, aqueous) and buffer B (0.01 mtrifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile), 0–100% B over 30 min, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The peptide was supplied in an aqueous solution in a silanized borosilicate multidose vial with additional screw-cap under argon. The peptide was stored in the absence of light and air at 4 °C. GlcNAc, chitobiose, chitotetraose, and WGA (Sigma) were used as positive controls andd-(+)-glucosamine, LRAP, and BSA (Sigma) as negative controls. The HAI assays were performed in 8 × 12-microtiter plates, with U-bottomed wells, after assessing the HA activity of the recombinant amelogenin/TRAP molecules as described earlier (5Ravindranath R.M.H. Moradian-Oldak J. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2464-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Previously, we have screened a variety of mammalian erythrocytes and selected mouse erythrocytes for effective HA by amelogenins including both rM179 and TRAP. We have selected the concentration of rM179/TRAP that gives two-well agglutination. All GMps were diluted (1:10 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 6.3) in Eppendorf tubes and were warmed to 30 °C. To each well, 12.5 μl of peptide solutions were added. The final concentration of peptides/well was adjusted to and ranged from 1 pm to 1 mm at 10-fold dilution. 6 μg/12.5 μl of amelogenin or 3 μg/12.5 μl of TRAP (diluted in trifluoroacetic acid (0.04%) + TBS, pH 6.3), or TBS (pH 6.3) capable of two-well agglutination was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After incubation, 25 μl of a 1.5% suspension of mouse erythrocytes (purchased from Crane Laboratories, Inc., Syracuse, NY) in TBS, pH 7.2, was added to all the wells. The plates were covered with parafilm, subjected to gentle low speed vortex for 10 s, and incubated at 25 °C, and scoring was done after 2 h. The HAI titers were reported as the reciprocal of the lowest concentration of the inhibitors giving complete HAI (button formation) after 2 h. A known amount of [14C]GlcNAc (2 × 104 cpm) in 100 μl of TBS (pH 7.2) was added to polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes containing 100 μl of increasing amounts of TRAP molecules in 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid. The mixture was incubated under constant agitation for 90 min at 25 °C and precipitated with 1 ml of cold ethanol (200 proof; Gold Shield Chemical Co., Hayward, CA) at 4 °C for 20 min. The tubes were then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g in a Beckman Microfuge 12, and the supernatant was removed. The unbound14C-labeled GlcNAc was removed completely by repeated vortex mixing and washing three times with cold ethanol. Washing three times with ethanol did not affect the bound peptides. The final pellets were dissolved in 1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was measured 15 min after adding 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Bio-safe 11, Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) in a β-counter (Beckman, LS-1801). WGA was used as a positive control and BSA as a negative control. For the competitive binding inhibition assay, 100 μl of unlabeled GMps or GlcNAc (TBS, pH 7.2) with increasing concentrations were prepared in duplicate in microcentrifuge tubes. To each concentration of the GMp or GlcNAc, 100 μl of [14C]GlcNAc (2 × 104 cpm in TBS, pH 7.2) was added and mixed. 100 μl of rM179 (7.5 nmol) or TRAP (20 nmol) in 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid were added to the mixture and incubated for 90 min at 25 °C on a rotator. After incubation, the proteins were precipitated with 1 ml of cold ethanol at 4 °C for 20 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The unbound radioactive GlcNAc was removed completely by repeated vortex mixing and washing, three times with ethanol. The final pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of 1 n NaOH, and the bound radioactivity was measured with 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Bio-safe 11) in a β-counter as mentioned earlier (5Ravindranath R.M.H. Moradian-Oldak J. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2464-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Glucosamine was used as a negative control. The values were expressed as percentage of bound [14C]GlcNAc to rM179 or TRAP. 100 μl of [3H]GMp1 (30 × 104 dpm in TBS, pH 7.2) was added to polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes containing increasing amounts of rM179 or TRAP molecules in 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid, and the mixture was gently shaken every 20 min for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were pelleted with 1 ml of cold ethanol at 4 °C for 20 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 ×g, and the supernatant was removed. The unbound radioactive peptides were removed completely by repeated vortex mixing and washing four times with ethanol, which did not affect the bound peptides. The final pellets were dissolved in 1 n NaOH, and the bound radioactivity was measured 15 min after adding 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a β-counter. BSA and WGA were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Purified recombinant murine amelogenins (rM179 and rM166) were resolved via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 15% resolving and 3.5% stacking gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp.; Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane) at 100 mA for 1 h using a semidry transblot apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco) (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Garden J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Protein transfer was assessed by staining the PVDF strips with 0.1% Fast Green (Sigma) in 40% acetic acid and 10% methanol, and the strips were compared with Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands (19Ravindranath R.M.H. Graves M.C. Virology. 1992; 188: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Replicas were treated with [3H]GMp1 (7 × 107 dpm/ml) resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.0) for 18 h at 25 °C, after blocking the membrane with phosphate-buffered saline, 1% HSA for 1 h at 37 °C. The membranes were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% HSA (20Ravindranath R.M.H. Graves M.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5430-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing and drying, the membranes were exposed to hyperfilm-3H (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 8 days at 25 °C, and the films were developed manually. The total binding of [3H]GMp1 to TRAP was determined in duplicates using increasing concentrations of [3H] GMp1 (40–700 pmol) to 20 nmol of TRAP molecules. The nonspecific binding of [3H]GMp1 was determined in duplicate in the presence of 40 nmol of unlabeled GMp1, and it was subtracted from the total binding to obtain the specific binding. A Scatchard plot analysis of this specific binding was carried out. 100 μl of unlabeled GMp1 or GlcNAc in TBS (pH 7.2) with increasing concentrations were prepared in duplicates in microcentrifuge tubes. To each concentration of unlabeled peptide or GlcNAc, 100 μl of [3H]GMp1 (30 × 104 dpm in TBS, pH 7.2) was added and mixed. TRAP (25 nmol/100 μl in 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid) was added to the mixture and gently shaken every 20 min for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were precipitated with 1 ml of cold ethanol and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The unbound [3H]GMp1 was removed completely by repeated vortex mixing and washing four times with ethanol, and the bound radioactivity was measured with 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a β-counter as mentioned earlier (5Ravindranath R.M.H. Moradian-Oldak J. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2464-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The values were expressed as percentage of bound [3H]GMp1 to TRAP. The binding efficiency of [3H]GMp1 (or [14C]GlcNAc) to different amelogenins was measured by solid matrix assay, using 96-Remova-well strips in a microtiter plate (Costar Brand, VWR Scientific Products). Antigen coating was done by adding a solution of 100 μl (5 nmol/well) of polypeptides (rM179, rM166, TRAP, LRAP, ACP, ATMP, T-ATMP, F-ATMP, porcine amelogenins, 20 and 25 kDa) in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) to microtiter wells in triplicate and kept at 25 °C overnight. Most amelogenin-derived polypeptides are soluble in the physiological range of pH (21Tan J. Leung W. Moradian-Oldak J. Zeichner-David M. Fincham A.G. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 1388-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). WGA and BSA were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Wells were blocked with 0.1% HSA in TBS, pH 7.2 for 2 h at 37 °C. 100 μl of [3H]GMp1 (30 × 104 dpm) in TBS (pH 7.2) were added to wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking once every 20 min. After incubation, the unbound peptide was removed and washed three times with TBS (pH 7.2). The wells were transferred to scintillation vials. The bound radioactive peptide was released into the 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Safety-Solve, Research Products International Corp.) by continuous shaking and vortexing for 15 min and counted for bound radioactivity in a β-counter. The above assay was also used to test inhibition of [14C]GlcNAc binding to TRAP by GMps. Descriptive statistics were calculated throughout. In addition, Mann-Whitney sample test and regression analyses (linear and polynomial curve fit,r 2, and test of significance of slope) were carried out using Origins software (Microcal Software Inc.). Two-tailedp values were obtained to assess the level of significance. GMp with the amino acid sequence SFGSGFGGGY (GMp1) and its variants (GMp-2 to -8) with single amino acid substitution (marked in boldface type in TableI) were purified by reverse phase HPLC, and a typical profile of GMp1 is illustrated in Fig. 2. The peptide binding specificity of purified rM179/TRAP molecules was probed by peptide inhibition of HA. GlcNAc-mediated HAI was used as a positive control. Table I shows the nature of GMps that inhibited HA of amelogenin and of TRAP. Of the peptides tested, only GMp1 and GMp4 inhibited the HA of rM179. None of the other GMps inhibited the HA of amelogenins even at 1000-fold higher concentrations. The substitution of the serine or phenylalanine residues of GMp1 significantly affected the binding. Both GMp1 and GMp4 inhibited the HA at 150 nm concentration, which is the same as with the dimer and tetramer of GlcNAc. The binding of GlcNAc to rM179 is 10-fold less than that of GMp1, suggesting that GlcNAc is the preferred ligand of rM179 than GMp1. In contrast, GMp1 is the most potent inhibitory peptide of TRAP-HA. The binding of GMp1 to the TRAP molecule is 20-fold stronger than that of GlcNAc, suggesting that GMp1 is the preferred ligand of TRAP. TRAP-HAI of GMp1 occurred at a concentration as low as 500 pm, whereas 500 nm of GMp4 is required to cause such inhibition. The inhibitory potency of GMp1 is 1000-fold greater than that of GMp4 or GMp2. The substitution of serine (as in GMp5 and GMp7) or phenylalanine residues (as in GMp3, GMp6, or GMp8) or changing the terminal tyrosine (as in GMp2 and GMp4) least affected HAI. The binding affinity for GlcNAc versus GMp1 appears to change with processing of the larger amelogenins (rM179) to TRAP. To identify and minimize the amino acid sequence responsible for binding to the tyrosyl TRAP motif of amelogenins, the pentamers were used to inhibit the amelogenin- or TRAP-mediated HA. The pentamer, FGGGY, did not affect amelogenin- or TRAP-mediated HA, whereas SFGSG, representing the amino-terminal half of the GMp1 inhibited the TRAP-mediated HA partially compared with the full-length GMp1 (see Table I), suggesting that SFGSG includes most of the functional amino acid sequence of GMp1 recognized by TRAP. The loss of binding affinity of the peptide when GMp1 is spliced into two halves indicates that the binding site of amelogenin or TRAP recognizes more than 5 amino acid residues of GMp1. In order to select the maximum concentration of rM179 or TRAP required for GMp inhibition of [14C]GlcNAc binding, the dosimetry of [14C]GlcNAc interaction with rM179/TRAP was determined. The binding of [14C]GlcNAc increases with the concentration of rM179 (5Ravindranath R.M.H. Moradian-Oldak J. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2464-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and TRAP (Fig. 3). Based on the results, we selected 7.5 nmol of rM179 and 20 nmol of TRAP for inhibition of binding of [14C]GlcNAc by GMps. The results of GMps inhibition of the interaction of [14C]GlcNAc to rM179 and TRAP are presented in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. GMp1 and GMp4 dosimetrically inhibited the binding of [14C]GlcNAc to rM179. None of the other GMps inhibited the interaction of rM179 with [14C]GlcNAc. 50% inhibition of GMp1 and GMp4 occurred at 150 μm and 130 μm, whereas inhibition by cold GlcNAc required a higher concentration (250 μm) (Fig. 4 A). The relative inhibitory potencies of GMp1 and GMp4 are about 2-fold more efficient than cold GlcNAc, a finding different from that for HAI in which GlcNAc showed a 10-fold increase in inhibitory potency. However, both GMp1 and GMp4 were preferred ligands of rM179 in both assays. Furthermore, GMp1 strongly and dosimetrically inhibited the binding of [14C]GlcNAc to TRAP. The relative inhibitory potency of GMp1 is 2.5-fold more efficient than cold GlcNAc (Fig. 4 B), a finding in conformity with HAI observations in which GMp1 is more potent than GlcNAc in inhibiting TRAP-mediated HA. None of the other peptides inhibited the interaction of TRAP with [14C]GlcNAc in the solid matrix assay. Therefore, GMp1 is the more preferred peptide ligand inhibiting the lectin-like activity of rM179 and the TRAP molecule. The binding of [3H]GMp1 increased as the concentration of rM179/TRAP increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A andB) as evidenced by a consistent polynomial fit with significant slope (p < 0.001) andr 2 (0.97 for rM179 and 0.93 for TRAP). WGA used as the positive control also showed a similar slope (Fig. 5 A, table inset). LRAP, a negative control, showed minimal and no dose-dependent binding to [3H]GMp1 and served as a background control. Autoradiograms further revealed the binding of [3H]GMp1 to amelogenins. Since the binding of [3H]GMp1 to TRAP reached saturation in addition to the greater potency of inhibition than GlcNAc in HA and [14C] GlcNAc binding of TRAP, we selected TRAP to further investigate the specific binding of GMp1 (Fig. 5 B). Fig. 6 shows the specific binding of [3H]GMp1 to TRAP as a function of increasing concentration of GMp1. The nonspecific binding was measured with unlabeled GMp1 and subtracted to obtain specific GMp1 binding. A Scatchard plot of the binding of [3H]GMp1 to TRAP indicates that the peptide-binding site is homogenous with respect to the association constant. Unlabeled GMp1 inhibited the binding of [3H]GMp1 to TRAP stoichiometrically. The inhibition slope for GMp1 (p < 0.001) and GlcNAc (p < 0.0001) and r 2 for GMp1 (−0.98) and GlcNAc (−0.99) establish significant stoichiometry (Fig. 7). Comparison of the slope or the 50% inhibition showed that GMp1 is 4-fold more potent than cold GlcNAc in binding to TRAP, a finding in conformity with GMp1 inhibition of HA (Table I) and binding of [14C]GlcNAc to TRAP (Fig. 4 B). The specific binding of GMp1 to TRAP is further confirmed in a solid matrix assay in which [3H]GMp1 bound to rM179 and rM166 (lacking the 13-residue ACP) but failed to bind to ACPper se, suggesting that the ACP is not required for binding. 33 amino acids of the 45 amino acid residues of the N-terminal TRAP region are also shared by LRAP (see Fig. 1). In addition, LRAP possesses 26 amino acid residues of"

Most germline p53 mutations observed to date cause amino acid substitutions in the protein's central sequence-specific DNA binding domain. Outside this conserved core region, however, we found novel alterations in sequences that regulate precursor mRNA splicing in three Li-Fraumeni syndrome families. Two splice site mutations affected the consensus sequence at the splice donor sites of introns 1 and 9, and produced unstable variant transcripts in normal cells. A third mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron 9 generated splicing at a cryptic acceptor site in intron 9. These splice site alterations emphasize the need to examine both noncoding and untranslated regions of the p53 gene for germline mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome families.

Our previous results demonstrated that LMW-PTP is able to bind and dephosphorylate activated PDGF receptor, thus inhibiting cell proliferation. Recently we have shown that LMW-PTP is specifically phosphorylated by c-Src in a cytoskeleton-associated fraction in response to PDGF, and this phosphorylation increases LMW-PTP activity about 20-fold. LMW-PTP strongly influences cell adhesion, spreading, and chemotaxis induced by PDGF stimulation, by regulating the phosphorylation level of p190Rho-GAP, a protein that is able to regulate Rho activity and hence cytoskeleton rearrangement. In the present study we investigate the physiological role of the two LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation sites, using LMW-PTP mutants on tyrosine 131 or 132. We demonstrate that each tyrosine residue is involved in specific LMW-PTP functions. Both of them are phosphorylated during PDGF signaling. Phosphorylation on tyrosine 131 influences mitogenesis, dephosphorylating activated PDGF-R and cytoskeleton rearrangement, acting on p190RhoGAP. Phosphorylation on tyrosine 132 leads to an increase in the strength of cell substrate adhesion, down-regulating matrix metalloproteases expression, through the inhibition of Grb2/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation on both Tyr131 or Tyr132 cooperate to determine a faster and stronger adhesion to extracellular matrix, although these two events may diverge in timing and relative amount.

Hunter T. Lindberg R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that the contribution of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)1 to the control of cell phosphorylation state is as relevant as that of phosphotyrosine protein kinases. The PTPs superfamily is composed of over 70 enzymes that, despite very limited sequence similarity, share a common active site motif CX 5R and an identical catalytic mechanism. On the basis of their function, structure, and sequence, PTPs can be classified in four main families: 1) tyrosine specific phosphatases, 2) VH1-like dual specificity PTPs, 3) the cdc25, and 4) the low molecular weight phosphatase (2Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is an 18-kDa enzyme that is expressed in many mammalian tissues (3Ramponi G. Adv. Prot. Phosphatases. 1994; 8: 1-25Google Scholar). Our previous studies on the molecular biology of LMW-PTP in NIH-3T3 cells evidenced a well defined role of this enzyme in PDGF-induced mitogenesis. The most relevant phenotypic effect of LMW-PTP overexpression was the strong reduction of cell growth rate in response to PDGF stimulation. We have previously shown that activated PDGF-R is a LMW-PTP substrate (4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and that LMW-PTP is involved in the control of specific pathways triggered by PDGF-R activation. In particular, LMW-PTP is able to modulate both myc expression, interfering with Src pathway, and fos expression through a MAPK-independent pathway mediated by the STAT proteins (5Chiarugi P.

More recently, we have found that in NIH-3T3 cells LMW-PTP is constitutively localized in both cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton-associated fractions. These two LMW-PTP pools are differentially regulated because only the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP fraction is specifically phosphorylated by c-Src after PDGF stimulation (6Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a consequence of its phosphorylation, LMW-PTP shows an average 20-fold increase in itsin vitro catalytic activity (7Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P.

Furthermore, we have shown that the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP influences cell adhesion, migration, and spreading and that these effects are dependent on LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation (10Chiarugi P.

We have shown that cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP influences the phosphorylation state of p190Rho-GAP, a protein that is able to regulate Rho activity and, hence, cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to PDGF stimulation. In addition, we have demonstrated that,in vivo, LMW-PTP is regulated by c-Src phosphorylation, because phosphorylated LMW-PTP presents an increased activity on a physiologic substrate such as p190Rho-GAP (10Chiarugi P.

We suggest that LMW-PTP is able to perform multiple roles in PDGF-induced mitogenesis. In fact, cytosolic LMW-PTP binds and dephosphorylates PDGF-R (4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F.

We have previously demonstrated that, in vitro, the tyrosine phosphorylation of LMW-PTP by c-Src is directed to both tyrosine 131 and 132, although they appear to have different effects: tyrosine 131 phosphorylation determines a strong increase in LMW-PTP specific activity, whereas phosphorylation of tyrosine 132 leads to in vitro Grb2 binding (7Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The relative in vivocontribution of each tyrosine phosphorylation remained to be determined. In this paper we analyze the role of Tyr131 and Tyr132 LMW-PTP mutants in cell growth, migration, and adhesion to determine the specific function of the two phosphorylation sites. Our findings suggest that, in vivo, both LMW-PTP tyrosines are efficiently phosphorylated during PDGF signaling, leading to different effects. Phosphorylation on Tyr131, leads to the regulation of Rho-mediated cell adhesion rate through the dephosphorylation of p190Rho-GAP. On the other side, the phosphorylation on Tyr132 leads to an increase in the strength of cell adhesion through the down-regulation of MMPs expression, probably through the inhibition of the Grb2/MAPK pathway. Unless specified all reagents were obtained from Sigma. NIH-3T3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection; human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB was from Peprotech; the enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; all antibodies were from Santa Cruz, except those against phosphoMAPKs that were from New England Biolabs. BCA protein assay reagent is from Pierce, and PP1 Src family kinase inhibitor was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Unique Restriction Elimination Site kit of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The 26-base-long target mutagenesis primer contains an ACA codon (alanine) substituting the original TAT codon (tyrosine) for each tyrosine. The mutated LMW-PTP coding sequence was completely sequenced by the Sanger method and subcloned in theHindIII and ApaI restriction sites of pRcCMV eukaryotic expression vector, harboring the neomycin resistance gene. NIH-3T3 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. 10 μg of pRcCMV-wtLMW-PTP or pRcCMV-Y131A-LMW-PTP or pRcCMV-Y132A-LMW-PTP or pRcCMV-Y131A/Y132A-LMW-PTP were transfected in NIH-3T3 cells using the calcium phosphate method. Stable transfected clonal cell lines were isolated by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Control cell lines were obtained by transfecting 2 μg of pRcCMVneo alone. The clonal lines were screened for expression of the transfected genes by 1) Northern blot analysis and 2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal anti-LMW-PTP rabbit antibodies, which do not cross-react with murine endogenous LMW-PTP. 2 × 104 NIH-3T3 cells were seeded in 24-multiwell plates and serum starved for 24 h before receiving 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 24 and 48 h. Fresh PDGF was added daily. Cellular growth was stopped by removing the medium and by the addition of a 0.5% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol. After 5 min of staining the fixed cells were washed with PBS and solubilized with 200 μl/well of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.2. The absorbance at 595 nm was evaluated using a microplate reader. 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were serum starved for 24 h before receiving 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Cells were then lysed for 20 min on ice in 500 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with 0.1 μg of the specific antibodies. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Sartorius). Immunoblots were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature, probed first with specific antibodies and then with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, washed, and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Cell lysate fractions were obtained as already described (6Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, PDGF-stimulated NIH-3T3 were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 20000 × g. Pellets were washed twice with 1 ml RIPA and then resuspended in complete RIPA buffer, which is RIPA buffer plus 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecilsulphate, by shaking for 1 h at room temperature and newly clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. RIPA or complete RIPA buffer fractions were then used for immunoprecipitation analysis. Cell adhesion was assessed as described elsewhere (11Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 104 cells are seeded for the indicated time in a 96-well dish precoated for 2 h with 10 μg/ml of human fibronectin and washed twice with PBS. Cell adhesion was stopped by removing the medium and by the addition of a 0.5% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol. After 5 min of staining the fixed cells were washed with PBS and solubilized with 200 μl/well of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.2. The absorbance at 595 nm was evaluated using a microplate reader. The adhesion assay was performed in complete medium. All cell adhesion assays were performed in triplicate. Cell migration was assessed as described elsewhere with minor modifications (5Chiarugi P.

Migration of NIH-3T3 cells was assayed with the Transwell system of Costar, equipped with 8-μm pore polyvinylpirrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (diameter, 13 mm) precoated with human type I collagen (20 μg/ml) and placed between the chemoattractant (lower chamber) and the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml of PDGF-BB. Serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cultured cells were suspended by trypsinization, and 1.5 × 105 cells in 200 μl were added to the top wells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h. After incubation, the cells attached to the upper side but not migrated through the filter were mechanically removed using cotton swabs. The filters were fixed in 96% methanol and stained with Diff Quick staining solutions. Chemotaxis was evaluated by counting the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the polycarbonate filters. For each filter the number of cells in six randomly chosen fields was determined, and the counts were averaged (mean ± S.D.). The strength of cell adhesion was measured as reported elsewhere (12Inagaki K. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horikawa T. Fukunaga K. Tsuda M. Ichihashi M. Kasuga M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of cells treated or not with 0.5 μm of PP1 Src family kinase inhibitor were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in calcium and magnesium free PBS containing 0.05% trypsin. 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The dishes were washed twice with PBS, and the attached cells were evaluated by crystal violet staining. After 5 min of staining the fixed cells were washed with PBS and solubilized with 200 μl/well of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.2. The absorbance at 595 nm was evaluated using a microplate reader. The value in ordinate (see Fig. 5) is the ratio between the cells attached after and before the treatment. Metalloprotease zymography was assessed as described elsewhere with minor modifications (13Mott J.D. Thomas C.L. Rosenbach M.T. Takahara K. Greenspan D. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1384-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium from confluent cell monolayers treated or not with 0.5 μm of PP1 Src family kinase inhibitor was collected, and 20 μl were added to sample buffer (SDS 0.4%, 2% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.001% bromphenol blue). The sample were run on a 8% SDS gel containing 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis the gel was washed twice with 2.5% Triton X-100 and once with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. The gel was incubated overnight at 37 °C with freshly added reaction buffer and stained with Laemli Comassie blue solution. 3 × 104 cells were plated on a 6-well dish in complete medium. After 48 h the cells were washed twice in PBS, lysed in RIPA buffer, and centrifuged to remove the insoluble debris. The total protein content was evaluated by the BCA protein assay and 20 μg of lysates were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved protein were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed overnight with anti-phospho-p44/42MAPK monoclonal antibodies. The PTP activity was measured as previously reported (7Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1,5 × 106 cells were collected in 300 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and sonicated for 10 s. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and 50 μl were used in the PTP activity assay with 50 μl of 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate at 37 °C for 30 min. The production of p-nitrophenol was measured colorimetrically at 410 nm. The results were normalized on the basis of total protein content. To study the role of LMW-PTP phosphorylation on Tyr131 and Tyr132, we generated by site specific mutagenesis two LMW-PTP tyrosine to alanine single mutants (Y131A and Y132A). We overexpressed these LMW-PTP mutants in NIH-3T3 cells, selecting two different clones for each mutant for further experiments (Y131A, clones P and M; Y132A, clones X and XII). Because we have previously demonstrated that LMW-PTP exists in cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton associated distinct pools, we analyzed the subcellular distribution and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant forms of LMW-PTP. As far as the double mutant Y131A/Y132A-LMW-PTP is concerned, we have already reported that it is targeted to cytoskeleton but not tyrosine phosphorylated upon PDGF treatment (10Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Giannoni E. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4640-4646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The results show that both mutants are efficiently targeted to cytoskeleton (Fig.1 A) and differently phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 1 B). This finding indicates that, in vivo, both tyrosine 131 and 132 are efficiently phosphorylated in NIH-3T3 cells after PDGF stimulation. As we reported previously, the activity on p-nitrophenylphosphate of Y131A and Y132A LMW-PTP mutants was 40 and 70%, respectively, with respect to wtLMW-PTP. The LMW-PTP, which is a C12A mutant, is totally inactive (7Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because the tyrosine phosphorylation level of cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP seems to be dependent on LMW-PTP catalytic activity, we suggest that LMW-PTP could undergo autodephosphorylation in vivo. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that the LMW-PTP mutants are inactive in vivo, we quantitated their catalytic activity in NIH-3T3 cells. The results are very similar to those obtained in vitro; taken as 100% the catalytic activity of the wtLMW-PTP, we obtained about 40 and 90% for Y131A-LMW-PTP and Y132A-LMW-PTP, respectively. These findings confirm that in vivo both LMW-PTP single tyrosine mutants are functional phosphatases, at least on synthetic substrates such as p-nitrophenylphosphate. We analyzed the serum-induced cell growth rate of Y131A-LMW-PTP and Y132A-LMW-PTP transfected cells in comparison with wtLMW-PTP and mock transfected cells (Fig.2 A). The results reveal that the Y132A-LMW-PTP, which maintains the possibility of phosphorylation on tyrosine 131, induces a decrease in cell growth rate, similar to the wtLMW-PTP, with respect to mock transfected cells. On the contrary, the Y131A-LMW-PTP, which maintains only the tyrosine in position 132, determines a slight increase in the cell growth rate with respect to mock transfected cells. Phosphorylation on Tyr131 but not on Tyr132 gives rise to a behavior similar to the wtLMW-PTP, suggesting that only the phosphorylation of LMW-PTP in position 131 mediates the inhibitory effect of this enzyme on serum-induced mitosis. We analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation level of PDGF-R in Y131A-NIH-3T3 and Y132A-NIH-3T3 cells in comparison with wtLMW-PTP and mock transfected cells. The result, shown in Fig. 2 B, demonstrates that although the Y132A mutant behaves as wtLMW-PTP, dephosphorylating the PDGF-R even more efficiently than the wild type enzyme, the Y131A mutant appears to be inefficient in this action. To determine whether the mutation of tyrosine 132 impairs the PDGF-R binding of LMW-PTP or only its ability to dephosphorylate the receptor, we coimmunoprecipitated LMW-PTP and the PDGF-R in all cell lines. We were not able to detect any interaction between the activated PDGF-R and Y131A-LMW-PTP (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that both tyrosine 131 and 132 are phosphorylated in vivo upon PDGF administration, but these events lead to different LMW-PTP effects on mitosis regulation and PDGF receptor activation. wtLMW-PTP overexpression induces a marked increase in integrin-mediated cell adhesion rate and PDGF-induced migration (10Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Giannoni E. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4640-4646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr131 or Tyr132 in this phenomenon, we evaluated cell adhesion on fibronectin of cells expressing wtLMW-PTP or the two single tyrosine mutants in comparison with mock transfected cells. Fig. 3 A shows that Y131A mutant behaves similarly to mock transfected cells. On the contrary, the Y132A mutant leads to a marked potentiation of fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion rate. This effect is even stronger than in wtLMW-PTP. In addition we evaluated the chemotaxis induced by PDGF-BB in all cell lines. Fig. 3 B shows that again the phosphorylation in Tyr131 mainly mediates the increase of cell chemotaxis toward PDGF induced by LMW-PTP overexpression. LMW-PTP is involved in Rho-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement such as chemotaxis and cell adhesion, as it specifically dephosphorylates the GTPase activating protein of Rho, called p190Rho-GAP, thus leading to an up-regulation of Rho activity (14Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 335-368Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Roof R.W. Haskell M.D. Dukes B.D. Sherman N. Kinter M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7052-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To analyze the activity of Y131A and Y132A LMW-PTP mutants on p190Rho-GAP, we tested the tyrosine phosphorylation level of p190Rho-GAP in all cell lines upon PDGF treatment. Fig. 4 shows that the Y132A-LMW-PTP mutant is able to dephosphorylate p190Rho-GAP even better than wtLMW-PTP, but the Y131A-LMW-PTP mutant is almost ineffective on this substrate. These findings indicate that only the phosphorylation of tyrosine 131 is essential for the function of LMW-PTP in Rho-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement leading to cell migration toward PDGF-BB and adhesion to extracellular matrix, through the regulation of p190Rho-GAP tyrosine phosphorylation. The transfection of Y131A-LMW-PTP mutant leads to the expression of a protein that is efficiently targeted to the cytoskeleton architecture (Fig. 1 A) and phosphorylated upon PDGF treatment (Fig. 1 B). Nevertheless, in Y131A-NIH-3T3 cells we failed to observe any variations in cell growth rate, PDGF-induced migration, and cell adhesion, with respect to mock transfected cells. We routinely observed, in all clones expressing Y131A-LMW-PTP mutant a resistance to trypsin detachment during cell culturing. Hence, we analyzed the strength of cell substratum adhesion by a detachment assay (12Inagaki K. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horikawa T. Fukunaga K. Tsuda M. Ichihashi M. Kasuga M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in exponentially growing cells treated or not with the PP1 Src family kinase inhibitor (16Liu Y. Bishop A. Witucki L. Kraybill B. Shimizu E. Tsien J. Ubersax J. Bletrow J. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 9: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (Fig.5). The overexpression of wtLMW-PTP leads to a slight decrease of the strength of cell substratum adhesion in 10% FCS growing cells (Fig. 5), as indicated by the decrease in the resistance to detachment reported in the ordinate of the plot. Although the Y132A-NIH-3T3 cells showed a behavior similar to wtLMW-PTP-NIH-3T3 cells, the Y131A-NIH-3T3 cells exhibited a dramatic increase in the resistance to detachment (Fig. 5). The NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the LMW-PTP Y131A/Y132A double mutant, that is not phosphorylated upon PDGF treatment (10Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Giannoni E. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4640-4646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), show a phenotype similar to mock-transfected cells. Hence, this increase in the resistance to cell detachment is likely due to the phosphorylation of LMW-PTP on tyrosine 132. In fact, the increased adhesion strength of Y131A-NIH-3T3 is abolished in serum-starved cells (data not shown), where the LMW-PTP is not phosphorylated by c-Src (6Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and in PP1 treated cells (Fig. 5), suggesting a role for LMW-PTP phosphorylation on tyrosine 132 in the modulation of of cell adhesion strength. As reported in literature, the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix is controlled by an equilibrium between integrin receptors interaction with ECM components and the activity of membrane protease acting on them. Matrix metalloprotease expression increases when remodelling of ECM is required (17Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 18Johnsen M.

Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that there is a modulation of the expression of MMPs in response to many growth factors such as PDGF or epidermal growth factor (21Singer C.F. Marbaix E. Lemoine P.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). To assess whether the increased resistance to cell detachment of Y131A-NIH-3T3 cells could be due to variations in MMPs production in response to growth factors, we analyzed by gelatin zymography the MMPs activity of Y131A, Y132A, and Y131A/Y132A-NIH-3T3 cells in comparison with mock transfected and wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells. We observed in growing cells (Fig. 6 A) a general down-regulation of MMPs activity in Y131A-NIH-3T3 cells with respect to mock transfected cells, whereas both Y132A-NIH-3T3 cells and wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells showed an increased MMPs production. In the same condition MMPs activity of Y131A/Y132A-NIH-3T3 cells is similar to mock transfected cells (Fig. 6 A). In both serum-starved cells (data not shown) and PP1-treated cells, where LMW-PTP is not phosphorylated (6Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1979638258,"Expression of the neurotrophin receptor trkB is regulated by thyroid hormone (T3) during development of the rat brain. trkB mRNA levels, coding for the full-length and the truncated isoforms, are increased in the cerebral cortex of neonatal experimental hypothyroid animals. Run-on transcription assays with nuclei from postnatal day 15, hypothyroid, and control cerebral cortices demonstrated that an increase in the transcription rate of the trkB gene accounts for the observed effect. Transient transfection experiments using a reporter plasmid containing a 7-kilobase pair DNA fragment upstream of the mouse trkB gene showed that unliganded thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) increases promoter activity, whereas addition of T3 reverses that activity below basal levels. Deletion analysis shows that the T3-dependent repression requires binding of the T3R to a specific region located downstream of the transcription start site. This region, at nucleotide position -465/-432, contains an array of thyroid hormone response half-sites that bind preferentially T3R as heterodimers with retinoid X receptor and whose deletion causes loss of the T3-dependent repression. These half-sites are able to confer negative regulation by T3 to a heterologous promoter, thus indicating the functionality of these sequences. These results demonstrate that, in the developing rat brain, T3 down-regulates the expression of the trkB gene through the active repression of a novel negative response element located downstream of its transcription initiation site."

The inhibitory function of an Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-Delta(222-437), which can bind p53 but is defective in targeting p53 for degradation was also studied. We have demonstrated that targeting p53 for degradation is the most effective way for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53. However, we have also shown that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation function of p53 without targeting it for degradation, although Mdm2 releases the transrepression ability of p53 mainly by targeting it for degradation. The ability of Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 was linked to its ability to inhibit the transrepression but not the transactivation function of p53. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the transrepression function of p53 was specific to p53-induced apoptosis and was not simply a result of cell death."

We investigated the mechanism of action of the toxin on Ca2+-regulated exocytosis in single bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, monitoring simultaneously fura-2 fluorescence measurements and electrochemical recordings using a carbon fiber microelectrode. Bc2 induced quantal release of catecholamines in a calcium-dependent manner. This release was associated with a sustained rise in cytosolic Ca2+ and displayed two different patterns of response: a continuous discharge of prolonged duration that changed to a transient burst as the toxin concentration (or incubation time) increased. Continuous secretion was dependent on the activity of native voltage-dependent Ca2+channels and showed a pattern similar to that of α-latrotoxin; however, its kinetics adjusted better to that of continuous cell depolarization with high K+ concentration. In contrast, transient secretion was independent of Ca2+ entry through native voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and showed inhibition of late vesicle fusion that was accompanied by “freezing” of F-actin disassembly.

Equinatoxins and sticholysins, for instance, are well studied sea anemone cytolysins and they form cation-selective channels in lipid bilayers and cells (6Tejuca M. Dalla-Serra M. Ferreras M.

The pore they form consists of 3 or 4 monomers inserted into the lipid membrane with an estimated diameter of approximately 1 nm, that allows the leakage of 400–900 Da molecules (6Tejuca M.

The effects of these cytolysins can be strongly inhibited by sphingomyelin, a membrane phospholipid that likely serves to anchor the toxin within the plasma membrane (5Macek P. Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Menestrina G. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). They are also able to increase the [Ca2+]c (10Zorec R. Tester M. Macek P. Mason W.T. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 118: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Frangez R. Meunier F. Molgo J. Suput D.

Toxicon. 2000; 38: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The increase of [Ca2+]c is probably a result of Ca2+ entry through the membrane pores formed by cytolysins. More recently, we have seen that Bc2 (20 kDa), the main cytolysin present in the brazilian sea anemone Bunodosoma caissarum, induces extensive glutamate release from rat cortical synaptosomes (20Migues P.V. Leal R.B. Mantovani M. Nicolau M. Gabilan N.H. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This effect was independent of extracellular Ca2+ and Na+ and was inhibited by the lipid sphingomyelin, a classical inhibitor of the sea anemone cytolysins activity. In addition, removal of Bc2 allowed the synaptosomes to restore their responsiveness to a subsequent KCl stimulation, indicating that this toxin does not cause unspecific disruption of cell membranes. Some of these effects resemble those observed with α-latrotoxin (LTx), a large neuroactive protein that produces massive release of a wide variety of neurotransmitters (21Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). LTx shows pore forming activity and has been used as a powerful tool to study the Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent exocytosis in cell lines (2Rosenthal L. Zacchetti D. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Mol.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6113-6125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the first detailed study on the effects of Bc2 on [Ca2+]c and exocytosis. To measure simultaneously these two parameters in a single cell with high time resolution we chose the bovine adrenal chromaffin cell, a model widely used to study basic mechanisms of exocytosis as a function of Ca2+dynamics at the single-cell level (27Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). For comparative purposes we have also employed LTx and direct depolarization of the cell with high concentration of K+. Although we found some similarities between Bc2, LTx, and K+, we also depicted drastic differences in their effects on [Ca2+]c changes and the release of catecholamines. This makes Bc2 an interesting neurotoxin to explore different aspects of basic neurotransmitter release mechanisms. Bovine adrenal medulla chromaffin cells were isolated following standard methods (28Livett B.G. Physiol Rev. 1984; 64: 1103-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) with some modifications (29Moro M.A. López M.G. Gandı́a L. Michelena P. Garcı́a A.G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were kept in an incubator at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere, and used 1–5 days thereafter. Microelectrodes for the detection of catecholamine release were prepared by cannulating individual carbon fibers (12 μm radius) into polyethylene tubing (Portex, Kent, United Kingdom), insulated as described (30Chow R.H. von Rüden L. Neher E. Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), and sealed into glass micropipettes with epoxy (CIBA-GEIGY). Microelectrodes (20–60 Gohm) were back-filled with 3m KCl solution and connected to a home-made amplifier. A constant voltage of 780 mV versus Ag/AgCl reference was applied to the electrode. The tip of the carbon-fiber electrode was gently pressed against the cell surface. The amperometric current was filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 200 Hz. An ADInstrument MacLab/4e interface controlled by a Macintosh Quadra 800 running the MacLab Chart application were used to record, display, and analyze simultaneously calcium and electrochemical data. Current integrals and curve fittings were also calculated using the program Igor Pro 3.14 and individual spike characteristics were analyzed using Igor Pro macros supplied by Dr. Ricardo Borges (Departamento de Farmacologı́a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Laguna, La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain) Coverslips containing the cells were placed on an experimental chamber mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. The chamber was continuously perfused at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) with Krebs-HEPES containing (mM): NaCl, 144; KCl, 5.9; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 2 mm; HEPES, 10; glucose, 11; pH 7.3, titrated with NaOH. Control and test solutions were changed using a multibarrelled concentration-clamp device (31Gandı́a L. Garcı́a A.G. Morad M. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1993; 244: 253-262Google Scholar). Cells attached to glass coverslips were loaded with the acetoxymethylester form of the fluorescent dye fura-2 (fura-2 AM) (2.5 μm for 40 min at 37 °C, in the dark). Then, the cells were washed with Krebs-HEPES solution and kept for 10 min at 37 °C in an incubator before being placed in a perfusion chamber. Solutions were applied to the cell under investigation using the fast superfusion device employed in the amperometric studies. Only one experimental protocol was run on each single coverslip. Single cell fluorescence measurements were performed by exciting the fura-2 loaded cells with alternating 360- and 390-nm filtered light. The apparent [Ca2+]c was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence signal (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Ca2+] c=Keff(R−Ro)/(R1−R)Equation 1 where K eff is an “effective binding constant,” R o is the fluorescence ratio at zero Ca2+, and R 1 is the limiting ratio at high Ca2+. These calibration constants were experimentally determined as described previously (33Almers W. Neher E. FEBS Lett. 1985; 92: 13-18Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). R is the observed or experimental ratio. Chromaffin cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips contained in a 6-well plastic plates at a density of 5 × 104 per 35-mm dish. Chromaffin cells were stained for F-actin and for dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), an antigen present in epinephrine- and norepinephrine-containing cells (34Cuchillo-Ibañez I. Michelena P. Albillos A. Garcı́a A.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Vitale M.L. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaró J.-M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); incubated for different time periods in PBS solution in the presence or absence of high K+ (70 mm) or Bc2 at different time intervals, to evoke the stimulus required. Following these incubations, chromaffin cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. Then, the cells were washed several times with PBS solution and incubated with a blocking solution consisting of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min. The coverslips were then washed in PBS solution and incubated with mouse anti-(DBH) monoclonal antibody (1:200; Chemicon) for 45 min and washed with PBS several times; bound primary antibodies were revealed by incubation for 45 min with BODIPY FL goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (diluted 1:100). For the staining of F-actin, cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 at 0.2%, for 2 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed with PBS for several times and then stained with 0.6 μmrhodamine-phalloidin for 20 min. Finally, coverslips were rinsed with PBS and mounted in glycerol-PBS (1:1, v/v). All the incubations were carried out at room temperature. Preparations were examined with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope and a Nikon planapo 60X/1.4 oil-immersion objective. Bc2 was purified from the Brazilian sea anemone B. caissarum mucus as described previously (20Migues P.V. Leal R.B. Mantovani M. Nicolau M. Gabilan N.H. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The toxin was kept in aliquots (0.1 mm) at −20 °C and then further diluted, as needed, on the day of use. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and antibiotics were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Madrid). LTx from Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel), sphingomyelin, nifedipine, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Madrid). ω-Agatoxin IVA was from The Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan) and ω-conotoxin GVIA was from Bachem Feinchemikalien (Basel, Switzerland). Anti-DBH antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Progenetics, Madrid). Fura-2 acetoxymethylester, BODIPY anti-mouse IgG, and rhodamine-phalloidin from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). ω-Agatoxin IVA and ω-conotoxin GVIA were dissolved in distilled water and stored frozen in aliquots at 0.1 mm. Nifedipine (10 mm) was prepared in ethanol, and diluted to the required final concentration (3 μm) in Krebs-HEPES solution. Stimulation is referred to as the 70 mm K+ solution (Krebs-HEPES solutions containing 70 mm K+, with 2 mmCa2+, with concomitant isosmotic reduction of Na+). For the experiments performed in the absence of Ca2+, 0.5 mm EGTA was added to the standard Krebs-HEPES without CaCl2. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences between means were estimated using Student's t test; p values equal or smaller than 0.05 were taken as significant. Carbon fiber amperometry records were combined with fura-2 fluorescence measurements to allow simultaneous on-line monitoring of catecholamine quantal release and intracellular Ca2+ signals. A short depolarization (5 s) of 70 mm K+ caused a fast and transient increase of [Ca2+]c from a resting level of approximately 75 ± 12 nm (n = 20) to 921 ± 82 nm (n = 18). The transient is attributed to activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels; thereafter there is a sustained Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium, followed by the release from intracellular Ca2+ stores and simultaneous extrusion of [Ca2+]c (36Rosario L.M. Soria B. Feurstein G. Pollard H.B. Neuroscience. 1989; 29: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). The evoked electrochemical signal correlated well with the Ca2+ signal and exhibited a single secretory component. Many superimposed amperometric secretory spikes appeared over an elevation of the basal amperometric current that can be identified as quantal release of many single vesicles of oxidizable neurotransmitter that fused with the plasma membrane at high rate and that persisted until the Ca2+ signal decayed. This initial massive release followed by a rapid fall in the amperometric current probably reflects fusion and release of readily releasable vesicles, that only require an elevation of [Ca2+]c for exocytosis (37Thomas P. Wong J.G. Lee A.K. Almers W. Neuron. 1993; 11: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 38Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nature Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Despite the similar initial increases in [Ca2+]c, continuous depolarization with 70 mm K+presented a slower decay in the fura-2 fluorescence, attributed to inactivation of Ca2+ channels (39Artalejo C.R. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Garcı́a A.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 134: 1-7Google Scholar, 40Michelena P. Garcı́a-Pérez L.E. Artalejo A.R. Garcı́a A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3284-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that blocks the entry of Ca2+. The secretory pattern induced by continuous depolarization persisted for several minutes (Fig. 1 B) in contrast to that induced by a short depolarizing pulse (5 s). The secretory pattern consisted in a first rapid phase similar to that observed with short depolarizations followed by a second slow-rate secretion, where individual spikes could be distinguish easily; they represent vesicles that need to undergo priming and maturation before they are ready for fusion (38Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nature Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Exposure of chromaffin cells to 5 nm LTx resulted in a gradual increase in [Ca2+]c that took place several minutes (2.5 ± 0.3 min; n = 7) after exposing the cells to the toxin; this latency can be attributed to the time required for the organization of the toxin to form pore structures. LTx increased the basal levels of [Ca2+]c to a sustained plateau of approximately 660 ± 220 nm (n = 7) (Fig.2 A). Exposure of the cells for 2 min to LTx was not sufficient to induce a response. In contrast to the stimulation with K+, changes in [Ca2+]c induced by LTx were not transient, but rather steady. Following the increase in [Ca2+]c, continuous discharges of amperometric spike events could be seen at a constant rate of release during the whole course of the experiment. This secretory behavior is different to that observed with sustained depolarization with 70 mm K+, where two distinct secretory phases can be appreciated. On the other hand, 5 s of subnanomolar (0.3 nm) concentrations of the sea anemone toxin Bc2 were enough to cause a rapid (latency: 21.8 ± 2.7 s; n = 11) increase in [Ca2+]c, reaching a plateau within 2–3 min, with an average of 674 ± 56 nm[Ca2+]c (Fig. 2 B). In some cells the [Ca2+]c decayed very slowly, reaching basal levels. The reversion time oscillated from 5 to more than 20 min, and after that, the cell was able to respond to a new toxin application or depolarizing stimulus (data not shown). When analyzing the exocytotic release of catecholamines two distinct kinetic components can be distinguished, a rapid initial component and a sustained component similar to that observed with continuous K+ (Fig.1 B). Unexpectedly, when we doubled the Bc2 concentration (0.6 nm) or increased the toxin exposition time (30 s), we observed a different response, characterized by a brief transient secretion (Fig. 2 C). The [Ca2+]cincreased initially and remained elevated in a plateau at 624 ± 93 nm (n = 7). This effect was irreversible, while the secretory response ended within the first minute. The catecholamine release occurred like a burst and reminded the response obtained with short K+ pulses. The transient overlapping of amperometric spikes suggests a fast fusion and neurotransmitter release of a finite number of chromaffin vesicles. Interestingly, at high concentrations of Bc2 we obtained a dissociation of the exocytotic and [Ca2+]c signals; so, despite having increased levels of [Ca2+]c, no measurable exocytosis occurred. Detailed analysis of individual amperometric spikes is a good approach to study if the toxin could affect the last step of exocytosis, consisting in the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane, formation of an exocytotic fusion pore and the release of catecholamines from the vesicle matrix (41Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernández-Chacón R. Fernández J.M. Nature. 1993; 373: 554-558Crossref Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Fig.3 plots the frequency histograms of quantal charge (time integral of individual amperometric spikes), peak amplitude, and half-width (duration of the amperometric signal at 50% of its peak amplitude) (Fig. 3 A), in cells stimulated with 70 mm K+ (Fig. 3 B) or 0.3 nm Bc2 (Fig. 3 C). The charge distribution for K+ and Bc2-induced exocytosis was rather similar; the mean charge value for K+ was 2.51 ± 0.13 pC (n = 448) and for Bc2, 2.39 ± 0.13 pC (n = 459). Half-width histograms fitted to Lorentzian distributions centered at t 12 of 37.2 ± 0.7 ms for 70 mm K+ and 35.2 ± 0.5 ms for Bc2-treated cells; this difference was not statistically significant. The amplitude distribution was similar in K+- (42.8 ± 2.4 pA) and Bc2 (38.3 ± 2.1 pA)-treated cells. Altogether, these results suggest that Bc2 does not alter the quantal size and pattern of vesicle release. Therefore, it is unlikely that the toxin is affecting the last step of the exocytotic process. In order to study the kinetic components of the secretory response when cells were exposed to different concentrations of Bc2, we measured the accumulated charge of the amperometric spikes. Fig.4 A depicts the average cumulative integral from experiments performed in 70 mmK+ (n = 6) and cells incubated with 0.3 nm (n = 7) and 0.6 nm(n = 9) Bc2. Continuous secretion induced by the low concentration of the toxin showed a marked increase of the amplitude of the exocytotic response (1504 ± 313 pC), with respect to cells exposed to prolonged depolarization (303 ± 82.9 pC). This difference is probably due to the difference in [Ca2+]c, since as shown in Figs. 1 Band 2 B, the total Ca2+ influx was lower in 70 mm K+ than in Bc2-treated cells. However, despite the different levels of [Ca2+]c reached with the different stimuli, the amperometric transient response obtained with the high concentration of Bc2 (454 ± 147 pC) was 3.3-fold lower than that obtained with the low concentration of Bc2 and only 1.5-fold higher than that induced by K+. Fig.4 B shows the normalized data. Superfusion of the cells with 0.6 nm Bc2 saturated the cumulative integral after 70 s. Interestingly, the continuous secretory response to low Bc2 and 70 mm K+ were well fitted to a double exponential; however, the transient exocytotic Bc2 response could be adequately fitted to a single exponential (see detail in the inset of Fig.4 B). The time constant of the exponential of the transient response was slightly faster (τ = 10.5 s) than the time constant of the faster component of the K+ response (τ = 15.1 s) and much faster than the time constant obtained with low toxin concentration (τ = 87.1 s). These results suggest that low Bc2 concentrations (0.3 nm) induce massive exocytosis, probably due to the massive entry of Ca2+ into the cell. The size and rate of release for the fast and slow component of the secretion is probably dependent on [Ca2+]c. The biexponential secretion behavior induced by Bc2 and high K+ indicate that these two stimuli seem to induce secretion through a similar mechanism of action. However, high Bc2 concentrations (0.6 nm) act in a very different manner; they induce an initial massive transient secretory release that fit to a single exponential. When we express the integral current in terms of fused vesicles (knowing that the averaged spike integral has a value of 2.51 ± 0.13 pC/vesicle under our recording conditions and the estimated secretion with a 12-μm diameter carbon-fiber electrode is about 20% of the total cell surface area), we obtain about 904 vesicles/cell which are rapidly released when treated with the high concentration (0.6 nm) of Bc2; the estimation of vesicles released in the early detected component (τ = 15.1 s) by 70 mmK+ is 228, a number in agreement with the estimated vesicle number obtained through capacitance measurements (42Neher E. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 43Heinemann C. Chow R.H. Neher E. Zucker R. Biophys. J. 1994; 70: 1069-1081Google Scholar, 44Voets T. Neher E. Moser T. Neuron. 1999; 23: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This suggests that the toxin could bypass some of the late stages of the exocytotic process, inducing the rapid release of vesicles from the ready releasable pool and likely too, from vesicles of the intermediate pool, that in normal conditions would need to suffer a maturation process before fusion. This could explain why in most cells treated with high concentrations of toxin we could observe, at least, two consecutive spike “bursts” with fast secretory rates (Figs.2 C and 7 B). In order to correlate the cortical actin network dynamics and the exocytotic responses induced by Bc2 we used rhodamine-phalloidin and anti-DBH-IgG staining. In resting cells, staining of F-actin with rhodamine-phalloidin revealed a weak and diffuse cytoplasmic staining and a continuous cortical ring (Fig.5 A). Stimulation of cells with 70 mm K+ for 2 min induced the disruption of the cortical fluorescent ring (Fig. 5 B). Because phalloidin is a probe for F-actin, the disappearance of rhodamine fluorescence indicates disassembly of actin filaments at subplasmalemmal areas (35Vitale M.L. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaró J.-M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), allowing translocation of vesicles to the plasmalemma in preparation for exocytosis (45Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaró J.-M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This effect is confirmed using the staining with anti-DBH-IgG to detect the presence of chromaffin vesicle membranes on the cell surface, in cells treated for 2 min with 70 mmK+ (Fig. 5 B′). Treatment of cells for 5 s with Bc2, followed by 2 min in Krebs-HEPES, to induce a “continuous” secretory pattern, showed cortical F-actin disassembly (Fig. 5 C) and concomitantly the presence of surface DBH (Fig. 5 C′) in the cortical areas devoid of rhodamine-phalloidin staining. These results are in line with the massive secretion observed in the amperometric experiments (Fig.2 B). However, exposure of chromaffin cells for 30 s (Fig. 2 C) to Bc2 followed by 2 min in Krebs-HEPES to induce the “transient” secretory pattern did not cause an important disruption of the subplasmalemmal F-actin network (Fig. 5 D) and only a few spots of DBH were observed at the plasma membrane level (Fig. 5 D′). This was in some way unexpected because elevated [Ca2+]c has been suggested to modulate the supply of release-competent vesi"
https://openalex.org/W1968394678,"Our laboratory has previously reported a structurally and mechanistically related family of β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases with significant homology to β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase. A large number of the members of this family are hypothetical proteins of bacterial origin with unknown identity in terms of their substrate specificities and metabolic roles. TheEscherichia coli β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologue corresponding to the AE000157 locus was cloned and expressed with a 6-histidine tag for specific purification. The purified recombinant protein very specifically catalyzed the NAD+-dependent oxidation ofd-glycerate and the NADH-dependent reduction of tartronate semialdehyde, identifying this protein as a tartronate semialdehyde reductase. Further evidence for identification as tartronate semialdehyde reductase is the observation that the coding region for this protein is directly preceded by genes coding for hydroxypyruvate isomerase and glyoxylate carboligase, two enzymes that synthesize tartronate semialdehyde, producing an operon clearly designed for d-glycerate biosynthesis from tartronate semialdehyde. The single β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologue fromHaemophilus influenzae was also cloned, expressed, and purified with a 6-histidine tag. This protein also catalyzed the NAD+-dependent oxidation ofd-glycerate but was significantly more efficient in the oxidation of four-carbon β-hydroxyacids liked-hydroxybutyrate and d-threonine. This enzyme differs from all the presently known β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases which are well established members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Our laboratory has previously reported a structurally and mechanistically related family of β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases with significant homology to β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase. A large number of the members of this family are hypothetical proteins of bacterial origin with unknown identity in terms of their substrate specificities and metabolic roles. TheEscherichia coli β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologue corresponding to the AE000157 locus was cloned and expressed with a 6-histidine tag for specific purification.

Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Plenum Press, New York1996: 395-402Google Scholar). Every family member observed displays a very characteristic amino acid sequence homology, with conserved residues segregated into distinct domains. Most of these domains have known or proposed structural and functional roles based on crystallographic studies of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (3Adams M.J. Ellis G.H. Gover S. Naylor C.E. Phillips C. Structure. 1994; 2: 651-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis studies on both β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (1Hawes J.W.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11231-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These include a highly conserved N-terminal domain that provides the bulk of the dinucleotide cofactor-binding site. This domain contains a sequence characteristic of the Rossman fold (5Mirny L.A. Shakhnovich E.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), but one with distinct differences from other Rossman fold sequences, including a completely conserved methionine residue (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A highly conserved domain with a consensus sequence of DAPVSGG appears to be structurally and functionally important to β-hydroxyacid substrate binding in 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (3Adams M.J. Ellis G.H. Gover S. Naylor C.E. Phillips C. Structure. 1994; 2: 651-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and most likely in other family members. A completely conserved lysine residue has been proposed as a critical catalytic residue in both β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase based on site-directed mutagenesis studies and structural data (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11231-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The two most well characterized β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases have distinct substrate specificities and metabolic roles. β-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase is a requisite enzyme for valine catabolism. This enzyme has been purified and characterized from rabbit liver (6Rougraff P.M. Paxton R. Kuntz M.J. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 327-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7Steele M.I. Lorenz D. Hatter K. Park A. Sokatch J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13585-13592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase has been cloned and characterized as a recombinant enzyme (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Hawes J.W. Crabb D.W. Chan R.M. Rougraff P. Harris R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4231-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The rat enzyme is highly specific forS-β-hydroxyisobutyrate but is also active in the NAD+-dependent oxidation ofl-glycerate, l-serine, andR-β-hydroxyisobutyrate, although with relatively highKm values compared withS-β-hydroxyisobutyrate. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is highly specific for NADP+-dependent oxidation of 6-phospho-gluconate and has well known metabolic roles as a part of the pentose phosphate pathway. Numerous β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologues appear in the genomes of many fungi, plants, and of all bacterial species so far examined. Most bacterial genomes display multiple homologues ranging in number from two to five distinct homologues per species, suggesting that this class of enzymes may have unique metabolic roles specific to bacterial biology. Indeed we first hypothesized that one or more of these homologues may correspond to tartronate semialdehyde reductase, a β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase type of reaction that functions specifically in bacterial biosynthesis of glycerate from glyoxylate through the action of glyoxylate carboligase (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the identity of the multiple bacterial β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase, in terms of their substrate specificities and metabolic roles, is not known. We report five distinct β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologues in theEscherichia coli genome, including a single gene for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. In contrast, only one homologue is apparent in the complete genome of Haemophilus influenzaeexcluding also a single gene clearly coding for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. We have cloned and expressed the E. colihomologue corresponding to the AE157 locus, as well as the single homologue of H. influenzae. Each of these recombinant proteins display distinct substrate specificities widely differing from those of the previously characterized β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases and catalyze reactions pertinent to specific bacterial metabolic pathways. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen. Plasmid and PCR1DNA purification reagents were from Qiagen. All PCR reagents were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. High molecular weight genomic DNA fromE. coli strain W3110 was from Sigma. R- andS-β-hydroxyisobutyrate was prepared from the corresponding methyl esters as described previously (6Rougraff P.M. Paxton R. Kuntz M.J. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 327-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tartronate semialdehyde was prepared according to the method of Kohn and Jakoby (9Kohn L. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 243: 2465-2471Google Scholar). Enzyme substrates, NAD+, NADH, and NADP+ were from Sigma. pTrcHisTOPO vector was from Invitrogen. Bacterial cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals, unless otherwise stated were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The entire amino acid sequence of rat β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase was used to perform standard tBLASTn and gapped tBLASTn searches of various genome data bases through the NCBI Blast search engine. Complete and unfinished microbial genome data bases were accessed from the NCBI, National Institutes of Health microbial genomes data bases. cDNA corresponding to the E. coli β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologue represented at locus AE000157 was amplified from high molecular weight genomic DNA from E. coli strain W3110 (Sigma) using the following primers: AAAAAACATATGAAACTGGGATTTATTGG, and AAAAAAGGATCCTCAGGCCAGTTTATGGTGAG. PCR reactions were performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9700 thermocycler using PerkinElmer Life Sciences Geneamp reagents and Taq polymerase. PCR product DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by gel extraction using QIAquick gel extraction reagents (Qiagen). Full-length PCR products were cloned into the pTrcHisTOPO vector (Invitrogen) exactly according to the manufacturer's protocols. Subclones were analyzed by automated DNA sequencing to verify sequence and ensure the fidelity of the reading frame for expression from the pTrcHisTOPO vector. Both strands of each cDNA clone were analyzed using a series of primers spaced approximately 500 base pairs apart. Sequence analysis was performed in the Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility at Indiana University School of Medicine using a 377 DNA sequencer and PerkinElmer Life Sciences Big-Dye terminator chemistry. A full-length cDNA corresponding to the HI1010 gene of H. influenzaewas amplified by nested PCR from two overlapping clones, GHICK65 and GHIJJ86, purchased from American Type Culture Collection. A 5′ segment of the HI1010 gene was amplified from the GHIJJ86 clone using the primers CATATGGAAAATCAAAATTATTCAGTC and CCAAGAGTTACCAGCTGCAT. An overlapping segment of the HI1010 gene containing the complete 3′ end was amplified from the GHICK65 clone using the primers CTCGAGCTACGCTCCTTTTTTCGGTAA and GAGTTGTTACAACCTGTTTTAG. These two primary PCR products were gel purified as described above and used together as template to amplify a full-length HI1010 cDNA using the primers CATATGGAAAAT CAAAATTATTCAGTC and CTCGAGCTACGCTCCTTTTTTCGGTAA. The full-length cDNA was ligated to the pTrcHisTOPO vector and analyzed by automated DNA sequencing as described above. Histidine-tagged clones derived from the pTrcHisTOPO vector were expressed in E. coli strain JM109 and XL1Blue. Cells were cotransfected with the histidine-tagged clones and the chloramphinecol-resistant pGroESL plasmid (10Zhao Y. Hawes J.W. Popov K.P. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the E. coli chaparonins GroEL and GroES under the control of their natural heat shock promoter. Cotransfected cells were cultured in TY medium at 37 °C until the culture reached anA600 of 0.6–0.8 at which time isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Incubation at 37 °C was continued for 20–24 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C until used for purification. Expressed enzyme stored in these cell pellets was stable for up to 2 months. Thawed cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5% Tween 20, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (added from 10 mg/ml fresh stock in isopropanol, 20 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was immediately loaded onto Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) previously equilibrated in the same lysis buffer. 10 ml of resin was used with 3–4 liters of culture. The extract was passed through the column, and the resin was washed with three bed volumes of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 20 mmimidazole. The resin was then washed successively 3 volumes of column buffer containing 40 mm imidazole and 6 volumes of column buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. Histidine-tagged protein was then eluted with column buffer containing 200 mmimidazole. Fractions containing eluted protein were combined. Glycerol was added to the combined fractions at a final concentration of 50% (v/v), and the enzyme was stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Prior to enzyme activity analysis aliquots of the enzyme were concentrated by centrifugation through Centriprep membrane devices (Amicon). Dehydrogenase assays, unless otherwise stated, were performed spectrophotometrically, at 30 °C, in 1 ml reactions containing 50 mm glycine, pH 9.5, 100 μm β-NAD+ or β-NADP+, and 1–10 μg enzyme protein. Reactions were initiated by the addition of β-hydroxyacid substrate, and absorbance at 340 nm was monitored to measure the rate of NADH production. Spectrophotometric measurements were recorded on a Cary 1E spectrophotometer (Varian) and collected using Varian software. Kinetic parameters were calculated exactly as described previously (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Hawes J.W. Crabb D.W. Chan R.M. Rougraff P. Harris R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4231-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The identity of purified proteins was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of trypsin-digested samples using a Finnigan (Thermoquest) LCQ mass spectrometer. Aliquots of 100 μg of purified protein were denatured in 4 m urea at 55 °C for 30 min in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5. Samples were then diluted 4-fold with HPLC grade water and 1 μg sequencing grade, modified trypsin was added. Trypsin digests were incubated for approximately 18 h and then stopped by addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Aliquots of the digests were chromatographed on 500 micron capillaries packed with standard C18 resins (Vydac) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 140D solvent delivery system and a standard acetonitrile gradient containing 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1% acetic acid. Peptides were eluted directly into the electrospray ionization source of the LCQ mass spectrometer. Three types of scans were continuously collected including a broad range mass scan from m/z 200 to 2000, a higher resolution scan with a 2 m/zwindow, and a collision-induced dissociation scan with the fragmentation energy set at 35. Mass spectral data were collected by the Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility at Indiana University School of Medicine. Masses and fragmentation patterns for each observed peptide were compared with those for expected peptides using the Protein Prospector software package. Protein sizes were analyzed by size exclusion HPLC using a Varian Hydropore SEC 5U column and a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 250 analytical HPLC system. Concentrated aliquots of protein purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid, as described above, were loaded onto the column and chromatographed at 200 μl/min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% ethylene glycol (v/v). Peak elution times and peak areas were recorded using a Hewlett Packard 3390A strip chart attenuator. Size exclusion chromatography standards (Sigma) were chromatographed under identical conditions. Standards proteins were repeatedly chromatographed on each day that enzyme samples were analyzed. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Leammli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis was performed exactly as for SDS-PAGE except with the omission of SDS. Purified yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma) were used as standards for native gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad assay method exactly according to the manufacturer's protocol using bovin serum albumin as standard. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase are the most well known members of the β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase enzyme family and clearly share a common structural framework defined by specific, conserved domains of amino acid sequence (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Using the tBLASTn search method with the full-length amino acid sequence of rat β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, we found that most bacterial species display multiple β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologues with the same characteristic conserved domains. The completed genome of E. coli contains five homologues including a single isoform of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Fig. 1). The completed genomes of Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium tuberculosum displayed four homologues each, including single isoforms of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (data not shown). In contrast, the completed genome of hemeophilis influenzaedisplays only one homologue, as well as one isoform of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Most of the conserved amino acids segregate into distinct domains (Fig. 1). Several of these domains have either known or proposed functions as determined by site-directed mutagenesis with β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Plenum Press, New York1996: 395-402Google Scholar) and by examination of the published x-ray crystal structures of mammalian 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (3Adams M.J. Ellis G.H. Gover S. Naylor C.E. Phillips C. Structure. 1994; 2: 651-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The most highly conserved domain is an N-terminal dinucleotide cofactor-binding domain with a consensus sequence of GXXGXGXMGXXXAXNXXXXG. Residues surrounding the first three conserved glycines in this domain (annotated with X) are semiconserved hydrophobic residues. The final conserved glycine in this consensus sequence is also followed by a stretch of 6 hydrophobic residues and either an aspartate or arginine residue that plays a role in cofactor specificity (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Plenum Press, New York1996: 395-402Google Scholar). The majority of family members contain an aspartate at this position and are therefore likely to be specific for β-NAD+ as in the case of β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another highly conserved stretch of amino acids is perhaps the most distinctive structural hallmark of the β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases, with a consensus sequence of MLDAPVSGGXXXAXXG. In this consensus sequence the serine residue, as well as each of the glycine residues, are the most conserved among all family members. The x-ray crystal structure of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase with bound substrate indicates that the conserved serine in this domain is essential to 6-phosphogluconate binding through contact with oxygen atoms in the carboxyl group (3Adams M.J. Ellis G.H. Gover S. Naylor C.E. Phillips C. Structure. 1994; 2: 651-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because of the extreme level of conservation, this serine likely plays this role in substrate binding for other β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases. A highly conserved catalytic domain consists of the consensus sequence GXXGXGXXXKXXX(N/Q). The conserved lysine residue was proposed as a key catalytic residue based on its hydrogen bond contact with the 3-hydroxyl group of 6-phosphogluconate in the crystal structure with bound substrate (3Adams M.J. Ellis G.H. Gover S. Naylor C.E. Phillips C. Structure. 1994; 2: 651-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and based on site-directed mutagenesis studies with both 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (1Hawes J.W. Harper E.T. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Zhang L. Chooback L. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11231-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Overall, the bacterial homologues share a higher level of sequence homology with β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase than with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; however, all share a similar level of homology (approximately 38%). When the amino acid sequences of apparent β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases from many bacterial species are compared, a similar level of homology is observed, and no sequences segregate into any distinct subclasses. Therefore, for the bacterial members of this enzyme family, it is difficult if not impossible to predict the exact identity in terms of reactions catalyzed or substrate specificities on sequence homology alone. To confirm the identity of the cloned E. coli homologue as a β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase, the cDNA was expressed, and the recombinant enzyme was purified utilizing the plasmid-encoded 6-histidine tag. The purified recombinant protein was over 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The predicted amino acid sequence of the purified protein was confirmed by the masses and fragmentation patterns of tryptic peptides analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with approximately 80% of the peptides recovered, including both the N and C termini (data not shown). The purified protein displayed enzymatic activities in the NAD+-dependent oxidation ofd-glycerate as well as the NADH-dependent reduction of tartronate semialdehyde (Fig. 2), with pH profiles characteristic of the known β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases (6Rougraff P.M. Paxton R. Kuntz M.J. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 327-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hawes J.W. Crabb D.W. Chan R.M. Rougraff P. Harris R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4231-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as those reported for purified, native tartronate semialdehyde reductase fromPseudomonas putida (12Kohn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4426-4433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was highly specific for NAD+ rather than NADP+ and was inactive with many analogous β-hydroxyacid substrates including R- andS-β-hydroxyisobutyrate, d- andl-serine, d-phenylserine,d-threonine, d-allothreonine,R-hydroxybutyrate, d- and l-malate, and d/l-mevalonate. The Kmfor d-glycerate was 278 μm, and theKm for β-NAD+ was 28 μm(Table I). These reaction characteristics identify this enzyme as a specific tartronate semialdehyde reductase. The reaction catalyzed by tartronate semialdehyde reductase plays a metabolic role specific to bacteria in the biosynthesis ofd-glycerate from glyoxylate and other compounds such as hydroxypyruvate (Fig. 3). Furthermore, except for enantiomeric specificity, the reaction catalyzed by tartronate semialdehyde reductase is very similar to that catalyzed by β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, with substrates differing only in the substituents present on the alpha carbon (Fig. 3). The quaternary structure of the purified enzyme was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. The enzyme eluted as a single peak at the same position as yeast alcohol dehydrogenase indicating a native size of approximately 150,000 (Fig. 4). The monomer molecular weight was approximately 35,000 as determined by denaturing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Therefore, the native protein appears to be a homotetramer. The purified enzyme also migrated at a position equivalent to yeast alcohol dehydrogenase on native gel electrophoresis in the absence of SDS further suggesting a tetrameric structure. The native tartronate semialdehyde reductase from P. putida was reported to be a tetramer of similarly sized monomers based on hydrodynamic data (12Kohn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4426-4433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data demonstrate a common catalytic chemistry, as well as the observed, common structural framework between rat β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase and the specific E. coli homologue corresponding to the AE000157locus. It is possible other E. coli β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologues (shown in Fig. 1) may correspond to other isoforms of tartronate semialdehyde reductase with differences in kinetic properties or substrate specificity.Table IKinetic parameters for purified E. coli and H. influenzae β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenasesSubstrate 1-aKm values for each substrate were determined with six concentrations of substrate and six concentrations of cofactor.

The purified recombinant protein was over 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE, and the predicted amino acid sequence of the purified protein was also confirmed by the masses and fragmentation patterns of tryptic peptides as described above for the E. coli enzyme (data not shown). Like the E. coli tartronate semialdehyde reductase, theH. influenzae β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase displayed a size of approximately 150,000 when analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4), indicating a tetrameric structure. Also like the E. coli tartronate semialdehyde reductase, this purified protein displayed enzymatic activities in the NAD+-dependent oxidation ofd-glycerate and NADH-dependent reduction of tartronate semialdehyde and was highly specific for β-NAD+ as the dinucleotide cofactor. However, this enzyme was considerably more efficient in the oxidation of four-carbon substrates including R-β-hydroxybutyrate andd-threonine. The Km ford-glycerate (3.7 mm) was about 14-fold higher than that with the E. coli enzyme (Table I). In contrast, the Km values for R-β-hydroxybutyrate andd-threonine were 48 and 61 μm, respectively, and the Vmax for each of these two substrates was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that withd-glycerate (Table I). The enzyme was inactive with many analogous β-hydroxyacid substrates including l-glycerate,R- and S-β-hydroxyisobutyrate, d- and l-serine, d-phenylserine,l-threonine, d-allothreonine, d- and l-malate, and d/l-mevalonate. This enzyme was, however, active in the oxidation ofS-β-hydroxybutyrate although with a Kmvalue (15 mm) over 300-fold higher than that for the R-enantiomer (Table I). Nevertheless, the Vmaxwith this substrate was only slightly lower than that withR-β-hydroxybutyrate. Therefore, the HI1010 gene appears to code for a novel β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase with extremely different substrate specificity compared with the known β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. All of the currently known β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases that have been cloned or structurally characterized are members of the well established short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) enzyme family. This family of enzymes includes a number of secondary alcohol and steroid metabolizing enzymes (13Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) as well as a large number of as yet unidentified, hypothetical proteins and shares a distinct structural framework and catalytic mechanism quite different from that of the β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family (12Kohn L.

Bio/Technol. 1999; 52: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases from Pseudomonas lemoignei and Rhodopseudomonas spheroides have been thoroughly characterized and are now widely used as reagents for the measurement of ketone bodies in various biological samples (16Bergmeyer H.U. Gawehn K. Klotzsch H. Krebs H.A. Williamson D.H. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Williamson D.H. Mellanby J. Bergmeyer H. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 1836Crossref Google Scholar). However, when compared with the H. influenzae (HI1010) enzyme, the purified β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases from bothP. lemoignei and R. spheroides were highly specific for R-β-hydroxybutyrate and were virtually inactive with either d-threonine andd-glycerate (Fig. 5). These data clearly demonstrate very different catalytic and structural characteristics between what can now be considered two forms ofR-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in bacterial species.H. influenzae, as well as E. coli, may also express an SDR type β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and it is likely that multiple genes coding for this enzyme activity have evolved to fulfill different metabolic roles with differences in gene expression and regulation. BLAST searches with known amino acid sequences of the SDR type β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases reveal such possible candidate genes (data not shown) in both E. coli andH. influenzae. However, the prevalence of SDR family members with widely varying substrate specificities makes it difficult to unambiguously predict the exact identity of these homologues based on sequence homology alone. The presence of multiple β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologues in many species of bacteria suggests that this family of enzymes may serve metabolic roles specific to bacterial biology. As shown above, tartronate semialdehyde fits this paradigm with a crucial role in d-glycerate biosynthesis from the two-carbon precursor, glyoxylate. Examination of the open reading frames in the AE000157 locus, flanking the tartronate semialdehyde gene, also supports this hypothesis. The genes coding for both glyoxylate carboligase and GIP, or glyoxylate-induced-protein, directly precede the tartronate semialdehyde coding sequence (Fig. 6). The GIP gene was recently identified as a specific hydroxypyruvate isomerase that catalyzes the synthesis of tartronate semialdehyde (18Ashiuchi M. Misono H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), as does glyoxylate carboligase, although with different mechanisms and precursors. The glyoxylate carboligase gene is directly preceded by a promoter sequence containing two separate sigma factor sites (Fig. 6). Although the tartronate semialdehyde reductase and GIP coding sequences are separated by a second putative sigma factor site, these three genes clearly form part of a gene cluster that would function, in part, in the biosynthesis ofd-glycerate with tartronate semialdehyde reduction as a central feature. Furthermore, when we cultured DH5α E. coli cells in M9 minimal medium with either 0.5% (w/v) glucose or glyoxylate as the sole carbon source, the activity of tartronate semialdehyde reductase was induced over 100-fold with growth on glyoxylate as compared with that with glucose, when assayed either for NAD+-dependent oxidation ofd-glycerate or NADH-dependent reduction of synthetic tartronate semialdehyde. The gene structures surrounding the other three putative E. coli β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases do not suggest clear or obvious functional roles. However, the homologue present at theAE000357 locus is also present in a cluster of genes containing a putative GIP or hydroxypyruvate isomerase coding sequence (Fig. 6), raising the question of identity for this gene as a second isoform of tartronate semialdehyde reductase linked to a second isoform of hydroxypyruvate isomerase with possible differences in gene expression or regulation. The open reading frames surrounding the HI1010 gene also do not suggest a single, obvious metabolic function but include a wide array of genes related to various carbohydrate metabolism pathways (Table II). It is noteworthy that the HI1010 gene also lies upstream of a putative GIP or hydroxypyruvate isomerase gene, the HI 1013 gene (Table II), revealing the same apparent genetic link in two widely differing bacterial species that may reflect common aspects of biological function in glycerate biosynthesis.Table IIOpen reading frames surrounding the HI1010 geneGene 2-aGenes listed in the H. influenzae genome, accession number NC 000907.Location 2-bLocation refers to the nucleotide position in the H. influenzae genome.StrandPID 2-cPID, protein identification number.ProductHI10081073118–1073456+1574038Conserved hypothetical proteinHI10091073504–1074274−1574039Glycerol-3-phosphate regulon repressorHI10101074433–1075338+1574042β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenaseHI10111075341–1076582+1574043Conserved hypothetical proteinHI10121076579–1077211+1574044Sugar isomerase, putativeHI10131077214–1077990+1574045Hydroxypyruvate isomerase, putativeHI10141078046–1078993+1574046Conserved hypothetical proteinHI10151079002–1080468+1574047Gluconate permease (gntP)HI10161080488–1080916+1574051Predicted coding regionHI10171081154–1081795+3212209Glycerol uptake facilitator protein (glpF)HI10191082773–1083771+1574048Thiamin ABC transporter (tbpA)HI10201083776–1085392+1574049Thiamin ABC transporter, permeaseHI10211085376–1086023+1574050Thiamin ABC transporter, ATP-bindingHI10221086136–1087137+1574054Biotin synthetase (bioB)HI10231087262–1089259−1574055Transketolase 1 (tktA)HI10241089388–1090065−1574056Hexulose-6-phosphate synthase, putativeHI10251090115–1090810−1574057l-Ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimeraseHI10261090804–1091664−1574058Hexulose-6-phosphate isomerase, putativeHI10271091678–1093135−1574059l-xylulose kinase (lyx)2-a Genes listed in the H. influenzae genome, accession number NC 000907.2-b Location refers to the nucleotide position in the H. influenzae genome.2-c PID, protein identification number. Open table in a new tab It is also possible, although speculative, that the novel β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase represented by HI1010 may play a role in utilization of polyhydroxybutyrates as an energy source. It is well established that most prokaryotes synthesize various forms of polyhydroxybutyrates under different conditions of nutrient deprivation (19Anderson A.J. Dawes E.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 841-847Google Scholar, 20Jia Y. Kappock T.J. Frick T. Sinskey A.J. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3927-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is likely that a specific β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase may be induced as part of the machinery for utilization of polyhydroxybutyrates as an energy storage form. Indeed, when the SDR type β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase of Rhizobium (Sinorhizobium) meliloti was genetically deleted, the knockout strain produced showed no changes in the turnover of polyhydroxybutyrates, suggesting that perhaps another enzyme may have been present to fill this role (21Aneja P. Charles T.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 849-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further genetic or metabolic studies will be required to define the true role of specific bacterial types of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases in this or any other metabolic pathway.

We have identified a syntaxin 7 homologue (26% identity and 54% similarity to human syntaxin 7) in DictyosteliumcDNA and genomic data banks. In addition to the Habc and H3 helices and the C-terminal transmembrane domain characteristic of syntaxins, this protein contains a repetitive N-terminal extension of 68 amino acids. We first showed that Dictyostelium syntaxin 7 was able to form a complex with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and α- and γ-solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein. Its intracellular localization was then studied by cell fractionation techniques and magnetic purification of the endocytic compartments. Most of D. discoideum syntaxin 7 is contained in endosomes. Finally, an in vitro endosome homotypic fusion assay (Laurent, O., Bruckert, F., Adessi, C., and Satre, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 793–799) was used to study a possible role for syntaxin 7 in this process. Purified anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies and a recombinant soluble fragment of syntaxin 7 both strongly inhibited fusion activity, indicating that this protein was necessary for endosome-endosome fusion. These results demonstrate the importance of this syntaxin 7 homologue in the early phases ofDictyostelium endo-phagocytic pathway.

Three SNARE subfamilies, syntaxin, vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25, are conserved from yeast to man (3Pelham H.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The structural basis of SNARE pairing is due to the characteristic presence in each SNARE of at least one α-helix able to adopt a coiled-coil conformation in association with other SNAREs (4Söllner T.

Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In neurons, a tripartite SNARE complex is formed from four parallel α-helices, one contributed by the syntaxin, one by the synaptobrevin, and two by SNAP-25 (6Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar, 7Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The most diverse and currently best known SNARE family is the syntaxin family. Specific syntaxins are present in almost every compartment undergoing membrane fusion, including endocytic compartments. Yeast syntaxins are organized in a sequential manner along the endocytic pathway, with Tlg1p and Tlg2p in early endosomes (8Holthuis J.C. Nichols B.J. Dhruvakumar S. Pelham H.R.

A similar spatial organization is also found in Arabidopsis thaliana, where the yeast syntaxin homologues AtPep12p and AtVam3p are present on the prevacuolar and vacuolar compartments, respectively (13Sato M.H.

In mammalian cells that recycle plasma membrane receptors by endocytosis, syntaxin 7 is present in early (15Prekeris R. Yang B. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol.

Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, syntaxin 7 is involved in the heterotypic fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes as well as in the homotypic fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes (18Ward D.M. Pevsner J. Scullion M.A. Vaughn M. Kaplan J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Syntaxins 8 (19Subramaniam V.N. Loh E. Horstmann H. Habermann A. Xu Y. Coe J. Griffiths G. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 11 (20), and 13 (21, 22) are also located in endosomes. However, less is known about syntaxins of the endo-phagocytic pathway. In the macrophagic cell line J744, syntaxins 2, 3, and 4 are mainly found in the plasma membrane, yet they are also present on phagosomes, possibly as a consequence of a passive transport from the plasma membrane (23Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Bennett M.K. Klip A. Grinstein S. Manolson M.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4377-4383PubMed Google Scholar). Dictyostelium discoideum is a highly phagocytic amoeba. In axenic strains the level of fluid-phase endocytosis activity is similar to that of professional phagocytic cells, such as activated macrophages (24Thilo L. Vogel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The endo-phagocytic pathway of D. discoideum has been well characterized (25Aubry L. Klein G. Martiel J.L. Satre M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 861-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Padh H. Ha J. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6742-6747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both fluid and particle internalization involve active actin cytoskeleton reorganization and formation of a phagocytic cup surrounded by coronin (27Hacker U. Albrecht R. Maniak M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early recycling of the internalized fluid is almost undetectable. The internalized material, first contained in endosomes, is found in acidic lysosomes after 10 min. Undigested material then transits through a neutral post-lysosomal compartment and is released by exocytosis about 45 min after internalization (25Aubry L. Klein G. Martiel J.L. Satre M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 861-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Padh H. Ha J. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6742-6747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these endocytic compartments are therefore easily distinguished using different pulse-chase conditions. In addition, D. discoideum endocytic compartments can be purified after iron dextran internalization on a magnetic column (28Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Nolta K.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nolta K.V. Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These advantages, combined with the available molecular tools, make D. discoideum a very attractive model organism to study the organization of the endo-phagocytic pathway at the molecular level. In this work, we report the identification, localization, and functional study of a D. discoideum homologue of mammalian syntaxin 7. This protein is mainly localized in endosomes and is necessary for the in vitro reconstituted homotypic fusion of endosomes. D. discoideum strain Ax-2 was cultivated at 21 °C in shaken suspensions (175 rpm) in an axenic medium (31Watts D.J. Ashworth J.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Exponential phase-growing amoebas (5 × 105 to 1 × 107 cells·ml−1) were harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Unless specified, biochemical reagents and chemicals were from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All plasmids and DNA constructions were sequenced on both strands. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For Western blot analysis, polypeptides were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose for immunostaining (Mini Protean II, Bio-Rad). D. discoideum syntaxin 7 was detected by rabbit polyclonal antibodies, described in this study. Cathepsin D and vacuolar ATPase V40 subunit were detected by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, kindly provided by Dr. Jérôme Garin (Laboratoire de Chimie des Protéines, CEA-Grenoble, France) and Pr. Günther Gerisch (Max-Planck-Institute, Martinsried, Germany), respectively. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat AR film. When needed, the photographic image was digitized using an 8-bit Epson GT5000 linear densitometer and the ImageIn software. Comparing different time exposures ensured that the response was linear. Quantification of proteins of interest was performed after background subtraction with the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U. S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). The His6-Syn782–331-expressing plasmid was build by inserting a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment of the SLH661 clone in the pQE30 expression vector containing a 5′-polyhistidine-coding sequence (Qiagen). Primers were designed to allow in-frame ligation of the polymerase chain reaction product, so that the resulting recombinant protein is the portion 82–331 ofD. discoideum syntaxin 7 fused with a MRGSHHHHHHHGI extension. Escherichia coli M15 cells (Qiagen) were transformed with the His6-Syn782–331-expressing plasmid and grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μl·ml−1 ampicillin and 50 μg·ml−1 kanamycin up to a cell density ofA 600 = 0.8. Expression of the recombinant protein was then induced for 2 h at 37 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside (Appligene). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in lysis buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg·ml−1 leupeptin, 10 μg·ml−1 pepstatin, 25 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5), and disrupted by a French press. The lysate was then clarified and purified on a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen), as described for D. discoideumHis6-Rab7 (32Laurent O. Bruckert F. Adessi C. Satre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 793-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further purification was performed on a 10-ml Q-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris/KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The protein of interest was eluted in a salt gradient at 400–500 mm NaCl. In addition to the expected polypeptide, the purified His6-Syn782–331 pool contained two minor degradation products, as checked by MALDI-TOF analysis of their trypsin-digested peptides. After dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, the recombinant protein was concentrated by centrifugation using the Ultrafree system (Millipore). Two mg of purified His6-Syn782–331 protein were used to raise polyclonal antibodies in a rabbit (Elevage Scientifique des Dombes, Romans, France). An affinity column was made by coupling 1 mg of the same recombinant protein to glutaraldehyde-activated Affi-Gel-102 resin (Bio-Rad) and used to purify anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies from rabbit serum (33Harlow H. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 313-315Google Scholar). D. discoideum cells were washed three times in washing buffer (200 mm sucrose, 5 mmglycine-KOH, pH 8.5), suspended at 3.108cells·ml−1 in breaking buffer (washing buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg·ml−1 leupeptin, 5 μg·ml−1 pepstatin, and 2 μg·ml−1 aprotinin), and then broken by six strokes in a ball-bearing cell cracker (34Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). D. discoideum membranes were fractionated as “heavy” (P2) and “light membranes” (P3) by successive centrifugation in breaking buffer: 10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C, Beckman JA-20 rotor; 100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C, Beckman TL100.3 rotor. When total cell membranes were needed, the PNS was only subjected to the second step of centrifugation. To label endocytic compartments, D. discoideum cells (109 cells/batch) were pulsed for 5 min at 21 °C with 40 μm pyranine in axenic medium, washed three times in ice-cold washing buffer, then chased in fresh axenic medium for 0, 15, or 60 min at 21 °C. Under these conditions, the fluorescent fluid-phase marker reached endosomes, lysosomes, or post-lysosomes, respectively. For each pulse/chase conditions, total cell membranes were prepared, suspended in breaking buffer, and layered onto 10-ml linear (25–57%, w/v) sucrose gradients, prepared in the breaking buffer. After 3 h of centrifugation in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. Acid and alkaline phosphatase activities were determined using p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The pyranine concentration was measured by fluorometry (450-nm excitation, 510-nm emission wavelengths) after dilution in 100 mm Tris, pH 10, 0.5% Triton X-100. Proteins of interest were detected and quantified by Western blotting. 109 amoebas were incubated for 90 min in 100 ml of axenic medium containing 1.2 mg·ml−1 superparamagnetic iron dextran (28Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Nolta K.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 40 μm pyranine. A PNS was prepared and loaded on a magnetic column (30Adessi C. Chapel A. Vincon M. Rabilloud T. Klein G. Satre M. Garin J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The column was washed in the presence of the magnetic field with 150 ml of breaking buffer, releasing unbound material. The retained material was eluted in batch in the absence of the magnetic field by gently agitating the iron meshwork in 100 ml of breaking buffer. Membranous and soluble fractions in the retained- and non-retained materials were separated by centrifugation. P2 membranes were prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C (Beckman JA-14 rotor), and P3 membranes by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C (Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor). Membranes were then analyzed for their iron (35Beinert H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), pyranine, and syntaxin 7 contents. Avidin or biotin-HRP-loadedD. discoideum endosomes were prepared, and fusion assays were performed as described (32Laurent O. Bruckert F. Adessi C. Satre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 793-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Except where otherwise stated, the fusion reactions were conducted in the presence of 50 μmGTPγS, 0.8 mg·ml−1 D. discoideum cytosol, and an ATP-depleting system consisting of 10 units·ml−1 apyrase. To test syntaxin 7 involvement in endosome fusion, purified anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies and/or recombinant His6-Syn782–331 were added to the reaction mix. As a control, equal volumes of the corresponding buffers were added. The D. discoideum EST data bank was searched for syntaxin homologues using human syntaxin 7 as a query. Six clones gave significant probability scores. This high number of clones was a clear indication of a well represented mRNA. All clones corresponded to the same cDNA but only their 5′- or 3′-end sequences were present in the data base. The longest member, clone SLH661 (AU039372), was fully sequenced. A putative starting codon was predicted according to the presence of Dictyosteliumcharacteristic A residues at positions −2 and −3 relative to it. Another ATG located 354 base pairs downstream lacked the canonical environment. An AATAA polyadenylation consensus was present near an in-frame putative TAG stop codon, giving a potential coding sequence of 1071 base pairs. A subsequent BLAST search of the D. discoideum genomic data bases allowed the assembly of the corresponding 1302-base pair-long genomic DNA. The genomic sequence contained two short introns, typically AT-rich, the first one of 93 base pairs (nucleotides 375–467) and the second one of 138 base pairs (nucleotides 568–705). The D. discoideum open reading frame encoded a 356-amino acid-long protein with a calculated molecular mass of 40.2 kDa showing 26% (54%) sequence identity (similarity) to human syntaxin 7. The characteristic syntaxin/epimorphin family signature was present at amino acids (aa) 265–304 (Fig.1 B). Using CLUSTAL W 1.7 software (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55389) Google Scholar), the encoded protein was aligned together with known endocytic syntaxins: human syntaxins 7, 8, 11, and 13, yeast Vam3p, Pep12p, Tlg1p, and Tlg2p, and A. thaliana Vam3p and Pep12p. It showed a clear grouping of Dictyostelium protein with the syntaxin 7 subfamily in the resulting phylogenetic tree (Fig.1 A). A secondary structure was predicted using the Predict-Prot software (37Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), based on multiple alignment of six members of the syntaxin 7 subfamily (Fig. 1 B). The largest part of the Dictyostelium protein (aa 69–356) conforms to a classical syntaxin pattern consisting of four α-helices followed by a C-terminal hydrophobic α-helical transmembrane domain (aa 334–354). The three α-helices (aa 89–111, 119–134, 159–186) correspond to the Habc complex (38Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The fourth one (aa 260–291) is able to adopt a coiled-coil structure, as suggested by the presence of characteristic heptad repeats, and corresponds to the H3 domain taking part in the hydrophobic core of the four-helix rod in the SNARE complex (6Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar, 7Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In addition, the D. discoideum SLH661-encoded protein presents a 68-aa-long, Q, N-rich N-terminal extension that contains several repeats of the 4-aa motif GGYN. A 17-residue T, N-rich insertion (aa 202–225) is also present between the Hc helix and the core domain. Such insertions and extensions are common in D. discoideumproteins and may provide sites for regulation by threonine or tyrosine phosphorylation (39Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 828-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To develop molecular tools to study the intracellular localization and function of the putative D. discoideum syntaxin 7, its conserved cytoplasmic portion (residues 82–331) was expressed in bacteria as an His6 fusion protein (His6-Syn782–331) and was used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies (anti-syntaxin 7). Western blot analysis of the PNS, cytosol, and total membrane preparations revealed essentially the presence of a 43-kDa polypeptide enriched in the membrane fraction, but absent in the cytosol, as expected (Fig.2). Detection of this polypeptide band was prevented by preincubating antibodies with an excess of His6-Syn782–331 recombinant protein (data not shown). These antibodies were affinity-purified on an His6-Syn782–331 column covalently coupled to protein A-agarose beads and used in immunoprecipitation experiments. A specific 43-kDa polypeptide was pulled down from a detergent-solubilized membrane extract 2A. Bogdanovic., F. Bruckert, S. Kieffer, J. Garin, T. Morio, and M. Satre, manuscript in preparation. whose peptide mass map, analyzed by MALDI-TOF, corresponds to the protein encoded by SLH661. These results establish the specificity of the purified antibodies. Furthermore, one of the peptides () comes from the sequence before the Met-119, confirming the position of the initial AUG codon and proving the existence of the N-terminal extension of the protein. SNAREs are known to form stable complexes with NSF and SNAP proteins in the absence of ATP (40Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). A cell line expressing a c-myc-tagged form ofD. discoideum NSF (NSF-myc+) was used to test for the presence of the putative syntaxin 7 in such complexes. Immunoprecipitation was performed on NSF-myc+ cell extract using 9E10 anti-myc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the same conditions under which α- and γ-SNAP co-immunoprecipitate with NSF (41Weidenhaupt M. Bruckert F. Louwagie M. Garin J. Satre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The presence of the D. discoideum syntaxin 7 was revealed by Western blotting using the anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies described above. As shown in Fig. 2, this protein is pulled down in the membrane fractions originating from NSF-myc+ cells, which proves its specific interaction with NSF and α- and γ-SNAP. All of the above evidence therefore strongly indicate that the SLH661-encoded protein is a functional D. discoideum SNARE and a member of the syntaxin 7 subfamily. This protein will thus be designated as syntaxin 7. To study syntaxin 7 intracellular localization, high and low density D. discoideum membranes were separated by differential centrifugation. A PNS was first centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet high density membranes (P2), which were enriched in mitochondria, lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, and remnants of the contractile vacuole apparatus meshwork known as acidosomes. A low density membrane pellet (P3) was obtained by further centrifugation of the P2 supernatant (S2) at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. These membranes contained part of the endocytic apparatus, the contractile vacuole bladder, and the plasma membrane. Both P2 and P3 pellets were probed for the presence of syntaxin 7 by immunoblotting with anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies (Fig.3). By quantitative densitometry, it was determined that about 70% of D. discoideum syntaxin 7 is recovered in the fraction of lower density. To determine whether syntaxin 7 has an endocytic localization in D. discoideum, we used a magnetic purification technique that allows a single step preparation of endocytic compartments (28Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Nolta K.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nolta K.V. Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Adessi C. Chapel A. Vincon M. Rabilloud T. Klein G. Satre M. Garin J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). D. discoideum cells were incubated in the presence of iron dextran and pyranine for 3 h to fill the endocytic space. A PNS was prepared and loaded onto an iron meshwork placed in an intense magnetic field. Nonspecifically bound material was washed out, then the magnetic field was removed, and the specifically retained material was recovered in batch. The purified vesicles were pelletized under conditions similar to that of a P2 pellet. Such low speed centrifugal forces are required to maximize vesicular integrity. Since we previously noted that most of syntaxin 7 was present in low density membranes, an additional high speed centrifugation step was performed on the S2 supernatants. Therefore, both retained and non-retained material were fractionated into P2 and P3 pellets and S3 supernatant as described above, and these fractions were analyzed for the presence of syntaxin 7, pyranine, acid phosphatase activity, and iron dextran (Fig.4, A and B). The low speed pellet of the retained material contains purified endocytic compartments, as shown by the relative enrichment in iron dextran, pyranine, and acid phosphatase. More than 40% of totalD. discoideum syntaxin 7 was also present in this fraction, whereas it contained only 5% of total proteins, corresponding to an 8-fold enrichment. The remaining syntaxin 7 was contained in the P2 and P3 pellets of non-retained material. The presence of small amounts of iron dextran, pyranine, and acid phosphatase activity in these fractions indicated that about 10% of endocytic compartments were not retained by the magnetic column. The majority of the syntaxin 7 not retained on the column is present in the P3 pellet. This pool likely corresponds to the endocytic compartments that have been broken, since 51% of the initial pyranine cell content were released in the S3 supernatant of the non-retained material. Finally, the endocytic localization of syntaxin 7 was shown directly, taking advantage of the large increase in density that iron dextran internalization causes to the endocytic compartments (Fig.4 C). When the cells were not loaded with iron dextran, 70% of syntaxin 7 was present in the P3 pellet, whereas for cells loaded with iron dextran, only 15% of syntaxin 7 was in this fraction. This proves that at least 55% of D. discoideum syntaxin 7 is present in compartments whose density changes upon iron dextran loading. To refine syntaxin 7 localization among the various endocytic compartments, D. discoideum membranes were further fractionated on a 25–57% linear sucrose density gradient. To distinguish the different endocytic compartments, three separate batches of D. discoideum cells were pulsed for 5 min with 40 μm pyranine, a fluorescent fluid-phase marker, and then chased for either 0, 15, or 60 min. Under these pulse-chase conditions, the fluid-phase marker is mainly contained in endosomes, lysosomes, or post-lysosomes, respectively (25Aubry L. Klein G. Martiel J.L. Satre M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 861-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Padh H. Ha J. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6742-6747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cell membranes were then prepared in parallel and fractionated onto linear sucrose gradients. The sharp pyranine peaks in the gradients obtained after a 15- or 60-min chase time indicated that the lysosomal and post-lysosomal compartments were concentrated at the bottom of the gradient (Fig.5 B, fractions 2–5). Both acid phosphatase and cathepsin D, two well known lysosomal marker enzymes (42Cardelli J.A. Schatzle J. Bush J.M. Richardson J. Ebert D. Freeze H. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 43Journet A. Chapel A. Jehan S. Adessi C. Freeze H. Klein G. Garin J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3833-3843PubMed Google Scholar), were also found in the same portion of the gradient, confirming the presence of lysosomes"
https://openalex.org/W2159938446,"Annexin II heterotetramer (AIIt) is a multifunctional Ca2+-binding protein composed of two 11-kDa subunits and two annexin II subunits. The annexin II subunit contains three type II and two type III Ca2+-binding sites which are thought to regulate the interaction of AIIt with anionic phospholipid, F-actin, and heparin. In the present study we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to create AIIt mutants with inactive type III (TM AIIt), type II (CM AIIt), and both type II and III Ca2+-binding sites (TCM AIIt). Surprisingly, we found that in the presence of Ca2+, the TM, CM, and TCM AIIt bound phospholipid and F-actin with similar affinity to the wild type AIIt (WT AIIt). Furthermore, the TCM mutant, and to a lesser extent the TM and CM AIIt displayed dose-dependent Ca2+-independent phospholipid aggregation and binding. While the TM and CM AIIt demonstrated Ca2+-dependent binding to F-actin, the binding of the TCM AIIt was Ca2+-independent. These results suggest that the type II or type III Ca2+-binding sites do not directly participate in anionic phospholipid or F-actin binding. We therefore propose that in the absence of Ca2+, the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites of AIIt stabilize a conformation of AIIt that is unfavorable for binding phospholipid and F-actin. Ca2+ binding to these sites, or the inactivation of these Ca2+-binding sites by site-directed mutagenesis, results in a conformational change that promotes binding to anionic phospholipid and F-actin. Since the TM, CM, and TCM AIIt require Ca2+ for binding to heparin, we also propose that novel Ca2+-binding sites regulate this binding event.

Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). All annexins have four repeating, highly homogenous amino acid sequences (eight repeats in the case of annexin VI), known as the annexin repeat (4Geisow M.J. Fritsche U. Hexham J.M. Dash B. Johnson T. Nature. 1986; 320: 636-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The annexin repeat contains 70–80 conserved amino acids, in particular the highly conserved 17-amino acid endonexin fold. Each repeat comprises one compact domain that consists of five α-helices wound into a right-handed super-helix. The sum of the annexin repeats make up the protein core, which contains the binding sites for common annexin ligands such as Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids. Preceding the protein core is the protease-sensitive N-terminal tail, which varies in sequence among annexins and is therefore thought to be of regulatory importance. There are many suggested functions of annexins including transmembrane ion transport, inhibition of phospholipase A2, inhibition of blood coagulation, signal transduction for differentiation and mitogenesis, regulation of cell-matrix interactions, and regulation of cell-cell adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 2Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholarand 5Donnelly S.R. Moss S.E. Cell Mol.

Nature. 1995; 378: 446-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The in vivo functions of annexins have not been well established.X-ray crystallographic analysis of annexin II has established in the presence of a single type II Ca2+-binding site in each of the second, third, and fourth domains and two type III Ca2+-binding sites in the first domain of the protein. Interestingly, these Ca2+-binding sites, along with the phospholipid-binding sites, are located on the convex surface of the molecule whereas the F-actin and heparin-binding sites are located on the opposite side of the molecule, on the concave surface. Annexin II is unique among the annexins in that its N-terminal 14 amino acids comprise a high affinity-binding site for a member of the S100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins, known as p11 (2Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The heterotetrameric complex formed by the interaction of the annexin II and p11 subunits is called annexin II heterotetramer (AIIt). Since the quaternary structure of AIIt is not known, the orientation or conformation of the annexin II subunits within AIIt is unknown. Therefore, it is also unclear whether or not all the Ca2+-binding sites of the annexin II subunits within AIIt are functional.Recently, it was reported that a bacterially expressed mutant of annexin II, composed of inactivated type II Ca2+-binding sites displayed a higher Ca2+ requirement for phospholipid binding. Furthermore, the inactivation of both the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites resulted in the complete loss of phospholipid binding by the mutant annexin II (8Jost M. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was therefore concluded that functionally intact type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites were required for the binding of phospholipid. However, these studies utilized a truncated annexin II in which the N-terminal 30 residues were removed proteolytically. It was therefore unclear if the results obtained from these studies would be applicable to the native protein. Since the truncated annexin II could not bind the p11 subunit, it was also not possible to investigate the function of the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites of AIIt.We have previously reported the purification and characterization of bacterially expressed human annexin II and p11 subunits (9Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The recombinant AIIt, composed of the wild type recombinant subunits of annexin II and p11, possessed identical biological activity to that of native AIIt purified from bovine lung. In the present article, we report the first characterization of AIIt in which the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites have been inactivated (TCM AIIt). Interestingly, inactivation of the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites of annexin II result in the Ca2+-independent association of AIIt with both phospholipid and F-actin. Furthermore, since the binding of the TCM AIIt to heparin requires Ca2+, we postulate that Ca2+-binding sites other than the five characterized type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites mediate the AIIt-heparin interaction.DISCUSSIONAIIt is a multifunctional protein that interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner with anionic phospholipid, F-actin, and heparin. The binding sites for these ligands are located within the annexin II subunit of AIIt. In the present study we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the type III (the TM mutant), type II (the CM mutant), and both type II and III Ca2+-binding sites of annexin II (the TCM mutant). The strategy for inactivation of the annexin II Ca2+-binding sites was initially proposed by Dr. Gerke's (8Jost M. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Jost M. Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14732-14739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) laboratory, who confirmed that the substitution of the key acidic residue of each Ca2+-binding site with alanine resulted in the inactivation of the Ca2+-binding site. However, in contrast to that study, which utilized a chymotrypsin-digested annexin II, we generated a full-length recombinant annexin II. Therefore, for the first time, we were able to form the TM, CM, and TCM mutant forms of AIIt by combining the mutant recombinant annexin II with wild type recombinant p11 subunit. In the present report we have used these mutant forms of AIIt to examine the role of the type II and III sites of AIIt in the Ca2+-dependent interaction with phospholipid, F-actin, heparin, and plasminogen.Since the WT and three mutant forms of annexin II had identical elution profiles after chromatography on hydroxylapatite, heparin-Sepharose, and Sephacryl S-100, we concluded that, as reported earlier, these mutations did not substantially perturb the conformation of annexin II. As well, the mutant annexin II monomers were able to bind to p11 and form AIIt, a further indication that annexin II was in its native conformation. Furthermore, since the WT recombinant AIIt and the TM, CM, and TCM mutants of AIIt had identical gel permeation chromatographic profiles and identical CD spectra, we have concluded that the TM, CM, and TCM mutants of AIIt were not conformationally compromised. The ability of the three mutants to bind heparin and stimulate t-PA-dependent plasminogen conversion to plasmin was further evidence that the conformation of these proteins was not perturbed.Our analysis of the Ca2+-binding capacity of the WT, TM, CM, and TCM AIIt has produced several unexpected results. First, we found that in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, WT annexin II and WT AIIt bound only about 4 or 6 mol of Ca2+/mol of AIIt, respectively. Since the crystal structure of annexin II established the presence of two type III Ca2+-binding sites and three type II Ca2+-binding sites, it was expected that annexin II should bind 5 mol of Ca2+/mol and AIIt would bind at least 10 mol of Ca2+/mol of AIIt. Previous equilibrium dialysis experiments performed in the presence of 1 mmCa2+ showed that annexin II and AIIt bound 2 and 4 mol of Ca2+ bound/mol of protein, respectively (20Glenney J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7247-7252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for the discrepancy between the equilibrium dialysis results and the predicted results is that full occupancy of the Ca2+-binding sites may require greater than 2 mm Ca2+. However, extended incubation of AIIt in the presence of greater than 2 mm Ca2+ leads to precipitation of the protein. 2N. R. Filipenko and D. M. Waisman, unpublished observation. It is therefore not possible to perform equilibrium dialysis experiments at concentrations of Ca2+ greater than 2 mm. It is also possible that AIIt binds less Ca2+ than expected because the conformation or orientation of the annexin II subunits is such that not all Ca2+-binding sites of the annexin II subunit are functional. However, without the elucidation of the x-ray crystallographic structure of AIIt, it is not possible to evaluate this possibility.Second, it was unexpected that the TCM annexin II and TCM AIIt bound 1 mol of Ca2+/mol and 2–3 mol of Ca2+/mol, respectively, because the x-ray crystallographic data had identified the presence of only type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites on annexin II (3Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this result is that the mutations introduced into annexin II do not provide total inactivation of the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites. We feel this is unlikely because the substitution of acidic residues with alanine would result in the loss of two carboxyl oxygen atoms from each Ca2+-binding sites. This would mean that in order for the Ca2+-binding sites to bind Ca2+, the type III Ca2+-binding sites of the TM AIIt would be required to coordinate Ca2+ binding with only two carbonyl oxygens and five water molecules. This type of geometry for a Ca2+-binding site is unlikely. The type II Ca2+-binding sites of CM AIIt would require the coordination of Ca2+ by only three carbonyl oxygens and four water molecules. At best this would be expected to generate a very weak Ca2+-binding site. The loss in the blue shift of the Trp-212 emission spectra for the CM AIIt is strong evidence that the Glu-246 → Ala substitution had inactivated the type II Ca2+-binding site of domain III of annexin II. It is therefore reasonable to expect that similar mutations in the other type II sites would result in their inactivation.Another possible explanation for the ability of the TCM annexin II and TCM AIIt to bind Ca2+ is that novel Ca2+-binding sites, other than type II or type III Ca2+-binding sites are present on these proteins. Since the TCM annexin II and AIIt mutants show Ca2+-dependent binding to heparin, it is likely that the type II or type III Ca2+-binding sites are not involved in regulating heparin-binding. It is therefore reasonable to propose that the single Ca2+-binding site present on TCM annexin II or the two to three Ca2+-binding sites present on the TCM AIIt are novel Ca2+-binding sites that are important for regulating the interaction of AIIt with heparin.If it is assumed that the binding of approximately 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of AIIt are due to Ca2+-binding sites distinct from the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites then it is possible to determine the number of atoms of Ca2+ bound to the type II or type III sites for each mutant AIIt. Since TM AIIt binds 5 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein and two of these Ca2+ are probably not type II or III Ca2+-binding sites, we can assume that three Ca2+ atoms remain bound to the type II sites present on TM AIIt. Similarly, the CM AIIt binds four Ca2+ and assuming two Ca2+ are not type II or III Ca2+-binding sites then the CM AIIt binds 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein to the type III sites present on the protein. Although speculative, the recalculated Ca2+-binding data is consistent with the binding of Ca2+ to only one of the annexin II subunits within AIIt. This presents the possibility that only one of the two annexin II subunits of WT AIIt may have type II or type III Ca2+-binding sites capable of binding Ca2+ in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. Alternatively, one WT annexin II subunit could have functional type II Ca2+-binding sites and the other subunit could have functional type III Ca2+-binding sites.As discussed above, x-ray crystallographic studies established that annexin II contains two type III Ca2+-binding sites located in the first domain of the protein and three type II Ca2+-binding sites located in the second, third, and fourth domains of the protein. The identified consensus amino acid sequence of the type II Ca2+-binding site is -G-X-G-T-X38-(D/E). Ca2+ is heptacoordinated by three carbonyl oxygen atoms, two oxygen atoms of the distal acidic residue, and two solvent molecules. The x-ray crystallographic structure of the annexin V-glycerophosphoserine complex has been reported and it was concluded from these studies that Ca2+ forms a bridge between the amino acids of the type II Ca2+-binding sites and the phosphoryl oxygen atom of the phospholipid (22Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the carboxyl oxygen of the distal acidic residue of the type II Ca2+-binding sites hydrogen bonds with the serine amino group of glycerophosphoserine. It was therefore unexpected that TM and CM AIIt bound to phospholipid vesicles and even more surprising that the binding of the CM and TCM mutant was Ca2+-independent. It was also unexpected that the CM and TCM AIIt had identical affinity for phospholipid in the presence or absence of Ca2+. This is surprising because the substitution of the acidic residues of the TCM AIIt with alanine would be expected to substantially weaken the interaction of AIIt with phospholipid. This is likely to occur by preventing the interaction of the carbonyl oxygen of the distal acidic residue with the polar head group of phosphatidylserine and by preventing the interaction of Ca2+ with the phosphoryl oxygen of phosphatidylserine. However, since the affinity of the WT, TM, CM, and TCM AIIt for phospholipid is identical, it is likely that these interactions are not sufficiently strong to influence the interaction of annexin II with phosphatidylserine. A detailed analysis of the mechanism of the interaction of annexin II or AIIt with phosphatidylserine will not be possible until the x-ray crystallographic structure of the phosphatidylserine-AIIt complex is elucidated.Our results differ dramatically from those obtained by Dr. Gerke's (8Jost M. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Jost M. Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. Eur. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14732-14739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) laboratory who reported that the TCM annexin II did not bind to phospholipid. Since the TCM annexin II mutant used in these experiments was a chymotryptic fragment that lacked the first 29 residues of the N terminus, it is possible that their protein was not in its native conformation. Drs. Drust and Creutz (24Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) have shown that proteolysis of the N terminus of annexin II dramatically increases the Ca2+ dependence of interaction of AIIt with biological membranes.It was also interesting that the TM and CM AIIt demonstrated Ca2+-dependent binding to F-actin. This suggested that the type II or III Ca2+-binding sites are not involved in the Ca2+-dependent interaction of AIIt with F-actin. It was therefore unexpected that the TCM AIIt showed Ca2+-independent binding to F-actin. Although speculative, it is reasonable to propose that in the absence of Ca2+, the distal acidic residues of the type II Ca2+-binding sites and the acidic residue of the type III Ca2+-binding sites interact with other residues within annexin II. This interaction results in the stabilization of a conformation of annexin II which does not allow for interaction with phospholipid or F-actin. The binding of Ca2+ to the Ca2+-binding sites results in the reorientation of these acidic residues such that they can now participate in Ca2+coordination. The resulting change in the conformation also allows the interaction of annexin II with phospholipid or F-actin. Similarly, removal of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis also prevents these acidic residues from interacting with other amino acid residues and promoting the conformation of annexin II that cannot interact with phospholipid or F-actin. Validation of this experimental model will await elucidation of the x-ray crystallographic structure of AIIt. The annexins are a family of about 13 proteins that bind to cellular membranes and anionic phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner (1Siever D.A. Erickson H.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 3Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). All annexins have four repeating, highly homogenous amino acid sequences (eight repeats in the case of annexin VI), known as the annexin repeat (4Geisow M.J. Fritsche U. Hexham J.M. Dash B. Johnson T. Nature. 1986; 320: 636-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The annexin repeat contains 70–80 conserved amino acids, in particular the highly conserved 17-amino acid endonexin fold. Each repeat comprises one compact domain that consists of five α-helices wound into a right-handed super-helix. The sum of the annexin repeats make up the protein core, which contains the binding sites for common annexin ligands such as Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids. Preceding the protein core is the protease-sensitive N-terminal tail, which varies in sequence among annexins and is therefore thought to be of regulatory importance. There are many suggested functions of annexins including transmembrane ion transport, inhibition of phospholipase A2, inhibition of blood coagulation, signal transduction for differentiation and mitogenesis, regulation of cell-matrix interactions, and regulation of cell-cell adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 2Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholarand 5Donnelly S.R. Moss S.E. Cell Mol.

Nature. 1995; 378: 446-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The in vivo functions of annexins have not been well established. X-ray crystallographic analysis of annexin II has established in the presence of a single type II Ca2+-binding site in each of the second, third, and fourth domains and two type III Ca2+-binding sites in the first domain of the protein. Interestingly, these Ca2+-binding sites, along with the phospholipid-binding sites, are located on the convex surface of the molecule whereas the F-actin and heparin-binding sites are located on the opposite side of the molecule, on the concave surface. Annexin II is unique among the annexins in that its N-terminal 14 amino acids comprise a high affinity-binding site for a member of the S100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins, known as p11 (2Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The heterotetrameric complex formed by the interaction of the annexin II and p11 subunits is called annexin II heterotetramer (AIIt). Since the quaternary structure of AIIt is not known, the orientation or conformation of the annexin II subunits within AIIt is unknown. Therefore, it is also unclear whether or not all the Ca2+-binding sites of the annexin II subunits within AIIt are functional. Recently, it was reported that a bacterially expressed mutant of annexin II, composed of inactivated type II Ca2+-binding sites displayed a higher Ca2+ requirement for phospholipid binding. Furthermore, the inactivation of both the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites resulted in the complete loss of phospholipid binding by the mutant annexin II (8Jost M. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was therefore concluded that functionally intact type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites were required for the binding of phospholipid. However, these studies utilized a truncated annexin II in which the N-terminal 30 residues were removed proteolytically. It was therefore unclear if the results obtained from these studies would be applicable to the native protein. Since the truncated annexin II could not bind the p11 subunit, it was also not possible to investigate the function of the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites of AIIt. We have previously reported the purification and characterization of bacterially expressed human annexin II and p11 subunits (9Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The recombinant AIIt, composed of the wild type recombinant subunits of annexin II and p11, possessed identical biological activity to that of native AIIt purified from bovine lung. In the present article, we report the first characterization of AIIt in which the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites have been inactivated (TCM AIIt). Interestingly, inactivation of the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites of annexin II result in the Ca2+-independent association of AIIt with both phospholipid and F-actin. Furthermore, since the binding of the TCM AIIt to heparin requires Ca2+, we postulate that Ca2+-binding sites other than the five characterized type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites mediate the AIIt-heparin interaction. DISCUSSIONAIIt is a multifunctional protein that interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner with anionic phospholipid, F-actin, and heparin. The binding sites for these ligands are located within the annexin II subunit of AIIt. In the present study we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the type III (the TM mutant), type II (the CM mutant), and both type II and III Ca2+-binding sites of annexin II (the TCM mutant). The strategy for inactivation of the annexin II Ca2+-binding sites was initially proposed by Dr. Gerke's (8Jost M. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Jost M. Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14732-14739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) laboratory, who confirmed that the substitution of the key acidic residue of each Ca2+-binding site with alanine resulted in the inactivation of the Ca2+-binding site. However, in contrast to that study, which utilized a chymotrypsin-digested annexin II, we generated a full-length recombinant annexin II. Therefore, for the first time, we were able to form the TM, CM, and TCM mutant forms of AIIt by combining the mutant recombinant annexin II with wild type recombinant p11 subunit. In the present report we have used these mutant forms of AIIt to examine the role of the type II and III sites of AIIt in the Ca2+-dependent interaction with phospholipid, F-actin, heparin, and plasminogen.Since the WT and three mutant forms of annexin II had identical elution profiles after chromatography on hydroxylapatite, heparin-Sepharose, and Sephacryl S-100, we concluded that, as reported earlier, these mutations did not substantially perturb the conformation of annexin II. As well, the mutant annexin II monomers were able to bind to p11 and form AIIt, a further indication that annexin II was in its native conformation. Furthermore, since the WT recombinant AIIt and the TM, CM, and TCM mutants of AIIt had identical gel permeation chromatographic profiles and identical CD spectra, we have concluded that the TM, CM, and TCM mutants of AIIt were not conformationally compromised. The ability of the three mutants to bind heparin and stimulate t-PA-dependent plasminogen conversion to plasmin was further evidence that the conformation of these proteins was not perturbed.Our analysis of the Ca2+-binding capacity of the WT, TM, CM, and TCM AIIt has produced several unexpected results. First, we found that in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, WT annexin II and WT AIIt bound only about 4 or 6 mol of Ca2+/mol of AIIt, respectively. Since the crystal structure of annexin II established the presence of two type III Ca2+-binding sites and three type II Ca2+-binding sites, it was expected that annexin II should bind 5 mol of Ca2+/mol and AIIt would bind at least 10 mol of Ca2+/mol of AIIt. Previous equilibrium dialysis experiments performed in the presence of 1 mmCa2+ showed that annexin II and AIIt bound 2 and 4 mol of Ca2+ bound/mol of protein, respectively (20Glenney J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7247-7252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for the discrepancy between the equilibrium dialysis results and the predicted results is that full occupancy of the Ca2+-binding sites may require greater than 2 mm Ca2+. However, extended incubation of AIIt in the presence of greater than 2 mm Ca2+ leads to precipitation of the protein. 2N. R. Filipenko and D. M. Waisman, unpublished observation. It is therefore not possible to perform equilibrium dialysis experiments at concentrations of Ca2+ greater than 2 mm. It is also possible that AIIt binds less Ca2+ than expected because the conformation or orientation of the annexin II subunits is such that not all Ca2+-binding sites of the annexin II subunit are functional. However, without the elucidation of the x-ray crystallographic structure of AIIt, it is not possible to evaluate this possibility.Second, it was unexpected that the TCM annexin II and TCM AIIt bound 1 mol of Ca2+/mol and 2–3 mol of Ca2+/mol, respectively, because the x-ray crystallographic data had identified the presence of only type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites on annexin II (3Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this result is that the mutations introduced into annexin II do not provide total inactivation of the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites. We feel this is unlikely because the substitution of acidic residues with alanine would result in the loss of two carboxyl oxygen atoms from each Ca2+-binding sites. This would mean that in order for the Ca2+-binding sites to bind Ca2+, the type III Ca2+-binding sites of the TM AIIt would be required to coordinate Ca2+ binding with only two carbonyl oxygens and five water molecules. This type of geometry for a Ca2+-binding site is unlikely. The type II Ca2+-binding sites of CM AIIt would require the coordination of Ca2+ by only three carbonyl oxygens and four water molecules. At best this would be expected to generate a very weak Ca2+-binding site. The loss in the blue shift of the Trp-212 emission spectra for the CM AIIt is strong evidence that the Glu-246 → Ala substitution had inactivated the type II Ca2+-binding site of domain III of annexin II. It is therefore reasonable to expect that similar mutations in the other type II sites would result in their inactivation.Another possible explanation for the ability of the TCM annexin II and TCM AIIt to bind Ca2+ is that novel Ca2+-binding sites, other than type II or type III Ca2+-binding sites are present on these proteins. Since the TCM annexin II and AIIt mutants show Ca2+-dependent binding to heparin, it is likely that the type II or type III Ca2+-binding sites are not involved in regulating heparin-binding. It is therefore reasonable to propose that the single Ca2+-binding site present on TCM annexin II or the two to three Ca2+-binding sites present on the TCM AIIt are novel Ca2+-binding sites that are important for regulating the interaction of AIIt with heparin.If it is assumed that the binding of approximately 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of AIIt are due to Ca2+-binding sites distinct from the type II and type III Ca2+-binding sites then it is possible to determine the number of atoms of Ca2+ bound to the type II or type III sites for each mutant AIIt. Since TM AIIt binds 5 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein and two of these Ca2+ are probably not type II or III Ca2+-binding sites, we can assume that three Ca2+ atoms remain bound to the type II sites present on TM AIIt. Similarly, the CM AIIt binds four Ca2+ and assuming two Ca2+ are not type II or III Ca2+-binding sites then the CM AIIt binds 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein to the type III sites present on the protein. Although speculative, the recalculated Ca2+-binding data is consistent with the binding of Ca2+ to only one of the annexin II subunits within AIIt. This presents the possibility that only one of the two annexin II subunits of WT AIIt may have type II or type III Ca2+-binding sites capable of binding Ca2+ in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. Alternatively, one WT annexin II subunit could have functional type II Ca2+-binding sites and the other subunit could have functional type III Ca2+-binding sites.As discussed above, x-ray crystallographic studies established that annexin II contains two type III Ca2+-binding sites located in the first domain of the protein and three type II Ca2+-binding sites located in the second, third, and fourth domains of the protein. The identified consensus amino acid sequence of the type II Ca2+-binding site is -G-X-G-T-X38-(D/E). Ca2+ is heptacoordinated by three carbonyl oxygen atoms, two oxygen atoms of the distal acidic residue, and two solvent molecules. The x-ray crystallographic structure of the annexin V-glycerophosphoserine complex has been reported and it was concluded from these studies that Ca2+ forms a bridge between the amino acids of the type II Ca2+-binding sites and the phosphoryl oxygen atom of the phospholipid (22Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the carboxyl oxygen of the distal acidic residue of the type II Ca2+-binding sites hydrogen bonds with the serine amino group of glycerophosphoserine. It was therefore unexpected that TM and CM AIIt bound to phospholipid vesicles and even more surprising that the binding of the CM and TCM mutant was Ca2+-independent.

As discussed above, x-ray crystallographic studies established that annexin II contains two type III Ca2+-binding sites located in the first domain of the protein and three type II Ca2+-binding sites located in the second, third, and fourth domains of the protein. The identified consensus amino acid sequence of the type II Ca2+-binding site is -G-X-G-T-X38-(D/E). Ca2+ is heptacoordinated by three carbonyl oxygen atoms, two oxygen atoms of the distal acidic residue, and two solvent molecules. The x-ray crystallographic structure of the annexin V-glycerophosphoserine complex has been reported and it was concluded from these studies that Ca2+ forms a bridge between the amino acids of the type II Ca2+-binding sites and the phosphoryl oxygen atom of the phospholipid (22Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the carboxyl oxygen of the distal acidic residue of the type II Ca2+-binding sites hydrogen bonds with the serine amino group of glycerophosphoserine. It was therefore unexpected that TM and CM AIIt bound to phospholipid vesicles and even more surprising that the binding of the CM and TCM mutant was Ca2+-independent. It was also unexpected that the CM and TCM AIIt had identical affinity for phospholipid in the presence or absence of Ca2+. This is surprising because the substitution of the acidic residues of the TCM AIIt with alanine would be expected to substantially weaken the interaction of AIIt with phospholipid. This is likely to occur by preventing the interaction of the carbonyl oxygen of the distal acidic residue with the polar head group of phosphatidylserine and by preventing the interaction of Ca2+ with the phosphoryl oxygen of phosphatidylserine. However, since the affinity of the WT, TM, CM, and TCM AIIt for phospholipid is identical, it is likely that these interactions are not sufficiently strong to influence the interaction of annexin II with phosphatidylserine. A detailed analysis of the mechanism of the interaction of annexin II or AIIt with phosphatidylserine will not be possible until the x-ray crystallographic structure of the phosphatidylserine-AIIt complex is elucidated. Our results differ dramatically from those obtained by Dr. Gerke's (8Jost M. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Jost M. Thiel C. Weber K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14732-14739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) laboratory who reported that the TCM annexin II did not bind to phospholipid. Since the TCM annexin II mutant used in these experiments was a chymotryptic fragment that lacked the first 29 residues of the N terminus, it is possible that their protein was not in its native conformation. Drs. Drust and Creutz (24Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) have shown that proteolysis of the N terminus of annexin II dramatically increases the Ca2+ dependence of interaction of AIIt with biological membranes. It was also interesting that the TM and CM AIIt demonstrated Ca2+-dependent binding to F-actin. This suggested that the type II or III Ca2+-binding sites are not involved in the Ca2+-dependent interaction of AIIt with F-actin. It was therefore unexpected that the TCM AIIt showed Ca2+-independent binding to F-actin. Although speculative, it is reasonable to propose that in the absence of Ca2+, the distal acidic residues of the type II Ca2+-binding sites and the acidic residue of the type III Ca2+-binding sites interact with other residues within annexin II. This interaction results in the stabilization of a conformation of annexin II which does not allow for interaction with phospholipid or F-actin. The binding of Ca2+ to the Ca2+-binding sites results in the reorientation of these acidic residues such that they can now participate in Ca2+coordination. The resulting change in the conformation also allows the interaction of annexin II with phospholipid or F-actin. Similarly, removal of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis also prevents these acidic residues from interacting with other amino acid residues and promoting the conformation of annexin II that cannot interact with phospholipid or F-actin. Validation of this experimental model will await elucidation of the x-ray crystallographic structure of AIIt. We gratefully acknowledge Darin K.

For the yeast two-hybrid screening, apo(a)KIV-6 was cotransformed with the human liver cDNA Matchmaker library in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) into the HF7c yeast strain, as described by the manufacturer, and the transformants were plated to synthetic dropout medium lacking leucine, histidine, and tryptophan but containing 5 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for up to 7 days. His+colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by transferring individual colonies on filters placed on selection medium. The plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C, and the filters lifted and immersed in liquid nitrogen for 10 s. After thawing at room temperature, the filters were placed on filter circles saturated with 0.2 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 30 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) in a Petri dish (permeabilized cells up) and incubated overnight as indicated. To verify the significance of the interaction a liquid culture assay using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate was performed as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). At least six individual cotransformants were assayed in the background of two different yeast strains. Only interactions of cotransformants in both yeast strains were asumed to be significant. The results are presented as the means ± S.D. Biotinylated peptides FibG207–235 and FibKA207–235 were purchased at Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Biotinylated peptides FibG190–235 and FibKA190–235 were prepared on an automated synthesizer ABI 421A (Applied Biosystems Inc.) using standard Boc/Bzl strategy. Biotin was coupled to the peptidyl-resin viaN-hydroxy-succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate in dimethyl formamide for 16 h at room temperature (28Tam J.P. Heath W.P. Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6442-6455Crossref Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The biotinylated peptidyl-resin was then washed twice with ter-amylalcohol, acetic acid, ter-amylalcohol, and diethylether. The peptides were cleaved from the vacuum-dried resins and simultaneously deprotected according to high hydrogen fluoride procedure (29Suter M. Butler J.E. Immunol. Lett. 1986; 13: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified and characterized by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis. The biotinylated control peptide derived from protein kinase Cα (RFARKGSLRQKNVY) was from Genosys (Cambridge, UK). A total of 5 ml of transformed yeast cells grown overnight in selective medium lacking tryptophan were used to inoculate 15 ml of yeast extract peptone dextrose medium. At anA600 of 0.5, the cells were pelleted, washed, resuspended at 5 × 108 cells/ml in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmEDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF) and frozen at −20 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Vienna, Austria), and fusion proteins were detected using a GAL4 DNA binding domain specific antibody (Santa Cruz Inc, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by a rabbit antimouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate and a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL reagent; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 (30Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B.

Transient transfection of cells was achieved by liposome-mediated gene transfer with the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After overnight incubation the transfection mixture was replaced by 2 ml of growth medium. After 48 h, cell culture supernatants were harvested, treated with proteinase inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin), and centrifuged for 10 min each at 300 and 4000 × g to remove cells and cell debris, respectively. The Lp(a) content was assayed as described elsewhere (31Kraft H.G. Lingenhel A. Pang R.W. Delport R. Trommsdorff M. Vermaak H. Janus E.D. Utermann G. Eur. J. Hum.

Following enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay determination of Lp(a) plasma levels and prior to diluting for the pull-down experiments, the integrity of plasma apo(a) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The Lp(a) isoforms used consisted of 18 apo(a) kringle units for plasma pull-down experiments and 21 apo(a) kringle units for pull-downs of purified Lp(a). Preparation of Lp(a) was performed by density centrifugation as described in Ref. 6Utermann G. Menzel H.J. Kraft H.G. Duba H.C. Kemmler H.G. Seitz C. J. Clin.

Diluted Lp(a) preparations, diluted plasma samples and cell supernatants that had been diluted with HBS (50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) with or without 0.2 m EACA were precleared with110volume Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h. Precleared samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated biotinylated peptide at 3 nm final peptide concentration followed by addition of 20 μl of Biobeads-streptavidin (Merck) for the last 30 min. Precipitates were collected on a magnetic rack and washed four times with HBS/0.05% Tween 20 buffer and protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin). Analysis of experiments described was determined by densitometric quantification of nonsaturated bands of the resulting immunoblots. The linearity of density and Lp(a) concentration within the density range observed in the experiments was verified by analyzing a Western blot with serial Lp(a) dilutions (not shown). The amount of Lp(a) bound to magnetic beads alone (36% of the maximal signal obtained for FibG190–235) or the signal obtained for pCMV vector control transfections (4% of the maximal signal obtained for A18 apo(a)/Lp(a)), respectively, was subtracted. Because of some gel to gel variability, statistical analysis of data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least two (cell culture supernatants) and five (purified Lp(a) and human plasma) independent experiments. Relative values are expressed as percentages of the maximal binding set at 100% for calculation purposes. Cell culture supernatants adjusted to end concentration of 0.6% SDS and 1% Triton X-100 in HBS were treated with proteinase inhibitors (1 mmPMSF, 5 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin) and subsequently precleared with 100 μl of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation the supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight with a monospecific polyclonal rabbit anti-apo(a) antibody (Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany) at 5 μg/ml final antibody concentration, followed by addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the last 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 10000 g at 4 °C and washed four times with 1 ml of washing buffer (0.2% SDS, 1.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin in HBS). The final pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on commercially available on 4–12% Bis-Tris- or 3–9% Tris-acetate gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Immunoblot analysis was performed using apo(a)-specific monoclonal antibody 1A2 (33Dieplinger H. Gruber G. Krasznai K. Reschauer S. Seidel C. Burns G. Muller H.J. Csaszar A. Vogel W. Robenek H.

This kringle IV subtype was used for the library screening because of its low self-activation rate compared with other kringle IV subtypes (not shown). To identify cDNA clones encoding proteins that interact with apo(a) kringle IV type 6, we transformed the yeast host strain HF7c, carrying a GAL4-HIS3 selection and GAL4-β-galactosidase reporter gene with the kringle IV type 6-expression plasmid as a bait and a human liver cDNA library with the cDNA fused to the GAL4 activation domain. A total of 2.4 × 106 transformants were subjected to positive genetic growth selection on His−Leu−Trp−plates, containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. 25 colonies stained positive for β-galactosidase activity. To determine whether activation of the GAL4-dependent reporter genes reflects a specific interaction of the encoded proteins with the kringle IV type 6 bait, each cDNA clone was rescued from yeast colonies and retransformed into the same yeast strain in the absence or presence of the GAL4 kringle IV type 6 bait expression plasmid. Additionally, we transformed each of the putative ligand expression plasmids with an expression plasmid with the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to a nonspecific protein (p53), which is not expected to interact with proteins that bind to apo(a). Four of the 25 clones showed specific interaction, activating β-galactosidase expression exclusively in the presence of the GAL4 kringle IV type 6 bait. Sequence analysis of these positive clones using primers in the pGAD10-flanking sequence revealed two cDNA sequences of so far unknown identity and two cDNA sequences showing a 100% match to fragments of the human fibrinogen β- and γ-chain, respectively. The fibrinogen β-chain clone (K6/β) extended from residues β1–310, and the fibrinogen γ-chain clone (K6/γ) extended from residues γ189–295 (Fig. 1).Figure 1Interaction of fibrinogen clones with apo(a) kringle IV type 6 bait in the two-hybrid screening. Position of the positive clones K6/γ and K6/β (arrows) obtained on screening of a human liver cDNA library are shown next to the corresponding fibrin(ogen) chain. The consensus binding domains for apo(a) kringle IV type 6 defined by the β-chain clone K6/β1 (arrow) are shaded. Also included is the amino acid sequence alignment and consensus sequence of this conserved β- and γ-chain region. Peptide sequences of FibG190–235(bold) and FibG207–235 (underlined) are marked. Lysine to alanine exchanges in the peptide sequences are indicated underneath the γ-chain sequence. Residue numbering corresponds to native human fibrinogen, in which the β-chain runs from Glnβ1 to Glnβ461 and the γ-chain runs from Tyrγ1 to Valγ411.Scissors mark the thrombin cleavage site on the fibrinogen β-chain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The matched sequences of both clones are located within the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of fibrinogen. These carboxyl-terminal sections of the fibrinogen β- and γ-chains are characterized by high sequence and structural homology (35Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C. Trong I.L. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminal fragment of K6/β containing the sequence overlapping with K6/γ was cloned in fusion with the GAL4 activation domain, and the resulting plasmid K6/β1 (Fig. 1) was assayed in yeast cells for interaction with the GAL4 DNA binding domain-apo(a) kringle IV type 6 fusion protein to localize the region of the fibrinogen β-chain clone that mediated binding to apo(a) kringle IV type 6. The positive result in the two-hybrid assay showed that the 64 carboxyl-terminal residues of fibrinogen β-chain that correspond by sequence alignment to amino acids 189–246 of fibrinogen γ-chain are sufficient for binding to apo(a) kringle IV type 6. Moreover, we performed a two-hybrid assay with the fibrinogen clones K6/β1 and K6/γ using the apo(a) kringle IV types 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as baits. Kringle subtypes 5, 7, and 10 showed a high rate of self-activation. Therefore, the interaction could not be evaluated (not shown). As expected, apo(a) kringle IV type 6 significantly interacted with the fibrinogen β- and γ-chain in both strains, despite some quantitative differences observed. However, kringle IV types 2, 8, and 9 did not interact (Fig. 2). The expression of the bait and prey proteins has been tested by analyzing the extracted yeast proteins after SDS-PAGE and Western blot by GAL4 fusion domain-specific antibody. Expressed proteins of the expected molecular weights have been detected in the corresponding yeast protein extracts (not shown). The crystal structure of the fibrinogen module encompassing residues γ144–411 (35Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C. Trong I.L. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C.

Nature. 1997; 389: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) revealed that the minimal kringle IV type 6 binding sequences of the β- and γ-chains are located in a region of similar overall structure consisting of two helices interrupted by the solvent exposed B1-loop (35Yee V.C.

We tested the biotinylated peptides comprising γ190–235 (FibG190–235) and γ207–235 (FibG207–235), respectively, as well as the corresponding lysine exchange mutants FibKA190–235 and FibKA207–235 for in vitro interaction with apo(a)/Lp(a). All four fibrinogen peptides were able to specifically pull down Lp(a) from human plasma, whereas the control peptide was not (Fig. 3). There was a reduced binding for the Lys/Ala peptide exchange mutant FibKA207–235 in relation to wt fibrinogen peptides and FibKA190–235, indicating that lysines affect binding of the shorter fibrinogen peptides (γ207–235) to Lp(a). However, and to our surprise, lysine residues appear not to be essential for this interaction. Next, employing purified Lp(a) instead of human plasma samples, again all fibrin(ogen) peptides bound Lp(a), whereas the control peptide did not (Fig. 4). Here we observed reduced binding efficiencies of the lysine exchange mutants FibKA190–235 and FibKA207–235 compared with the corresponding wt sequences FibG190–235 and FibG207–235. HepG2 cell supernatants containing distinct apo(a)/Lp(a) derivatives were obtained after transient transfection of HepG2 cells with apo(a) expression vector constructs A18 wt, ΔKV-P, and ΔKIV 8-P representing wt apo(a) with 18 kringle units and two 3′ deletions of different lenght (as outlined in Fig. 5). Equal amounts of apo(a)/Lp(a) (as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were used for pull-down experiments with FibG207–235 and immunoprecipitation. As a result, A18 wt Lp(a) as well as ΔKV-P Lp(a) showed a strong interaction with FibG207–235. In contrast, only marginal binding of ΔKIV 8-P apo(a) to FibG207–235was observed (Fig. 6, A andB). The three distinct forms of apo(a)/Lp(a) were expressed equally as verified by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6 C). HepG2 cells were transfected with the apo(a) expression vector constructs A18 wt and the mutant A18-Arg (Fig. 5). The latter is A18 apo(a) with a Trp-4174 to Arg substitution in the LBS of kringle IV type 10, which renders A18-Arg Lp(a) unable to bind to lysine-Sepharose (26Ernst A. Helmhold M. Brunner C. Petho-Schramm A. Armstrong V.W. Muller H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6227-6234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of apo(a)/Lp(a) (as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) from the resulting supernatants were used for pull-down experiments with FibG207–235 and the mutant peptide FibKA207–235. The influence of the LBS on the interaction with the fibrinogen peptides was further evaluated by adding the lysine analogue EACA to the binding buffer. Consistent with pull-down experiments from plasma and with purified Lp(a), pull-down of A18 wt Lp(a) from HepG2 supernatants with the mutant peptide FibKA207–235 resulted in decreased binding efficiency compared with the wt FibG207–235 peptide. Binding of FibG207–235 to A18 wt Lp(a) was significantly reduced after preventing lysine-dependent interactions by addition of EACA. Binding of both fibrinogen peptides to the A18-Arg mutant Lp(a) was greatly reduced when compared with the binding to A18 wt Lp(a). Again further reduction in binding of both peptides was observed in the presence of EACA (Fig. 7). To address the question whether the low to absent binding of FibG207–235 to ΔKIV 8-P apo(a) is due to the presence of this mutant form as free apo(a) exclusively, we transfected apoB100 negative CHO cells with the apo(a) expression vector constructs and performed pull-down experiments with equal amounts of apo(a) from the cell supernatants. We observed strong binding of A18 wt apo(a) and reduced binding of ΔKV-P apo(a) to FibG207–235 (Fig. 8,A and B). Binding to ΔKIV 8-P was below the value obtained by the control peptide. Equal expression of the three apo(a) forms was controlled by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 8 C). Moreover, we tested binding of the mutant apo(a) ΔKIV 5–8 to FibG207–235. This mutant which lacks the kringle IV types 5–8 and does not form Lp(a) particles (26Ernst A. Helmhold M. Brunner C. Petho-Schramm A. Armstrong V.W. Muller H.J. J. Biol.

We cloned rabbit reticulocyte E217K because unlike the similarly sized class I E2s, E214K and UBC4, it is unable to support ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3)-dependent conjugation to endogenous proteins. RNA analysis revealed that this E2 was expressed in all tissues tested, with higher levels in the testis. Analysis of testis RNA from rats of different ages showed that E217K mRNA was induced from days 15 to 30. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that E217K is a 19.5-kDa class I E2 but differs from other class I enzymes in possessing an insertion of 13 amino acids distal to the active site cysteine. E217K shows 74% amino acid identity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae UBC7, and therefore, we rename it mammalian UBC7. Yeast UBC7 crystal structure indicates that this insertion forms a loop out of the otherwise conserved folding structure. Sequence analysis of E2s had previously suggested that this loop is a hypervariable region and may play a role in substrate specificity. We created mutant UBC7 lacking the loop (ubc7Δloop) and a mutant E214k with an inserted loop (E214k+loop) and characterized their biochemical functions. Ubc7Δloop had higher affinity for the E1-Ub thiol ester than native UBC7 and permitted conjugation of Ub to selected proteins in the testis but did not permit the broad spectrum E3-dependent conjugation to endogenous reticulocyte proteins. Surprisingly, E214k+loop was unable to accept Ub from ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) but was able to accept NEDD8 from E1. E214k+loop was able to support conjugation of NEDD8 to endogenous reticulocyte proteins but with much lower efficiency than E214k. Thus, the loop can influence interactions of the E2 with charged E1 as well as with E3s or substrates, but the exact nature of these interactions depends on divergent sequences in the remaining conserved core domain. The structural basis by which ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzymes (E2s) determine substrate specificity remains unclear.

In eukaryotes, selective degradation of many key cellular proteins is mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (reviewed in Refs. 1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through degradation of these proteins, the ubiquitin/proteasome system is implicated in the regulation of diverse processes such as gene transcription, DNA repair (12Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), cell cycle, cellular stress response, receptor endocytosis (13Hicke L.

Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). How the ubiquitin/proteasome system recognizes a multitude of specific substrates remains to be elucidated and is a question of current interest. Proteins recognized by this system are targeted to hydrolysis by the 26 S proteasome through the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid protein. Thus, the ubiquitin-conjugating apparatus plays a key role in selection of substrates. The conjugation of ubiquitin to protein substrates is a multistep process involving three enzymes (15Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step is catalyzed by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; Ub, ubiquitin; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligases; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; Ub, ubiquitin; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligases; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. In an ATP-hydrolyzing reaction, a ubiquitin adenylate intermediate is formed, followed by transfer of the C terminus of the ubiquitin to the thiol group of the active site cysteine residue of the E1 enzyme (16Haas A.L. Warms J.V.B. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activated ubiquitin is then transferred from E1 to a specific cysteine residue of one of several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) (17Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Some E2s transfer ubiquitin to ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s) that bind substrates. This step also involves the formation of a thiol ester linkage between ubiquitin and the ligase (18Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Other E2s appear to bind to E3s, and in these situations, the E3s appear to act as docking proteins, which bring together the E2 and the substrate (19Reiss Y. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10378-10383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some E2s can transfer ubiquitin to the substrate directly (20Pickart C.M. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1573-1581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E2 and/or E3 enzymes finally catalyze isopeptide bond formation between the C terminus of ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of internal lysine residues of target proteins. In most cases, conjugation of ubiquitin to ubiquitin moieties already linked to the protein leads to formation of multi-ubiquitin chains attached to the substrate (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). These multi-ubiquitin chains are subsequently recognized by the 26 S proteasome. Proteins are then probably unfolded and translocated into the central cavity of the proteasome where they are degraded to small peptides (21Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). A large body of genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that both E2 and E3 enzymes exist as protein families and together define the substrate specificity of the conjugation system (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are a family of closely related proteins. Functionally, these have been best characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which 13 E2 genes have been described. Inactivation of many yeast E2 genes produces specific phenotypes indicating that different E2s have different functions. For example, the near identical E2s, UBC4/UBC5 are involved in degradation of abnormal proteins, sporulation, and resistance to stress conditions (8Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). UBC6 is involved in degradation of the yeast transcriptional repressor MATα2 (22Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). UBC7 is responsible for resistance to cadmium toxicity (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Schobert C. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 361: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), degradation of MATα2 (22Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and certain proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope (24Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). This indicates that E2s are involved in determining substrate specificity either by interacting with specific E3s which in turn bind the substrates or less likely by directly recognizing and ligating ubiquitin to a target protein. E2 protein structures have been intensely studied because they may reveal some of the mechanisms underlying recognition of substrates. All E2s have a core domain of about 150 amino acids that shows at least 25% sequence identity. E2s can be divided broadly into four classes (17Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Class I enzymes contain only the conserved catalytic core domain. Class II and III enzymes have either extra C-terminal or extra N-terminal extensions attached to the core domain, respectively. Class IV enzymes have both C-terminal and N-terminal extensions. These extensions to the core domain have been proposed to confer specificity for recognition of substrates or E3s (25Silver E.T. Gwozd T.J. Ptak C. Goebl M. Ellison M.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or to provide a localization signal (26Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, divergent sequences within the conserved core domain of E2 proteins may also be highly significant for recognizing substrates. Haas and co-workers (27Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) initially identified five major E2s in reticulocyte extracts. E214K supports an apparently wide spectrum conjugation of ubiquitin to endogenous proteins (27Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was subsequently determined to be a class I E2 (28Wing S.S. Dumas F. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6495-6501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the other prototype class I E2, the UBC4/5 subfamily, also supports this apparent wide spectrum conjugation of ubiquitin to endogenous proteins (29Wing S. Jain P. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Girod P.-A. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 955-960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E220K, E225K, and E232Kwere subsequently found to be class II E2s and to conjugate ubiquitinin vitro only to selected substrates (31Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no apparent substrates have been identified for E217K, and its molecular structure remains unexplored. Although it is relatively similar in size to E214K (which actually has a molecular mass of 17.3 kDa) and therefore may also be a class I enzyme, it is clearly functionally distinct, having no identified substrates. Therefore, we decided to explore the molecular basis of this functional difference by characterizing this E2. E217K was purified from rabbit reticulocytes as described previously (27Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragmentation by the cyanogen bromide method (28Wing S.S. Dumas F. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6495-6501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Charbonneau H. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 17-30Google Scholar) produced three peptides, two of approximately 6 kDa and one of approximately 5 kDa. The fragments were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and sequenced by Edman degradation as described previously (28Wing S.S. Dumas F. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6495-6501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two peptide sequences were obtained (Fig. 1). From these data, two degenerate primers (5′atgaa(a/g)tt(t/c)at(t/c)acnga(a/g)at3′ and 5′gc(a/g)tciac(a/g)ttigcnggnga(a/g)tc3′) were designed. These primers were then used in RNA PCR reactions to amplify a cDNA fragment encoding part of E217K. The cDNA templates were synthesized from rat brain, bone marrow, liver, testis, and rabbit reticulocyte RNA (2 μg) using reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Superscript Preamp Kit) according to the supplier's protocol and oligo(dT) as a primer. In the PCR reactions, annealing was carried out at 55 °C, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and 30 cycles were performed. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method and T7 polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Since the predicted protein sequence was identical with the sequence obtained from the two E217Kpeptides, the PCR-amplified DNA fragment was labeled with32P and used as a probe to screen a rat testis cDNA library in the λzapII vector (Stratagene). An aliquot of the library containing one million recombinants was screened by transferring plaques to nylon membranes and hybridized with the probe. Positive phage clones were purified, and the pBluescript phagemid containing the insert was excised from the phage according to the manufacturer's instructions. The insert in the plasmid was sequenced. Sequences were analyzed using the Blast software at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Expression of rat UBC7 was evaluated either by RNA blotting (Northern analysis) or by RNase protection assays. RNA was prepared from various rat tissues by the guanidinium thiocyanate-CsCl method (33Ausabel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.D. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1993: 4.2.1-4.2.6Google Scholar). RNA blotting was performed by resolving the indicated quantities of RNA on agarose gels containing 1% formaldehyde followed by transfer to nylon membranes and cross-linking with UV light. The membranes were hybridized with the indicated 32P-labeled DNA probes, washed, and then subjected to autoradiography. RNase protection assays for measuring rat UBC7 were performed as described previously (34Wing S.S. Bedard N. Morales C. Hingamp P. Trasler J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4064-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The RNA probe was the antisense strand of the region encoding amino acid residues 71–140, which was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEM-T. 32P-Riboprobes encoding the complementary strand were synthesized in vitro by using the appropriate T7 or SP6 polymerase and were hybridized with RNA samples (10 μg) overnight at 46 °C. Subsequently, nonhybridizing RNA was digested with RNases A/T, and the remaining labeled RNA hybrids were resolved on a 4% acrylamide DNA sequencing gel. Size of the bands was estimated by running a sequencing reaction alongside the samples. To confirm that the band seen corresponded to that expected, RNA encoding the rat UBC7 mRNA was synthesized in vitro and similarly hybridized with the probe. A UBC7 construct lacking the loop (PGEDKYGYEKPEE) was derived by a PCR-based mutagenesis method. To prevent misfolding of ubc7Δloop without the loop, the residues adjacent to the loop were mutated to those in E214K. Two overlapping internal primers, one forward and one reverse, were synthesized and both contain the same deletion of nucleotides encoding amino acid residues 97–109 and same mutation of nucleotides encoding residue 95 from His to Gln; 96 from Glu to Asn (internal forward primer, 5′cagaatagatggctgcctatccatac3′; internal reverse primer, 5′tctattctgaagaatagaaatgcaaac3′). The internal reverse primer and the external forward primer (5′acggagctgcagtcggc3′) were used in one PCR reaction to amplify the 5′ part of the E2. The internal forward primer and the external reverse primer containing a BamHI site (5′ggatccctcaattggagaccctg3′) were used in another PCR reaction to amplify the 3′ part of the E2. The purified products of these reactions were then mixed together and amplified using only the external forward and reverse primers to produce the full-length product without the 39 nucleotides encoding the 13 extra amino acids. This product was digested with BamHI and subcloned into the pET-11d expression vector (Novagen) that had been digested withNcoI, filled in with Klenow polymerase, and then digested with BamHI. The E214K containing the inserted loop (E214K+loop) was amplified using the same principle as above except that the two overlapping primers contained the same insertion of nucleotides encoding the 13 amino acids (internal forward primer, 5′aaatatggttatgagaagccagaggaacgc3′; internal reverse primer, 5′ctcataaccatatttatcctctccaggttcag3′; external forward primer, 5′tcgaccccggcgcggaggagg3′; external reverse primer, 5′ggatccgatggaaaggatcaacagc3′). The full-length product of E214K containing the loop was also subcloned into the pET-11d vector. The pET-11d plasmids containing UBC7, ubc7Δloop, E214K, and E214K+loop were transformed individually into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Following induction of expression of T7 polymerase by incubation of the bacteria with isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C, the cells were harvested, sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g. The supernatants containing the individual E2s were used in the assays, or the E2s were purified as described below. Bacterial lysates containing E214K or E214K+loop were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 0.1-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with anti-E214K antibody, followed by incubation with secondary antibody, 125I-goat anti-rabbit IgG. The membranes were exposed to x-ray films and to a PhosphorImager screen for quantification. PhosphorImager analysis was carried out using a Fuji imaging plate (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Various amounts of the lysates were analyzed to confirm linearity of the quantitation. A DNA fragment encoding the mature proteolytically processed form of rat NEDD8 was amplified from rat muscle RNA using reverse transcriptase-PCR, and oligonucleotides derived from the NEDD8 sequence (35Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) previously deposited in GenBankTM. The fragment was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET11-d (Novagen) and transformed intoE. coli BL21 (DE3). Following induction of expression with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested from 800 ml of culture and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Subsequent manipulations were on ice or at 4 °C. The frozen pellets were resuspended in one-tenth of the original culture volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and then proteins were differentially precipitated by ammonium sulfate (ICN Ultrapure). The 60–95% ammonium sulfate fraction containing the NEDD8 was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and then passed over a 7-ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in the same buffer. NEDD8 remained in the unbound fraction, and this fraction was then dialyzed overnight against 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, before being applied to a 5 × 100-mm propylsulfonic acid cation exchange column (Waters SP/HR15) equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (10 mm/min) in the same buffer. NEDD8 eluted at approximately 0.125 m NaCl and in most fractions was >99% pure as evaluated by Coomassie Blue-stained acrylamide gels. Molecular mass determination by Maldi-Toff mass spectrometry confirmed that the purified NEDD8 peptide was intact. The chloramine-T method was used to label bovine ubiquitin with Na125I to a specific radioactivity of 6,000 cpm/pmol and to label NEDD8 to a specific radioactivity of 15,000 cpm/pmol. Unincorporated 125I was removed by passing the reaction products over a Sephadex G-25 column. The relative enzymatic activities of E214K, E214k+loop, UBC7, and ubc7Δloop containing bacterial lysates were quantitated by their abilities to form thiol ester complexes with 125I-ubiquitin. E1 used in the assays was prepared from rabbit reticulocytes or rabbit liver as described previously (27Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various amounts of E2s were incubated in a total volume of 10 μl as follows: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 50 nm (unless otherwise indicated) E1, inorganic pyrophosphatase (20 units/ml), 5 μm125I-ubiquitin (>3000 cpm/pmol) at 37 °C for 1 min. The reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol (to hydrolyze or preserve the thiol ester linkages, respectively) and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% acrylamide gels at 4 °C. Following detection by autoradiography, the thiol ester bands were excised from the dried gel in order to measure the incorporated radioactivity and thereby estimate the E2 enzymatic activity. Assaying dilutions of the E2-containing extracts confirmed linearity of assays. The relative enzymatic activity of bacterial lysates containing E214K and E214k+loop to form thiol ester complexes with 125I-NEDD8 was determined using the same method except that the concentration of 125I-NEDD8 was 100 μm, and the reaction time was 2 min to ensure full charging of the E2s with NEDD8. To test the abilities of UBC7 and ubc7Δloop to interact with E1, their apparent K m values for E1 charged with ubiquitin were determined. Recombinant UBC7 and ubc7Δloop were purified by adding E1 to the bacterial lysates followed by ubiquitin affinity chromatography and quaternary amine anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech MonoQ) as described previously (28Wing S.S. Dumas F. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6495-6501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Varying concentrations (50–500 nm) of the purified E2s were assayed in thiol ester reactions as above except that a limiting concentration of E1 was used (2 pm), and the time course of formation of the E2 thiol ester was monitored by removing aliquots from the reaction every 30 s over a 2-min period. Initial velocities were calculated from the time courses and used in double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk) to determine apparentK m values and maximal velocities. The abilities of native and mutated forms of the E2s to support conjugation of ubiquitin or NEDD8 to endogenous proteins were tested as follows. The test fraction derived from endogenous proteins was incubated in a final volume of 25 μl containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmATP, 0.5 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 12.5 mmphosphocreatine, 2.5 units of creatine kinase, 50 nm E1 (100 nm when used with NEDD8), 5 μm125I-ubiquitin or 100 μm125I-NEDD8 and the indicated concentrations of E2s. Following incubation for the indicated times at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, the products resolved of free ubiquitin or NEDD8 by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels, and detected by autoradiography. When required, lanes were cut out and the incorporated ubiquitin or NEDD8 quantitated by counting in a gamma counter. The rabbit reticulocyte fraction devoid of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes was prepared by a 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation of fraction II as previous described (27Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of crude testis cytosol and its fractionation by quaternary amine anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech MonoQ) was as described previously (34Wing S.S. Bedard N. Morales C. Hingamp P. Trasler J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4064-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether E217K is a class I enzyme, we obtained peptide sequence from the purified protein for the purpose of molecular cloning. Direct sequencing of purified rabbit reticulocyte E217K protein did not yield any sequence suggesting the presence of a blocked N terminus. Therefore, the protein was digested with cyanogen bromide. Three peptides, two of approximately 6 kDa and one of approximately 5 kDa, were generated. Two peptide sequences were obtained, one of 17 residues and another of 16 residues (Fig. 1). By examining data bases, we found that these two peptides revealed significant sequence similarities with E2s in various species. To obtain the cDNA sequence, degenerate primers were designed encoding a part of each peptide sequence (Fig. 1). These primers were used with rabbit reticulocyte, rat testis, kidney, and muscle cDNAs in PCR reactions. A fragment of 207 bp was amplified from all of the tissue cDNAs. Sequencing of the fragments and translation of the sequences yielded identical amino acid sequences that corresponded to the peptide microsequencing results, confirming that the DNA fragment encodes part of E217K. Because RNA analysis with this cDNA as probe (see below) showed higher expression of E217K in rat testis (Fig. 2), a cDNA library derived from this tissue was screened to obtain full-length clones. Five positive clones were found, all possessing an open reading frame encoding a protein of 170 amino acids and a predicted mass of 19.5 kDa. Comparison of the sequence with the E2s in the GenBankTM data base showed that this protein has 74% amino acid identity with S. cerevisiae UBC7 (Fig. 1). It has the conserved core catalytic domain but lacks N- or C-terminal extensions and is therefore a class I enzyme. The core domain contains the active site cysteine and the conserved “HPN” tripeptide found in all E2s. The deduced amino acid sequence was also found to be identical to human E2g (36Watanabe T.K. Kawai A. Fujiwara T. Maekawa H. Hirai Y. Nakamura Y. Takahashi E. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 74: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), confirming again the conservation of the ubiquitin system. Since most investigators in this area are naming mammalian E2s after their apparent yeast homologues, we therefore now refer to E217Kas mammalian UBC7. To determine which tissues express UBC7, RNA from various rat tissues were analyzed by Northern blotting using the fragment of rat UBC7 cDNA as a probe. One transcript (2.5 kilobase pairs) was observed in all rat tissues examined. Thus, this E2 appears to have a general cellular function. This would be consistent with results from studies in yeast which indicate that UBC7 plays a role in the degradation"
