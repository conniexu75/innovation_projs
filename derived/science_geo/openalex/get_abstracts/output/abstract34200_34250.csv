https://openalex.org/W2087916050,"Brain injury induced by fluid percussion in rats caused a marked elevation in extracellular glutamate and aspartate adjacent to the trauma site. This increase in excitatory amino acids was related to the severity of the injury and was associated with a reduction in cellular bioenergetic state and intracellular free magnesium. Treatment with the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist dextrophan or the competitive antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid limited the resultant neurological dysfunction; dextrorphan treatment also improved the bioenergetic state after trauma and increased the intracellular free magnesium. Thus, excitatory amino acids contribute to delayed tissue damage after brain trauma; NMDA antagonists may be of benefit in treating acute head injury."
https://openalex.org/W1980847511,"To examine the extent and variation of allelic loss in a common adult tumor, polymorphic DNA markers were studied from every nonacrocentric autosomal arm in 56 paired colorectal carcinoma and adjacent normal colonic mucosa specimens. This analysis was termed an allelotype, in analogy with a karyotype. Three major conclusions were drawn from this analysis: (i) Allelic deletions were remarkably common; one of the alleles of each polymorphic marker tested was lost in at least some tumors, and some tumors lost more than half of their parental alleles. (ii) In addition to allelic deletions, new DNA fragments not present in normal tissue were identified in five carcinomas; these new fragments contained repeated sequences of the variable number of tandem repeat type. (iii) Patients with more than the median percentage of allelic deletions had a considerably worse prognosis than did the other patients, although the size and stage of the primary tumors were very similar in the two groups. In addition to its implications concerning the genetic events underlying tumorigenesis, tumor allelotype may provide a molecular tool for improved estimation of prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2059222296,"The region-specific homeotic gene fork head (fkh) promotes terminal as opposed to segmental development in the Drosophila embryo. We have cloned the fkh region by chromosomal walking. P element-mediated germ-line transformation and sequence comparison of wild-type and mutant alleles identify the fkh gene within the cloned region. fkh is expressed in the early embryo in the two terminal domains that are homeotically transformed in fkh mutant embryos. The nuclear localization of the fkh protein suggests that fkh regulates the transcription of other, subordinate, genes. The fkh gene product, however, does not contain a known protein motif, such as the homeodomain or the zinc fingers, nor is it similar in sequence to any other known protein."
https://openalex.org/W2038701440,"The bicoid (bcd) protein is expressed in an anteroposterior gradient in early Drosophila embryos and controls the zygotic activation of the segmentation gene hunchback (hb) in a broad but precisely bounded anterior domain. Here we show that the hb gene contains multiple regulatory elements that mediate transcriptional activation in response to bcd protein. Further, we demonstrate that the resulting patterns of expression in vivo depend critically on both the bcd gradient profile and the number and quality of these hb elements. Finally, we show that these same elements mediate bcd-dependent transcriptional activation in yeast and that this interaction requires distinct DNA binding and activating regions in the bcd protein. Our results argue that bcd protein normally binds and activates the hb gene in a concentration-dependent fashion, thereby allowing the gradient of bcd protein to dictate where the hb gene is initially turned on in early embryos. They also suggest that the bcd gradient has the instructive capacity to activate other subordinate control genes by the same mechanism, each in a distinct spatial domain according to its affinity for bcd protein."
https://openalex.org/W2117237148,"Transgenic mice carrying the activated c-neu oncogene under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat were produced. Epithelial hyperplasia of epididymis, seminal vesicles, and salivary glands, and dysplasia of harderian glands, were induced. Moreover, in females of our four lines, independent but multiple mammary tumors arose asynchronously, between 5 and 10 months of age, as stochastic events. Histologically, poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, with intratumor necrosis and calcifications, arose adjacent to morphologically normal epithelium. High transgene expression was detected in all mammary tumors tested and in normal mammary glands before the appearance of the tumors. Together these results suggest that the expression of the activated c-neu oncogene was necessary but not sufficient to induce malignant transformation of the mammary epithelial cells. These tumors appear to be an adequate model for human breast cancers overexpressing c-neu."
https://openalex.org/W1605451242,"Gp170 (also known as P-glycoprotein) is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is overexpressed in multidrug-resistant tumor cells and is also found in the apical plasma membrane domain of several normal human and animal tissues. Gp170 has been postulated to function as an energy-dependent efflux pump for cytotoxic drugs. In rat liver, Gp170 is restricted to the bile canalicular domain of the plasma membrane. Canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV), but not sinusoidal membrane vesicles, contained a approximately 160-kDa protein which reacts with anti-Gp170 monoclonal antibody and manifest ATP-dependent [3H]daunomycin transport which is temperature dependent, osmotically sensitive, and saturable. Among several nucleotides, ATP was a potent stimulator of transport whereas non- or slowly hydrolyzable analogues (adenosin-5-O-(3-thiotriphosphate, adenyl-5-yl-imidodiphosphate) were ineffective. ATP-dependent daunomycin transport was inhibited by cytotoxic drugs (vinblastine, vincristine, and adriamycin) and other drugs, such as verapamil and quinidine, which restore anti-cancer drug sensitivity in resistant cells. Inside-out CMV were separated from right side-out CMV by antibody-induced affinity density perturbation. Only inside-out CMV manifested ATP-dependent daunomycin transport. These results suggest that Gp170 is an ATP-dependent efflux pump which is responsible for the undirectional, energy-dependent transport of daunomycin and other drugs by rat liver into the bile."
https://openalex.org/W2031370899,"RNA amplification with transcript sequencing (RAWTS) is a rapid and sensitive method of direct sequencing that involves complementary DNA synthesis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a primer or primers containing a phage promoter, transcription from the phage promoter, and reverse transcriptase-mediated sequencing. By means of RAWTS, it was possible to sequence each of four tissue-specific human messenger RNAs (blue pigment, factor IX, phenylalanine hydroxylase, and tyrosine hydroxylase) in four cell types examined (white blood cells, liver, K562 erythroleukemia cells, and chorionic villus cells). These results indicate that there is a basal rate of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation of tissue-specific mRNAs in adult and embryonic tissues. In addition to revealing sequence information, it is possible to generate a desired in vitro translation product by incorporating a translation initiation signal into the appropriate PCR primer. RAWTS can be used to obtain novel mRNA sequence information from other species as illustrated with a segment of the catalytic domain of factor IX. In general, the ability to obtain mRNA sequences rapidly across species boundaries should aid both the study of protein evolution and the identification of sequences crucial for protein structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2001199318,"In frogs, mesoderm presumably derives from presumptive ectoderm by induction under the control of diffusible substances produced by the endoderm. To analyze the early phase of mesoderm induction, I have isolated cDNA copies of mRNAs induced in presumptive ectoderm by mesoderm inducing factor secreted by the XTC cell line. One of the inducible mRNAs encodes a homeodomain-containing protein that is likely to play a regulatory role in development. Mix.1 behaves as an immediate early response to induction, and its kinetics of expression suggest a major role for MBT in the control of inducible gene expression. Unexpectedly, Mix.1 is expressed mostly in the future endoderm, suggesting that endoderm may be formed by induction in a similar way as mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2111341106,"Homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster such as Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Antennapedia (Antp) have long been thought to select metameric identity during development by controlling the expression of various target genes. Here we describe a cotransfection assay in cultured D. melanogaster cells that is used to demonstrate that Ubx proteins (UBX) can repress an Antp promoter fusion and activate a Ubx promoter fusion, activities predicted from genetic studies. We show (a) that UBX proteins regulated the level of accurately initiated Antp P1 and Ubx transcripts, (b) that activation of the Ubx promoter required a downstream cluster of UBX binding sites, and (c) that binding site sequences were sufficient to confer regulation on a heterologous promoter, regardless of their orientation or precise position. We conclude that UBX proteins are transcriptional repressors and activators, and that their actions are mediated by binding to promoter region sequences. Each member of the UBX protein family has similar regulatory abilities, but the properties of synthetic mutant forms suggest that UBX proteins may have a modular design similar to other transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2070397307,"We demonstrated previously that two molecules of steroid hormone receptor bound efficiently to a single hormone response element (GRE/PRE) of the tyrosine aminotransferase gene (Tsai et al., 1988). Here, we show that two tandemly linked GRE/PREs conferred progesterone inducibility synergistically to a heterologous TK-CAT fusion gene. Binding studies demonstrated that occupation of one GRE/PRE site by a progesterone receptor dimer increased the binding affinity of receptors for the second GRE/PRE site 100-fold. Thus, the observed synergistic induction of TK-CAT may result from cooperative binding of receptor dimers to the two GRE/PRE sites."
https://openalex.org/W2074378372,"Inheritance of T cell receptor beta chain (TCR beta) genes was analyzed in families of 40 sibling pairs concordant for the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS). TCR beta haplotypes were determined by segregation analysis of polymorphic markers within the TCR beta complex. The mean proportion of TCR beta haplotypes identical by descent (IBD) inherited by MS sibling pairs was significantly increased compared with expected values (means test, p less than 0.004), whereas the distribution of haplotype sharing was random when MS patients were compared with their unaffected siblings. Furthermore, one allelic form of a TCR beta variable region gene segment was overrepresented on MS chromosomes compared with those parental chromosomes not transmitted to MS offspring both in the MS sibling pair families and in a second group of families containing only one individual affected with MS. These results demonstrate that a gene within the TCR beta complex or a closely linked locus influences susceptibility to MS."

https://openalex.org/W1489183905,"The purification and characterization of transcription factor IIF (TFIIF), a factor required for transcription by the RNA polymerase II machinery, is described. TFIIF was isolated from the previously described IIE protein fraction. TFIIF enters into the transcription cycle via a preinitiation complex, and it is required for the formation of a complex capable of initiating transcription in the presence of heparin concentrations that inhibit the action of a free factor. TFIIF and TFIIE independently interacted with purified RNA polymerase II. TFIIF and TFIIE were both required for transcription of several class II promoters, including a promoter that lacks the conserved TATA box. Interestingly TFIIF was absolutely required for the formation of a preinitiation complex; however, it also affected the elongation phase of the transcription cycle. TFIIF, together with the previously described elongation factor TFIIS, was required for efficient elongation."

https://openalex.org/W1496068612,"Abstract The gene encoding a human alpha 2-adrenergic receptor was isolated from a human genomic DNA library using a 367-base pair fragment of Drosophila genomic DNA that exhibited 54% identity with the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor and 57% identity with the human alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. The nucleotide sequence of a fragment containing the human alpha 2-receptor gene and 2.076 kilobases of untranslated 5' sequence was determined, and potential upstream regulatory regions were identified. This gene encodes a protein of 450 amino acids and was identified as an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor by homology with published sequences and by pharmacological characterization of the protein expressed in cultured cells. Permanent expression of the alpha 2-receptor was achieved by transfecting Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells which lack adrenergic receptors with a 1.5-kilobase NcoI-HindIII fragment of the genomic clone containing the coding region of the gene. The alpha 2-receptor expressed in CHO cells displayed pharmacology characteristic of an alpha 2 A-receptor subtype with a high affinity for yohimbine (Ki = 1 nM) and a low affinity for prazosin (Ki = 10,000 nM). Agonists displayed a rank order of potency in radioligand binding assays of para-aminoclonidine greater than or equal to UK-14304 greater than (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine greater than (-)-isoproterenol, consistent with the identification of this protein as an alpha 2-receptor. The role of the alpha 2-receptor in modulating intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations was investigated in three transfected cell lines expressing 50, 200, and 1200 fmol of receptor/mg membrane protein. At low concentrations (1-100 nM), (-)-epinephrine attenuated forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation by up to 60% in a receptor density-dependent manner. At epinephrine concentrations above 100 nM, cyclic AMP levels were increased up to 140% of the forskolin-stimulated level. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of cells eliminated alpha 2-receptor-mediated attenuation of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels and enhanced the receptor density-dependent potentiation of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP concentrations from 3 to 8-fold. Potentiation of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels was also elicited by the alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, UK-14304 and para-aminoclonidine, and blocked by the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, but not by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1543280300,"Nucleotides encoding glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, or asparagine residues within the stalk sector of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase were altered by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. The mutant cDNAs were expressed in COS-1 cells, and mutant Ca2+-ATPases were assayed for Ca2+ transport function and phosphoenzyme formation. Multiple mutations introduced into stalks, 1, 2, and 3 resulted in partial loss of Ca2+ transport function. In most cases, subsequent mutation of individual amino acids in the cluster had no effect on Ca2+ transport activity. In one cluster, however, it was possible to assign the reduction in Ca2+ transport activity to alterations of Asn111 and Asn114. The mutant Asn114 to alanine retained about 50% activity, whereas the change Asn111 to alanine retained only 10% activity. None of the mutations affected phosphorylation of the enzyme by ATP in the presence of Ca2+ or by inorganic phosphate in the absence of Ca2+. The combined experiments suggest that the reduced Ca2+ uptake observed in the Asn111 and Asn114 mutants was not due to a defect in enzyme activation by Ca2+ or in formation of the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate but rather to incompetent handling of the bound Ca2+ following ATP utilization. These results demonstrate that the acidic and amidated residues within the stalk region do not constitute the high affinity Ca2+-binding sites whose occupancy is required for enzyme activation. They may, however, act to sequester cytoplasmic Ca2+ and to channel it to domains that are involved in enzyme activation and cation translocation. Simultaneous mutation of 4 glutamate residues to alanine in the lumenal loop between transmembrane sequences M1 and M2 did not affect Ca2+ transport activity, indicating that acidic residues in this lumenal loop do not play an essential role in Ca2+ transport. Similarly, mutation of Glu192 and Asp196 in the β-strand domain between stalk helices 2 and 3 did not affect Ca2+ transport activity, although mutation of Asp196 did diminish expression of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1550698494,"The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, cyclin) was originally defined as a nuclear protein whose appearance correlated with the proliferative state of the cell. It is now known to be a co-factor of DNA polymerase delta and to be necessary for DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. cDNA clones of human PCNA have been isolated and, using one of these cDNA, we have now obtained from a lambda phage library a clone containing the entire human PCNA gene and flanking sequences. The human PCNA gene is a unique copy gene and has 6 exons. It spans, from the cap site to the poly(A) signal 4961 base pairs. We have identified, in the 5'-flanking sequence, a region with promoter activity, a well as other structural elements common to other promoters. An interesting feature of the PCNA gene is the presence of extensive sequence similarities among introns and between introns and exons."

https://openalex.org/W2132172516,"Drosophila homeodomain proteins bind to specific DNA sequences in vitro and are hypothesized to regulate the transcription of other genes during development. Using a cotransfection assay, we have shown that homeodomain proteins encoded by the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) and the segmentation gene fushi tarazu, as well as a hybrid homeodomain protein, are activators of transcription from specific promoters in cultured Drosophila cells. Sequences downstream of the Antp P1 and Ultrabithorax transcription start sites mediate the observed activation. A TAA-rich DNA sequence to which the Antp protein binds in vitro is sufficient to confer regulation on a heterologous promoter. The results demonstrate that homeodomain proteins are transcriptional regulators in vivo and that in cultured cells, different homeodomain-containing proteins can act upon a common sequence to modulate gene transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2088265709,"NON-INDIGENOUS African honey bees have invaded most of South and Central America in just over 30 years1. The genetic composition of this population and the means by which it rapidly colonizes new territory remain controversial. In particular, it has been unclear whether this 'Africanized' population has resulted from interbreeding between African and domestic European bees, or is an essentially pure African population. Also, it has not been known whether this population expanded primarily by female or by male migration. Restriction site mapping of 62 mitochondrial DNAs of African bees from Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico reveals that 97% were of African (Apis mellifera scutellata) type. Although neotropical European apiary populations are rapidly Africanized by mating with neotropical African males, there is little reciprocal gene flow to the neotropical African population through European females. These are the first genetic data to indicate that the neotropical African population could be expanding its range by female migration."
https://openalex.org/W1580174349,"Phospholipase C (PL-C) mediates transduction of neurotransmitter signals across membranes via hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), leading to generation of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. In this study, dopamine-1 (DA-1) but not dopamine-2 (DA-2) agonists were shown to stimulate PL-C activity in renal cortical membranes. The DA-1 agonist, SKF 82526, stimulated the release of inositol phosphates from renal cortical membranes prelabeled with [3H]myoinositol. The majority of the label (75%) was found in phosphatidylinositol followed by PIP2 (15%) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (10%). A DA-1 specific effect on PL-C activity was also observed in an in vitro assay of PL-C activity in renal cortical membranes and basolateral and brush border membranes using [3H]PIP2 as the substrate. Dopamine and SKF 82526 stimulated the release of inositol phosphates from added [3H]PIP2 in a concentration-dependent manner. This release was blocked by the DA-1 antagonist SCH 23390 but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and prazosin. In contrast, the DA-2 agonist LY 171555 had no effect on inositol phosphate release. Guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate enhanced while guanyl-5'-yl thiophosphate attenuated the DA-1 agonist-stimulated PL-C activity. PL-C activity as measured by [3H]PIP2 hydrolysis had a pH optimum of 6.5, was inhibited by Mg2+ concentrations above 1 mM, was linear with time and protein concentration, and was sensitive to phosphatidylserine and calcium concentrations. We conclude that PL-C is activated by DA-1 but not DA-2 agonists in renal cortical membranes as well as both the basolateral and brush border renal tubular membranes. It is speculated that this action may mediate the natriuretic effects of dopamine in renal tubular epithelia."

https://openalex.org/W1572389160,"Abstract The complete cDNA sequence of a mitochondrial protein from Chinese hamster ovary cells, designated P1, which was originally identified as a microtubule-related protein (Gupta, R.S., Ho, T.K.W., Moffat, M.R.K., and Gupta, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 1071-1078), has been determined. The P1 cDNA encodes a protein of 60,983 Da including a 26-amino acid putative mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N-terminal end. The deduced amino acid sequence of Chinese hamster P1 shows 97% identity to the human P1 protein. Most interestingly, the amino acid sequences of mammalian P1 proteins show extensive sequence homology (42-60% identical residues and an additional 15-25% conservative replacements) to the family of bacterial, yeast, and plant proteins (viz. groEL protein of Escherichia coli, hsp 60 protein of yeast, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase subunit binding protein of plant chloroplasts) and to the 60-65-kDa major antigenic protein of mycobacteria and Coxiella burnetii. The homology between mammalian P1 and other proteins begins after the putative mitochondrial presequence and extends up to the C-terminal end. Furthermore, similar to the chaperonin family of proteins, P1 appears to exist in cells as a homooligomeric complex of seven subunits and shows ATPase activity. These observations strongly indicate that P1 protein is a member of the chaperonin family and that it may be involved in a similar function in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1543879567,"The S-type α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) deficiency allele differs from the normal M1(Val213) allele by a single amino acid substitution (Glu264 → Val). To evaluate the molecular pathophysiology responsible for the reduced serum levels of al AT associated with the S-type allele, α1AT gene expression was examined in blood monocytes, cells which normally produce α1AT, as well as murine fibroblasts modified by retroviral gene transfer to express the S-type and normal M-type human α1AT genes. Northern analysis and S1 protection analysis demonstrated that monocytes of M and S homozygotes both express 1.8-kilobase α1AT mRNA transcripts in comparable levels and similar in structure. Pulse-chase labeling studies demonstrated that both M and S monocytes synthesized and secreted a 52-kDa protein, but the S monocytes secreted significantly less. The cellular lysates of both M and S monocytes contained a newly synthesized 50-kDa precursor form of α1AT, but the S monocytes contained reduced amounts. Pulse-chase labeling in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of core oligosaccharide addition, demonstrated that S monocytes exhibited a selective inhibition of secretion of 45-kDa nonglycosylated α1AT not observed in M monocytes. Consistent with these observations, murine fibroblasts modified by retroviral gene transfer to contain an integrated human S-type α1AT cDNA demonstrated reduced secretion of α1AT compared with fibroblasts containing an integrated human M-type α1 AT cDNA and also reproduced the abnormality of α1AT biosynthesis observed with S-type monocytes. Furthermore, in the presence of leupeptin, an inhibitor of cellular proteinases, the S-type modified fibroblasts demonstrated a selective augmentation of human α1AT secretion not observed for the M-type. Together, these observations are consistent with the concept that the single A → T mutation of the S-type α1AT gene results in reduced cellular secretion of α1AT because the newly synthesized S-type α1AT protein is degraded intracellularly prior to secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1983556489,"The Ubx and abd-A gene products are required for proper development of thoracic and abdominal structures in Drosophila. We expressed LexA-Ubx and LexA-abdA fusion proteins in yeast. These proteins activated expression of target genes that carried either upstream LexA operators or upstream Ubx binding sites. Both proteins contain homeodomains. Experiments with mutant fusion proteins show that the homeodomain is not required for the proteins to form dimers or enter the nucleus, and that, when DNA binding is provided by the LexA moiety, the homeodomain is not required for gene activation. Our results suggest that the homeodomain is necessary for these proteins to bind Ubx sites, but that the homeodomain does not contact DNA exactly like bacterial helix-turn-helix proteins. Finally, our data suggest that gene activation by these proteins is a simple consequence of their binding to DNA, while negative gene regulation requires that these proteins act together with other Drosophila gene products."
https://openalex.org/W44935923,"Abstract Multiple forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA were previously detected in the mammary gland (Lopez-Casillas, F., Luo, X., Kong, I.-S., and Kim, K.-H. (1989) Gene, in press). We have now established that the rat liver also contains heterogeneous acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA populations that differ in the 5'-untranslated region. In addition, the liver contains a unique form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA in which the 5'-nontranslated end differs from the species in mammary gland. The 5' end of this unique species was characterized using a procedure for cloning minute amounts of primer extension products (pAU clones). This procedure should also be useful for obtaining full length clones of other mRNAs. The DNA sequence of pAU clones indicates that this liver-specific acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA has a 315-base long untranslated region. The first 242 nucleotides replace the 5' end of the predominant acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA found in the mammary gland (FL56 type). Under lipogenic conditions the unique liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA increases and is the major species of acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA. Livers from rats fed a normal diet and the mammary glands of lactating rats do not contain detectable amounts of the pAU type mRNA. On the other hand, the epididymal adipose tissue from these animals contains mainly the pAU type and only minimal amounts of the FL56 type. The multiple forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA appear to be generated by differential splicing. In addition, transcription appears to be physiologically regulated by the use of tissue-specific acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene promoters."
https://openalex.org/W143872792,"A novel fusion gene has been created in which the expression of a dominant selectable marker, the human multidrug resistance gene, is directly linked to the expression of human adenosine deaminase cDNA.

Transfectants were selected in increasing concentrations of colchicine and found to contain multiple copies of the intact fusion gene, which is stably and efficiently expressed. A membrane-associated 210-kDa human P-glycoprotein-adenosine deaminase fusion protein is synthesized which retains function of the multidrug transporter and also exhibits adenosine deaminase activity.

https://openalex.org/W1500781972,"Abstract Many small peptide hormones are synthesized as larger precursors in which the mature hormone sequence is flanked by pairs of basic amino acids. These precursors often undergo extensive post-translational modifications; a critical step in this process is proteolytic excision of the hormone at the paired basic residues. To determine the role of paired basic amino acids as recognition signals for cleavage by processing enzymes, we investigated the heterologous expression of prosomatostatin (the pro-somatotropin release inhibiting factor (pro-SRIF). Pro-SRIF is one of the simplest peptide hormone precursors, possessing a single copy of the 14-residue SRIF peptide at its carboxyl terminus preceded by the least common pair of basic amino acids, Arg-Lys. Employing site-directed mutagenesis, we altered the paired basic cleavage site to the more common Arg-Arg and Lys-Arg residues. The native and mutated precursors were expressed in rat pituitary GH3 cells and mouse 3T3 cells using a retroviral vector. Alteration of the paired basic residues had no effect on the specificity of proteolytic cleavage as both the native and mutant precursors were processed with 70 to 80% efficiency in GH3 cells. Surprisingly, when the mutant pro-SRIFs were expressed in 3T3 cells, which do not process the native precursor, the Arg-Arg and Lys-Arg precursors were processed with 16 and 20% efficiency, respectively. The role of an acidic compartment in mediating pro-SRIF cleavage was also investigated using low concentrations of the lysosomotrophic drug Chloroquine. Twenty-five microM Chlorquine completely inhibited pro-SRIF cleavage and intracellular storage; the unprocessed precursor was secreted into the medium. We conclude that (i) exposure to an acidic compartment is required for pro-SRIF maturation, and (ii) the conformation of the processing site, rather than the composition of the basic amino acids, defines cleavage specificity by prohormone processing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1488998860,"Following loss of functional renal mass due to acute injury, there is significantly increased proliferation of tubular epithelium to replace injured and necrotic cells. In contrast, following uninephrectomy, the contralateral kidney increases in size primarily by hypertrophy, with little cellular proliferation. We and others have demonstrated only modest increases in renal protooncogene expression following uninephrectomy. In this study, we demonstrate markedly elevated expression of the protooncogenes c-fos, c-myc, c-Ki-ras, and c-Ha-ras following acute renal injury induced by a single large parenteral dose of folic acid. The expression of these genes occurs in a sequential pattern similar to that seen in proliferating cells in culture and in regenerating liver. In addition, we demonstrate elevated levels of histone H4 and beta-actin mRNAs consistent with increased cell proliferation. These data suggest that the molecular mechanisms regulating cell proliferation in the kidney are similar to those in regenerating liver and in cultured cells. In addition, it appears that these events are regulated normally after acute renal injury and following uninephrectomy, since in both instances the levels of protooncogene expression correlate with the degree of cell proliferation. This is in direct contrast to a pathologic renal condition, polycystic kidney disease, in which the level of protooncogene expression is out of proportion to the degree of cell proliferation. Further studies of the molecular correlates of acute renal injury may yield insight into the pathogenesis of this and other clinically important renal disorders."

The aim of this study was to characterize the E2-dependent SRIF receptor in comparison with the E2-independent one, which was expressed in ovariectomized rats. The following observations were obtained: 1) both of the E2-dependent and E2-independent SRIF receptors, measured with 125I-Tyr11-SRIF as a radiolabeled ligand, were enriched in the plasma membrane fraction of the cells, displaying a single class of binding site (E2-dependent: Kd, 32 pM, Bmax, 2.3 pmol/mg protein; E2-independent: Kd, 83 pM, Bmax, 0.26 pmol/mg protein). The ligand binding to both receptors was sensitive to monovalent and divalent cations, and GTP. 2) Among the SRIF analogs tested, the relative potencies of SRIF28 and its analog and cyclosomatostatin compared with SRIF were lower in the E2-dependent receptor than in the E2-independent one. 3) A cross-linking study with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azido-benzoate revealed that the molecular weight of the cross-linked E2-dependent receptor was approximately 94,000, whereas that of the E2-independent one was 82,000, irrespective of the presence of a reducing reagent. The molecular weight of SRIF receptor from normal male or female rat pituitary was similar to the E2-independent type. 4) Both types of the cross-linked SRIF receptors were solubilized by sucrose monolaurate, adsorbed to a wheat germ agglutinin-agarose column, and eluted with N-acetyl-glucosamine. 5) SRIF inhibited the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the pituitary membranes from E2-treated rats, but it did not in the E2-depleted membranes. These results demonstrate that there are at least two subtypes of SRIF receptor in the rat anterior pituitary, one of which is exclusively expressed by the treatment with E2, and that these subtypes are distinct with respect to ligand binding specificity, molecular weight, and coupling to adenylate cyclase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1524230030,"Abstract We have examined the transcriptional regulation of the rabbit myosin heavy chain (HC) beta gene by using DNA-mediated transfection experiments. To analyze the activity of the myosin HC beta promoter in a myogenic background, cultured myoblasts from 12-day-old chick embryonic breast muscle were transfected with a chimeric gene containing 781 base pairs of the promoter region fused to the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). As indicated by the transient expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, the activity of the promoter in myoblast cultures increased at least 32-fold following differentiation and was selectively inhibited when myogenesis was blocked with 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Furthermore, RNase protection experiments showed that the in vivo myosin HC beta transcriptional initiation (or cap) site was utilized in the transfected skeletal muscle cells and also that the regulation of the exogenous promoter was similar to the induction of the endogenous skeletal alpha-actin gene. The results indicated that the exogenous promoter is regulated in a tissue- and stage-specific manner. By creating progressive 5' deletions of the promoter, we showed that only the region extending -294 base pairs upstream from the cap site is necessary for the muscle-specific expression. Linker-scanner mutagenesis of this region indicated that the positive regulation in differentiated skeletal muscle is mediated by at least two distinct elements within the 5'-flanking region of the myosin HC beta gene."
https://openalex.org/W1601468536,"Abstract Somatostatin is a peptide synthesized in the pancreatic islets, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and thyroid gland. Factors that control islet cell-specific expression of the somatostatin gene were analyzed by expression of fusion genes consisting of 5' rat somatostatin gene sequences linked to coding sequences of the receptor genes, bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and human growth hormone. Fusion genes containing 900 and 250 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking DNA were preferentially expressed at 5-10-fold higher levels in somatostatin-producing islet cell lines, as compared with islet cell lines that produced insulin and glucagon, and in three non-islet cell lines. A deletional mutation consisting of only 65 bp of 5'-flanking sequence of the rat somatostatin gene expressed in all islet cell lines but not in non-islet lines, indicating the existence of a negative-acting islet cell-specific element located between nucleotides -250 and -65. The 65-bp sequence contains the octameric cAMP-responsive enhancer (CRE) TGACGTCA (nucleotides -48 to -41). Fine mapping of sequences responsible for islet-specific expression by substitution of synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes revealed full retention of expression by deletion to nucleotides -48 and complete loss of expression at nucleotides -42 of the CRE. Substitution of the 9 bp adjacent 3' to the CRE of the somatostatin gene (nucleotides -40 to -32) with the corresponding sequence located 3' to the CRE of the glucagon gene abolished expression. By gel mobility shift and DNaseI footprinting analyses, proteins in extracts of islet cells bound to the 24 bp including the CRE and downstream adjacent 9 bp (nucleotides -58 to -35). An additional upstream region of DNA was protected from DNase I digestion (nucleotides -110 to -80). Proteins from non-islet cells bound to the region from nucleotides -58 to -35, but patterns of DNase I protection differed from those using proteins from islet cells. These observations indicate that several DNA-binding proteins interact with cis-acting elements located between 35 and 58 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of the rat somatostatin gene to determine islet cell-specific gene expression. CRE-binding protein(s) is ubiquitous among phenotypically different cells, and expression of the somatostatin gene in non-somatostatin-producing islet cells appears to be inhibited by a negative-acting element located upstream of the CRE."
https://openalex.org/W1593301417,"Abstract An endopeptidase that converts the opioid peptide dynorphin B (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-aRg-Gln-Phe-Lys-Val-Val-Thr) to its bioactive fragment Leu-enkephalin-Arg6 was isolated from bovine spinal cord. The enzyme was purified about 230-fold from a concentrated spinal cord extract. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it stained as a protein of Mr 55,000. The purified enzyme is optimally active at around pH7 and has essential thiol groups. It appears to be highly specific for dynorphin B (Km = 11 microM) but not for alpha-neoendorphin or dynorphin A, two other opioids included in the prodynorphin precursor. From its specificity, molecular size, and inhibitory spectrum, this enzyme is different from other known dynorphin-converting or -degrading enzymes and appears to be a unique and novel endoprotease."
https://openalex.org/W1555713326,"Prosomatostatin (pro-SS) is a peptide of 92 amino acids which contains the extensively studied somatostatin (SS) 1-28 and SS 1-14 at the C terminus. Little is known about the N-terminal part of pro-SS. In previous studies, using a radioimmunoassay against pro-SS 20-36 (sequence deduced from human cDNA sequence) we have identified a peptide with a molecular mass of approximately 8000 daltons in extracts of pancreas and intestinal mucosa. Using a variety of chromatographic procedures we have now isolated this peptide from extracts of pancreas and intestinal mucosa from pigs. The isolated peptides were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems gas phase sequenator and cleaved with the Asp-N endopeptidase for sequencing of C-terminal fragments. The peptides had an amino acid sequence identical to human pro-SS 1-64. In effluent from isolated perfused preparations of porcine small intestine and pancreas we identified upon appropriate stimulation pro-SS 20-36 immunoreactive peptides that by isocratic high pressure liquid chromatography appeared identical to pro-SS 1-64. An identical peptide was identified in pig plasma. Thus, in pancreas and gut pro-SS processing gives rise to the same pro-SS 1-64 molecule in spite of differential processing of the C terminus (SS 1-14 in pancreas and SS 1-28 in gut). The eventual hormonal role of pro-SS 1-64 may now be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1586900743,"Abstract gamma-Glutamate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the pathway from glutamate to proline, has been postulated to convert glutamate to a gamma-activated form (possibly gamma-glutamyl phosphate), which is reduced by a NADPH-linked reductase to yield glutamate gamma-semialdehyde (in equilibrium with delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate). In the present work we found that the kinase, in the absence or presence of the reductase (and in the absence of NADPH), catalyzes stoichiometric formation of 5-oxo-L-proline and Pi from L-glutamate and ATP, but catalyzes hydroxamate formation at only about 10% of the rate of ATP-cleavage. A new substrate of the kinase was found; thus, cis-cycloglutamate (cis-1-amino-1,3-dicarboxycyclohexane), a glutamate analog which cannot cyclize to form an analog of 5-oxoproline, interacts effectively with the kinase. The trans form of cycloglutamate does not interact with the kinase; only the cis form can assume a diequatorial conformation equivalent to the extended conformation of glutamate. cis-Cycloglutamyl phosphate formation was shown and evidence was obtained for formation of an enzyme-ADP-cycloglutamyl phosphate complex. Although cis-cycloglutamyl phosphate is not a reducible substrate of the NADPH-dependent reductase, the findings indicate that it interacts with the reductase. These studies, which elucidate several aspects of the mechanism of the utilization of glutamate for formation of delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, support the hypothesis that the kinase and reductase function as an enzyme complex. A model is suggested in which gamma-glutamyl phosphate formed on the kinase interacts with the reductase to form a gamma-glutamyl-reductase complex, which is reduced by NADPH to yield glutamate gamma-semialdehyde."

https://openalex.org/W1524109265,"Abstract Incorporation of asparagine synthetase-specific monoclonal antibodies into L5178Y D10/R (L-asparaginase-resistant) murine lymphoma cells by osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles was used to evaluate the potential of the technique for macromolecular incorporation for metabolic studies. Nonspecific effects of the incorporation procedure included temporary inhibition of protein and DNA synthesis by 80-85% and a transitory loss of membrane integrity. Cells incorporated with an antibody inhibitory to tumor cell asparagine synthetase showed increased dependence upon an exogenous source of asparagine in the culture medium, while cells incorporated with a control antibody were not affected. These studies demonstrated that incorporation of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies into cells can be used to study the short term metabolic role of specific enzymes; however, the metabolic effects induced by the specific macromolecule must be evaluated within the context of the nonspecific effects caused by the osmotic treatment required for incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1608058439,"A glutamate-binding protein was solubilized from rat brain synaptic plasma membranes using sodium cholate. Its properties were characterized after addition of exogenous phospholipids and formation of proteoliposomes. Glutamate binding was dependent on calcium and chloride ions with maximal binding at concentrations of 10(-5) M calcium and 10 mM chloride ions. The effects of the two ions were synergistic rather than additive. In addition, glutamate binding was not affected by inhibitors specific for N-methyl-D-aspartate and kainate receptor subtypes, but was inhibited by quisqualate (Ki = 50 microM) and DL-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (Ki = 1.3 mM). Furthermore, binding was abolished by 100 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and 1 mM dithiothreitol. These properties resemble those of the chloride- and calcium-dependent binding site. Starting from the detergent extract, the glutamate-binding protein was purified 123-fold using fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on hydroxyapatite and on DEAE-Sephacel as sequential purification steps. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified protein fraction showed two major bands migrating with Mr values of 51,000 and 105,000. The properties of the partially purified binding protein were similar to those of the detergent extract. Glutamate binding to the partially purified protein is not due to a sequestration process or product binding to N-acetylated alpha-linked dipeptidase. Thus, the functional role of the binding protein remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W2395765463,"The c-raf-1 oncogene is located at chromosome 3p25, near a region known to be specifically deleted in patients with renal cell carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). From cytogenetic analyses of SCLC cell lines, we have estimated that one c-raf-1 allele was deleted in approximately 80% of the cases. However, c-raf-1 was generally thought to be distal to the most common deletion in SCLC, 3p14-23. Using restriction site polymorphisms (RFLPs) located within the c-raf-1 locus, we have examined DNA from 84 human lung carcinomas. In an analysis of 11 paired (normal versus tumor) SCLC DNA samples, all five informative cases showed loss of heterozygosity at this locus in the corresponding tumor sample. Analysis of 73 unpaired lung carcinoma DNAs showed that out of 31 non-SCLC samples, 19% were heterozygous for the BglI polymorphism and 25% showed heterozygosity with TaqI. However, all of the 42 SCLC samples were homozygous for both of these RFLPs. This striking loss of heterozygosity at the c-raf-1 locus in SCLC indicates that one allele of c-raf-1 is deleted in SCLC. The kinase activity of the c-raf protein appears to be constitutively activated in these cells. Whether this apparent activation results from genetic or epigenetic events is under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W294354477,"The small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor which is transported into the chloroplast. During or after transport the precursor is processed to its mature size by removal of an amino-terminal transit peptide. Eight small subunits and eight large subunits (synthesized in the chloroplast) assemble to form the holoenzyme. We have expressed the precursor of the small subunit in Escherichia coli as a fusion to the carboxyl terminus of staphylococcal protein A'. The fusion protein was recovered from the bacterial lysate by chromatography on IgG-agarose. A 58-kDa protein copurified with the fusion protein in approximately equal amounts. Much less of the 58-kDa protein copurified with a fusion in which the transit peptide was deleted, and it did not copurify with protein A'. The 58-kDa protein was identified as the E. coli groEL gene product with antibodies directed against a homologous mitochondrial heat shock protein. This finding is particularly interesting because a chloroplast protein involved in the assembly of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase also is homologous to the groEL protein. These homologs could modulate protein-protein interactions during folding and assembly of subunits into native complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1523315413,"Abstract Chemical modification studies with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate have indicated that lysine(s) appear to be at or near the active site of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase (Colanduoni, J., and Villafranca, J. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15042-15050; Whitley, E. J., Jr., and Ginsburg, A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7017-7025). Enzyme samples were prepared that contained approximately 1, approximately 2, and approximately 3 pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate residues/50,000-Da monomer; the activity of each sample was 100, 25, and 14% of the activity of unmodified enzyme, respectively. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of each enzyme sample was performed, the peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography, and the peptides containing pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate were identified by their absorbance at 320 nm. These isolated peptides were analyzed for amino acid composition and sequenced. The N terminus of the protein (a serine residue) was modified by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at a stoichiometry of approximately 1/50,000 Da and this modified enzyme had full catalytic activity. Beyond a stoichiometry of approximately 1, lysines 383 and 352 reacted with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and each modification results in a partial loss of activity. When various combinations of substrates and substrate analogs (ADP/Pi or L-methionine-SR-sulfoximine phosphate/ADP) were used to protect the enzyme from modification, Lys-352 was protected from modification indicating that this residue is at the active site. Under all experimental conditions employed, Lys-47, which reacts with the ATP analog 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-adenosine does not react with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate."
