https://openalex.org/W2744089492,"The purpose of this study was to examine human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV vaccine knowledge, attitudes, and uptake in college students and to identify factors associated with vaccination status utilizing the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM). The sample included 383 undergraduates from a public university who participated in February and March 2015. Students were emailed an anonymous online survey assessing knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions related to HPV and HPV vaccination, as well as their stage in the PAPM regarding vaccination completion. Significantly more females (47.3%) than males (15.8%) were vaccinated. While most students had basic knowledge of HPV, they had low perceptions of their susceptibility to contract HPV. Most unvaccinated students were in the early stages of decision-making related to vaccination. Campus health centers have an opportunity to increase HPV vaccination rates. This study indicates that students need prompts from providers, as well as education regarding susceptibility to HPV."
https://openalex.org/W2744782538,"The ability of the FdsABG formate dehydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator (formerly known as Ralstonia eutropha) to catalyze the reverse of the physiological reaction, the reduction of CO2 to formate utilizing NADH as electron donor, has been investigated. Contrary to previous studies of this enzyme, we demonstrate that it is in fact effective in catalyzing the reverse reaction with a kcat of 11 ± 0.4 s−1. We also quantify the stoichiometric accumulation of formic acid as the product of the reaction and demonstrate that the observed kinetic parameters for catalysis in the forward and reverse reactions are thermodynamically consistent, complying with the expected Haldane relationships. Finally, we demonstrate the reaction conditions necessary for gauging the ability of a given formate dehydrogenase or other CO2-utilizing enzyme to catalyze the reverse direction to avoid false negative results. In conjunction with our earlier studies on the reaction mechanism of this enzyme and on the basis of the present work, we conclude that all molybdenum- and tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenases and related enzymes likely operate via a simple hydride transfer mechanism and are effective in catalyzing the reversible interconversion of CO2 and formate under the appropriate experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2744256399,"For over a century, enzymatic activity has been studied in vitro, assuming similar activity in the crowded cellular milieu. Here, we determined in real time the catalytic activity of TEM1-β-lactamase inside living cells and compared the values to those obtained in vitro. We found the apparent in vivo catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, to be lower than in vitro, with significant cell-to-cell variability. Surprisingly, the results show that inside the cell the apparent catalytic efficiency decreases, and Km increases with increasing enzyme concentration. To rationalize these findings, we measured enzyme and substrate diffusion rates in the cell and found the latter to be slower than expected. Simulations showed that for attenuated diffusion the substrate flux becomes rate-limiting, explaining why reaction rates in vivo can be independent on enzyme concentrations. The octanol/water partition of the substrate is 4.5, which is in the range of Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs. This suggests substrate-limited reaction rates to be common. These findings indicate that in vitro data cannot be simply extrapolated to the crowded in vivo environment."

This study compared effects of facilitated case conferencing (FCC) with usual care (UC) on end-of-life care.A two arm parallel cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted. The sample included people with advanced dementia from 20 Australian nursing homes and their families and professional caregivers. In each intervention nursing home (n = 10), Palliative Care Planning Coordinators (PCPCs) facilitated family case conferences and trained staff in person-centred palliative care for 16 hours per week over 18 months. The primary outcome was family-rated quality of end-of-life care (End-of-Life Dementia [EOLD] Scales). Secondary outcomes included nurse-rated EOLD scales, resident quality of life (Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia [QUALID]) and quality of care over the last month of life (pharmacological/non-pharmacological palliative strategies, hospitalization or inappropriate interventions).Two-hundred-eighty-six people with advanced dementia took part but only 131 died (64 in UC and 67 in FCC which was fewer than anticipated), rendering the primary analysis under-powered with no group effect seen in EOLD scales. Significant differences in pharmacological (P < 0.01) and non-pharmacological (P < 0.05) palliative management in last month of life were seen. Intercurrent illness was associated with lower family-rated EOLD Satisfaction with Care (coefficient 2.97, P < 0.05) and lower staff-rated EOLD Comfort Assessment with Dying (coefficient 4.37, P < 0.01). Per protocol analyses showed positive relationships between EOLD and staff hours to bed ratios, proportion of residents with dementia and staff attitudes.FCC facilitates a palliative approach to care. Future trials of case conferencing should consider outcomes and processes regarding decision making and planning for anticipated events and acute illness.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12612001164886."
https://openalex.org/W2743797500,"Populations in Latin America, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly ageing. The extent to which traditional systems of family support and security can manage the care of increased numbers of older people with chronic health problems is unclear. Our aim was to explore the social and economic effects of caring for an older dependent person, including insight into pathways to economic vulnerability.We carried out a series of household case studies across urban and rural sites in Peru, Mexico, China and Nigeria (n = 24), as part of a cross-sectional study, nested within the 10/66 Dementia Research Group cohort. Case studies consisted of in-depth narrative style interviews (n = 60) with multiple family members, including the older dependent person.Governments were largely uninvolved in the care and support of older dependent people, leaving families to negotiate a 'journey without maps'. Women were de facto caregivers but the traditional role of female relative as caregiver was beginning to be contested. Household composition was flexible and responsive to changing needs of multiple generations but family finances were stretched.Governments are lagging behind sociodemographic and social change. There is an urgent need for policy frameworks to support and supplement inputs from families. These should include community-based and residential care services, disability benefits and carers allowances. Further enhancement of health insurance schemes and scale-up of social pensions are an important component of bolstering the security of dependent older people and supporting their continued social and economic participation."
https://openalex.org/W2743657615,"As a chronic illness derived from hair cells of the inner ear, Menière's disease (MD) negatively influences the quality of life of individuals and leads to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, temporary hearing loss, and tinnitus. The complete identification of novel genes related to MD would help elucidate its underlying pathological mechanisms and improve its diagnosis and treatment. In this study, a network-based method was developed to identify novel MD-related genes based on known MD-related genes. A human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the PPI information reported in the STRING database. A classic ranking algorithm, the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm, was employed to search for novel genes using known genes as seed nodes. To make the identified genes more reliable, a series of screening tests, including a permutation test, an interaction test and an enrichment test, were designed to select essential genes from those obtained by the RWR algorithm. As a result, several inferred genes, such as CD4, NOTCH2 and IL6, were discovered. Finally, a detailed biological analysis was performed on fifteen of the important inferred genes, which indicated their strong associations with MD."
https://openalex.org/W2744188019,"Differences among fatty acids (FAs) in chain length and number of double bonds create lipid diversity. FA elongation proceeds via a four-step reaction cycle, in which the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases (HACDs) HACD1–4 catalyze the third step. However, the contribution of each HACD to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase activity in certain tissues or in different FA elongation pathways remains unclear. HACD1 is specifically expressed in muscles and is a myopathy-causative gene. Here, we generated Hacd1 KO mice and observed that these mice had reduced body and skeletal muscle weights. In skeletal muscle, HACD1 mRNA expression was by far the highest among the HACDs. However, we observed only an ∼40% reduction in HACD activity and no changes in membrane lipid composition in Hacd1-KO skeletal muscle, suggesting that some HACD activities are redundant. Moreover, when expressed in yeast, both HACD1 and HACD2 participated in saturated and monounsaturated FA elongation pathways. Disruption of HACD2 in the haploid human cell line HAP1 significantly reduced FA elongation activities toward both saturated and unsaturated FAs, and HACD1 HACD2 double disruption resulted in a further reduction. Overexpressed HACD3 exhibited weak activity in saturated and monounsaturated FA elongation pathways, and no activity was detected for HACD4. We therefore conclude that HACD1 and HACD2 exhibit redundant activities in a wide range of FA elongation pathways, including those for saturated to polyunsaturated FAs, with HACD2 being the major 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase.

Differences in chain length and the number and position of double bonds generate diversity in FAs and lipids. Most cellular FAs are long-chain FAs (LCFAs; C11–C20), among which C16 and C18 LCFAs are especially abundant. FAs of length ≥C21 are called very-long-chain FAs (VLCFAs). Although the cellular quantities of VLCFAs are much lower than those of LCFAs, VLCFAs possess characteristic functions that cannot be performed by LCFAs.

FAs are elongated via the FA elongation cycle in the endoplasmic reticulum, using acyl-CoA as a substrate. In each cycle, the FA chain length is increased by two carbon units. The FA elongation cycle consists of four distinct reactions (condensation, reduction, dehydration, and reduction), and the enzymes involved are conserved among eukaryotes (6Kihara A.

Parvari R. Congenital myopathy is caused by mutation of HACD1.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22: 5229-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hacd1 KO mice also exhibit a myopathic phenotype, with reduced body weight, muscle mass, muscle force, and muscle fiber diameter (31Blondelle J. Ohno Y. Gache V. Guyot S. Storck S.

Biol. 2015; 7: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During myogenesis, myoblasts are fused into multinucleated myotubes, followed by maturation into myofibers. The fusion process is retarded in Hacd1 KO myoblasts (31Blondelle J. Ohno Y. Gache V. Guyot S. Storck S. Blanchard-Gutton N. Barthélémy I. Walmsley G. Rahier A. Gadin S. Maurer M. Guillaud L. Prola A. Ferry A. Aubin-Houzelstein G. et al.HACD1, a regulator of membrane composition and fluidity, promotes myoblast fusion and skeletal muscle growth.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 7: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to identify as-yet-undetermined substrate specificities of HACDs. For this purpose, we performed lipidomics analyses on newly generated Hacd1 KO mice. Furthermore, the 3-OH acyl-CoA dehydratase activity of each HACD was investigated by FA elongation assay, in which commercially available acyl-CoAs/FAs were used as substrates, instead of direct measurement of 3-OH acyl-CoA dehydratase activity using 3-OH acyl-CoA substrates. Our results indicate that HACD1 and HACD2 exhibit broad substrate specificities. They are active toward saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated 3-OH acyl-CoAs of long- to very long-chain FAs, with HACD2 exhibiting greater activity than HACD1. In contrast, HACD3 showed only weak activity in saturated and monounsaturated FA elongation pathways, and no HACD4 activity was detected. To reveal the substrate specificity of HACD1 and the pathogenesis of the myopathy caused by HACD1 mutations, Hacd1 KO mice were created. HACD/Phs1 family members contain the active-site residues Tyr and Glu within the fifth transmembrane segment (32Kihara A. Sakuraba H. Ikeda M. Denpoh A. Igarashi Y. Membrane topology and essential amino acid residues of Phs1, a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase involved in very long-chain fatty acid elongation.J. Biol.

Identification of residues important for the catalysis, structure maintenance, and substrate specificity of yeast 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase Phs1.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The Hacd1 KO construct was designed to replace exon 6, which encodes the active-site residues, with a neomycin-resistant gene (Fig. 2A). Gene disruption was confirmed by genomic PCR (Fig. 2B). The Hacd1 KO mice exhibited smaller body size (Fig. 2C) and reduced body and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) weight at 1 and 6 months of age (Fig. 2, D and E), compared with the control mice, as has been reported previously (31Blondelle J. Ohno Y. Gache V. Guyot S. Storck S. Blanchard-Gutton N. Barthélémy I. Walmsley G. Rahier A. Gadin S. Maurer M. Guillaud L. Prola A. Ferry A. Aubin-Houzelstein G. et al.HACD1, a regulator of membrane composition and fluidity, promotes myoblast fusion and skeletal muscle growth.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 7: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In WT skeletal muscle, expression levels of HACD1 mRNA were much higher than those of other HACDs (Fig. 3A). However, the reductions in the 3-OH acyl-CoA dehydratase activity toward 3-OH palmitoyl-CoA in skeletal muscles of Hacd1 heterozygous KO (Hacd1+/−) and Hacd1 homozygous KO (Hacd1−/−) mice relative to WT mice were relatively small (∼20% reduction in Hacd1+/− mice and ∼40% reduction in Hacd1−/− mice; Fig. 3B). No compensatory increases in HACD2, HACD3, or HACD4 mRNA levels were observed in the Hacd1 KO skeletal muscle (Fig. 3C). Next, we examined the effect of Hacd1 gene disruption on the product levels. Because the acyl-CoA products elongated via the FA elongation cycle are mainly used for membrane lipid synthesis, we measured the levels of three major lipid classes in skeletal muscle by liquid chromatography (LC)–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). These were the sphingolipid sphingomyelin (Fig. 3D) and the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 3E) and phosphatidylinositol (Fig. 3F). There were no differences in the levels of these lipids among WT (Hacd1+/+), Hacd1 heterozygous KO (Hacd1+/−), and Hacd1 homozygous KO (Hacd1−/−) mice, irrespective of chain lengths (Fig. 3, D–F). To further examine the effect of Hacd1 gene disruption on the FA elongation cycle, myoblasts were prepared from WT and Hacd1 KO mice. After differentiation into myotube cells, they were incubated with deuterium (d)-labeled FAs for 24 h, and their metabolism was traced by LC-MS/MS analysis. Exogenously added FAs are metabolized to other FAs via elongation and/or desaturation within cells (Fig. 4A). When cells were labeled with d31-palmitic acid (C16:0-COOH) (palmitic acid with 31 deuteriums (d31)), d31-labeled saturated and monounsaturated C16–C26 FAs were detected in WT cells (Fig. 4B). Almost no differences were observed in the compositions of d31-labeled FAs between WT and Hacd1 KO cells. Furthermore, tracer analyses using d9-oleic acid (C18:1–COOH) indicated that d9-oleic acid metabolism was indistinguishable between WT and Hacd1 KO cells (Fig. 4C). Mammals cannot produce n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated FAs endogenously, due to a lack of FA Δ12 desaturase and FA Δ15 desaturase, and must therefore obtain these FAs from foods. Food-derived polyunsaturated FAs are subjected to repetitive elongation and desaturation in cells and are converted to other polyunsaturated FAs (Fig. 4A). d11-Linoleic acid (C18:2(n-6)-COOH) (Fig. 4D) and d5-α-linolenic acid (C18:3(n-3)-COOH) labeling (Fig. 4E) experiments revealed that these FAs were metabolized similarly in WT and Hacd1 KO cells. Thus, disruption of Hacd1 gene had no apparent effects on membrane lipid composition or the FA elongation cycle. Relatively weak effects on the 3-OH acyl-CoA dehydratase activity as a result of Hacd1 gene KO (Fig. 3B) suggest redundancy among the HACDs. We previously reported that ectopic expression of HACD1 or HACD2 in a PHS1-shutoff yeast strain complemented growth defects, whereas neither HACD3 nor HACD4 exhibited such activity (26Ikeda M. Kanao Y. Yamanaka M. Sakuraba H. Mizutani Y. Igarashi Y. Kihara A. Characterization of four mammalian 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases involved in very long-chain fatty acid synthesis.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In WT yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the VLCFAs are almost exclusively C26:0 (34Ejsing C.S. Sampaio J.L. Surendranath V. Duchoslav E. Ekroos K. Klemm R.W. Simons K. Shevchenko A. Global analysis of the yeast lipidome by quantitative shotgun mass spectrometry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2136-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), whereas the production of at least some C24:0 VLCFAs is necessary for normal growth (11Ohno Y. Suto S. Yamanaka M. Mizutani Y. Mitsutake S. Igarashi Y. Sassa T. Kihara A. ELOVL1 production of C24 acyl-CoAs is linked to C24 sphingolipid synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18439-18444Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Consequently, the results of the growth complementation analysis suggest that both HACD1 and HACD2 possess the ability to produce C24:0 or longer VLCFAs, and therefore that there is some redundancy in their function. We first examined the activity of HACD1 and HACD2 in the saturated FA elongation pathway, using a yeast system. To minimize the endogenous 3-OH acyl-CoA dehydratase activity, we created phs1Δ htd2Δ cells expressing human ceramide synthase CERS5. In these cells both yeast HACD homolog PHS1 and the mitochondrial 3-OH acyl carrier protein dehydratase HTD2 were deleted. Htd2 is a component of FA synthase type II (35Kastaniotis A.J. Autio K.J. Sormunen R.T. Hiltunen J.K. Htd2p/Yhr067p is a yeast 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase essential for mitochondrial function and morphology.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1407-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because VLCFA production is essential for yeast growth, any genes involved in FA elongation, including PHS1, cannot be deleted under normal conditions (4Denic V. Weissman J.S. A molecular caliper mechanism for determining very long-chain fatty acid length.Cell. 2007; 130: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In yeast, most VLCFAs are used for sphingolipid synthesis, and the lethality of the VLCFA-deficient cells can be attributed to the loss of sphingolipid production due to the substrate specificity of yeast ceramide synthases. Therefore, genes of the FA elongation machinery can be deleted if yeast cells are engineered to produce ceramides/sphingolipids, such as by ectopic expression of the human ceramide synthase CERS5, which uses LCFAs for ceramide synthesis (36Wakashima T. Abe K. Kihara A. Dual functions of the trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase TER in the sphingosine 1-phosphate metabolic pathway and in fatty acid elongation.J. Biol.

Phs1, HACD1, or HACD2 was expressed as triple FLAG (3xFLAG)-tagged protein in the phs1Δ htd2Δ/CERS5 cells. Expression levels of HACD2 were the highest, and those of Phs1 were the lowest (Fig. 5A).

Multi stage sampling technique was used to select a total of 504 preschool children. Data were collected using structured interviewer administered questionnaire and anthropometric measurements. Data were entered using Epidata version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20 and WHO 2007 Anthro version 2.0.4 software. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify associated factors. P values <0.05 with 95% confidence level were used to declare statistical significance.A total of 500 study participants were included with 99.2% response rate and 51.6% were girls while 48.4% were boys. The mean (±SD) age of participants was 47.68 ±7.19 months. The combined prevalence of overweight /obesity was 13.8% (95%CI; 10.6, 17.2) the specific being 9.6% for overweight and 4.2% for obesity. The multivariable analysis indicated that the age group between 36-47 months [AOR = 2.38 (95%CI; 1.27,4.46)],high dietary diversity[AOR = 3.73(95%CI;1.15,12.54),consumption of sweet food[AOR = 2.69 (95%CI,1.21, 5.98)],time spent in watching television>2hr/day [AOR = 4.01 (95%CI;2.22, 7.26)] and mother's education at secondary level [AOR = 0.35 (95% CI; 0.12, 0.96)] were associated with overweight/obesity among preschool children.Once considered a high income country problem, result of this study in urban city like Gondar reveals that overweight/obesity is on the rise in urban Ethiopia, which indicates the need for formulating preventive programs and policies during a child's early years."

Fifty-one percent of the cases had PSI IV-V. Twenty-one (8%) died within 30-days after admission. The analysis of the TTP showed that the first quartile of the TTP (9.2h) was the best cut-off for differentiating 2 groups of patients at risk, early (TTP <9.2 h) and late (TTP ≥9.2 h) detection groups (AUC 0.66 [95% CI 0.53 to 0.79]). Early TTP was associated with a statistically significant risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (18% vs. 6%, p = 0.007), longer length of hospital stay (12 days vs. 8 days, p<0.001), higher in-hospital mortality (15% vs. 4%, p = 0.010), and 30-day mortality (15% vs. 5%, p = 0.018).

https://openalex.org/W2743997882,"Cancer stem cell survival is the leading factor for tumor recurrence after tumor-suppressive treatments. Therefore, specific and efficient inhibitors of cancer stemness must be discovered for reducing tumor recurrence. YM155 has been indicated to significantly reduce stemness-derived tumorsphere formation. However, the pharmaceutical mechanism of YM155 against cancer stemness is unclear. This study investigated the potential mechanism of YM155 against cancer stemness in lung cancer. Tumorspheres derived from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant HCC827 and EGFR wild-type A549 cells expressing higher cancer stemness markers (CD133, Oct4, and Nanog) were used as cancer stemness models. We observed that EGFR autophosphorylation (Y1068) was higher in HCC827- and A549-derived tumorspheres than in parental cells; this autophosphorylation induced tumorsphere formation by activating G9a-mediated stemness. Notably, YM155 inhibited tumorsphere formation by blocking the autophosphorylation of EGFR and the EGFR-G9a-mediated stemness pathway. The chemical and genetic inhibition of EGFR and G9a revealed the significant role of the EGFR-G9a pathway in maintaining the cancer stemness property. In conclusion, this study not only revealed that EGFR could trigger tumorsphere formation by elevating G9a-mediated stemness but also demonstrated that YM155 could inhibit this formation by simultaneously blocking EGFR autophosphorylation and G9a activity, thus acting as a potent agent against lung cancer stemness."

Most importantly, these conditions also contribute to the risk of maternal death. This population-based observational study proposed and evaluated the impact of expanding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) measure of severe maternal morbidity by including additional comorbidities and intensive care admissions during delivery hospitalizations and examined associated factors. A New York State linked hospitalization and birth record database was used. Study participants included all New York State female residents, ages 10 to 55 years, who delivered a live infant in a New York acute care hospital between 2008 and 2013, inclusive. Incidence trends for both severe maternal morbidity measures were evaluated longitudinally. Associations between covariates and the two severe maternal morbidity measures were examined with logistic regression models, solved using generalized estimating equations and stratified by method of delivery. The New York expanded severe maternal morbidity measure identified 34,478 cases among 1,352,600 hospital deliveries (estimated incidence 2.55%) representing a 3% increase in the number of cases compared to the CDC measure. Both estimates increased over the study period (p<0.001). Covariates with an odds ratio > 1.5 included most measured comorbidities (e.g., pregnancy-induced hypertension, placentation disorder), multiple births, preterm birth, no prenatal care, hospitalization prior to delivery, higher levels of perinatal care birthing facilities and race/ethnicity. Expanding the measure for severe maternal morbidity during delivery to capture intensive care admissions provides a more sensitive estimate of disease burden. Perinatal regionalization in New York appears effective in routing high risk pregnancies to higher levels of perinatal care birthing facilities."

Genotyping was performed using Sanger method and size of alleles, multiplicity of infection, heterogeneity and recombination rate were analyzed. Asexual stage antigens were highly polymorphic with 55 and 50 unique alleles in msp-1 and msp-2 genes, respectively. The MOI for msp-1 and msp-2 were 1.67 and 1.28 respectively. A total 59 genotype was found in glurp gene with 8 types of amino acid repeats in the conserved part of RII repeat region. The number of NANP repeats from 40 to 44 was found among 55% samples in csp gene while pfs25 was found almost conserved with only two amino acid substitution site. The level of genetic diversity in the present study population was very similar to that from Asian countries. A higher IgG response was found in the B-cell epitopes of msp-1 and csp antigens and higher level of antibodies against csp B-cell epitope and glurp antigen were recorded with increasing age groups. Significantly, higher positive responses were observed in the csp antigen among the samples with ≥42 NANP repeats. The present finding showed extensive diversity in the asexual stage antigens."

Here, using fission yeast as a model, we randomly mutagenized the subunits of the 19S proteasome subcomplex and sought to uncover a direct role of the proteasome in heterochromatin regulation. We identified a mutant allele, rpt4-1, that disrupts a non-proteolytic function of the proteasome, also known as a non-proteolytic allele. Experiments performed using rpt4-1 cells revealed that the proteasome is involved in the regulation of heterochromatin spreading to prevent its uncontrolled invasion into neighboring euchromatin regions. Intriguingly, the phenotype of the non-proteolytic rpt4-1 mutant resembled that of epe1Δ cells, which lack the Epe1 protein that counteracts heterochromatin spreading. Both mutants exhibited variegated gene-silencing phenotypes across yeast colonies, spreading of heterochromatin, bypassing of the requirement for RNAi in heterochromatin formation at the outer repeat region (otr), and up-regulation of RNA polymerase II.

These observations suggest that the 19S proteasome may be involved in modulating the activities of Epe1 and Mst2. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the proteasome appears to have a heterochromatin-regulating function that is independent of its canonical function in proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2744819874,"Mesoporous calcium-silicate nanoparticles (MCSNs) are advanced biomaterials for drug delivery and mineralization induction. They can load silver and exhibit significantly antibacterial effects. However, the effects of MCSNs and silver-loaded MCSNs on dentin are unknown. The silver (Ag) and/or zinc (Zn) incorporated MCSNs (Ag-Zn-MCSNs) were prepared by a template method, and their characterizations were tested. Then the nanoparticles were filled into root canals and their effects on the dentin were investigated. Ag-Zn-MCSNs showed characteristics of mesoporous materials and sustained release of ions over time. Ag-Zn-MCSNs adhered well to the root canal walls and infiltrated into the dentinal tubules after ultrasound activation. Ag-Zn-MCSNs showed no significantly negative effects on either the flexural strength or the modulus of elasticity of dentin, while CH decreased the flexural strength of dentin significantly (P<0.05). These findings suggested that Ag and Zn can be incorporated into MCSNs using a template method, and the Ag-Zn-MCSNs may be developed into a new disinfectant for the root canal and dentinal tubules."

The nitrogenase Fe protein cycle involves a transient association between the reduced, MgATP-bound Fe protein and the MoFe protein and includes electron transfer, ATP hydrolysis, release of Pi, and dissociation of the oxidized, MgADP-bound Fe protein from the MoFe protein. The cycle is completed by reduction of oxidized Fe protein and nucleotide exchange. Recently, a kinetic study of the nitrogenase Fe protein cycle involving the physiological reductant flavodoxin reported a major revision of the rate-limiting step from MoFe protein and Fe protein dissociation to release of Pi. Because the Fe protein cannot interact with flavodoxin and the MoFe protein simultaneously, knowledge of the interactions between flavodoxin and the different nucleotide states of the Fe protein is critically important for understanding the Fe protein cycle. Here we used time-resolved limited proteolysis and chemical cross-linking to examine nucleotide-induced structural changes in the Fe protein and their effects on interactions with flavodoxin. Differences in proteolytic cleavage patterns and chemical cross-linking patterns were consistent with known nucleotide-induced structural differences in the Fe protein and indicated that MgATP-bound Fe protein resembles the structure of the Fe protein in the stabilized nitrogenase complex structures. Docking models and cross-linking patterns between the Fe protein and flavodoxin revealed that the MgADP-bound state of the Fe protein has the most complementary docking interface with flavodoxin compared with the MgATP-bound state.

https://openalex.org/W2743229971,"Occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is age-dependent and heterogenous. Factors deciding the occurrence of POCD in patients of the same age undergone same surgeries remain unclear. Here we investigated the effects of pre-existing weakness on the occurrence of POCD in mice of the same age. Pre-existing weakness of mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (8mg/kg) and was evaluated by physical frailty index (by open field test), neuroinflammation level (by Iba1 immunostaining and inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β), and neuronal activity (by p-CREB immunostaining). POCD was induced by partial hepatolobectomy and was evaluated by puzzle box test and Morris water maze test. The brains were collected to detect the levels of neuroinflammation, synaptophysin and NMDA receptor subunits NR2A, NR2B and NR1 (by western blot), and oxidative stress (by Dihydroethidium). Compared to the normal adult mice of the same age, LPS pretreated mice had increased physical frailty index, higher levels of neuroinflammation, and lower neuronal activity. Partial hepatolobectomy induced obvious impairments in executive function, learning and memory in LPS pretreated mice after surgery, but not in normal mice of the same age. Partial hepatolobectomy also induced heightened neuroinflammation, obvious loss of NMDA receptor subunits, strong oxidative stress in LPS pretreated mice on the 1st and 3rd postoperative day. However, the POCD-associated pathological changes didn’t occur in normal mice of the same age after surgery. These results suggest that pre-existing weakness is critical for the occurrence of POCD in mice of the same age."
https://openalex.org/W2744495559,"Purpose Currently the screening for lung cancer for risk groups is based on Computed Tomography (CT) or low dose CT (LDCT); however, the lung cancer death rate has not decreased significantly with people undergoing LDCT. We aimed to develop a simple reliable blood test for early detection of all types of lung cancer based on the immunogenicity of aberrant forms of BARD1 that are specifically upregulated in lung cancer. Methods ELISA assays were performed with a panel of BARD1 epitopes to detect serum levels of antibodies against BARD1 epitopes. We tested 194 blood samples from healthy donors and lung cancer patients with a panel of 40 BARD1 antigens. Using fitted Lasso logistic regression we determined the optimal combination of BARD1 antigens to be used in ELISA for discriminating lung cancer from healthy controls. Random selection of samples for training sets or validations sets was applied to validate the accuracy of our test. Results Fitted Lasso logistic regression models predict high accuracy of the BARD1 autoimmune antibody test with an AUC = 0.96. Validation in independent samples provided and AUC = 0.86 and identical AUCs were obtained for combined stages 1–3 and late stage 4 lung cancers. The BARD1 antibody test is highly specific for lung cancer and not breast or ovarian cancer. Conclusion The BARD1 lung cancer test shows higher sensitivity and specificity than previously published blood tests for lung cancer detection and/or diagnosis or CT scans, and it could detect all types and all stages of lung cancer. This BARD1 lung cancer test could therefore be further developed as i) screening test for early detection of lung cancers in high-risk groups, and ii) diagnostic aid in complementing CT scan."
https://openalex.org/W2744846126,"Introduction One of the main reasons for disease recurrence in the curative breast cancer treatment setting is the development of drug resistance. Microtubule targeted agents (MTAs) are among the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of breaset cancer and therefore overcoming taxane resistance is of primary clinical importance. Our group has previously demonstrated that the microtubule dynamics of docetaxel-resistant MCF-7TXT cells are insensitivity to docetaxel due to the distinct expression profiles of β-tubulin isotypes in addition to the high expression of p-glycoprotein (ABCB1). In the present investigation we examined whether taxane-resistant breast cancer cells are more sensitive to microtubule destabilizing agents including vinca alkaloids and colchicine-site binding agents (CSBAs) than the non-resistant cells. Methods Two isogenic MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines were selected for resistance to docetaxel (MCF-7TXT) and the wild type parental cell line (MCF-7CC) to examine if taxane-resistant breast cancer cells are sensitive to microtubule-destabilizing agents including vinca alkaloids and CSBAs. Cytotoxicity assays, immunoblotting, indirect immunofluorescence and live imaging were used to study drug resistance, apoptosis, mitotic arrest, microtubule formation, and microtubule dynamics. Results MCF-7TXT cells were demonstrated to be cross resistant to vinca alkaloids, but were more sensitive to treatment with colchicine compared to parental non-resistant MCF-7CC cells. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that the IC50 of MCF-7TXT cell to vinorelbine and vinblastine was more than 6 and 3 times higher, respectively, than that of MCF-7CC cells. By contrast, the IC50 of MCF-7TXT cell for colchincine was 4 times lower than that of MCF-7CC cells. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that all MTAs induced the disorganization of microtubules and the chromatin morphology and interestingly each with a unique pattern. In terms of microtubule and chromain morphology, MCF-7TXT cells were more resistant to vinorelbine and vinblastine, but more sensitive to colchicine compared to MCF-7CC cells. PARP cleavage assay further demonstrated that all of the MTAs induced apoptosis of the MCF-7 cells. However, again, MCF-7TXT cells were more resistant to vinorelbine and vinblastine, and more sensitive to colchicine compared to MCF-7CC cells. Live imaging demonstrated that the microtubule dynamics of MCF-7TXT cells were less sensitive to vinca alkaloids, and more sensitive to colchicine. MCF-7TXT cells were also noted to be more sensitive to other CSBAs including 2MeOE2, ABT-751 and phosphorylated combretastatin A-4 (CA-4P). Conclusion Docetaxel-resistant MCF-7TXT cells have demonstrated cross-resistance to vinca alkaloids, but appear to be more sensitive to CSBAs (colchicine, 2MeOE2, ABT-751 and CA-4P) compared to non-resistant MCF-7CC cells. Taken together these results suggest that CSBAs should be evaluated further in the treatment of taxane resistant breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2745232313,"Prion diseases are neurodegenerative conditions characterized by the conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), an endogenous membrane glycoprotein of uncertain function, into PrPSc, a pathological isoform that replicates by imposing its abnormal folding onto PrPC molecules. A great deal of evidence supports the notion that PrPC plays at least two roles in prion diseases, by acting as a substrate for PrPSc replication, and as a mediator of its toxicity. This conclusion was recently supported by data suggesting that PrPC may transduce neurotoxic signals elicited by other disease-associated protein aggregates. Thus, PrPC may represent a convenient pharmacological target for prion diseases, and possibly other neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we sought to characterize the activity of chlorpromazine (CPZ), an antipsychotic previously shown to inhibit prion replication by directly binding to PrPC. By employing biochemical and biophysical techniques, we provide direct experimental evidence indicating that CPZ does not bind PrPC at biologically relevant concentrations. Instead, the compound exerts anti-prion effects by inducing the relocalization of PrPC from the plasma membrane. Consistent with these findings, CPZ also inhibits the cytotoxic effects delivered by a PrP mutant. Interestingly, we found that the different pharmacological effects of CPZ could be mimicked by two inhibitors of the GTPase activity of dynamins, a class of proteins involved in the scission of newly formed membrane vesicles, and recently reported as potential pharmacological targets of CPZ. Collectively, our results redefine the mechanism by which CPZ exerts anti-prion effects, and support a primary role for dynamins in the membrane recycling of PrPC, as well as in the propagation of infectious prions."
https://openalex.org/W2743064337,"Decreased cell-substratum adhesion is crucially involved in metastasis. Previous studies demonstrated that lung cancer with floating cell clusters in histology is more likely to develop metastasis. In the present study, we investigated whether cancer cells in long-term, three-dimensional low attachment cultures acquire high metastatic potential; these cells were then used to examine the mechanisms underlying metastasis. Two KRAS-mutated adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 and H441) were cultured and selected on ultra-low attachment culture dishes, and the resulting cells were defined as FL (for floating) sublines. Cancer cells were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice via an intracardiac injection, and metastasis was evaluated using luciferase-based imaging and histopathology. In vitro cell growth (in attachment or suspension cultures), migration, and invasion were assayed. A whole genomic analysis was performed to identify key molecular alterations in FL sublines. Upon detachment on low-binding dishes, parental cells initially formed rounded spheroids with limited growth activity. However, over time in cultures, cells gradually formed smaller spheroids that grew slowly, and, after 3-4 months, we obtained FL sublines that regained prominent growth potential in suspension cultures. On ordinary dishes, FL cells reattached and exhibited a more spindle-shaped morphology than parental cells. No marked differences were observed in cell growth with attachment, migration, or invasion between FL sublines and parental cell lines; however, FL cells exhibited markedly increased growth potential under suspended conditions in vitro and stronger metastatic abilities in vivo. A genomic analysis identified epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and c-Myc amplification in A549-FL and H441-FL cells, respectively, as candidate mechanisms for metastasis. The growth potential of FL cells was markedly inhibited by lentiviral ZEB1 knockdown in A549-FL cells and by the inhibition of c-Myc through lentiviral knockdown or the pharmacological inhibitor JQ1 in H441-FL cells. Long-term three-dimensional low attachment cultures may become a useful method for investigating the mechanisms underlying metastasis mediated by decreased cell-substratum adhesion."

The recognition of the health benefits of Epimedium has increased its market demand. However, its resource recycling rate is low and environmentally dependent. Furthermore, its natural sources are endangered, further increasing prices. Commercial culture can address resource constraints of it.Understanding the effects of environmental factors on the production of its active components would improve the technology for cultivation and germplasm conservation. Here, we studied the effects of light intensities on the flavonoid production and revealed the molecular mechanism using RNA-seq analysis. Plants were exposed to five levels of light intensity through the periods of germination to flowering, the flavonoid contents were measured using HPLC. Quantification of epimedin A, epimedin B, epimedin C, and icariin showed that the flavonoid contents varied with different light intensity levels. And the largest amount of epimedin C was produced at light intensity level 4 (I4). Next, the leaves under the treatment of three light intensity levels (“L”, “M” and “H”) with the largest differences in the flavonoid content, were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. Transcriptome reconstruction identified 43,657 unigenes. All unigene sequences were annotated by searching against the Nr, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. In total, 4008, 5260, and 3591 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the groups L vs. M, M vs. H and L vs. H. Particularly, twenty-one full-length genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were identified. The expression levels of the flavonol synthase, chalcone synthase genes were strongly associated with light-induced flavonoid abundance with the highest expression levels found in the H group. Furthermore, 65 transcription factors, including 31 FAR1, 17 MYB-related, 12 bHLH, and 5 WRKY, were differentially expressed after light induction. Finally, a model was proposed to explain the light-induced flavonoid production. This study provided valuable information to improve cultivation practices and produced the first comprehensive resource for E. pseudowushanense transcriptomes."
https://openalex.org/W2744605964,"Opioids modulate the tumor microenvironment with potential functional consequences for tumor growth and metastasis. We evaluated the effects of morphine administration on the circulating proteolytic profile of tumor-free mice. Serum from morphine-treated (1 or 10 mg/kg, i.p. every 12 h) or saline-treated mice was collected at different time points and tested ex vivo in endothelial, lymphatic endothelial, and breast cancer cell migration assays. Serum from mice that were treated with 10 mg/kg morphine for 3 d displayed reduced chemotactic potential for endothelial and breast cancer cells, and elicited reduced cancer cell invasion through reconstituted basement membrane compared with serum from saline controls. This was associated with decreased circulating matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and increased circulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-3/4 as assessed by zymography and reverse zymography. By using quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed morphine-induced alterations in MMP-9 and TIMP expression and identified organs, including the liver and spleen, in which these changes originated. Pharmacologic inhibition of MMP-9 abrogated the difference in chemotactic attraction between serum from saline-treated and morphine-treated mice, which indicated that reduced proteolytic ability mediated the decreased migration toward serum from morphine-treated mice. This novel mechanism may enable morphine administration to promote an environment that is less conducive to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis.-Xie, N., Khabbazi, S., Nassar, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2742476769,"Uric acid has been linked with increased risk of chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease and this association has been attributed to a pro-inflammatory effect. Indeed, observational studies have shown that high uric acid is associated with high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood. However, whether high uric acid directly affects inflammation or rather represents a parallel defensive antioxidant mechanism in response to pathology that causes inflammation is unknown. To determine whether acute increase or decrease uric acid levels affects inflammation in healthy individuals, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical study of uric acid or rasburicase with 20 healthy volunteers in each treatment-placebo group was conducted at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, MD. Change in inflammatory response was assessed by administering an oral lipid tolerance before and after the treatment of uric acid, rasburicase and placebo. Following uric acid administration, there was an accentuated increase in IL-6 during the oral lipid tolerance test (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed after lowering of uric acid with rasburicase. No side effects were reported throughout the trial. In health individuals, acute increase in uric acid results in an increased IL-6 response when challenged with lipid load. Such effect of amplification of inflammatory response may explain the higher risk of chronic diseases observed in subclinical hyperuricemia in observational studies.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01323335."
https://openalex.org/W2743740932,"Healthcare acquired infections (HAI) pose a great threat in hospital settings and environmental contamination can be attributed to the spread of these. De-contamination and, significantly, prevention of re-contamination of the environment could help in preventing/reducing this threat. Goldshield (GS5) is a novel organosilane biocide marketed as a single application product with residual biocidal activity. We tested the hypothesis that GS5 could provide longer-term residual antimicrobial activity than existing disinfectants once applied to surfaces. Thus, the residual bactericidal properties of GS5, Actichlor and Distel against repeated challenge with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC43300 were tested, and showed that GS5 alone exhibited longer-term bactericidal activity for up to 6 days on 316I stainless steel surfaces. Having established efficacy against S. aureus, we tested GS5 against common healthcare acquired pathogens, and demonstrated that, on average, a 1 log10 bactericidal effect was exhibited by GS5 treated surfaces, although biocidal activity varied depending upon the surface type and the species of bacteria. The ability of GS5 to prevent Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation was measured in standard microtitre plate assays, where it had no significant effect on either biofilm formation or development. Taken together the data suggests that GS5 treatment of surfaces may be a useful means to reducing bacterial contamination in the context of infection control practices."
https://openalex.org/W2742613463,"Inbreeding is a known risk factor for recessive Mendelian diseases and previous studies have suggested that it could also play a role in complex disorders, such as psychiatric diseases. Recent inbreeding results in the presence of long runs of homozygosity (ROHs) along the genome, which are also defined as autozygosity regions. Genetic variants in these regions have two alleles that are identical by descent, thus increasing the odds of bearing rare recessive deleterious mutations due to a homozygous state. A recent study showed a suggestive enrichment of long ROHs in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that recent inbreeding could play a role in the disease. To better understand the impact of autozygosity on schizophrenia risk, we selected, from a cohort of 180 Italian patients, seven subjects with extremely high numbers of large ROHs that were likely due to recent inbreeding and characterized the mutational landscape within their ROHs using Whole Exome Sequencing and, gene set enrichment analysis. We identified a significant overlap (17%; empirical p-value = 0.0171) between genes inside ROHs affected by low frequency functional homozygous variants (107 genes) and the group of most promising candidate genes mutated in schizophrenia. Moreover, in four patients, we identified novel and extremely rare damaging mutations in the genes involved in neurodevelopment (MEGF8) and in GABA/glutamatergic synaptic transmission (GAD1, FMN1, ANO2). These results provide insights into the contribution of rare recessive mutations and inbreeding as risk factors for schizophrenia. ROHs that are likely due to recent inbreeding harbor a combination of predisposing low-frequency variants and extremely rare variants that have a high impact on pivotal biological pathways implicated in the disease. In addition, this study confirms that focusing on patients with high levels of homozygosity could be a useful prioritization strategy for discovering new high-impact mutations in genetically complex disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2743686539,"Hippocampal theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) are consistently recorded during memory tasks and spatial navigation. Despite several known circuits and structures that generate hippocampal theta locally in vitro, none of them were found to be critical in vivo, and the hippocampal theta rhythm is severely attenuated by disruption of external input from medial septum or entorhinal cortex. We investigated these discrepancies that question the sufficiency and robustness of hippocampal theta generation using a biophysical spiking network model of the CA3 region of the hippocampus that included an interconnected network of pyramidal cells, inhibitory basket cells (BC) and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells. The model was developed by matching biological data characterizing neuronal firing patterns, synaptic dynamics, short-term synaptic plasticity, neuromodulatory inputs, and the three-dimensional organization of the hippocampus. The model generated theta power robustly through five cooperating generators: spiking oscillations of pyramidal cells, recurrent connections between them, slow-firing interneurons and pyramidal cells subnetwork, the fast-spiking interneurons and pyramidal cells subnetwork, and non-rhythmic structured external input from entorhinal cortex to CA3. We used the modeling framework to quantify the relative contributions of each of these generators to theta power, across different cholinergic states. The largest contribution to theta power was that of the divergent input from the entorhinal cortex to CA3, despite being constrained to random Poisson activity. We found that the low cholinergic states engaged the recurrent connections in generating theta activity, whereas high cholinergic states utilized the OLM-pyramidal subnetwork. These findings revealed that theta might be generated differently across cholinergic states, and demonstrated a direct link between specific theta generators and neuromodulatory states."

Heat treatment has been revisited to control stored-product insects as a potential alternative to methyl bromide for disinfesting mills and food-processing facilities. The influence of acclimation of T. castaneum adults, pupae, larvae, and eggs to sublethal temperatures of 36, and 42°C on their subsequent susceptibility to lethal temperature of 50°C was respectively investigated. The acclimation of T. castaneum eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults to 36, and 42°C significantly decreased their subsequent susceptibility to lethal high temperature of 50°C. The influence of acclimation to 42°C was significantly greater than that of acclimation to 36°C. The most influential acclimation times at 42°C for mortality of T. castaneum eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults were 15, 5, 5, and 5 h, respectively, and their corresponding mortality were 41.24, 5.59, 20.19, and 4.48%, compared to 100% mortality of T. castaneum eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults without acclimation when exposed to 50°C for 35 min, respectively.

BB-SPICE environment is composed of three modules: a new textual and compact description formalism for biological systems, a converter that handles this description and generates the SPICE netlist of the equivalent electronic circuit and NGSPICE which is an open-source SPICE simulator. In addition, the environment provides back and forth interfaces with SBML (System Biology Markup Language), a very common description language used in systems biology. BB-SPICE has been developed in order to bridge the gap between the simulation of biological systems on the one hand and electronics circuits on the other hand. Thus, it is suitable for applications at the interface between both domains, such as development of design tools for synthetic biology and for the virtual prototyping of biosensors and lab-on-chip. Simulation results obtained with BB-SPICE and COPASI (an open-source software used for the simulation of biochemical systems) have been compared on a benchmark of models commonly used in systems biology. Results are in accordance from a quantitative viewpoint but BB-SPICE outclasses COPASI by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude regarding the computation time. Moreover, as our software is based on NGSPICE, it could take profit of incoming updates such as the GPU implementation, of the coupling with powerful analysis and verification tools or of the integration in design automation tools (synthetic biology)."

We aimed to compare the effects of the rivastigmine patch between patients with AD with minimal WMHs and those with moderate WMHs. Methods Three hundred patients with mild to moderate AD were enrolled in this multicenter prospective open-label study and divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised patients with AD with minimal WMHs and group 2 comprised those with moderate WMHs. The patients were treated with a rivastigmine patch for 24 weeks. Efficacy measures were obtained at baseline and after 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) from the baseline to the end of the study. Results Of the 300 patients, there were 206 patients in group 1 and 94 patients in group 2. The intention-to-treat group comprised 198 patients (group 1, n = 136; group 2, n = 46) during the 24-week study period. Demographic factors did not differ between group 1 and group 2. There were no significant differences in change in ADAS-cog between group 1 (-0.62±5.70) and group 2 (-0.23±5.98) after the 24-week rivastigmine patch therapy (p = 0.378). The patients in group 1 had a 0.63-point improvement from baseline on the Frontal Assessment Battery, while group 2 had a 0.16-point decline compared to baseline at the end of the study (p = 0.037). The rates of adverse events (AEs) (42.6 vs. 40.3%) and discontinuation due to AEs (10.3% vs. 4.3%) did not differ between the groups. Conclusions Although the efficacy and tolerability of rivastigmine patch therapy were not associated with WMH severity in patients with AD, some improvement in frontal function was observed in those with minimal WMHs.

We used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explore the intentions of North-Western Ethiopian dairy farmers towards implementing non-specified mastitis control measures (nsMCMs) and towards implementing 4 specific MCMs. Face to face interviews were held with 134 dairy farmers to study associations between their intentions and any of three factors (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control) that, according to the TPB, determine intentions. The majority of the farmers (93%) had a positive intention to implement nsMCMs, whereas a smaller majority of farmers had the intention to implement the specific MCMs to improve udder cleaning (87%), to improve stall hygiene (78%), to improve feeding of cows (76%), and to perform foremilk stripping (74%). Farmers had a more positive attitude, but lower subjective norm and lower perceived behavioural control towards implementing nsMCMs compared with implementing most specific MCMs, although the subjective norms for stall hygiene and perceived behavioural control for improving feeding of cows were also low. Attitude was positively associated with intentions to implement nsMCMs, to improve cleaning of the udders, to improve stall hygiene and to implement foremilk stripping. Both the intention to improve udder cleaning and to implement foremilk stripping, were positively associated to subjective norms towards these MCMs. Our data can help tailor intervention programs aiming to increase the intention of Ethiopian dairy farmers to implement MCMs and thus to improve udder health in this country. We show that such programs should primarily focus on changing attitude and secondarily on improving the farmers' subjective norms."

Antibody levels against EBA140, EBA175, EBA181, PfRh2, PfRh4, and MSP2, were measured by ELISA. We also used parasites with disrupted EBA140, EBA175 and EBA181 genes to show that all these were targets of invasion inhibitory antibodies. However, antigenic targets of inhibitory antibodies were not stable and changed substantially over time in most individuals, independent of age. Antibodies levels measured by ELISA also varied within and between individuals over time and the antibodies against EBA181, PfRh2 and MSP2 declined more rapidly in younger individuals (≤15 years) compared with older (>15). The breadth of high antibody responses over time was more influenced by age than by the frequency of infection. High antibody levels were associated with a more stable invasion inhibitory response, which could indicate that during the long process of formation of immunity, many changes not only in levels but also in functional responses are needed. This is an important finding in understanding natural immunity against malaria, which is essential for making an efficacious vaccine."

Evaluating the data quality of MNase-seq data remains challenging, especially in mammalian. There is a strong need for a convenient and comprehensive approach to obtain dedicated quality control (QC) for MNase-seq data analysis. Here we developed CAM, which is a comprehensive QC pipeline for MNase-seq data. The CAM pipeline provides multiple informative QC measurements and nucleosome organization profiles on different potentially functional regions for given MNase-seq data. CAM also includes 268 historical MNase-seq datasets from human and mouse as a reference atlas for unbiased assessment. CAM is freely available at: http://www.tongji.edu.cn/~zhanglab/CAM."
https://openalex.org/W2742290966,"Here we describe the excretion pattern of corticosterone metabolites collected from droppings in barnacle goslings (Branta leucopsis) raised under 24 hours of continuous natural light in the Arctic. In lower latitudes, circulating corticosterone peaks around waking and shows a nadir between midnight and 4:00, whereas the peak and nadir are time-delayed slightly when measuring corticosterone metabolites from droppings. Photoperiod, along with other environmental factors, helps to entrain an animal's endogenous rhythm to that of the natural world. North of the Arctic Circle, photoperiod may not be a reliable cue as light is continuously absent during the winter and continuously present during the summer. Here, for the first time, we used droppings to describe a 24-hour excretion pattern of corticosterone metabolites (CORTm). By applying circular statistics for dependent data, we found a diel rhythmic pattern even under continuous natural light. We discuss potential alternative 'Zeitgeber' that may function even in the polar regions, focusing on melatonin. We propose a line of research to measure melatonin non-invasively from droppings. We also provide a validation of the adopted enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that was originally developed for greylag geese."
https://openalex.org/W2744677051,"Although experimental studies have shown that adiponectin and leptin modulate glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, it remains unclear whether these adipocytokines exert similar effects in general human populations. We evaluated the associations of serum adiponectin and leptin with β-cell function and insulin resistance in a population with low obesity prevalence. A cross-sectional study of 783 rural residents, aged 25–74 years, recruited in Ningxia, China was conducted during 2008–2012. β-cell function and insulin resistance were estimated using the Homeostasis Model Assessment. Serum adiponectin and leptin were measured with ELISA. Serum adiponectin concentrations (mean ± SD) were highest in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (36.65 ± 61.13 μg/ml), intermediate in those with impaired fasting glucose (25.92 ± 34.48 μg/ml), and lowest in those with diabetes (15.08 ± 12.14 μg/ml) (p = 0.001). A similar pattern of differences was found for β-cell function, whereas opposite results were observed for insulin resistance and blood glucose. After adjustment for confounders including metabolic syndrome components, serum adiponectin (μg/ml) was inversely associated with β-cell function (%β) [β (95% CI): -7.57 (-12.33, -2.81)] and insulin resistance (100/%S) [β (95% CI): -0.21 (-0.33, -0.09)]. A significant inverse association also existed between serum leptin and β-cell function, but serum leptin was not significantly associated with insulin resistance. The present study suggests that adiponectin and leptin play a role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes independent of metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W4241814117,"Municipal infrastructure is a fundamental facility for the normal operation and development of an urban city and is of significance for the stable progress of sustainable urbanization around the world, especially in developing countries. Based on the municipal infrastructure data of the prefecture-level cities in China, municipal infrastructure development is assessed comprehensively using a FA (factor analysis) model, and then the stochastic model STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology) is examined to investigate key factors that influence municipal infrastructure of cities in various stages of urbanization and economy. This study indicates that the municipal infrastructure development in urban China demonstrates typical characteristics of regional differentiation, in line with the economic development pattern. Municipal infrastructure development in cities is primarily influenced by income, industrialization and investment. For China and similar developing countries under transformation, national public investment remains the primary driving force of economy as well as the key influencing factor of municipal infrastructure. Contribution from urbanization and the relative consumption level, and the tertiary industry is still scanty, which is a crux issue for many developing countries under transformation. With economic growth and the transformation requirements, the influence of the conventional factors such as public investment and industrialization on municipal infrastructure development would be expected to decline, meanwhile, other factors like the consumption and tertiary industry driven model and the innovation society can become key contributors to municipal infrastructure sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W2744048188,"Genome duplication event in edible dicots under the orders Rosid and Asterid, common during the oligocene period, is missing for species under the order Caryophyllales. Despite this, grain amaranths not only survived this period but display many desirable traits missing in species under rosids and asterids. For example, grain amaranths display traits like C4 photosynthesis, high-lysine seeds, high-yield, drought resistance, tolerance to infection and resilience to stress. It is, therefore, of interest to look for minor genome rearrangements with potential functional implications that are unique to grain amaranths. Here, by deep sequencing and assembly of 16 transcriptomes (86.8 billion bases) we have interrogated differential genome rearrangement unique to Amaranthus hypochondriacus with potential links to these phenotypes. We have predicted 125,581 non-redundant transcripts including 44,529 protein coding transcripts identified based on homology to known proteins and 13,529 predicted as novel/amaranth specific coding transcripts. Of the protein coding de novo assembled transcripts, we have identified 1810 chimeric transcripts. More than 30% and 19% of the gene pairs within the chimeric transcripts are found within the same loci in the genomes of A. hypochondriacus and Beta vulgaris respectively and are considered real positives. Interestingly, one of the chimeric transcripts comprises two important genes, namely DHDPS1, a key enzyme implicated in the biosynthesis of lysine, and alpha-glucosidase, an enzyme involved in sucrose catabolism, in close proximity to each other separated by a distance of 612 bases in the genome of A. hypochondriacus in a convergent configuration. We have experimentally validated that transcripts of these two genes are also overlapping in the 3' UTR with their expression negatively correlated from bud to mature seed, suggesting a potential link between the high seed lysine trait and unique genome organization."
https://openalex.org/W2743494010,"The variety of microtubule arrays observed across different cell types should require a diverse group of proteins that control microtubule organization. Nevertheless, mainly because of the intrinsic propensity of microtubules to easily form bundles upon stabilization, only a small number of microtubule crosslinking proteins have been identified, especially in postmitotic cells. Among them is microtubule crosslinking factor 1 (MTCL1) that not only interconnects microtubules via its N-terminal microtubule-binding domain (N-MTBD), but also stabilizes microtubules via its C-terminal microtubule-binding domain (C-MTBD). Here, we comprehensively analyzed the assembly structure of MTCL1 to elucidate the molecular basis of this dual activity in microtubule regulation. Our results indicate that MTCL1 forms a parallel dimer not only through multiple homo-interactions of the central coiled-coil motifs, but also the most C-terminal non-coiled-coil region immediately downstream of the C-MTBD. Among these homo-interaction regions, the first coiled-coil motif adjacent to N-MTBD is sufficient for the MTCL1 function to crosslink microtubules without affecting the dynamic property, and disruption of this motif drastically transformed MTCL1-induced microtubule assembly from tight to network-like bundles. Notably, suppression of the homo-interaction of this motif inhibited the endogenous MTCL1 function to stabilize Golgi-associated microtubules that are essential for Golgi-ribbon formation. Because the microtubule-stabilizing activity of MTCL1 is completely attributed to C-MTBD, the present study suggests possible interplay between N-MTBD and C-MTBD, in which normal crosslinking and accumulation of microtubules by N-MTBD is essential for microtubule stabilization by C-MTBD."
https://openalex.org/W2744462035,"Bloodstream infection is a common cause of morbidity in children aged <5 years in developing countries. In studies reporting bacteremia in Africa, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) are commonly isolated. However, it is currently unclear whether children who are highly susceptible to infection because of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) or HIV should be treated with antimicrobials specifically to cover CoNS. We aimed to determine the clinical significance of CoNS amongst children admitted to a rural hospital in Kenya in relation to nutritional and HIV status.Systematically collected clinical and microbiological surveillance data from children aged 6-59 months admitted to Kilifi County Hospital (2007-2013) were analysed. Multivariable regression was used to test associations between CoNS isolation from blood cultures and SAM (MUAC <11.5cm or nutritional oedema (kwashiorkor)), and HIV serostatus; and among children with SAM or HIV, associations between CoNS isolation and mortality, duration of hospitalization and clinical features.CoNS were isolated from blood culture in 906/13,315 (6.8%) children, of whom 135/906 (14.9%) had SAM and 54/906 (6.0%) were HIV antibody positive. CoNS isolation was not associated with SAM (MUAC<11.5cm (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88-1.40) or kwashiorkor (aOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48-1.49)), or a positive HIV antibody test (aOR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92-1.71). Among children with SAM or a positive HIV antibody test, CoNS isolation was not associated with mortality or prolonged hospitalization.In a large, systematic study, there was no evidence that antimicrobial therapy should specifically target CoNS amongst children with SAM or HIV-infection or exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2744730480,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza represents a severe public health threat. Over the last decade, the demand for highly efficacious vaccines against avian influenza viruses has grown, especially after the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in China that resulted in over 600 human cases with over 200 deaths. Currently, there are several H5N1 and H7N9 influenza vaccines in clinical trials, all of which employ traditional oil-in-water adjuvants due to the poor immunogenicity of avian influenza virus antigens. In this study, we developed potent recombinant avian influenza vaccine candidates using HyperAcute™ Technology, which takes advantage of naturally-acquired anti-αGal immunity in humans. We successfully generated αGal-positive recombinant protein and virus-like particle vaccine candidates of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza strains using either biological or our novel CarboLink chemical αGal modification techniques. Strikingly, two doses of 100 ng αGal-modified vaccine, with no traditional adjuvant, was able to induce a much stronger humoral response in αGT BALB/c knockout mice (the only experimental system readily available for testing αGal in vivo) than unmodified vaccines even at 10-fold higher dose (1000 ng/dose). Our data strongly suggest that αGal modification significantly enhances the humoral immunogenicity of the recombinant influenza vaccine candidates. Use of αGal HyperAcute™ technology allows significant dose-sparing while retaining desired immunogenicity. Our success in the development of highly potent H5N1 and H7N9 vaccine candidates demonstrated the potential of αGal HyperAcute™ technology for the development of vaccines against other infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2745244391,"Although sport psychology literature focuses on psychological skills use to promote proficiency, it is still puzzling that current research has focused on psychological skills use only during competition. There remains a scarcity of empirical evidence to support the timing, and content of psychological skill application during the time preceding competition. This study examined the extent to which psychological skills usage are dynamic or stable over a 7-day pre-competitive period and whether any natural learning experiences might have accounted for the acquisition of these skills across gender and skill level.Ninety elite and sub-elite table tennis players completed the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS) at three different periods (7 days, 2 days, 1 hour) before competition. A MANOVA repeated measures with follow-up analyses revealed significant multivariate main effects for only skill level and time-to-competition with no interactions. Specifically, elite (international) athletes reported more usage than sub-elite (national) counterparts for self-talk, imagery and relaxation respectively. Time-to-competition effects showed imagery use decreased steadily across the three time points while reported usage of relaxation were almost at the same level on two time points (7 days and 1 hour) but decreased 2 days before competition.Findings suggest an implementation of formalized and periodized psychological skills training programs over continuous training cycles. This may foster a positive long-term athletes' psychological state prior to the onset of competition."
https://openalex.org/W2742343623,"A search of the disulfide reductase activities expressed in the adult stage of the free-living platyhelminth Dugesia dorotocephala was carried out. Using GSSG or DTNB as substrates, it was possible to obtain a purified fraction containing both GSSG and DTNB reductase activities. Through the purification procedure, both disulfide reductase activities were obtained in the same chromatographic peak. By mass spectrometry analysis of peptide fragments obtained after tryptic digestion of the purified fraction, the presence of glutathione reductase (GR), thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (TGR), and a putative thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) was detected. Using the gold compound auranofin to selectively inhibit the GSSG reductase activity of TGR, it was found that barely 5% of the total GR activity in the D. dorotocephala extract can be assigned to GR. Such strategy did allow us to determine the kinetic parameters for both GR and TGR. Although It was not possible to discriminate DTNB reductase activity due to TrxR from that of TGR, a chromatofocusing experiment with a D. dorotocephala extract resulted in the obtention of a minor protein fraction enriched in TrxR, strongly suggesting its presence as a functional protein. Thus, unlike its parasitic counterparts, in the free-living platyhelminth lineage the three disulfide reductases are present as functional proteins, albeit TGR is still the major disulfide reductase involved in the reduction of both Trx and GSSG. This fact suggests the development of TGR in parasitic flatworms was not linked to a parasitic mode of life."
https://openalex.org/W2742743653,"In this paper, we study a two-party pie-sharing problem in the presence of asymmetries in the stakeholders' private endowments. Both the two stakeholders and third-party arbitrators may influence the outcome. We consider Nash-demand negotiations, where the two stakeholders place demands and share the pie accordingly if demands are compatible, and elicit dictatorial allocations from the stakeholders and the arbitrators. The Nash demands by stakeholders are strategic; the dictatorial allocations by stakeholders and arbitrators are non-strategic. We are interested in the influence of the past arbitrator experience on stakeholder allocations and demands and the past stakeholder experience on third-party arbitration allocations. We find that the ex-arbitrators' stakeholder allocations differ more from the impartial ideal than the stakeholder allocations by those without arbitration experience. In contrast with previous findings, the arbitration outcomes do not depend on the asymmetries in the previous stakeholder roles."
https://openalex.org/W2743965580,"An ecosystem is a community comprising living and nonliving components of the environment. Microbes are ubiquitous elements in each of these components. The dynamics of microbiota formation in an ecosystem is important to elucidate, because how the different components of a system exchange microbes, and how the microbes control ecological processes remain unresolved. In this study, an abalone, Haliotis diversicolor, seed-nursing pond was used as a model system. We first examined changes in bacterial communities during the seedling cultivation of this herbivorous juvenile aquatic invertebrate animal. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing were used to analyze bacterial community dynamics and spatio-temporal interactions of different system components: consumers (abalone), producers (algae or a substrate), and the environment (water). DGGE fingerprints revealed that the developmental stages of abalone influences bacterial communities of both the abalone and substrate. Although the communities in water fluctuated daily, they could be divided into two clusters that coincided with abalone stages, reflecting the transition from larva to juvenile at around day 21. Pyrosequencing showed that the microbiota in the abalone and substrate had more operational taxonomic units in common than that of either with water. The Bray-Curtis similarity index was used to quantify the formation dynamics of microbiota among the various components of the system. The bacterial communities in producers and consumers showed similar changes. These communities were unstable at the beginning and then slowly stabilized over time. The environmental bacterial community was more stable than the bacterial communities in consumers and producers, and may have been the basis for stability in the system. Our research provides insights into the dynamics of microbiota formation in various biotic elements of a system that will contribute to predictive systems modeling."
