https://openalex.org/W2059539080,"Most minerals of Earth's upper mantle contain small amounts of hydrogen, structurally bound as hydroxyl (OH). The OH concentration in each mineral species is variable, in some cases reflecting the geological environment of mineral formation. Of the major mantle minerals, pyroxenes are the most hydrous, typically containing ∼200 to 500 parts per million H2O by weight, and probably dominate the water budget and hydrogen geochemistry of mantle rocks that do not contain a hydrous phase. Garnets and olivines commonly contain ∼1 to 50 parts per million. Nominally anhydrous minerals constitute a significant reservoir for mantle hydrogen, possibly accommodating all water in the depleted mantle and providing a possible mechanism to recycle water from Earth's surface into the deep mantle."

""Titration"" reactions with ND3 reveal the uptake of eight molecules, pointing to the fact that the titanium atoms are at exposed positions of similar coordination. A dodecahedral structure of Th point group symmetry is proposed to account for the unusual stability of this molecular cluster. The Ti8C12+ dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal rings and each of the rings is formed by two titanium and three carbon atoms, where each titanium is bound to three carbons. Based on the model, it is expected that neutral Ti8C12 would be a stable metallo-carbododecahedral molecule and may comprise one member of a new class of molecules, namely metallo-carbohedrenes."
https://openalex.org/W2066031415,"Chemical engineering theory can be used in accounting for the broad range of metabolic scaling exponents found in some aquatic invertebrates and algae. Delivery of metabolically important compounds to these organisms occurs by diffusion through a boundary layer. Dimensionless relations (Sherwood-Reynolds number functions) demonstrate the degree to which water motion and organism size affect mass transfer, and ultimately, metabolic rate. Derivation of mass exponents in the range 0.31 to 1.25 for simple geometries such as plates, spheres, and cylinders directly follows from knowledge of the Sherwood-Reynolds number relations. The range of exponents predicted is that found by allometric studies of metabolic rate in these organisms."

The mass spectra of these samples are similar to those of ambient-pressure, high-boiling-point solvent extractions, supporting the idea that solvent temperature and possibly pressure are key parameters in extraction of the giant fuilerenes. The STM images show that the giant fullerenes in these samples are roughly spherical in shape and range in diameter from approximately 1 to 2 nanometers, corresponding to fullerenes containing 60 to 330 atoms. No evidence of bucky tubes was found."
https://openalex.org/W2005257213,"Synchrotron surface x-ray scattering (SXS) studies have been carried out at the Au(lll)/electrolyte interface to determine the influence of surface charge on the microscopic arrangement of gold surface atoms. At the electrochemical interface, the surface charge density can be continuously varied by controlling the applied potential. The top layer of gold atoms undergoes a reversible phase transition between the (1 x 1) bulk termination and a (23 x radical3) reconstructed phase on changing the electrode potential. In order to differentiate the respective roles of surface charge and adsorbates, studies were carried out in 0.1 M NaF, NaCl, and NaBr solutions. The phase transition occurs at an induced surface charge density of 0.07 +/- 0.02 electron per atom in all three solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2008977338,"The dynamics of chemisorbed species as they swing to-and-fro on their adsorption sites may be directly observed with electron-stimulated desorption. The observation of the thermal disorder in adsorbate chemical bond directions, through studies of the thermal excitation of librational modes, allows one to visualize the potential energy surfaces controlling the structure and dynamics of adsorbates on single crystal metal and semiconductor surfaces. This information may be useful in understanding surface diffusion as well as the spatial aspects of surface chemical reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2053985819,"Think of tropical deforestation, and the image that comes most readily to mind is of chainsaws chewing their way through the Amazon basin. But the popular perception that the rain forests of Brazil represent the most threatened of the world's tropical forest ecosystems needs overhauling, according to a new assessment from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The Amazon rain forests are being cleared at an alarming rate, the new study shows, but rain forests in some other regions, along with other tropical forest types, are in an even more parlous state. South America accounts for the largest absolute losses, but in terms of percentages, Southeast Asia and Central America are losing their forests at a faster rate. Also, moist deciduous and upland forests are disappearing at a faster rate than the rain forests."
https://openalex.org/W1964627286,"In his article An optimal transition path for controlling greenhouse gases', William D Nordhaus takes a giant methodological step forward. His dynamic integrated climate-economy (DCIE) model couples my and Starley Thompson's globally averaged climate model with economic dynamics in order to evaluate the economic efficiency of different carbon tax scenarios. Nordhaus is one of the few economists who appropriately tries to balance the potential costs of CO[sub 2] emission controls with the external costs of unmitigated climate change - those that would occur in the absence of such controls."

https://openalex.org/W2082737759,"Most eukaryotic genes contain introns that interrupt the continuity of the genetic information. Introns are removed from a precursor RNA transcript by a process called splicing, whereby the intron is clipped out and the exons are rejoined to give the functional RNA molecule. There are three distinct mechanisms of RNA splicing (1-3). In the self-splicing mechanism, discovered by Cech, the splicing process relies on the intron to take on a complex structure and to catalyze its own removal. In mRNA splicing in the eukaryotic nucleus, the pre-mRNA molecule is assembled into a large complex structure, the spliceosome, and components of the spliceosome, probably one or more of the small nuclear RNA's, catalyze the splicing reaction. In contrast, the small introns that interrupt the anticodon loops of
eukaryotic precursor tRNA's are removed by a comparatively simple and familiar enzymatic process in which an endonuclease cleaves the two splice junctions and an ATP-dependent ligase joins the two exons."
