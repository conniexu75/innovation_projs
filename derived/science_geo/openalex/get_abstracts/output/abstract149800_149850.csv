https://openalex.org/W306915739,"Members of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor family have been shown recently to be required for cellular transformation by oncogenic Ras and by other oncoproteins and to suppress transformation-associated apoptosis. Furthermore, NF-kappa B has been shown to be activated by several oncoproteins including HER2/Neu, a receptor tyrosine kinase often expressed in human breast cancer. Human breast cancer cell lines, human breast tumors and normal adjacent tissue were analysed by gel mobility shift assay, immunoblotting of nuclear extracts and immunohistochemistry for activation of NF-kappa B. Furthermore, RNA levels for NF-kappa B-activated genes were analysed in order to determine if NF-kappa B is functionally active in human breast cancer. Our data indicate that the p65/RelA subunit of NF-kappa B is activated (i.e., nuclear) in breast cancer cell lines. However, breast tumors exhibit an absence or low level of nuclear p65/RelA but show activated c-Rel, p50 and p52 as compared to nontumorigenic adjacent tissue. Additionally, the I kappa B homolog Bcl-3, which functions to stimulate transcription with p50 or p52, was also activated in breast tumors. There was no apparent correlation between estrogen receptor status and levels of nuclear NF-kappa B complexes. Transcripts of NF-kappa B-regulated genes were found elevated in breast tumors, as compared to adjacent normal tissue, indicating functional NF-kappa B activity. These data suggest a potential role for a subset of NF-kappa B and I kappa B family proteins, particularly NF-kappa B/p52 and Bcl-3, in human breast cancer. Additionally, the activation of functional NF-kappa B in these tumors likely involves a signal transduction pathway distinct from that utilized by cytokines."

https://openalex.org/W2328868894,"Both nonneoplastic colon epithelium and colon carcinoma cells in situ are continuously exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Few reports have addressed possible direct effects of LPS in promotion of colon carcinoma and underlying mechanisms. We found evidence that LPS directly stimulated growth of the human colon carcinoma cell line CE-1 through an increase in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a result of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. LPS induced significant increases in PGE2 production in CE-1 cells, which were found to express a high-affinity LPS receptor, CD14. Positive correlations were found between PGE2 production and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B as well as expression of both COX-2 mRNA and protein in LPS-stimulated CE-1 cells. When CE-1 cells were exposed to exogenous PGE2, DNA synthesis increased. These results indicate that LPS may stimulate DNA synthesis in certain colon carcinoma cells as a result of PGE2 production involving increased COX-2 expression that might result in turn from activation of NF-kappa B by LPS. Further investigation of the pathways mediating LPS-induced stimulation of colon carcinoma cells may provide insights into LPS effects in in vivo tumor biology."
https://openalex.org/W1998008682,"Activation of the CD95 death receptor as well as ionizing radiation induces apoptotic cell death in human lymphoma cells. The activation of caspases is a hallmark of apoptosis induction irrespective of the apoptotic trigger. In contrast to death receptor signaling, the exact mechanisms of radiation-induced caspase activation are not well understood. We provide evidence that both, radiation and CD95 stimulation, induce the rapid activation of caspase-8 and BID followed by apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells. To analyse the relative position of caspase-8 within the apoptotic cascade we studied caspase activation and apoptosis in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Caspase-8 activation, pro-apoptotic BID cleavage and apoptosis in response to radiation were abrogated in these cells, while the responses to CD95 stimulation were only partially attenuated by overexpression of Bcl-2 family members. In parallel, the breakdown of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) in response to radiation was inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL Jurkat cells genetically deficient for caspase-8 were found to be completely resistant towards CD95. However, radiation-induced apoptotic responses in caspase-8-negative cells displayed only a modest reduction. We conclude that ionizing radiation activates caspase-8 and BID downstream of mitochondrial damage suggesting that, in contrast to CD95, both events function as executioners rather than initiators of the apoptotic process."
https://openalex.org/W2802036836,"Optical trickery can undermine the assistant referee's view of this ruling. In football (soccer), a player is ‘offside’ if he or she is closer to the goal than the last defender (excluding the goalkeeper) when the ball is passed to them. We investigated why assistant referees, who have the responsibility of judging offside, regularly make mistakes. We show that this is probably due to the angle of viewing by the assistant referee, who is frequently positioned beyond the last defender — a viewpoint from which errors are optically inevitable."

https://openalex.org/W2333608599,"We have cloned a novel quail cDNA with strong homology to the pim family of proto-oncogenes. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of the cDNA, named qpim, is more closely related to Xenopus Pim and to the recently identified rat Pim-3 than to human or rodent Pim-1 or Pim-2. The protein encoded by the qpim cDNA can autophosphorylate itself and share substrates with murine Pim-1, suggesting functional redundancy to other Pim family serine/threonine kinases. We have compared the expression of qpim in avian embryos to mouse pim-1, -2 and -3 by in situ hybridization. qpim shows a highly dynamic expression pattern, particularly at early developmental stages. Surprisingly, its expression pattern is not identical to any of the murine pim genes, which show complementary and/or partially overlapping expression sites both in- and outside of the hematopoietic system. Altogether, our results suggest novel functions for Pim family kinases during embryonic development, in particular in epithelia and in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2005519312,"Focal adhesions and actin cytoskeleton are involved in cell growth, shape and movement and in tumor invasion. Mitogen-induced changes in actin cytoskeleton are accompanied by changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several focal adhesion proteins. In this study, we have investigated the role of RAFTK, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase related to focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in heregulin-mediated signal transduction in breast cancer cells. Stimulation of T47D cells with heregulin (HRG) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK and the formation of a multiprotein complex. Analyses of the members of the HRG-stimulated complex revealed that RAFTK is associated with p190 RhoGAP (p190), RasGAP and ErbB-2, and plays an essential role in mediating the tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 by Src. Mutation of the Src binding site within RAFTK (402) abolished the phosphorylation of p190. In addition, upon HRG stimulation of T47D cells, association of ErbB-2 with RAFTK was observed and found to be indirect and mediated by Src. Expression of wild-type RAFTK (WT) significantly increased MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell invasion, while expression of the kinase-mutated RAFTK-R457 (KM) or the Src binding site mutant RAFTK (402) did not affect this cell invasion. Furthermore, HRG leads to the activation of MAP kinase which is mediated by RAFTK. These findings indicate that RAFTK serves as a mediator and an integration point between the GAP proteins and HRG-mediated signaling in breast cancer cells, and implicate RAFTK involvement in the MAP kinase pathway and in breast cancer cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2006623494,"Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) exerts its biological effects via binding and activating a transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase receptor known as c-Met. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that c-met gene expression is inducible by its own ligand (HGF). However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in this process are unknown. The present study was carried out to address this question. Transfection of various c-met-CAT promoter constructs into the mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hepa 1-6 in combination with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) identified the responsive element as an activated protein-1 (AP-1) binding site (TGAGTCA) within the c-met core promoter region at position -158 to -152. The c-met AP-1 element binds specifically to AP-1 protein as verified by supershift assays. EMSA studies and mutational analyses of the promoter region also revealed that the members of the Sp family of transcription factors (Sp-1 and Sp-3) bind to the c-met Sp-1 element (located at position -124) which is adjacent to the AP-1 site. We show that Sp binding dampens binding of AP-1 to its cognate site in the c-met promoter region. Stimulation of Hepa 1-6 cells with HGF resulted in a rapid and dramatic enhancement of the AP-1 binding activity as well as an overall increase in the level of AP-1 protein. Cotransfection of AP-1 expression vectors (c-Fos plus c-Jun) with c-met promoter constructs resulted in stimulation of c-met promoter activity. We found that transactivation of the c-met promoter by AP-1 can be blocked by Curcumin, an inhibitor of AP-1. Moreover, we found that the induction of the endogenous c-met gene by HGF is inhibited by the addition of Curcumin. The results demonstrate that the HGF-induced transcription of the c-met gene by HGF is, at least in part, due to activation of the AP-1 pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1983282393,"The phosphoaminothiol WR1065, the active metabolite of the pro-drug amifostine (WR2721), protects cultured cells and tissues against cytotoxic exposure to radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. We show here that WR1065 and the pro-drug WR2721 activate the p53 tumor suppressor protein and induce the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf-1 in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and in the mouse fibroblast cell line balb/c 3T3. Using two MCF-7 derived cell lines, MN1 and MDD2, we show that induction of p21waf-1 is detectable in MN1 (expressing a functional p53) but not in MDD2 (p53 disabled). These effects are observed at concentrations of WR1065 (0.5 to 1 mM) identical to those required to protect against cytotoxicity by hydrogen peroxide. Induction of p53 is not prevented by addition of aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of Cu-dependent amine-oxidases which blocks the extra-cellular degradation of WR1065 into toxic metabolites. Moreover, spermidine, a natural polyamine structurally related to amifostine, does not activate p53. Induction of p53 by WR1065 results in a delay in the G1/S transition in MCF-7 and MN-1 cells, but not in the p53 disabled cells MDD2. These data indicate that WR1065, a polyamine analog with thiol anti-oxidant properties, activates a cell cycle check-point involving p53."
https://openalex.org/W2316897006,"Cytokine-dependent activation of distinct signaling pathways is a common scheme thought to be required for the subsequent programmation into cell proliferation and survival. The PI 3-kinase/Akt, Ras/MAP kinase, Ras/NFIL3 and JAK/STAT pathways have been shown to participate in cytokine mediated suppression of apoptosis in various cell types. However the relative importance of these signaling pathways seems to depend on the cellular context. In several cases, individual inhibition of each pathway is not sufficient to completely abrogate cytokine mediated cell survival suggesting that cooperation between these pathways is required. Here we showed that individual inhibition of STAT5, PI 3-kinase or MEK activities did not or weakly affected the IL-3 dependent survival of the bone marrow derived Ba/F3 cell line. However, the simultaneous inhibition of STAT5 and PI 3-kinase activities but not that of STAT5 and MEK reduced the IL-3 dependent survival of Ba/F3. Analysis of the expression of the Bcl-2 members indicated that phosphorylation of Bad and Bcl-x expression which are respectively regulated by the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and STAT5 probably explain this cooperation. Furthermore, we showed by co-immunoprecipitation studies and pull down experiments with fusion proteins encoding the GST-SH2 domains of p85 that STAT5 in its phosphorylated form interacts with the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase. These results indicate that the activations of STAT5 and the PI 3-kinase by IL-3 in Ba/F3 cells are tightly connected and cooperate to mediate IL-3-dependent suppression of apoptosis by modulating Bad phosphorylation and Bcl-x expression."
https://openalex.org/W1623615887,"Although migration is a common behaviour, the effects of this annual two-way event on the speciation process are poorly understood, even though birds, which are commonly migratory b played a critical role in the development of speciation theory1,2. Here I propose that new developments3,4 in the theory of sympatric speciation — a process whereby new species can arise through population differentiation without spatial isolation — may help to explain the bursts of speciation observed in some seasonal migrant lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2315437476,"Using single and double transgenic mouse models, we investigated how c-Myc modulates the mammary epithelial cell cycle to induce cancer and how TGFalpha enhanced the process. In c-myc transgenic mice, c-myc expression was high in the hyperplastic mammary epithelium and in the majority of tumor areas. However, the tumors displayed focal areas of low expression of c-myc but high rates of proliferation. In contrast to E2F1 and cyclin A2, which were induced and co-localized with c-myc expression, induction of cyclins D1 and E occurred only in these tumor foci. Overexpression of cyclin D1 also occurred in the hyperplastic epithelium of tgfalpha-single and tgfalpha/c-myc-double transgenic mice. In tgfalpha/c-myc tumors, cells positive for cyclins D1 and E were randomly spread, without showing a reciprocal relationship to c-myc expression. In contrast to c-myc tumors, most tgfalpha/c-myc tumors showed undetectable levels of retinoblastoma protein (pRB), and the loss of pRB occurred in some cases at the mRNA level. These results suggest that E2F1 and cyclin A2 may be induced by c-Myc to mediate the onset of mammary cancer, whereas overexpression of cyclins D1 and E may occur later to facilitate tumor progression. TGFalpha may play its synergistic role, at least in part, by inducing cyclin D1 and facilitating the loss of pRB."
https://openalex.org/W2318592626,"Induction of irreversible growth arrest and terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells following treatment with recombinant human fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and mezerein (MEZ) results in elevated expression of a specific melanoma differentiation associated gene, mda-7. Experiments were conducted to define the mechanism involved in the regulation of mda-7 expression in differentiating human melanoma cells. The mda-7 gene is actively transcribed in uninduced HO-1 human melanoma cells and the rate of transcription of mda-7 is not significantly enhanced by treatment with IFN-beta, MEZ or IFN-beta+MEZ. The high basal activity of the mda-7 promoter in uninduced melanoma cells and the absence of enhancing effect upon treatment with differentiation inducers is corroborated by transfection studies using the promoter region of mda-7 linked to a luciferase reporter gene containing the SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence. RT - PCR analysis detects the presence of low levels of mda-7 transcripts in uninduced and concomitant increases in differentiation inducer treated HO-1 cells. However, steady-state mda-7 mRNA is detected only in IFN-beta+MEZ and to a lesser degree in MEZ treated cells. We show that induction of terminal differentiation of HO-1 cells with IFN-beta+MEZ dramatically increases the half-life of mda-7 mRNA while treatment with cycloheximide results in detectable mda-7 mRNA in control and inducer treated cells. These observations confirm constitutive activity of the mda-7 promoter in HO-1 cells irrespective of differentiation status suggesting posttranscriptional processes as important determinants of mda-7 expression during terminal differentiation. The 3' UTR region of mda-7 contains AU-rich elements (ARE) that contribute to rapid mda-7 mRNA turnover during proliferation and reversible differentiation, a process controlled by a labile protein factor(s). Substitution of the SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence in the luciferase reporter plasmid with the mda-7-ARE-3'-UTR renders the Luciferase message unstable when expressed in proliferating and reversibly differentiated melanoma cells. In contrast, the luciferase message is stabilized when the mda-7-ARE-3'-UTR construct is expressed in terminally differentiated HO-1 cells. These results provide compelling evidence that mda-7 expression during terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells is regulated predominantly at a posttranscriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2324684567,"Several transgenic mouse tumor models were utilized to explore how specific genetic alterations affect the tumor cell response to chemotherapeutic agents in vivo. Specifically, MMTV-ras transgenic mice were interbred to p53 knock-out mice to create a model for assessing the role of p53 in chemotherapeutic responses. In addition, MMTV-ras tumors were compared to MMTV-myc and MMTV-ras/myc tumors. Mice of each genotype reproducibly develop mammary and/or salivary tumors, but tumor growth dynamics vary considerably between genotypes. MMTV-ras/p53-/- tumors exhibit higher S phase fractions than MMTV-ras/p53+/+ tumors, although both tumor types display very low apoptosis levels. In contrast, MMTV-myc tumors exhibit both high S phase fractions and spontaneous apoptosis levels. Tumor-bearing mice of each genotype were treated with either doxorubicin or paclitaxel, and effects on overall tumor growth, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were evaluated. Surprisingly, neither agent efficiently induced apoptosis in any of the tumor models, including those with wildtype p53. Rather, tumor responses were mediated primarily by changes in cell cycle distribution. However, the spontaneous apoptosis levels did serve as a predictor of tumor growth response, in that only those tumors with high pretreatment apoptosis levels underwent significant regression following treatment with either agent."
https://openalex.org/W2315835535,"Structural requirements for beta 1 integrin cytoplasmic domain functions in adhesion, migration and signaling have been studied mainly for fibroblasts in vitro. The relevance for beta 1-dependent in vivo migration of lymphoid cells has not been assessed. To study this, we transfected beta 1 mutants into beta 1-deficient double knockout (DKO) ESb lymphoma cells, and tested the capacity of the cells to metastasize to liver and spleen. This was compared to alpha 4 beta 1-dependent invasion into cell monolayers in vitro and Mn2+-induced adhesion to fibronectin. Deletion of the five C-terminal residues or mutation of both threonines T788 and T789 to alanines blocked invasion and metastasis and greatly reduced adhesion, in line with known in vitro effects. However, mutations of the NPXY motif tyrosines had unexpected consequences. A Y783F mutation had no effect at all, but a Y783,795F double mutation strongly reduced Mn2+-induced adhesion, whereas it had limited effects on invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, cells expressing a beta 1 beta 2 chimeric subunit, which contains phenylalanines in the NPXY/F motifs, adhered poorly but invasion and metastasis was fully restored to the same levels as for cells expressing wild-type beta 1. We conclude that part of the functions of the beta 1 cytoplasmic domain that are required for adhesion are not essential for beta 1-dependent invasion and metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2325250004,"We have investigated the mechanism by which two oncogenic mutations (M1268T and D1246H/N; Amino-acids are numbered according to Schmidt et al., 1999) affecting conserved residues in the catalytic domain of the Met receptor, activate its transforming potential. Both mutations were previously found in tumorigenic forms of the Ret and Kit receptors, respectively. The mutated residues are located either in the P+1 loop (M) or within the activation loop (A-loop) (D), which in a number of receptor tyrosine kinases harbors a pair of tandem tyrosines (Y1252-1253 in Met). Ligand-induced dimerization promotes their phosphorylation, and locks the A-loop into an open conformation. When unphosphorylated, the tandem tyrosines inhibit enzymatic activity by blocking the active site. Upon Y-->F mutation of Y1252-1253, neither ligand binding nor Tpr-mediated dimerization can release this block. Here we show that the M1268T mutation partially rescues the kinase activity (and the transforming ability) of the Y1252-1253F Tpr-Met mutant, but is completely dependent on dimerization for its effect. In contrast, the two D1246H/N mutants strictly depend on Y1252-1253 for activity. Surprisingly, however, they constitutively activate the isolated cytoplasmic TK domain of Met (Cyto-Met). These data indicate that the two mutations operate via distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2325786224,"Previous studies have led to the proposal that a single molecule of Cki can associate with the cyclin/Cdk complex to repress its activity. On the other hand, multiple inhibitor molecules are required to inhibit Cdks. In the present work, by using differently tagged p57Kip2 proteins we demonstrate that p57Kip2 can bind to itself in vitro and in vivo. Mutational deletion analysis showed that the NH2 terminal domain of p57Kip2 is necessary and sufficient to dimerization. Using an in vitro competition/association assay, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 alone, Cdk4 alone and/or cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes do not compete for the p57Kip2 homodimers formation. However, a mutation in the alpha-helix domain of p57Kip2 (R33L) strongly reduced homodimer formation but did not modify interaction with cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes. Also, increasing amounts of p57Kip2 lead in vivo to a significant augmentation in the level of p57Kip2 homodimerization associated with cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes and to a marked inhibition of the cyclin D1-Cdk4 kinase activity. Altogether, these data suggest a model whereby p57Kip2 associates with itself by using the NH2 domain to form a homodimeric species which interacts with and inhibits the cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2330720803,"Most of the proteins in the Ras-family proteins, including Ras, Rap and TC21, have been reported to be strong inhibitors of skeletal myogenesis. Here we show that R-Ras, another member of this family, promotes terminal differentiation of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts. In contrast to Ras, which induced a markedly transformed phenotype of C2C12 cells, an activated mutant of R-Ras (R-RasQ87L) did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on the differentiation of C2C12 cells, but enhanced the formation of multinucleated myotubes. Although R-RasQ87L showed little effect on induction of two muscle-specific proteins, creatine kinase and myogenin, it prevented cell death during myoblast differentiation, probably through Akt activation and Bcl-xL induction. Motility of C2C12 cells, which may be involved in fusion of myoblasts, was also stimulated by R-RasQ87L. Furthermore, we observed a transient activation of endogenous R-Ras during differentiation of C2C12 cells. The ectopic expression of R-Ras GAP inhibited the differentiation. These results suggest that R-Ras has a positive effect on the terminal differentiation of myoblasts and may be involved in the program of skeletal myogenesis."

We have analysed this chromosome using GlimmerM, a freely available gene-finder developed specifically for the P. falciparum species2. GlimmerM was highly effective in finding nearly all the genes that were reported on P. falciparum chromosome 2 (ref. 2), and a newly re-trained version was even more effective on chromosome 3, confirming virtually all reported genes and finding several additional ones."
https://openalex.org/W2069547025,"Molecular pathways and mechanisms underlying human cancer are frequently investigated in animal models. Studies to identify and dissect molecular pathways include the discovery of genes and their subsequent analysis in transgenic and `knock-out' mice. A critical aspect in such investigations is the evaluation of organ integrity and histology upon the alteration or inactivation of specific genes. Results from such studies are usually published in scientific journals. However, due to print space and costs the display of large high quality images is limited. Furthermore, the printed media does not permit an easy comparison of histological images published in different journals and different years. The Internet provides a tool for the timely and inexpensive dissemination of scientific data to the research community. However, its potential for the analysis of histological images has not been explored. Here we present a web-based interactive histology atlas ( http://histology.nih.gov ) that permits the retrieval of annotated, high-resolution histology images via the Internet. This histology atlas also takes advantage of the interactive nature of the Internet to support the communication between different research groups. As an outline forum this atlas provides the framework to evaluate and understand cancer pathology, and to develop a consensus between veterinary and human pathologists."
