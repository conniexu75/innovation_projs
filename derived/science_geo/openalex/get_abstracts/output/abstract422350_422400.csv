https://openalex.org/W2170490448,"We describe a computational method that infers tumor purity and malignant cell ploidy directly from analysis of somatic DNA alterations. The method, named ABSOLUTE, can detect subclonal heterogeneity and somatic homozygosity, and it can calculate statistical sensitivity for detection of specific aberrations. We used ABSOLUTE to analyze exome sequencing data from 214 ovarian carcinoma tumor-normal pairs. This analysis identified both pervasive subclonal somatic point-mutations and a small subset of predominantly clonal and homozygous mutations, which were overrepresented in the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and NF1 and in a candidate tumor suppressor gene CDK12. We also used ABSOLUTE to infer absolute allelic copy-number profiles from 3,155 diverse cancer specimens, revealing that genome-doubling events are common in human cancer, likely occur in cells that are already aneuploid, and influence pathways of tumor progression (for example, with recessive inactivation of NF1 being less common after genome doubling). ABSOLUTE will facilitate the design of clinical sequencing studies and studies of cancer genome evolution and intra-tumor heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2069269337,"Tumor maintenance relies on continued activity of driver oncogenes, although their rate-limiting role is highly context dependent. Oncogenic Kras mutation is the signature event in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), serving a critical role in tumor initiation. Here, an inducible Kras(G12D)-driven PDAC mouse model establishes that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on Kras(G12D) expression. Transcriptome and metabolomic analyses indicate that Kras(G12D) serves a vital role in controlling tumor metabolism through stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates into the hexosamine biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP). These studies also reveal that oncogenic Kras promotes ribose biogenesis. Unlike canonical models, we demonstrate that Kras(G12D) drives glycolysis intermediates into the nonoxidative PPP, thereby decoupling ribose biogenesis from NADP/NADPH-mediated redox control. Together, this work provides in vivo mechanistic insights into how oncogenic Kras promotes metabolic reprogramming in native tumors and illuminates potential metabolic targets that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in PDAC."

We do not see significantly greater numbers of de novo missense mutations in affected versus unaffected children, but gene-disrupting mutations (nonsense, splice site, and frame shifts) are twice as frequent, 59 to 28. Based on this differential and the number of recurrent and total targets of gene disruption found in our and similar studies, we estimate between 350 and 400 autism susceptibility genes. Many of the disrupted genes in these studies are associated with the fragile X protein, FMRP, reinforcing links between autism and synaptic plasticity. We find FMRP-associated genes are under greater purifying selection than the remainder of genes and suggest they are especially dosage-sensitive targets of cognitive disorders.

The genetic component can be transmitted or acquired through de novo (“new”) mutation. Analysis of the de novo mutations has demonstrated a large number of potential autism target genes (Gilman et al., 2011Gilman S.R. Iossifov I. Levy D. Ronemus M. Wigler M. Vitkup D.

Previously cited studies have focused on large-scale de novo copy number events, either deletions or duplications. Because such events typically span many genes, discerning which of the genes in the target region, alone or in combination, contribute to the disorder becomes a matter of educated guessing or network analysis (Gilman et al., 2011Gilman S.R. Iossifov I. Levy D. Ronemus M. Wigler M. Vitkup D.

However, with high-throughput DNA sequencing we can readily search for new mutation in single genes by comparing children to both parents. Such mutation is fairly common, on the order of a hundred new mutations per child, with only a few—on the order of one per child—falling in coding regions (Awadalla et al., 2010Awadalla P. Gauthier J. Myers R.A. Casals F. Hamdan F.F. Griffing A.R. Côté M. Henrion E. Spiegelman D. Tarabeux J. et al.Direct measure of the de novo mutation rate in autism and schizophrenia cohorts.Am. J.

Thus, candidate gene and exome sequencing, involving the capture of designated coding regions of the genome, are efficient ways to search for new gene mutations in families. Preliminary attempts with these approaches, including studies of autism, have already been published (O'Roak et al., 2011O'Roak B.J. Deriziotis P. Lee C. Vives L. Schwartz J.J. Girirajan S.

In each family, only a single child is on the spectrum, and each has one or more normal siblings. This collection is depleted of multiplex cases where transmission genetics is expected to play a greater role (Fischbach and Lord, 2010Fischbach G.D. Lord C. The Simons Simplex Collection: a resource for identification of autism genetic risk factors.Neuron. 2010; 68: 192-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It is enriched for higher-functioning probands. As a result, the gender ratio among probands in this study is roughly 1 female per 6 males. Our focus was to determine first and foremost if the various types of new mutations would have different incidence in affected children than in their sibling controls. Not all types of point mutations are equally likely to be disruptive of gene function, and the contribution of the various types of events to autism incidence could not be evaluated in the absence of knowledge of relative rates, in affected and the sibling controls. Hence, we performed our analysis on family “quads” rather than trios. We rejected the idea that a comparative rate could be obtained by studies of unrelated controls performed at other sequencing centers or even at our own sequencing centers if performed at separate times with ostensibly similar protocols. We conclude that de novo mutations disrupting gene function, such as indels that cause frame shifts and point mutations that affect splice sites or introduce stop codons, are statistically more likely in children on the autistic spectrum than in their unaffected siblings. In contrast, we see no statistically significant signal from either missense or synonymous mutations. Including de novo copy number variation, the types of mutation we can now detect contribute collectively to about 16% of the cases of simplex autism, undoubtedly an underestimate of the actual contribution. We observe an unusual coincidence between the list of genes with disruptive de novo mutations in children with autism and the list of 842 gene products associated with FMRP (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J. Zhang C. Hung K.Y. Mele A. Fraser C.E. Stone E.F. Chen C. Fak J.J. Chi S.W. et al.FMRP stalls ribosomal translocation on mRNAs linked to synaptic function and autism.Cell. 2011; 146: 247-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar), itself a target of mutation in ∼2% of children with ASD. Within the parental gene pool there are far fewer disruptive variants in FMRP-associated genes than found in typical genes, suggestive of stringent purifying selection acting on FMRP-associated genes. We report on the sequence and analysis of whole exomes from 343 families, each comprising parents and at least two offspring. No families with a member of questionable pedigree were included. To maximize the efficiency and uniformity of sequencing and capture we adopted a barcoding and pooling strategy. We used the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome v2.0 capture reagent (Experimental Procedures). The 36.0 Mb target sequence consists almost entirely of coding exons. On average, individuals had 78% of the target covered at ≥20× and 56% at ≥40×. Since ours is a family study, we define “joint coverage” at a base as the minimum coverage at that base in any individual member of that family. On average, families had 71% joint coverage at ≥20× and 45% at ≥40×. Ninety-six percent of families had fifty percent or greater of target jointly covered at ≥20×. Coverage is presented graphically in Figure 1. To improve detection of indels and mutations at potential splice signals, our sequence analysis pipeline included 20 bp flanking each end of the coding exons, bringing our “extended” target to 43.8 Mb. We counted de novo events over the extended region even though coverage was lower than over coding target. We used a new multinomial test to determine likelihood that a mutation was de novo. We also used a chi-square test to exclude loci that did not fit a simple germline model, and we excluded sites that were polymorphic or noisy over the population. We established thresholds for these tests and used additional microassembly criteria, comprising our filters for counting candidate events. We sampled calls for experimental validation testing to determine our false positive rate. Because the vast majority of false positives originate from the chance undersampling of one parental allele, we made an empirical choice of likelihood thresholds that diminished the frequency with which known polymorphic loci in the population appeared as “de novo” mutations in the children (see Figure S1 available online). These thresholds define part of our “SNV filter.” For each indel call, we also used de Bruijn graph microassembly as a filter (Pevzner et al., 2001Pevzner P.A. Tang H. Waterman M.S. An Eulerian path approach to DNA fragment assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 9748-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) of reads possibly covering candidate regions in each of the family members. For validation testing, we designed barcoded primers from the reference genome for each mutation examined, individually PCR-amplified DNA from each family member for the locus, pooled by family relation to the proband, made libraries and sequenced pooled products (Experimental Procedures). Validation tests succeeded or failed, and if they succeeded, the results either confirmed or falsified the calls. A summary of results is found in Table 1, for SNVs and indels. The detailed results (including counts) are in Tables S1 and S3. We validated in three batches, each time blind to the gene or affected status. In the first batch, we selected from the SNV data available, picking random calls passing filter. In the other two batches, we focused on indels and nonsense mutations. In all three batches, we tested a few calls close to passing but excluded by our filters.Table 1Validation of De Novo CallsPasses (Filter)ConfirmedFalsifiedSNVs (99/105 Successfully Tested)No (SNV)73Yes (SNV)890Nonsense (22/24 Successfully Tested)No (SNV)10Yes (SNV)210Indels (49/49 Successfully Tested)No (SNV or indel)01Yes (SNV only)10Yes (Indel only)90Yes (SNV and indel)380Two filters were used for counting calls, an SNV and indel filter. We list all calls tested and the number of successful tests, separated into de novo SNVs (top) and indels (bottom). The middle subtable is the subset of SNVs that created stop codons (nonsense mutations), which are included in the overall number in the top subtable. Calls fell either within (“Yes”) or outside (“No”) the thresholds of the filter (first column), and were either confirmed or falsified as a de novo variants (second and third columns).

We sought to produce a list of autism candidates with as few false positives as possible and to be able to make the strongest statistical evaluation of the differential rates of de novo mutation between affecteds and siblings. We confirmed all 137 calls passing filters that we successfully tested. We subsequently loosened some and tightened other criteria for indels (the “indel filter”) to capture more events, as described below. We first investigated de novo SNVs. We counted 754 candidate de novo events passing our SNV filter (summarized in Table 2; complete list with details in Table S1). The distribution of events in families closely fit a Poisson model. Events were classified by affected status, gender, location (within exon, splice site, intron, 5′UTR, and 3′UTR) and type of coding mutation (synonymous, missense, or nonsense). The specific position of the mutation and the resulting coding change, if any, are also listed. In all cases examined, microassembly qualitatively validated the de novo SNV calls. Every de novo SNV candidate that passed filter and was successfully tested was confirmed present in the child and absent in the parents (89/89; Table 1 and Table S1).Table 2Summary of De Novo Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) in 343 SSC Families40× (High) CoverageAll LociSNV EffectProbandSiblingProbandSiblingProband F (29)Proband M (314)Sibling F (182)Sibling M (161)BothTotalSplice site4163151209Nonsense15719931663230Missense12512120720719188116913417Synonymous5342796987143264152Promoter0111010102UTR57890836017Intron3435596455438261124Intergenic0212012003Total2362163803643634420915510754De novo SNVs were tabulated according to affected status, gender, and type of mutation. Data under “40× coverage” indicate variants in the subset of the exome target region in which all members of a given family were covered by at least 40 sequence reads. The power to detect de novo variants in children from this well-covered portion of the target is very high, and we found no bias in coverage between affected and unaffected children. No significant difference was seen for missense mutations (125 in probands to 121 in unaffected siblings), but larger ratios of nonsense (15:7) and splice site (4:1) mutations were observed in probands relative to unaffected siblings. When we expanded our set of calls to include every variant that passed our thresholds (under “all loci”; see Experimental Procedures), similar ratios were observed. Probands and unaffected siblings are further subdivided based on gender: “proband F” indicates an affected female; “proband M” an affected male; “sibling F” an unaffected female; and “sibling M” an unaffected male. In parentheses, we indicate the number of children with the corresponding affected status and gender. The “both” column shows de novo SNVs that were shared by both siblings from the same family.

In parentheses, we indicate the number of children with the corresponding affected status and gender. The “both” column shows de novo SNVs that were shared by both siblings from the same family. Because variation in the number of mutations detected could be a function of variable sequence coverage in probands versus siblings, we also determined counts of mutation equalized by high coverage, assessing only regions where the joint coverage was at least 40×. At such high coverage, less than 5% of true de novo SNVs would be missed (as judged by simulations). We then determined the de novo SNV mutation rate by summing the total number of de novo SNVs in these 40× joint regions from all individual children, then dividing by the sum of base pairs within these regions in these children. The rate was 2.0 ∗ 10−8 (±10−9) per base pair, or about 120 mutations per diploid genome per generation (6 ∗ 109 ∗ 2 ∗ 10−8), consistent with a range of estimates obtained by others (Awadalla et al., 2010Awadalla P.

Genet. 2011; 43: 712-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Table 2 contains a summary of our findings. The number of de novo SNVs only in probands versus the number only in their siblings is not significantly different than expected from the null hypothesis of equal rates between probands and siblings, whether counting all SNVs (380 versus 364), synonymous (79 versus 69), or missense (207 versus 207). Ten de novo variants occurred in both proband and sibling. The balance does not change if we examine only regions of joint coverage ≥40×. Applying additional filters for amino acid substitutions (conservative versus nonconservative) or genes expressed in brain also did not substantively change this conclusion (Table S1). However, this study lacks the statistical power to reject the hypothesis that missense or synonymous mutations make a major contribution (see Discussion). We did see a differential signal when comparing the numbers of nonsense mutations (19 versus 9) and point mutations that alter splice sites (6 versus 3). Such mutations could reasonably be expected to disrupt protein function, and in the following we refer to such mutations as ‘likely gene disruptions’ (LGD). The LGD targets and the specifics of the mutations in the affected population are listed in Table 3, and more details for all children are provided in Table S2. The sum of LGDs caused by point mutation was 25 in affecteds to 12 in siblings, with a p value of 0.047 by the two-sided binomial test. Every nonsense candidate that passed filter and was successfully tested was confirmed present in the child and absent in the parents (21/21; Tables 1 and S1).Table 3Likely Gene-Disrupting (LGD) Mutations in Affected ChildrenFamily IDGenderVariantEffectGeneAmino Acid PositionFMRP Target12221Msub(C → T)NFAM91A172/839Yes12501Msub(A → T)NNRXN1587/1,177Yes12645Msub(C → T)NANK2104/1,049Yes12764Fsub(C → A)NNCKAP11,082/1,129Yes12840Msub(C → T)NATP1B1143/299Yes12867Fsub(G → A)NTRIP1235/1,723Yes13094Msub(T → A)NWDFY3978/3,527Yes12683Mdel(1)FKDM6B192/1,683Yes12705Mins(C)FDIP2C657/1,557Yes12952Mdel(1)FMLL51,066/1,859Yes13012Mins(CTGGTCT)FDIP2A608/1,568Yes13092Mins(AGGTCAG)FLMTK3307/1,490Yes13612Mdel(4)FDST3,268/5,172Yes12969Mins(C)SMED13L1,789/2,211Yes12409Msub(G → A)NLRP23,184/4,656No12463Msub(C → T)NUNC80518/1,765No12653Msub(C → T)NKIAA0232118/1,396No12669Msub(C → T)SRABGGTAUTRNo12792Msub(C → T)NANO5420/913No12840Msub(C → T)STM4SF1968/210No12864Fsub(C → T)SSUV420H186/646No13010Msub(G → C)STBC1D23293/700No13042Msub(G → A)NTHSD7A879/1,658No13125Msub(C → T)NRAD21L154/557No13197Msub(G → T)NNR3C2701/868No13234Msub(G → A)NCBX4131/561No13349Msub(G → A)NNUAK1433/662No13364Msub(G → A)NECM2182/678No13506Msub(C → A)NSCUBE280/1,000No13513Msub(G → A)SZMYND11239/455No13526Msub(A → G)SCACNA2D3592/939No13670Fsub(C → T)NNFIA30/502No12323Mdel(1)FPHF21,088/1,097No12652Mdel(1)FSPATA13127/1,278No12653Mins(A)FDLL1431/724No12773Mdel(4)FPCDHA13678/951No12826Fdel(4)FTROVE2253/539No12858Fdel(1)FPAX5111/392No12939Mdel(2)FSLC25A39104/352No12950Mdel(4)FUBN21,063/1,348No13018Mdel(1)FPCOLCE101/450No13070Mdel(2)FCTTNBP2760/1,664No13096Mdel(1)FGIMAP8149/666No13162Mins(A)FRIMS1196/1,693No13168Fdel(1)FMFRP342/580No13176Fdel(1)FZFYVE26397/2,540No13183Mins(G)FBCL11A265/836No13398Mins(CGTCATCA)FPOGZ1,108/1,316No13439Mins(A)FCSTF2T354/617No13471Mdel(2)FFLG147/4,062No13537Mdel(4)STUBGCP4578/667No13548Fdel(1)FGALNTL4521/608No13552Mdel(1)FDYRK1A487/755No13585Mins(G)FACACB114/2,459No13586Mins(G)FTRIM17274/478No13590Mins(A)FMTHFS147/147No13590Mdel(1)FEFCAB5848/857No13616Mins(G)FATP10D1,001/1,427No13646Mdel(5)FVCP515/807NoSNV and indel variants from affected children that are likely to disrupt the function of the corresponding proteins are listed.

The “variant” column shows detail for reconstructing the haplotype around the de novo variant relative to the reference genome as follows: “sub(R → A)” represents a substitution of the reference allele to an alternative allele; “ins(seq)” indicates an insertion of the provided sequence “seq”; and “del(N)” denotes a deletion of N nucleotides. Chromosomal locations for events can be found in Table S2. Under “effect,” “N” stands for nonsense, “S” for splice site, and “F” for frame shift events. The “amino acid position” column shows the position of the first incorrectly encoded amino acid (or nonsense codon) within the encoded protein/the length of the protein. When a mutation affects multiple isoforms of a transcript, the earliest proportionate coordinate is given. “FMRP target” indicates whether the corresponding gene's RNA was found to physically associate with FMRP (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C.

See “Recurrence and Overlaps with FMRP-Associated Genes” in the Results as well as Tables 5 and 6 for additional details. Further support for the hypothesis that LGDs contribute to ASD comes from counting small insertions or deletions (indels) within coding regions. Small indels were ascertained using a simple protocol. This protocol works best for indels less than six base pairs: we surveyed all reads that required a gap to align to the reference genome, and marked where the gap was placed. After eliminating all gap positions that are common in the population, we again used our SNV filter: multinomial sampling to estimate the likelihood that a gap in the child was not inherited from either parent, and used a chi-square test for a germline model (Experimental Procedures). We set the same thresholds as used for SNVs. Microassembly excluded ten presumptive indel loci as inconsistent, failing either because of low count for confirmatory reads, absence of an indel, or finding the nonreference allele in a parent. For two loci, the sizes of deletions were corrected by microassembly. We tested 49 candidate de novo indels, and all 39 that passed the SNV filter were confirmed. Incidence of indels in families again followed a Poisson model. It was quite clear from validation testing that many candidate indels excluded by the SNV filter were true positives. There was clearly allele imbalance favoring the reference allele over the indel in the exome sequencing, but this bias was absent in the validation testing (Table S2). Because of the importance of indels, we wished to establish an “indel filter” that diminished false negatives, so we lowered our chi-square stringency (from 10−4 to 10−9) and multinomial threshold (from 60 to 30). To guard against false positives resulting from undersampling the parents, we excluded any locus at which the variant allele was seen fewer than six times in the child, or appeared even once in the parents, and insisted on certain lower limits of coverage, all of which was done without respect to affected status (Experimental Procedures). Of the 49 tested loci, 47 passed this new filter and confirmed (Table 1). With the indel filter, we detected 53 indels in probands and 32 in siblings (p value = 0.03). Of these, 32 in probands and 15 in siblings caused frame shifts (p value = 0.02; see Table 4 for summary and Table S3 for complete list). Frame shift mutations, like nonsense and splice mutations, can cause severe disruption of coding capacity and hence we classify them as LGDs. Three more indels (2 in probands and 1 in siblings) are likely to be LGDs, as they either introduce stop codons or disrupt a splice site. It is likely that even in-frame insertions or deletions are more disruptive to a peptide than a mere substitution, and we refer later to an interesting example, but we do not count them as LGDs.Table 4Summary of De Novo Indels in 343 SSC FamiliesIndel EffectProbandSiblingProband FProband MSibling FSibling MBothTotalSplice site20020002Frame shift3215527411047"
https://openalex.org/W1979612107,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in cognitive decline and altered network activity, but the mechanisms are unknown. We studied human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice, which simulate key aspects of AD. Electroencephalographic recordings in hAPP mice revealed spontaneous epileptiform discharges, indicating network hypersynchrony, primarily during reduced gamma oscillatory activity. Because this oscillatory rhythm is generated by inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) cells, network dysfunction in hAPP mice might arise from impaired PV cells. Supporting this hypothesis, hAPP mice and AD patients had decreased levels of the interneuron-specific and PV cell-predominant voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1. Restoring Nav1.1 levels in hAPP mice by Nav1.1-BAC expression increased inhibitory synaptic activity and gamma oscillations and reduced hypersynchrony, memory deficits, and premature mortality. We conclude that reduced Nav1.1 levels and PV cell dysfunction critically contribute to abnormalities in oscillatory rhythms, network synchrony, and memory in hAPP mice and possibly in AD."

https://openalex.org/W2163679188,"Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells grown in serum exhibit greater heterogeneity in morphology and expression of pluripotency factors than ES cells cultured in defined medium with inhibitors of two kinases (Mek and GSK3), a condition known as ""2i"" postulated to establish a naive ground state. We show that the transcriptome and epigenome profiles of serum- and 2i-grown ES cells are distinct. 2i-treated cells exhibit lower expression of lineage-affiliated genes, reduced prevalence at promoters of the repressive histone modification H3K27me3, and fewer bivalent domains, which are thought to mark genes poised for either up- or downregulation. Nonetheless, serum- and 2i-grown ES cells have similar differentiation potential. Precocious transcription of developmental genes in 2i is restrained by RNA polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing. These findings suggest that transcriptional potentiation and a permissive chromatin context characterize the ground state and that exit from it may not require a metastable intermediate or multilineage priming."

However, the detailed mechanism of MSC-based immunotherapy is not fully understood. In this study, we show that MSC-induced T cell apoptosis through FAS signaling is required for MSC-mediated therapeutic effects in systemic sclerosis (SS) and experimental colitis in mice. Since bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs) express FAS ligand (FASL) and activated T cells express elevated levels of FAS (Mazar et al., 2009Mazar J. Thomas M. Bezrukov L. Chanturia A. Pekkurnaz G. Yin S. Kuznetsov S.A. Robey P.G. Zimmerberg J. Cytotoxicity mediated by the Fas ligand (FasL)-activated apoptotic pathway in stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22022-22028Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar; Figures S1A–S1D available online), we hypothesized that FASL-mediated FAS signaling might play a critical role in BMMSC-based immunomodulation. To test this hypothesis, BMMSCs from C57BL6 mice, fasl-mutated B6Smn.C3-FASLgld/J mice (gldBMMSC), and fasl-transfected gldBMMSCs (FASL+gldBMMSCs) were injected into normal C57BL6 mice (Figure 1A ). Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were collected at 0, 1.5, 6, 24, and 72 hr after BMMSC transplantation (BMMSCT) (Figure 1A). Allogenic BMMSC infusion reduced the number of CD3+ T cells and increased the number of apoptotic CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node starting at 1.5 hr, reaching the peak at 6 hr, and lasting until 72 hr posttransplantation (Figures 1B–1E; S1P–S1S). In order to compare syngenic and allogenic BMMSCs, we showed that BMMSCs derived from a littermate were the same as allogenic BMMSCs in their capacity to induce T cell apoptosis (Figures S2A–S2G). Meanwhile, infusion of FASL−/− gldBMMSCs failed to reduce the number of CD3+ T cells or elevate the number of apoptotic CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow (Figures 1B–1E). However, overexpression of fasl in gldBMMSCs by lentiviral transfection (Figure S1N) partially rescued the capacity to reduce the number of CD3+ T cells and elevate the number of apoptotic CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow (Figures 1B–1E). BMMSC infusion also resulted in the reduction of the number of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a correspondingly increased number of apoptotic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood (Figures S1E and S1F). Interestingly, BMMSCT induced CD4+ T cell apoptosis and Treg upregulation in OT1 TCR TG mice. However, the percentage of CD8+ T cells, which react with OVA-MHC class I antigen, was unchanged after BMMSCT, indicating that transplanted BMMSCs need to be recognized as antigens to initiate CD8+ T cell apoptosis (Figures S1T–S1AA). TUNEL staining confirmed that BMMSC infusion elevated the number of apoptotic T cells in bone marrow (Figure 1F). We next verified that BMMSC-induced T cell death was caused by apoptosis based on the in vitro blockage of BMMSC-induced CD3+ T cell apoptosis by neutralizing FASL antibody and caspase 3, 8, and 9 inhibitors (Figures 1G–1I). FASL neutralizing antibody injection could partially block BMMSC-induced CD3+ T cell apoptosis, upregulation of Tregs, and downregulation of Th17 cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow (Figures S1G–S1M). These data indicate that BMMSCs are capable of inducing T cell apoptosis through the FASL/FAS signaling pathway (Figure 1J). Although BMMSCs failed to induce naive T cell apoptosis in the coculture system (data not shown), they were able to induce activated T cell apoptosis in vitro (Figures 1G and 1I). In order to confirm the role of FASL in BMMSC-mediated T cell apoptosis in vivo, we used siRNA to knock down fasl expression in BMMSCs (Figure S3A) and infused these into C57BL6 mice. As expected, this failed to reduce the number of CD3+ T cells or induce CD3+ T cell apoptosis in peripheral blood and bone marrow (Figures 2A–2D ). Moreover, infusion of these fasl knockdown BMMSCs failed to elevate Treg levels in peripheral blood (Figure 2E). This study confirms that FASL is required for BMMSC-induced T cell apoptosis and Treg upregulation. Since apoptotic T cells trigger TGFβ production by macrophages and upregulate Tregs, which leads to immune tolerance in vivo (Perruche et al., 2008Perruche S. Zhang P. Liu Y. Saas P. Bluestone J.A. Chen W. CD3-specific antibody-induced immune tolerance involves transforming growth factor-beta from phagocytes digesting apoptotic T cells.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we examined whether BMMSC-induced T cell apoptosis could also promote the upregulation of Tregs. We found that systemic infusion of BMMSCs did, in fact, elevate Treg levels in peripheral blood at 24 and 72 hr posttransplantation (Figure 2F; S2H–S2M), as well as elevate TGFβ levels and reduce Th17 cell levels in peripheral blood (Figure 2G; S1O). Cotransplantation of BMMSCs and pan T cells resulted in T cell apoptosis at 1.5 and 6 hr posttransplantation. On the other hand, FASL−/− gldBMMSC infusion failed to upregulate the levels of either Tregs or TGFβ (Figures 2F and 2G), suggesting that FASL-mediated T cell apoptosis plays a critical role in Treg upregulation. Indeed, overexpression of fasl in FASL−/− gldBMMSCs rescued BMMSC-induced Treg upregulation and TGFβ production at 24 hr posttransplantation (Figures 2F and 2G). To examine the mechanism by which BMMSC infusion resulted in TGFβ upregulation in peripheral blood, we used fluorescence analysis to confirm that macrophages engulfed apoptotic T cells in vivo (Perruche et al., 2008Perruche S. Zhang P. Liu Y. Saas P. Bluestone J.A. Chen W. CD3-specific antibody-induced immune tolerance involves transforming growth factor-beta from phagocytes digesting apoptotic T cells.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar; Figure 2H). Then we measured the number of CD11b+ macrophages in spleen cells and found that the number was significantly increased in the BMMSC infusion group (Figure 2I). In contrast, treatment with macrophage inhibitor clodronate liposomes significantly reduced the number of CD11b+ macrophages in spleen cells (Figure 2I) and blocked BMMSC infusion-induced upregulation of TGFβ and Tregs (Figures 2J and 2K). These data suggest that T cell apoptosis, as induced by BMMSC infusion, activates macrophages to produce the TGFβ that results in Treg upregulation (Figure 2L). We next asked whether apoptosis of infused BMMSCs also triggers macrophages to produce TGFβ to upregulate Tregs. Carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled BMMSCs, gldBMMSCs, and fasl knockdown BMMSCs were infused into C57BL6 mice. At 1.5 hr postinfusion, all CFSE+ cells were detected and reached a peak in peripheral blood and bone marrow, after which the cell number was gradually decreased, becoming undetectable at 24 hr postinfusion (Figures S3C and S3D). In contrast, CFSE+ apoptotic cells reached a peak at 6 hr postinfusion and became undetectable at 24 hr postinfusion in peripheral blood and bone marrow (Figures S3E and S3F). The apoptosis of transplanted BMMSCs was also observed by immunofluorescent analysis (Figure S3B). Although apoptosis of the infused FASL-deficient BMMSCs was observed, no corresponding upregulation of TGFβ or Tregs was observed in peripheral blood (Figures 2E–2G). These data suggest that T cell, not BMMSC, apoptosis is required for Treg upregulation (Figure 2L). To further study the therapeutic mechanism of BMMSCT, two mouse models, genetic tight-skin (Tsk/+) SS and inductive experimental colitis, were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of BMMSCT. Allogenic normal BMMSCs or gldBMMSCs (1×106) were systemically transplanted into Tsk/+ SS mice (Green et al., 1976Green M.C. Sweet H.O. Bunker L.E. Tight-skin, a new mutation of the mouse causing excessive growth of connective tissue and skeleton.Am. J. Pathol. 1976; 82: 493-512PubMed Google Scholar) at 8 weeks of age, and samples were harvested at 12 weeks of age for further evaluation (Figure 3A ). The BMMSC-transplanted group showed significant reduction in the number of CD3+ T cells and corresponding elevation in the number of apoptotic CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood from 6 to 72 hr posttransplantation (Figures 3B and 3C). On the other hand, FASL−/− gldBMMSC transplantation failed to induce CD3+ T cell apoptosis (Figures 3B and 3C). Tsk/+ mice showed an increase in the levels of antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double strand DNA (dsDNA) IgG and IgM antibodies, creatinine in serum, and urine proteins (Figures 3D–3H). Normal BMMSC, but not FASL−/− gldBMMSC, transplantation significantly reduced the levels of ANA, dsDNA IgG and IgM, serum creatinine, and urine protein levels (Figures 3D–3H). Moreover, BMMSCT rescued decreased levels of Tregs and increased levels of Th17 cells in Tsk/+ mice (Figures 3I and 3J; S4B). As expected, gldBMMSC transplantation failed to regulate the levels of Tregs and Th17 cells in Tsk/+ mice (Figures 3I and 3J). Histological analysis also showed that skin hypodermal (HD) thickness was significantly increased in Tsk/+ mice (Figure 3K). After BMMSCT, HD thickness was reduced to a level equal to that of the control group, whereas gldBMMSC failed to reduce HD thickness (Figure 3K). Additionally, the tightness of skin, as measured by Grabbed distance, was significantly improved in the BMMSC, but not the gldBMMSC, transplantation group (Figure S4A). The induced experimental colitis model was generated as previously described (Alex et al., 2009Alex P. Zachos N.C. Nguyen T. Gonzales L. Chen T.E. Conklin L.S. Centola M. Li X.

Immunol. 2010; 183: 7787-7798Crossref Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Allogenic normal BMMSCs or FASL−/− gldBMMSCs (1×106) were systemically transplanted into experimental colitis mice at day 3 after 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induction (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang Q. Shi S. Liu Y. Uyanne J. Shi Y. Shi S. Le A.D.

Immunol. 2010; 183: 7787-7798Crossref Scopus (547) Google Scholar; Figure 4A ). Normal BMMSCT reduced the number of CD3+ T cells and elevated the number of AnnexinV+7AAD+ double positive apoptotic CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood starting at 1.5 hr and lasting to 72 hr after transplantation (Figures 4B and 4C). However, the gldBMMSC transplantation group showed no difference from the colitis group in terms of numbers of CD3+ T cells and apoptotic CD3+ T cells (Figures 4B and 4C). The body weight of mice with induced colitis was significantly reduced compared to that of control C57BL6 mice from day 5 to 10 post-DSS induction (Figure 4D). After normal BMMSC, but not gldBMMSC, transplantation, the body weight was partially restored at day 10 post-DSS induction. The disease activity index (DAI), including body weight loss, diarrhea, and bleeding, was significantly elevated in the colitis mice compared to the control mice. After BMMSCT, the DAI score was decreased, while gldBMMSCs failed to reduce the DAI score (Figure 4E). Both decreased Tregs and elevated Th17 cells were observed in the colitis mice from day 7 to 10 post-DSS induction (Figures 4F and 4G). BMMSC, but not gldBMMSC, transplantation significantly upregulated Tregs and downregulated Th17 cells (Figures 4F and 4G). Furthermore, colon tissue from each group was analyzed (Figure 4H). Both the absence of epithelial layer and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in the colitis and gldBMMSC transplantation groups. BMMSCT recovered epithelial structure and eliminated inflammatory cells in colitis mice. Histological activity index (Alex et al., 2009Alex P. Zachos N.C. Nguyen T. Gonzales L. Chen T.E. Conklin L.S. Centola M. Li X. Distinct cytokine patterns identified from multiplex profiles of murine DSS and TNBS-induced colitis.Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2009; 15: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) confirmed that BMMSCT reduced the DAI, while gldBMMSCs failed to improve the DAI (Figure 4H). The data therefore suggest that BMMSC-induced T cell apoptosis with Treg upregulation might offer a potential treatment for the colitis (Figure 4I). Moreover, upregulation of Tregs was required in ameliorating disease phenotype in the DSS-induced colitis model (Figures S5A–S5F). In addition to FASL, BMMSCs also express FAS (Figure S6A). To examine whether FAS plays a role in BMMSC-based immunotherapies, we infused FAS−/− BMMSCs, derived from C3MRL-FASlpr/J mice (lprBMMSCs), into C57BL6 mice and found that FAS−/− lprBMMSCs failed to reduce the number of CD3+ T cells or elevate the number of apoptotic CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow (Figures 5A–5D ). In addition, we revealed that lprBMMSC transplantation failed to upregulate the levels of Tregs and TGFβ and downregulate Th17 cell level in peripheral blood (Figures 5E and 5F; S6X). Moreover, fas knockdown BMMSCs using siRNA showed the same effect as observed in FAS−/− lprBMMSC (Figures S6Y–S6EE). When transplanted into DSS-induced colitis mice, lprBMMSCs neither provided therapeutic effects on body weight, DAI, and histological activity index, nor balanced the levels of Tregs and Th17 cells (Figures S6B–S6G). In addition, lprBMMSC transplantation failed to treat Tsk/+ SS mice, showing no rescue of the levels of ANA, anti-dsDNA IgG and IgM antibodies, creatinine, urine protein, Grabbed distance, Tregs, or Th17 cells (Figures S6H–S6Q). Taken together, these data suggest that FAS−/− lprBMMSCs, like FASL−/− gldBMMSCs, were unable to ameliorate disease phenotypes in SS and colitis mouse models. Next, we investigated the underlying mechanisms by which lprBMMSC transplantation failed to treat the diseases. We showed that lprBMMSCs expressed a normal level of FASL by western blot analysis (Figure S6R) and induced CD3+ T cell apoptosis in a coculture system (Figure 5G). This was blocked by anti-FASL neutralizing antibody (Figure 5G), suggesting that the failure to induce in vivo T cell apoptosis by lprBMMSCs does not result from the lack of expression of functional FASL. We therefore hypothesized that FAS expression affects the BMMSC immunomodulatory property via a non-FASL-related mechanism, such as regulating the recruitment of T cells. To test this, we used an in vitro transwell coculture system to show that activated T cells migrate to BMMSCs to initiate cell-cell contact (Figure 5H). However, lprBMMSCs showed a significantly reduced capacity to recruit activated T cells in the coculture system when compared to control BMMSCs (Figures 5H and 5I). We then used a cytokine array analysis to determine that lprBMMSCs express a low level of MCP-1, a member of the C-C motif chemokine family and a T cell chemoattractant cytokine (Carr et al., 1994Carr M.W. Roth S.J. Luther E. Rose S.S. Springer T.A. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 acts as a T-lymphocyte chemoattractant.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar; Figure S6S). Interestingly, overexpression of mcp-1 in lprBMMSCs partially rescued their capacity to recruit T cells (Figures 5H–5J). Overexpression of fas in lprBMMSCs resulted in the secretion level of multiple cytokines being restored (Figures S6S and S6U) and fully rescued their capacity to recruit T cells (Figures 5H, 5I, and 5K). However, the expression level of MCP-1 protein in lprBMMSCs was higher than that in control BMMSCs, and overexpression of fas reduced MCP-1 cytoplasm protein level in lprBMMSCs (Figure 5L), indicating that FAS regulates MCP-1 secretion, but not expression. Next, we examined MCP-1 level in the culture supernatant, and we found that the MCP-1 level in lprBMMSCs was significantly lower than in BMMSCs (Figure 5M). Overexpression of mcp-1 and fas in lprBMMSCs rescued MCP-1 levels in culture supernatant (Figure 5M). We next confirmed that FAS regulated MCP-1 secretion using the siRNA knockdown approach (Figure S6T). Downregulation of fas expression in BMMSCs resulted in reduced MCP-1 secretion (Figure 5N), with a corresponding reduction in the capacity to recruit activated T cells in the coculture system (Figures 5O and 5P). In order to confirm that MCP-1 contributes to BMMSC-based immunoregulation, we isolated BMMSCs from MCP-1 mutant B6.129S4-Ccl2tm1Rol/J mice and showed that MCP-1−/− BMMSCs were defective in reducing the number of CD3+ T cells or elevating apoptotic CD3+ T cells in C57BL6 mice when compared to control BMMSCs (Figures 6A and 6B ). Also, MCP-1−/− BMMSCs failed to upregulate the levels of Tregs and TGFβ within 72 hr posttransplantation (Figures 6C and 6D). The deficiency of inducing T cell apoptosis and Treg upregulation by MCP-1−/− BMMSCs was not associated with FASL function (Figure 6E). When MCP-1−/− BMMSCs were cocultured with activated T cells in a transwell culture system, the number of T cells migrating to BMMSCs was significantly reduced compared to control BMMSCs (Figure 6F). Also, FAS and MCP-1 play an important role in attracting B cells, NK cells, and immature dendritic cells (iDCs) in an in vitro culture system (Figure S7A–S7C). These data indicate that MCP-1 secretion regulates BMMSC-induced T cell migration (Figure 6G). Moreover, we showed that FAS also regulated the secretion of other cytokines, such as C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease-1 (TIMP-1) (Figures S6V and S6W). Based on the above results in experimental animal models, we conducted a pilot clinical investigation to assess whether T cell apoptosis and Treg upregulation occurred in SS patients treated with MSC transplantation (MSCT). Five patients (four females and one male; Table S1), ranging in age from 44 to 61 years old (average 51.2 ± 7.8 years old) having SS for a duration of 48–480 months (average 163.2 ± 182.1 months) were enrolled for allogenic MSCT (Sun et al., 2009Sun L.

Allogenic MSCT significantly reduced the number of CD3+ T cells and upregulated the number of AnnexinV-positive apoptotic CD3+ T cells at 6 hr post-MSCT, and decreased CD3+ T cell number and apoptotic rate to baseline level by 72 hr (Figures 7B and 7C). A reduced number of CD4+ T cells was also observed at 6 hr post-MSCT (Figure 7D). Importantly, the frequency of Tregs in peripheral blood was significantly upregulated at 72 hr post-MSCT (Figure 7E),"

To determine whether small RNAs of the adult brain can regulate memory storage, a process that requires stable and long-lasting changes in the functional state of neurons, we generated small RNA libraries from the Aplysia CNS. In these libraries, we discovered an unexpectedly abundant expression of a 28 nucleotide sized class of piRNAs in brain, which had been thought to be germline specific. These piRNAs have unique biogenesis patterns, predominant nuclear localization, and robust sensitivity to serotonin, a modulatory transmitter that is important for memory. We find that the Piwi/piRNA complex facilitates serotonin-dependent methylation of a conserved CpG island in the promoter of CREB2, the major inhibitory constraint of memory in Aplysia, leading to enhanced long-term synaptic facilitation. These findings provide a small RNA-mediated gene regulatory mechanism for establishing stable long-term changes in neurons for the persistence of memory."

Although MCL-1 is known to oppose cell death, precisely how it functions to promote survival of normal and malignant cells is poorly understood. Here, we report that different forms of MCL-1 reside in distinct mitochondrial locations and exhibit separable functions. On the outer mitochondrial membrane, an MCL-1 isoform acts like other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 molecules to antagonize apoptosis, whereas an amino-terminally truncated isoform of MCL-1 that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix is necessary to facilitate normal mitochondrial fusion, ATP production, membrane potential, respiration, cristae ultrastructure and maintenance of oligomeric ATP synthase. Our results provide insight into how the surprisingly diverse salutary functions of MCL-1 may control the survival of both normal and cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2161253430,"Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure are associated with aberrant cardiac metabolism. We show that the heart regulates systemic energy homeostasis via MED13, a subunit of the Mediator complex, which controls transcription by thyroid hormone and other nuclear hormone receptors. MED13, in turn, is negatively regulated by a heart-specific microRNA, miR-208a. Cardiac-specific overexpression of MED13 or pharmacologic inhibition of miR-208a in mice confers resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Conversely, genetic deletion of MED13 specifically in cardiomyocytes enhances obesity in response to high-fat diet and exacerbates metabolic syndrome. The metabolic actions of MED13 result from increased energy expenditure and regulation of numerous genes involved in energy balance in the heart. These findings reveal a role of the heart in systemic metabolic control and point to MED13 and miR-208a as potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2080967954,"mTOR is a regulator of cell growth and survival, protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity, and autophagic degradation of cellular components. When triggered by mTOR inactivation, macroautophagy degrades long-lived proteins and organelles via sequestration into autophagic vacuoles. mTOR further regulates synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration occurs when macroautophagy is deficient. It is nevertheless unknown whether macroautophagy modulates presynaptic function. We find that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin induces formation of autophagic vacuoles in prejunctional dopaminergic axons with associated decreased axonal profile volumes, synaptic vesicle numbers, and evoked dopamine release. Evoked dopamine secretion was enhanced and recovery was accelerated in transgenic mice in which macroautophagy deficiency was restricted to dopaminergic neurons; rapamycin failed to decrease evoked dopamine release in the striatum of these mice. Macroautophagy that follows mTOR inhibition in presynaptic terminals, therefore, rapidly alters presynaptic structure and neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W1991340932,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent cause of cancer deaths worldwide; nearly half contain mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS pathway. Here we show that RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC cells depend on the transcription factor GATA2. Loss of GATA2 reduced the viability of NSCLC cells with RAS-pathway mutations, whereas wild-type cells were unaffected. Integrated gene expression and genome occupancy analyses revealed GATA2 regulation of the proteasome, and IL-1-signaling, and Rho-signaling pathways. These pathways were functionally significant, as reactivation rescued viability after GATA2 depletion. In a Kras-driven NSCLC mouse model, Gata2 loss dramatically reduced tumor development. Furthermore, Gata2 deletion in established Kras mutant tumors induced striking regression. Although GATA2 itself is likely undruggable, combined suppression of GATA2-regulated pathways with clinically approved inhibitors caused marked tumor clearance. Discovery of the nononcogene addiction of KRAS mutant lung cancers to GATA2 presents a network of druggable pathways for therapeutic exploitation."

We identified mutations in EXOSC3 in an additional 8 of 12 families with PCH1. Morpholino knockdown of exosc3 in zebrafish embryos caused embryonic maldevelopment, resulting in small brain size and poor motility, reminiscent of human clinical features, and these defects were largely rescued by co-injection with wild-type but not mutant exosc3 mRNA. These findings represent the first example of an RNA exosome core component gene that is responsible for a human disease and further implicate dysregulation of RNA processing in cerebellar and spinal motor neuron maldevelopment and degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2004268936,"During development, cortical plasticity is associated with the rearrangement of excitatory connections. While these connections become more stable with age, plasticity can still be induced in the adult cortex. Here we provide evidence that structural plasticity of inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal neurons is a major component of plasticity in the adult neocortex. In vivo two-photon imaging was used to monitor the formation and elimination of fluorescently labeled inhibitory structures on pyramidal neurons. We find that ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex is associated with rapid inhibitory synapse loss, especially of those present on dendritic spines. This occurs not only with monocular deprivation but also with subsequent restoration of binocular vision. We propose that in the adult visual cortex the experience-induced loss of inhibition may effectively strengthen specific visual inputs with limited need for rearranging the excitatory circuitry."

We detected hundreds of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in every clone, with an average of 11 in coding regions. In two experiments, all SNVs were unique for each clone and did not cluster in pathways, but in the third, all four iPSC clones contained 157 shared genetic variants, which could also be detected in rare cells (<1 in 500) within the parental MEF pool. These data suggest that most of the genetic variation in iPSC clones is not caused by reprogramming per se, but is rather a consequence of cloning individual cells, which ""captures"" their mutational history. These findings have implications for the development and therapeutic use of cells that are reprogrammed by any method."

Mutations within the highly conserved CAP-Gly domain of dynactin cause neurodegenerative disease. Here, we show that the CAP-Gly domain is necessary to enrich dynactin at the distal end of primary neurons. While the CAP-Gly domain is not required for sustained transport along the axon, we find that the distal accumulation facilitates the efficient initiation of retrograde vesicular transport from the neurite tip. Neurodegenerative disease mutations in the CAP-Gly domain prevent the distal enrichment of dynactin thereby inhibiting the initiation of retrograde transport. Thus, we propose a model in which distal dynactin is a key mediator in promoting the interaction among the microtubule, dynein motor, and cargo for the efficient initiation of transport. Mutations in the CAP-Gly domain disrupt the formation of the motor-cargo complex, highlighting the specific defects in axonal transport that may lead to neurodegeneration."

Recent success in the derivation of mouse haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) via parthenogenesis has enabled genetic screening in mammalian cells. However, successful generation of live animals from these haESCs, which is needed to extend the genetic analysis to the organism level, has not been achieved. Here, we report the derivation of haESCs from androgenetic blastocysts. These cells, designated as AG-haESCs, partially maintain paternal imprints, express classical ESC pluripotency markers, and contribute to various tissues, including the germline, upon injection into diploid blastocysts. Strikingly, live mice can be obtained upon injection of AG-haESCs into MII oocytes, and these mice bear haESC-carried genetic traits and develop into fertile adults. Furthermore, gene targeting via homologous recombination is feasible in the AG-haESCs. Our results demonstrate that AG-haESCs can be used as a genetically tractable fertilization agent for the production of live animals via injection into oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2001574193,"Neuroepithelial attachments at adherens junctions are essential for the self-renewal of neural stem and progenitor cells and the polarized organization of the developing central nervous system. The balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation depends on the precise assembly and disassembly of these adhesive contacts, but the gene regulatory mechanisms orchestrating this process are not known. Here, we demonstrate that two Forkhead transcription factors, Foxp2 and Foxp4, are progressively expressed upon neural differentiation in the spinal cord. Elevated expression of either Foxp represses the expression of a key component of adherens junctions, N-cadherin, and promotes the detachment of differentiating neurons from the neuroepithelium. Conversely, inactivation of Foxp2 and Foxp4 function in both chick and mouse results in a spectrum of neural tube defects associated with neuroepithelial disorganization and enhanced progenitor maintenance. Together, these data reveal a Foxp-based transcriptional mechanism that regulates the integrity and cytoarchitecture of neuroepithelial progenitors."

Results from electrical brain stimulation have traditionally been interpreted with an emphasis on somatotopy (Penfield and Boldrey, 1937Penfield W. Boldrey E.

Despite the detailed knowledge gleaned from these efforts, our understanding of the macroscopic organization of motor cortex remains incomplete. Much of our understanding about the motor cortex comes from experiments in which stimulation or recording is performed at a few cortical points. Technical limitations have traditionally made it difficult to probe the cortical circuitry underlying motor representations in a uniform, quantitative manner. Recently, we and others have developed a novel method for rapid automated motor mapping based on light activation of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) that has facilitated experiments which were previously impossible (Ayling et al., 2009Ayling O.G.S.

This technique has the advantage of objectively and reproducibly sampling the movements evoked by stimulation at hundreds of cortical locations in mere minutes. Here, we apply light-based motor mapping to investigate the functional subdivisions of the motor cortex and their dependence on intracortical activity. The ability to repeatedly map the motor cortex over timescales ranging from minutes to months has allowed us to appreciate the dynamic nature of movement representations and facilitated the comparison of motor maps generated before and after pharmacological perturbations of the intracortical circuitry.

In these experiments, anesthetized mice were head-fixed in the prone position with their contralateral limbs suspended. In this posture, the limbs were able to move freely along the axis of measurement of a laser range finder. The resultant movement maps were centered at positions consistent with those obtained by EMG recording or visual observation (forelimb: 2.2 ± 0.1 mm lateral, 0.05 ± 0.09 mm anterior of bregma; hindlimb: 2.0 ± 0.11 mm lateral, 0.21 ± 0.1 mm posterior of bregma, n = 14 mice, all values ± SEM) (Pronichev and Lenkov, 1998Pronichev I.V.

Composite maps based on the average of three repetitions were highly reproducible, with a shift in center position of 0.19 ± 0.02 mm (n = 12 mice) between mapping trials (∼30 min per composite map). In a separate group of animals implanted with cranial windows, maps remained stable for months (Figure S1 available online). Movement maps could also be generated in animals where ChR2 was expressed in pyramidal neurons of both superficial and deep cortical layers by transduction with adeno-associated virus (Figure S2). Consistent with previous results, forelimb movements could be elicited by stimulation (10 ms pulses, 0.5–10 mW or 63–1270 mW/mm2) of a broad cortical area, up to 2 mm anterior and posterior of bregma (Ayling et al., 2009Ayling O.G.S.

However, when forelimb movements were examined at stimulation sites across the motor cortex, a diversity of response types became apparent (Figures 1C–1F). Evoked movements were divided into two classes depending on the direction of forelimb movement (abduction or adduction, Figures 1D–1F). Stimulation sites that produced movements containing both abduction and adduction components were considered as regions of overlap between abduction and adduction maps. This analysis revealed a functional subdivision of the motor cortex that was not apparent from EMG-based maps, even when antagonistic muscle pairs were compared (Ayling et al., 2009Ayling O.G.S. Harrison T.C. Boyd J.D. Goroshkov A. Murphy T.H. Automated light-based mapping of motor cortex by photoactivation of channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic mice.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The motor cortex abduction representation (here termed Mab) was not different from the adduction representation in area (Mad) (4.7 ± 0.6 versus 4.9 ± 0.7 mm2, n = 14 mice), but movements evoked from the center of Mab tended to be smaller than those evoked from the center of Mad (0.2 ± 0.02 versus 0.5 ± 0.09 mm, p = 0.036 paired t test, n = 14 mice). Mab movements also began at a shorter latency from the onset of cortical stimulation (19.4 ± 0.9 versus 24.6 ± 1.5 ms, p = 0.002 paired t test, n = 14 mice) (Figure 1G). Mab was typically located anterior and lateral of Mad (Figures 2A and 2B ). Mab and Mad were both centered within the boundaries of the caudal forelimb area defined by intracortical electrical microstimulation, but frequently extended into the reported territory of the rostral forelimb area (Tennant et al., 2011Tennant K.A. Adkins D.L. Donlan N.A. Asay A.L. Thomas N. Kleim J.A. Jones T.A. The organization of the forelimb representation of the C57BL/6 mouse motor cortex as defined by intracortical microstimulation and cytoarchitecture.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The Mad portion of the forelimb map overlapped with hindlimb motor cortex to a greater extent than Mab (55.9 ± 8.7 versus 43.9 ± 7.5%, n = 14 mice, p < 0.01, paired t test). Mad was also closer than Mab to the centers of the hindlimb somatosensory representation, whereas Mab was closer than Mad to the center of the forelimb somatosensory representation (Figure 2B). Mab and Mad representations were not different in consistency, defined as the percentage of stimulus sites from which movements were evoked in all three repetitions of a composite map (8.3 ± 2.3 versus 10.8 ± 3.0%, n = 12 mice). The centers of gravity of Mab and Mad were separated from each other by an average of 0.6 ± 0.06 mm (p < 0.0001, single sample t test versus hypothetical mean 0, n = 14 mice). When a threshold was applied at 50% of each map's peak amplitude, separation between Mab and Mad increased to 1.2 ± 0.07 mm (n = 14 mice), which is comparable to the distance between the centers of forelimb and hindlimb somatosensory maps (1.2 ± 0.2 mm, n = 7 mice). These observations demonstrate that the mouse forelimb motor cortex can be reproducibly subdivided according to a simple assay of evoked movement direction. It has been proposed that long stimulus trains may be more effective than shorter bursts at producing ethologically relevant movements and identifying cortical movement representations (Graziano et al., 2005Graziano M.S.A. Aflalo T.N.S. Cooke D.F. Arm movements evoked by electrical stimulation in the motor cortex of monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4209-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Despite the ability of light-based mapping to rapidly, quantitatively, and uniformly sample the motor output of a large cortical area, the restricted sampling of forelimb displacement in our method limits the information that can be gathered about the movements generated by stimulation of any particular cortical location. To better describe the properties of the Mab and Mad motor subregions, we used a high-speed CCD camera to record forelimb movements evoked by stimulation of sites near the center of each map. In these experiments, the centers of the Mab and Mad maps were defined with the mouse lying prone and the contralateral forelimb suspended parallel to the ground (Figure 3A , left). The anesthetized mice were then moved to a sitting posture, with their heads fixed and their forelimbs hanging free (Figure 3A, center). With prolonged stimulus trains (500 ms), the forelimb tended to reach a final position within ∼300 ms and remain there for the duration of the stimulus. Stimulation of Mab caused the contralateral forelimb to be raised and then brought toward the midline, whereas stimulation of Mad typically produced rhythmic movements lower in space, often coupled with movement of the hindlimb (Figure 3B). These movements were reproduced in anesthetized mice where ChR2 was locally expressed using adeno-associated virus (Figure S2) and in awake, freely moving ChR2 transgenic mice stimulated within Mab and Mad via optical fibers (Figures 3A and 3B, right; Movie S2). In both anesthetized and awake mice, the displacement of the limb from its starting position was significantly greater when Mab was stimulated rather than Mad (Figures 3B and 3C). Although movement trajectories (Figure 3B) and displacements (Figure 3C) were clearly dependent on stimulus site for both awake and anesthetized mice, the speed profiles of Mab and Mad movements were nearly identical (Figure 3D). Movements evoked from each site were remarkably consistent from trial to trial, and the variability that they did exhibit had a temporal structure that depended on the site of stimulation (Figure S3). Increasing stimulus duration generally had little effect on movement map structure, despite changes observed in movement trajectories (Figure S4). Consistent with previous results from electrical stimulation (Ramanathan et al., 2006Ramanathan D. Conner J.M. Tuszynski M.H. A form of motor cortical plasticity that correlates with recovery of function after brain injury.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11370-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), modulating optogenetic stimulus intensity did not affect movement trajectories evoked by prolonged stimulation (Figure S5). These experiments complement the mapping study by exposing the distinct types of complex movement that can be evoked from Mab and Mad by prolonged stimulation in both anesthetized and awake mice. To determine whether these complex movements require selective stimulation of layer 5B neurons, we compared optogenetic stimulation (500 ms train of 5 ms, 5 mW pulses at 100 Hz) with trains of electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) targeted to layer 5 of cortex (500 ms trains of 200 μs, 100 μA pulses at 200 Hz) (Ramanathan et al., 2006Ramanathan D. Conner J.M. Tuszynski M.H. A form of motor cortical plasticity that correlates with recovery of function after brain injury.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11370-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Given the differences between ICMS and optogenetic stimulation, we were surprised to discover that ICMS was able to closely reproduce the complex movements characteristic of transgenic or viral optogenetic stimulation of Mab and Mad (Figure 4A , Figure S2). In addition to their overlapping trajectories, movements evoked by either method had comparable peak displacements, time to peak, and angle from origin at peak displacement (Figure 4B). Interestingly, although movements evoked by ICMS or optogenetic stimulation shared the same end point, ICMS-evoked movements were significantly slower (Figure 4C). These results suggest that the site of stimulation determines the trajectory of the resulting movement (Figure 3), whereas movement speed depends on the mechanism of stimulation (Figure 4). After characterizing the movement representations of the mouse motor cortex, we investigated their mechanistic basis. We hypothesized that the distinct movements produced by the Mab and Mad motor cortex subregions could be explained by differences either in their output projections (Rathelot and Strick, 2009Rathelot J.-A.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8432-8444PubMed Google Scholar). To test the extent to which cortical synaptic input contributes to the differences between Mab and Mad motor subregions, we compared movement trajectories generated before and after the application of glutamate receptor antagonists (CNQX 4.5 mM and MK-801 0.3 mM) or saline to the cortical surface (Figure 5A ). In the control condition Mab and Mad movements had nonoverlapping trajectories that could be distinguished by plotting the angle of the forelimb from the starting position (Figure 5B, left). Disrupting glutamatergic transmission increased the extent to which Mab and Mad trajectories overlapped, biasing both toward medial rotation (Figure 5B, right). Glutamate receptor antagonists also had a site-specific effect on speed profiles, causing a delayed increase in movement speed for Mad, but not Mab (Figure 5C). These results suggest that differences between movements evoked by prolonged stimulation of Mab and Mad may reflect variation in the patterns of glutamatergic synaptic input that these areas receive. We next examined the effects of pharmacological manipulations on the structure of motor maps evoked by brief (10 ms) pulses of light (Figures 6A and 6B ). We had initially hypothesized that blocking cortical glutamatergic transmission would eliminate the contribution of facilitatory cortico-cortical projections from regions lacking direct motor output, causing a reduction in map area. Surprisingly, we found that Mab and Mad maps tended to increase in amplitude (Figure 6B) and expand in area (Figure 6C) after application of glutamate receptor antagonists, compared with no change after application of saline vehicle. This expansion in map area was also apparent in the hindlimb motor representation (134 ± 77%, p = 0.02, n = 9, paired t test), but the expansion was most pronounced in Mad (Figure 6C). The region of overlap between abduction and adduction representations increased in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists, but was not significantly altered by application of saline (Figure 6D). Because of its influence on map area (Figures S5A and S5B), stimulus intensity was held constant within animals for all pharmacology experiments. Despite the fact that glutamate receptor antagonists caused map expansion and increased overlap between Mab and Mad, movement topography was not abolished. The Mab and Mad maps could still be distinguished in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists (Figure 6B), with no significant reduction in the separation between their centers of gravity (Figure 6D). Application of glutamate receptor antagonists did not cause a significantly greater shift in map centers from their baseline positions than application of saline for Mab (0.5 ± 0.09 versus 0.5 ± 0.1 mm, respectively, p = 0.96, n = 9 versus n = 5, t test) or Mad (0.5 ± 0.09 versus 0.2 ± 0.04 mm, respectively, p = 0.06). Although the increased movement durations (Figure 5C) and expansion of motor maps (Figure 6C) caused by disruption of excitatory synaptic transmission were unexpected, this may be explained by a loss of disynaptic inhibition (Helmstaedter et al., 2009Helmstaedter M.

To test this hypothesis, we repeated these experiments with GABAA receptor antagonists (gabazine 1 μM n = 4 or picrotoxin 100 μM n = 2, Figure S6). GABA receptor antagonists diminished differences between Mab and Mad movement trajectories, but had no significant effect on movement kinematics (Figure S6), and generally did not degrade functional subdivisions of the motor cortex. Disrupting GABAergic transmission did reproduce the increases in map amplitude (Figure S7C) and area (Figure S7D) seen during blockade of excitatory transmission. As with the delayed increase in movement speeds (Figure 5C), this effect was restricted to Mad. These effects are consistent with disinhibition causing the selective expansion of the Mad subregion. The separation between Mab and Mad and the region of overlap between them was unchanged (Figure S7E). Like glutamate receptor antagonists, GABA receptor antagonists did not cause greater displacement of map centers than saline treatment for Mab (0.6 ± 0.1 versus 0.5 ± 0.1 mm, p = 0.37, n = 6 versus n = 5, t test) or Mad (0.4 ± 0.1 ve"

Neonatal lethality of mice lacking the Pcdh-γ gene cluster has, however, precluded analysis of many brain regions. Here, we use a conditional Pcdh-γ allele to restrict mutation to the cerebral cortex and find that, in contrast to other central nervous system phenotypes, loss of γ-Pcdhs in cortical neurons does not affect their survival or result in reduced synaptic density. Instead, mutant cortical neurons exhibit severely reduced dendritic arborization. Mutant cortices have aberrantly high levels of protein kinase C (PKC) activity and of phosphorylated (inactive) myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate, a PKC target that promotes arborization. Dendrite complexity can be rescued in Pcdh-γ mutant neurons by inhibiting PKC, its upstream activator phospholipase C, or the γ-Pcdh binding partner focal adhesion kinase. Our results reveal a distinct role for the γ-Pcdhs in cortical development and identify a signaling pathway through which they play this role."

One hundred years of positional information.Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Protein gradients exist in many developing systems (reviewed in Rogers and Schier, 2011Rogers K.W. Schier A.F. Morphogen gradients: from generation to interpretation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 377-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), but it is not clear how many concentration thresholds can be provided by a single gradient, or how gradients contribute to the robust systems that ensure body plan consistency within species. In Drosophila a network of transcription factors establishes the body plan along the anterior posterior (AP) axis. At the top of this network is the Bicoid (Bcd) gradient, which is formed by diffusion from a localized RNA source near the anterior pole (Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988bDriever W.

The gradient morphogen bicoid is a concentration-dependent transcriptional activator.Cell. 1989; 57: 1259-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Posterior boundaries of these bands and stripes are precisely registered along the AP axis, foreshadowing the organization of the mature body plan. Several experiments suggest that Bcd functions as a morphogen. For example, increasing bcd gene copy number shifts the posterior boundaries of Bcd-dependent target genes (Gao et al., 1996Gao Q. Wang Y. Finkelstein R. Orthodenticle regulation during embryonic head development in Drosophila.Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Struhl et al., 1989Struhl G.

Nüsslein-Volhard C. The bicoid protein determines position in the Drosophila embryo in a concentration-dependent manner.Cell. 1988; 54: 95-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). With six or seven copies of bcd, the posterior shifts are very dramatic, but remarkably, the embryos survive to fertile adulthood due to compensation mechanisms (Namba et al., 1997Namba R. Pazdera T.M. Cerrone R.L. Minden J.S. Drosophila embryonic pattern repair: how embryos respond to bicoid dosage alteration.Development. 1997; 124: 1393-1403PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the absolute positioning of individual boundaries with respect to the embryonic poles is not essential for development (in the lab). In recent years more direct challenges to the Bcd morphogen hypothesis have arisen in the literature. First, boundary shifts caused by copy number changes are less dramatic than predicted by the threshold model (Gao and Finkelstein, 1998Gao Q. Finkelstein R. Targeting gene expression to the head: the Drosophila orthodenticle gene is a direct target of the Bicoid morphogen.Development. 1998; 125: 4185-4193PubMed Google Scholar, Gao et al., 1996Gao Q.

Establishment of developmental precision and proportions in the early Drosophila embryo.Nature. 2002; 415: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Second, there is no strong correlation between boundary position and the Bcd-binding strength of target gene enhancers (Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2005Ochoa-Espinosa A. Yucel G. Kaplan L. Pare A. Pura N. Oberstein A. Papatsenko D. Small S. The role of binding site cluster strength in Bicoid-dependent patterning in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Predicting expression patterns from regulatory sequence in Drosophila segmentation.Nature. 2008; 451: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Thus, differential binding sensitivity to Bcd is not the primary design principle that positions Bcd-dependent expression boundaries. To test the Bcd morphogen hypothesis, we recently used genetic experiments to significantly flatten the Bcd gradient (Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2009Ochoa-Espinosa A. Yu D. Tsirigos A. Struffi P. Small S. Anterior-posterior positional information in the absence of a strong Bicoid gradient.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We further altered Bcd concentration by changing bcd gene copy number. Bcd target genes responded to the flattened gradients in two ways. Three target genes (the head gap genes orthodenticle [otd], empty spiracles [ems], and buttonhead [btd]) formed correctly ordered expression domains with shifted but well-defined posterior boundaries. Three other target genes (the trunk gap genes giant [gt], hunchback [hb], and Kruppel [Kr]), responded in an all or none fashion to the flattened gradients of Bcd. Very low levels of Bcd could activate zygotic hb and Kr, but approximately twice as much was required for activation of gt (Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2009Ochoa-Espinosa A. Yu D. Tsirigos A. Struffi P. Small S. Anterior-posterior positional information in the absence of a strong Bicoid gradient.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Importantly, all six tested target genes were activated by less Bcd than the amounts present at their boundary positions in wild-type embryos. Thus, it was suggested that Bcd concentrations are in excess at every position within the wild-type gradient. Why are target gene boundaries formed in regions where there is more Bcd than the minimal amount required for activation? Perhaps repressors present in middle regions of the embryo can set boundaries of Bcd-dependent expression patterns. For example the Capicua (Cic) repressor is required for setting the posterior boundaries of Bcd target genes that are expressed in the future cephalic region (Löhr et al., 2009Löhr U. Chung H.R. Beller M. Jäckle H. Antagonistic action of Bicoid and the repressor Capicua determines the spatial limits of Drosophila head gene expression domains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21695-21700Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Also, the Kr repressor sets the posterior boundaries of sloppy-paired 1 (slp1) and even-skipped (eve) stripe 2 (Andrioli et al., 2004Andrioli L.P. Oberstein A.L. Corado M.S. Yu D. Small S.

However, it is not clear whether these repressive activities correctly order boundaries of different target genes. Here, we describe a systems approach to better understand the Bcd-dependent patterning system. We use bioinformatics, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Chip data and in vivo reporter gene assays to collect and verify 66 Bcd-dependent enhancers and sequence mining to identify overrepresented motifs that correlate with boundary positioning. One prominent motif is a binding site for Runt (Run) protein, which is expressed in a transient-graded pattern that directly opposes the Bcd gradient (Gergen and Butler, 1988Gergen J.P. Butler B.A. Isolation of the Drosophila segmentation gene runt and analysis of its expression during embryogenesis.Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We show that Run functions with Cic and Kr to limit Bcd-dependent activation and that repression is required for correctly ordering target gene boundaries. To further understand the relationship between Bcd binding and embryo patterning, we collected a relatively large set of Bcd-dependent regulatory elements, starting with 34 enhancers that were previously validated in the literature (see Table S1 available online). We used two sets of criteria for predicting Bcd-dependent enhancers in genomic sequences: published ChIP-Chip data for Bcd (Li et al., 2008Li X.Y. MacArthur S. Bourgon R. Nix D. Pollard D.A. Iyer V.N. Hechmer A. Simirenko L. Stapleton M. Luengo Hendriks C.L. et al.Transcription factors bind thousands of active and inactive regions in the Drosophila blastoderm.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e27Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and a clustering algorithm that determines Bcd-binding motif density (Lifanov et al., 2003Lifanov A.P. Makeev V.J. Nazina A.G. Papatsenko D.A. Homotypic regulatory clusters in Drosophila.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Candidate enhancers were attached to a lacZ reporter gene and targeted to a specific genomic location selected for its clean background and high activation level (Bateman et al., 2006Bateman J.R. Lee A.M. Wu C.T. Site-specific transformation of Drosophila via phiC31 integrase-mediated cassette exchange.Genetics. 2006; 173: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar; Figure S1). The ChIP-Chip data show nearly 700 genomic regions that bind Bcd in the embryo with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% (Li et al., 2008Li X.Y. MacArthur S. Bourgon R. Nix D. Pollard D.A. Iyer V.N. Hechmer A. Simirenko L. Stapleton M. Luengo Hendriks C.L. et al.Transcription factors bind thousands of active and inactive regions in the Drosophila blastoderm.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e27Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Of the 34 previously known Bcd-dependent enhancers, 22 map to genomic regions that appear in the 50 strongest ChIP-Chip signals. We therefore tested fragments (HC_01–HC_33) from all remaining regions in the top 50 list (see Experimental Procedures; Figure 1A ). Remarkably, 28 of the 33 tested fragments drove expression during nuclear cycle 14 (NC14) (Figures 1B and S1). Crossing these reporter genes into embryos lacking bcd showed that the expression patterns of 24 of the 28 were either completely abolished (18) or shifted anteriorly (6), confirming their dependence on Bcd (Figure S2).Figure S2Bcd Dependence of Selected Transgenes, Related to Figure 1Show full captionlacZ RNA patterns for each enhancer are shown in wild-type (wt) and embryos produced by bcd homozygous mutant females (bcd-).(A) Reporter genes that require bcd for activation.(B) Reporter genes that require bcd for correct boundary positioning.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) lacZ RNA patterns for each enhancer are shown in wild-type (wt) and embryos produced by bcd homozygous mutant females (bcd-). (A) Reporter genes that require bcd for activation. (B) Reporter genes that require bcd for correct boundary positioning. The homotypic-clustering model (Experimental Procedures) identified 221 genomic regions with high densities of Bcd site motifs. Of the 34 previously known enhancers, this model correctly predicted 15, but 5 of these do not overlap with the top 50 ChIP-Chip signals (Figure 1A). Thus, we used the clustering model to filter the list of 1% FDR ChIP-Chip signals below the top 50 and tested 25 fragments contained in both sets (HC_34–HC_58). Of these elements, 8 drove Bcd-dependent expression in the early embryo, bringing the total number of known Bcd-dependent enhancers to 66. We also tested 19 elements predicted by the clustering model that do not appear in the ChIP-Chip list (HC_59–HC_77). None directed expression in the early embryo, despite having what appear to be strong clusters of Bcd-binding sites (see Discussion). During early NC14 the 66 Bcd-dependent enhancers drive expression patterns with boundaries at a large number of positions along the AP axis (Figure 2A ). Six enhancers (type 0) drive reporter expression patterns (green) that are limited to the anterior-most 25% of the embryo (100%–75% embryo length [EL]; 100% = the anterior pole), which corresponds to the unsegmented region near the anterior pole. A total of 33 enhancers (type I) establish expression boundaries (orange) in the region between 75% and 65% EL (Figure 2A). The posterior-most boundary in this group is formed by the eve stripe 1 enhancer, which marks the cephalic furrow, the division between the presumptive head and thorax. Finally, 27 enhancers (type II) form boundaries in embryonic regions posterior to the cephalic furrow (Figure 2A, blue). If repressors present in middle regions of the embryo help set boundary positions of type I patterns, their binding sites might be overrepresented in type I enhancers. By contrast, these same binding sites should be lacking or underrepresented in type II enhancers, which drive expression in regions where repressors might be present. We used an enumerative method to evaluate the distribution of all possible hexamers in the sequences of type I and type II enhancers. Then, we used an exact binomial test (Experimental Procedures) to assess significance of hexamer count differences between the two types. At a stringent cutoff p value (0.005), only six hexamers are significantly overrepresented in type I enhancers compared to type II enhancers (Figure 2B). The top four can also be aligned, producing a composite hexamer ACCRCA (Figure 2B). We also applied a discriminative motif discovery tool (DREME) to search type I enhancers by using type II enhancers as negative filter (Experimental Procedures). A motif that contains the ACCRCA core was discovered (Figure 2C), which shows a very high similarity to canonical binding motifs for Run domain proteins (Melnikova et al., 1993Melnikova I.N. Crute B.E. Wang S. Speck N.A. Sequence specificity of the core-binding factor.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including Drosophila Run and human Runx1 (Figure 2D). We then checked the distribution of Run-binding sites in all Bcd-dependent enhancers by using the Drosophila Run-binding motif (Figure 2E). High-affinity Run-binding sites (with matching p < 0.0005) are significantly enriched in type I enhancers (p < 10−7; one-tail Poisson) and underrepresented in type II (p = 0.0026). We also calculated a cutoff-free index (Stubb score; Sinha et al., 2006Sinha S. Liang Y. Siggia E. Stubb: a program for discovery and analysis of cis-regulatory modules.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W555-W559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which represents integrated input over all potential Run sites. Type I enhancers show significantly higher Stubb scores than type II enhancers (Figure 2E). Finally, we checked the ChIP-Chip data, which show Run binding to 82% of type I enhancers, but only to 50% of type II, with generally weaker signals (Figure S3). run was identified as a pair-rule mutation (Gergen and Wieschaus, 1985Gergen J.P. Wieschaus E.F. The localized requirements for a gene affecting segmentation in Drosophila: analysis of larvae mosaic for runt.Dev. Biol. 1985; 109: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and is expressed in a seven-striped pattern in NC14 embryos (Gergen and Butler, 1988Gergen J.P. Butler B.A. Isolation of the Drosophila segmentation gene runt and analysis of its expression during embryogenesis.Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, run is first expressed ubiquitously in NC10 embryos and then repressed in anterior-most regions in NC12, forming a broad domain in middle regions that lasts until very early in NC14 (Figure 2F). Run protein at the anterior edge of this domain forms a gradient that directly opposes the Bcd gradient, consistent with a potential role as a repressor. To test this, we used a hs-run transgene to induce ubiquitous expression in early NC14 (Tsai and Gergen, 1994Tsai C. Gergen J.P. Gap gene properties of the pair-rule gene runt during Drosophila segmentation.Development. 1994; 120: 1671-1683PubMed Google Scholar). This caused a strong repression of reporter gene expression driven by all 15 tested type I enhancers (Figure 3B ; data not shown). In contrast, patterns driven by all tested type 0 (two) and type II (seven) enhancers were not detectably altered in embryos with ubiquitously expressed Run (Figures 3A and 3C; data not shown). To test whether Run-binding sites are sufficient for establishing posterior boundaries, we introduced one, two, or three Run-binding sites into a type II enhancer from the hb gene (hbP2-lacZ, Figures 3D–3H; Table S2). The hbP2 enhancer contains four high-affinity Bcd-binding sites (p < .0005), but no native Run-binding sites, and forms a posterior boundary at ∼55% EL. Adding Run sites to this enhancer progressively shifted the posterior boundary of hbP2-lacZ expression toward the anterior (Figures 3E–3G). We also constructed a hbP2-lacZ reporter gene in which the nucleotides we changed to insert Run sites were mutated to other nucleotides (Figure 3H). The posterior boundary formed by this reporter appears at a position very similar to that formed by the wild-type enhancer (Figure 3D). Finally, we crossed all hbP2-lacZ reporter genes into run mutants (Figures 3D–3G; data not shown). This caused posterior expansions of patterns driven by reporters containing Run sites (Figures 3E–3G), but no change in the patterns driven by the wild-type and the scrambled site reporter. Finally, we inserted Run-binding sites into a second type II enhancer (HC_01, Figure 1B; Table S2), which caused an anterior shift of the posterior boundary similar to that seen with the hbP2-lacZ reporter (Figure S4). Together, these experiments show that direct Run binding can set Bcd-dependent boundaries. We next tested whether endogenous Run sets posterior boundaries of real Bcd target genes by examining expression patterns in run mutant embryos. Consistent with previous results, loss of run caused ectopic expression of the head gap gene otd in the posterior part of the embryo (Figure 4A ). Careful measurements revealed that the posterior boundary of the anterior otd expression domain also shifts posteriorly by ∼3% in run mutants. This shift was more significant in early NC14 embryos (68.9% ± 1.8% EL in run [n = 10] compared to 72.2% ± 1.6% EL in wild-type [n = 48]) but was still detectable in mid-NC14 embryos (Figure 4A). Other anterior genes regulated by type I enhancers, including ems (Figure 4B) and slp1 and slp2, also showed similar boundary shifts in run− embryos (Figure S5).Figure S5Repression-Dependent Bcd Target Expression Patterns, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A–F) Expression patterns of endogenous Bcd target genes are shown in wild-type (wt), run3 mutant, cic1 mutant, and run3 cic1 double mutant embryos as indicated.

In (A), (E) and (F), embryos were costained for run (red stars) for genotyping. In (D), embryos were costained for otd (red contours) to distinguish run3 mutants. We also examined a reporter gene containing the otd EHE enhancer in run mutants (Figure 4C). The pattern driven by this enhancer showed an expansion similar to that seen for the endogenous otd gene. This enhancer contains seven Run-binding sites; we mutated these sites (Table S2), which caused a posterior shift of the expression boundary similar to that seen for the wild-type enhancer in run mutants (Figure 4C). The boundary shifts of endogenous expression patterns observed in run mutants (Figures 4 and S5) are modest (∼3% EL) compared to the dramatic shift (∼15% EL) observed when the hbP2-lacZ reporter gene with three inserted Run sites was crossed into the same mutants. One explanation is that the otd EHE contains weak Bcd-binding sites that do not support activation in more posterior regions. Alternatively, type I enhancers may receive inputs from other transcription repressors, in particular Cic and/or Kr. We tested this by genetically removing both run and maternal Cic, which also causes a severe reduction in Kr levels (Ajuria et al., 2011Ajuria L. Nieva C. Winkler C. Kuo D. Samper N. Andreu M.J. Helman A. González-Crespo S. Paroush Z. Courey A.J. Jiménez G. Capicua DNA-binding sites are general response elements for RTK signaling in Drosophila.Development. 2011; 138: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This double mutant caused more dramatic expansions of head gap patterns than observed in either single mutant (Figure S5). To test whether the correct registry of gene expression boundaries is affected in these mutants, we performed multiplex FISH experiments to simultaneously detect three Bcd-dependent expression patterns. We compared otd, slp1, and gt (anterior domain), which have well-separated posterior boundaries (Figures 5A and 5E). In single run or cic mutants, there were noticeable posterior shifts of all three boundaries, but no change in their spatial order (Figures 5B, 5C, 5F, and 5G). In the double mutant, however, the increased expansions of otd and slp1 extended to a point where they completely overlapped with the gt posterior boundary (Figures 5D and 5H). To test whether overlapping boundaries disrupt AP segment formation in the cephalic region, we assayed expression of engrailed (en), a segment polarity gene expressed in five anterior domains that mark anlage for cephalic segments (Figure 5I). In single run or cic mutants, all five expression domains were still detectable (Figures 5J and 5K). However, in double-mutant embryos only a single expression pattern was observed (Figure 5L). These results suggest that the double mutant causes drastic head defects, consistent with the loss of normally registered expression boundaries. Also, because the amplitude and shape of the Bcd gradient appear unchanged from wild-type in all mutant embryos (Figure S6), we conclude that the formation of specific head segments and the spatial registration of multiple Bcd-dependent expression boundaries are formed primarily by antagonistic repression of the Bcd gradient. Repression by Run and Cic provides a mechanism that is consistent with the idea that boundaries of Bcd target genes are normally set in positions where Bcd concentrations are in excess of those required for activation. We previously showed that boundaries of some target genes (the type I genes otd, ems, and btd) are correctly ordered in double-mutant (exuperantia vasa [exu vas]) embryos that flatten the Bcd gradient (Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2009Ochoa-Espinosa A. Yu D. Tsirigos A. Struffi P. Small S. Anterior-posterior positional information in the absence of a strong Bicoid gradient.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Are Run and/or Cic involved in setting these boundaries? In addition to the anterior expression domains of otd, ems, and btd, exu vas mutant embryos show posterior stripes of all three genes, arranged with anterior boundaries in mirror image to the order of boundaries in anterior regions (Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2009Ochoa-Espinosa A. Yu D. Tsirigos A. Struffi P. Small S. Anterior-posterior positional information in the absence of a strong Bicoid gradient.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the terminal system functions through a graded phosphorylation cascade at both poles (Furriols and Casanova, 2003Furriols M. Casanova J. In and out of Torso RTK signalling.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it could in principle account for the observed mirror image expression patterns (Gao et al., 1996Gao Q. Wang Y. Finkelstein R. Orthodenticle regulation during embryonic head development in Drosophila.Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test this, we used a triple-mutant chromosome (evt) that contains exu, vas, and a null mutation of torso (tor), which encodes the terminal system receptor, and varied bcd copy number (Figures 6A–6D ). The additional removal of the terminal system completely abolished the posterior otd, ems, and btd stripes observed in exu vas embryos, but each target gene was still expressed in an anterior domain with a sharp posterior expression boundary (Figures 6G–6I, 6L–6N, and 6Q–6S). In embryos with six copies of bcd, boundaries were established very near the center of the embryo (Figures 6G, 6L, and 6Q); reducing bcd copy number shifted these boundaries to more anterior positions (Figures 6H, 6I, 6M, 6N, 6R, and 6S). Because the gradient of Cic-repressive activity is abolished in terminal system mutants (Jiménez et al., 2000Jiménez G. Guichet A. Ephrussi A. Casanova J. Relief of gene repression by torso RTK signaling: role of capicua in Drosophila terminal and dorsoventral patterning.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 224-231PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely that Cic-mediated repression is involved in forming these boundaries. Thus, we assayed the run RNA expression pattern in evt embryos. run is indeed expressed, and the anterior run boundary, normally positioned at ∼65%EL (Figure 6U), shifts with bcd copy number in the evt mutan"

https://openalex.org/W1989083413,"During heat shock stress, importin β family-mediated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is downregulated, whereas nuclear import of the molecular chaperone Hsp70s is upregulated. Here, we identify a nuclear import pathway that operates during heat shock stress and is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved protein named “Hikeshi,” which does not belong to the importin β family. Hikeshi binds to FG-Nups and translocates through nuclear pores on its own, showing characteristic features of nuclear transport carriers. In reconstituted transport, Hikeshi supports the nuclear import of the ATP form of Hsp70s, but not the ADP form, indicating the importance of the Hsp70 ATPase cycle in the import cycle. In living cells, depletion of Hikeshi inhibits heat shock-induced nuclear import of Hsp70s, reduces cell viability after heat shock stress, and significantly delays the attenuation and reversion of multiple heat shock-induced nuclear phenotypes. Nuclear Hsp70s rescue the effect of Hikeshi depletion at least in part. Thus, Hsp70s counteract heat shock-induced damage by acting inside of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2090156860,"Animals are not passive spectators of the sensory world in which they live. In natural conditions they often sense objects on the bases of expectations initiated by predictive cues. Expectation profoundly modulates neural activity by altering the background state of cortical networks and modulating sensory processing. The link between these two effects is not known. Here, we studied how cue-triggered expectation of stimulus availability influences processing of sensory stimuli in the gustatory cortex (GC). We found that expected tastants were coded more rapidly than unexpected stimuli. The faster onset of sensory coding related to anticipatory priming of GC by associative auditory cues. Simultaneous recordings and pharmacological manipulations of GC and basolateral amygdala revealed the role of top-down inputs in mediating the effects of anticipatory cues. Altogether, these data provide a model for how cue-triggered expectation changes the state of sensory cortices to achieve rapid processing of natural stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1974868752,"c-Myc is a proto-oncogenic transcription factor and its rapid turnover mediated by the ubiquitin–proteasome system is critical for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis. Multiple ubiquitin ligases have been assigned for c-Myc regulation till date. However, the available data suggest for the possible existence of additional E3 ligase(s). Here, we report a new E3 ligase for c-Myc, the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein or CHIP, which is a chaperone-associated Ubox-containing E3 ligase. In this report, we show that CHIP interacts and ubiquitinates c-Myc, thus targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation. Overexpression of CHIP could accelerate the turnover rate of c-Myc protein. Conversely, knockdown of CHIP by RNAi stabilizes endogenous c-Myc. The interaction between CHIP and c-Myc depends on the N-terminally located tetratricopeptide repeats of CHIP, which has been implicated as a chaperone-binding motif. Inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone activity by 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin reduces c-Myc protein level. We found that the association between CHIP and c-Myc is dependent on the chaperones; particularly Hsp70. CHIP antagonizes the transcriptional activity of c-Myc and decreases the abundance of the transcripts of its target genes. Overall, CHIP-knockdown increases malignant behavior of C6 glioma cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of c-Myc being regulated by a bona-fide chaperone-associated E3 ligase in HEK293 as well as glioma cells. Because CHIP has been reported earlier to be negatively regulating Akt1, BCR-ABL and hTERT, and now c-Myc, the present study may strengthen the view that CHIP acts as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2091850057,"Multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) that target the osteogenic Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) define an interrelated network of miRNAs that control osteoblastogenesis.

Here, we find that seven RUNX2-targeting miRNAs (miR-23a, miR-30c, miR-34c, miR-133a, miR-135a, miR-205, and miR-217) also regulate the chondrogenic GATA transcription factor tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome I (TRPS1). Although the efficacy of each miRNA to target RUNX2 or TRPS1 differs in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, each effectively blocks maturation of precommitted osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Furthermore, these miRNAs can redirect mesenchymal stem cells into adipogenic cell fate with concomitant up-regulation of key lineage-specific transcription factors. Thus, a program of multiple miRNAs controls mesenchymal lineage progression by selectively blocking differentiation of osteoblasts and chondrocytes to control skeletal development."
https://openalex.org/W2069232168,"Functional neural circuit formation during development involves massive elimination of redundant synapses. In the cerebellum, one-to-one connection from excitatory climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) is established by elimination of early-formed surplus CFs. This process depends on glutamatergic excitatory inputs, but contribution of GABAergic transmission remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate impaired CF synapse elimination in mouse models with diminished GABAergic transmission by mutation of a single allele for the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD67, by conditional deletion of GAD67 from PCs and GABAergic interneurons or by pharmacological inhibition of cerebellar GAD activity. The impaired CF synapse elimination was rescued by enhancing GABA(A) receptor sensitivity in the cerebellum by locally applied diazepam. Our electrophysiological and Ca2+ imaging data suggest that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition onto the PC soma from molecular layer interneurons influences CF-induced Ca2+ transients in the soma and regulates CF synapse elimination from postnatal day 10 (P10) to around P16."

Allergen exposure upregulated IL-25 and induced type 2 cytokine production in a previously undescribed granulocytic population, termed type 2 myeloid (T2M) cells. Il17rb(-/-) mice showed reduced lung pathology after chronic allergen exposure and decreased type 2 cytokine production in T2M cells and CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Airway instillation of IL-25 induced IL-4 and IL-13 production in T2M cells, demonstrating their importance in eliciting T cell-independent inflammation. The adoptive transfer of T2M cells reconstituted IL-25-mediated responses in Il17rb(-/-) mice. High-dose dexamethasone treatment did not reduce the IL-25-induced T2M pulmonary response. Finally, a similar IL-4- and IL-13-producing granulocytic population was identified in peripheral blood of human subjects with asthma.

TGD2 was previously shown to be in a complex of >500 kDa. We demonstrate that this complex also contains TGD1 and -3 and is very stable because it cannot be broken down by gentle denaturants to form a ""core"" complex similar in size to standard ABC transporters. The complex was purified from Pisum sativum (pea) chloroplast envelopes by native gel electrophoresis and examined by mass spectrometry. Identified proteins besides TGD1, -2, or -3 included a potassium efflux antiporter and a TIM17/22/23 family protein, but these were shown to be in separate high molecular mass complexes.

Functional rescue of neurotransmission required expression of enzymatically active Fic on capitate projections of glia cells, but not neurons, supporting a role in the recycling of the visual neurotransmitter histamine. Histamine levels were reduced in the lamina of Fic null flies, and dietary histamine partially restored ON transients. These findings establish a previously unknown regulatory mechanism in visual neurotransmission and provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence for a role of glial capitate projections in neurotransmitter recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2048964173,"It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein), which is associated with the ribosome under hypoxic conditions. A Δ3935 mutant phenocopies the ΔdosR mutant during hypoxia, and complementation of ΔdosR with the MSMEG_3935 gene leads to complete recovery of dosR mutant phenotypes during hypoxia. We suggest that this protein is named ribosome-associated factor under hypoxia (RafH) and that it is the major factor responsible for DosR-mediated hypoxic survival in mycobacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2076326092,"Aggressive cancers often express E-cadherin in cytoplasmic vesicles rather than on the plasma membrane and this may contribute to the invasive phenotype of these tumors. Therapeutic strategies are not currently available that restore the anti-invasive function of E-cadherin in cancers. MDA-MB-231 cells are a frequently used model of invasive triple-negative breast cancer, and these cells express low levels of E-cadherin that is mislocalized to cytoplasmic vesicles. MDA-MB-231 cell lines stably expressing wild-type E-cadherin or E-cadherin fused to glutathione S-transferase or green fluorescent protein were used as experimental systems to probe the mechanisms responsible for cytoplasmic E-cadherin localization in invasive cancers. Although E-cadherin expression partly reduced cell invasion in vitro, E-cadherin was largely localized to the cytoplasm and did not block the invasiveness of the corresponding orthotopic xenograft tumors. Further studies indicated that the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the highly potent class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor largazole cooperated to induce E-cadherin localization to the plasma membrane in triple-negative breast cancers, and to suppress cellular invasion in vitro. Dexamethasone blocked the production of the cleaved form of the CDCP1 (that is, CUB domain-containing protein 1) protein (cCDCP1) previously implicated in the pro-invasive activities of CDCP1 by upregulating the serine protease inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. E-cadherin preferentially associated with cCDCP1 compared with the full-length form. In contrast, largazole did not influence CDCP1 cleavage, but increased the association of E-cadherin with γ-catenin. This effect on E-cadherin/γ-catenin complexes was shared with the nonisoform selective HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA), although largazole upregulated endogenous E-cadherin levels more strongly than TSA. These results demonstrate that glucocorticoids and HDAC inhibitors, both of which are currently in clinical use, cooperate to suppress the invasiveness of breast cancer cells through novel, complementary mechanisms that converge on E-cadherin."
https://openalex.org/W2163048796,"How mutant prion protein (PrP) leads to neurological dysfunction in genetic prion diseases is unknown. Tg(PG14) mice synthesize a misfolded mutant PrP which is partially retained in the neuronal endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As these mice age, they develop ataxia and massive degeneration of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Here, we report that motor behavioral deficits in Tg(PG14) mice emerge before neurodegeneration and are associated with defective glutamate exocytosis from granule neurons due to impaired calcium dynamics. We found that mutant PrP interacts with the voltage-gated calcium channel α(2)δ-1 subunit, which promotes the anterograde trafficking of the channel. Owing to ER retention of mutant PrP, α(2)δ-1 accumulates intracellularly, impairing delivery of the channel complex to the cell surface. Thus, mutant PrP disrupts cerebellar glutamatergic neurotransmission by reducing the number of functional channels in CGNs. These results link intracellular PrP retention to synaptic dysfunction, indicating new modalities of neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2168526169,"Adult neurogenesis occurs throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus and is essential for memory and mood control. There is significant interest in identifying ways to promote neurogenesis and ensure maintenance of these hippocampal functions. Previous work with a synthetic small molecule, isoxazole 9 (Isx-9), highlighted its neuronal-differentiating properties in vitro. However, the ability of Isx-9 to drive neurogenesis in vivo or improve hippocampal function was unknown. Here we show that Isx-9 promotes neurogenesis in vivo, enhancing the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) neuroblasts, and the dendritic arborization of adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons. Isx-9 also improves hippocampal function, enhancing memory in the Morris water maze. Notably, Isx-9 enhances neurogenesis and memory without detectable increases in cellular or animal activity or vascularization. Molecular exploration of Isx-9-induced regulation of neurogenesis (via FACS and microarray of SGZ stem and progenitor cells) suggested the involvement of the myocyte-enhancer family of proteins (Mef2). Indeed, transgenic-mediated inducible knockout of all brain-enriched Mef2 isoforms (Mef2a/c/d) specifically from neural stem cells and their progeny confirmed Mef2′s requirement for Isx-9-induced increase in hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, Isx-9 enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and memory in vivo, and its effects are reliant on Mef2, revealing a novel cell-intrinsic molecular pathway regulating adult neurogenesis.—Petrik, D., Jiang, Y., Birnbaum, S.

https://openalex.org/W2079909703,"Although many cancers initially respond to cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy, resistance frequently develops. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) silencing by promoter methylation is involved in the CDDP-acquired resistance process in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Our purpose is to design a translational-based profile to predict resistance in NSCLC by studying the role of IGFBP-3 in the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. We have first examined the relationship between IGFBP-3 expression regulated by promoter methylation and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGFIR) and PI3K/AKT pathways in 10 human cancer cell lines and 25 NSCLC patients with known IGFBP-3 methylation status and response to CDDP. Then, to provide a helpful tool that enables clinicians to identify patients with a potential response to CDDP, we have calculated the association between our diagnostic test and the true outcome of analyzed samples in terms of cisplatin IC50; the inhibitory concentration that kills 50% of the cell population. Our results suggest that loss of IGFBP-3 expression by promoter methylation in tumor cells treated with CDDP may activate the PI3K/AKT pathway through the specific derepression of IGFIR signaling, inducing resistance to CDDP. This study also provides a predictive test for clinical practice with an accuracy and precision of 0.84 and 0.9, respectively, (P=0.0062). We present a biomarker test that could provide clinicians with a robust tool with which to decide on the use of CDDP, improving patient clinical outcomes."

Using high-fidelity imaging of pHluorin-tagged vesicular monoamine transporter 2 in dopamine neurons, we found that exocytosis was more loosely coupled to calcium entry than in fast synapses. In ventral tegmental area neurons, this allows exocytosis to be efficiently controlled by a native fast calcium buffer, calbindin-D28k, maintaining a lower vesicular release probability compared with substantia nigra neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2156676526,"Substrates used to culture human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are typically 2-dimensional (2-D) in nature, with limited ability to recapitulate in vivo-like 3-dimensional (3-D) microenvironments. We examined critical determinants of hESC self-renewal in poly-d-lysine-pretreated synthetic polymer-based substrates with variable microgeometries, including planar 2-D films, macroporous 3-D sponges, and microfibrous 3-D fiber mats. Completely synthetic 2-D substrates and 3-D macroporous scaffolds failed to retain hESCs or support self-renewal or differentiation. However, synthetic microfibrous geometries made from electrospun polymer fibers were found to promote cell adhesion, viability, proliferation, self-renewal, and directed differentiation of hESCs in the absence of any exogenous matrix proteins. Mechanistic studies of hESC adhesion within microfibrous scaffolds indicated that enhanced cell confinement in such geometries increased cell-cell contacts and altered colony organization. Moreover, the microfibrous scaffolds also induced hESCs to deposit and organize extracellular matrix proteins like laminin such that the distribution of laminin was more closely associated with the cells than the Matrigel treatment, where the laminin remained associated with the coated fibers. The production of and binding to laminin was critical for formation of viable hESC colonies on synthetic fibrous scaffolds. Thus, synthetic substrates with specific 3-D microgeometries can support hESC colony formation, self-renewal, and directed differentiation to multiple lineages while obviating the stringent needs for complex, exogenous matrices. Similar scaffolds could serve as tools for developmental biology studies in 3-D and for stem cell differentiation in situ and transplantation using defined humanized conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2093083290,"The vertebrate-restricted carcinoembryonic antigen gene family evolves extremely rapidly. Among their widely expressed members, the mammal-specific, secreted CEACAM16 is exceptionally well conserved and specifically expressed in the inner ear. To elucidate a potential auditory function, we inactivated murine Ceacam16 by homologous recombination. In young Ceacam16(-/-) mice the hearing threshold for frequencies below 10 kHz and above 22 kHz was raised. This hearing impairment progressed with age. A similar phenotype is observed in hearing-impaired members of Family 1070 with non-syndromic autosomal dominant hearing loss (DFNA4) who carry a missense mutation in CEACAM16. CEACAM16 was found in interdental and Deiters cells and was deposited in the tectorial membrane of the cochlea between postnatal days 12 and 15, when hearing starts in mice. In cochlear sections of Ceacam16(-/-) mice tectorial membranes were significantly more often stretched out as compared with wild-type mice where they were mostly contracted and detached from the outer hair cells. Homotypic cell sorting observed after ectopic cell surface expression of the carboxyl-terminal immunoglobulin variable-like N2 domain of CEACAM16 indicated that CEACAM16 can interact in trans. Furthermore, Western blot analyses of CEACAM16 under reducing and non-reducing conditions demonstrated oligomerization via unpaired cysteines. Taken together, CEACAM16 can probably form higher order structures with other tectorial membrane proteins such as α-tectorin and β-tectorin and influences the physical properties of the tectorial membrane. Evolution of CEACAM16 might have been an important step for the specialization of the mammalian cochlea, allowing hearing over an extended frequency range."
https://openalex.org/W2014115244,"The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a hypoxia regulated gene that has a variety of tumorigenic functions. In clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC), hypoxic signaling is constitutively active because of the frequent loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein. We therefore sought to assess the expression of MIF in CCRC and its biological functions. We stained tumor tissue microarrays comprising sections of 128 CCRC tumors and found MIF to be moderately or highly expressed in >98%. MIF expression was further found to be dramatically elevated in blood plasma of individuals with CCRC compared with healthy controls, suggesting that measurement of MIF levels in the blood may have utility as a diagnostic marker in CCRC. At a functional level, MIF has been reported to engage the CD74 and CD44 receptors and induce signal transduction. In CCRC cell lines, depletion of MIF, CD74 or CD44 by small hairpin RNA led to a significant reduction in growth rate, and clonogenic survival, coinciding with the degree of knockdown. Interruption of the MIF pathway also decreased tumorigenic potential. Biochemically, we found that in CCRC cells MIF signaling leads to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and to Src phosphorylation, which is critical for regulation of p27. Together, our studies establish MIF as a protumorigenic signaling molecule that functions in an autocrine fashion to promote renal cell carcinoma and may be useful as a minimally invasive marker of disease status."
https://openalex.org/W2071858898,"In female mouse embryos, somatic cells undergo a random form of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), whereas extraembryonic trophoblast cells in the placenta undergo imprinted XCI, silencing exclusively the paternal X chromosome. Initiation of imprinted XCI requires a functional maternal allele of the X-linked gene Rnf12, which encodes the ubiquitin ligase Rnf12/RLIM. We find that knockout (KO) of Rnf12 in female mammary glands inhibits alveolar differentiation and milk production upon pregnancy, with alveolar cells that lack RLIM undergoing apoptosis as they begin to differentiate. Genetic analyses demonstrate that these functions are mediated primarily by the paternal Rnf12 allele due to nonrandom maternal XCI in mammary epithelial cells.

During embryogenesis of female mice, sex-specific regulation has been discovered in extraembryonic placental trophoblast tissues that exclusively silence the paternal X chromosome (Xp), and somatic female tissues are thought to display a random pattern of XCI (Heard and Disteche, 2006Heard E.

However, it has recently been reported that specific regions in the adult female brain display a bias to silence the paternal X chromosome (Gregg et al., 2010Gregg C. Zhang J. Butler J.E. Haig D.

Paternally biased X inactivation in mouse neonatal brain.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R79Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although the physiological importance of this bias is unclear. Milk-producing alveolar cells in the mammary gland are generated during alveolar morphogenesis in pregnant female mice (Visvader, 2009Visvader J.E. Keeping abreast of the mammary epithelial hierarchy and breast tumorigenesis.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2563-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Prolactin (Prl) signaling via Jak2 and Stat5 is essential for the differentiation and expansion of alveolar cells in pregnant and lactating females (Hennighausen and Robinson, 2008Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Interpretation of cytokine signaling through the transcription factors STAT5A and STAT5B.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Upon weaning, mammary alveolar cells undergo apoptosis in a process called involution (Sutherland et al., 2007bSutherland K.D. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. The molecular culprits underlying precocious mammary gland involution.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2007; 12: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Though genes have been identified that promote alveolar differentiation, factors that trigger involution are still obscure. The X-linked gene Rnf12 encodes the RING finger LIM domain-interacting protein (RLIM), a nuclear ubiquitin ligase that regulates the activity of specific transcription factors in part by controlling the levels of various cofactors (Ostendorff et al., 2002Ostendorff H.P.

Targeting a conditional knockout (KO) of Rnf12 in mouse oocytes, we have shown that the maternal transmission of an Rnf12 KO allele results in early embryonic lethality, specifically of female embryos, due to defective imprinted XCI, precluding development of embryonic trophoblast tissues. Moreover, the gender ratio of pups born by mothers carrying an Rnf12 mutation is significantly biased toward males. Indeed, males carrying a germline KO of Rnf12 (Δ/Y) appear healthy and are fertile (Shin et al., 2010Shin J. Bossenz M. Chung Y. Ma H. Byron M. Taniguchi-Ishigaki N. Zhu X. Jiao B. Hall L.L. Green M.R. et al.Maternal Rnf12/RLIM is required for imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in mice.Nature. 2010; 467: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To investigate functions of RLIM/Rnf12 in adult mice, we targeted the KO of Rnf12 to mammary epithelia and found inhibited alveolar differentiation and milk production in pregnant and lactating females. Indeed, alveolar cells lacking Rnf12/RLIM undergo apoptosis as soon as they differentiate, indicating crucial survival functions for RLIM. We show that RLIM levels in alveolar cells dramatically decrease within hours upon forced weaning, suggesting important roles for triggering involution. Genetic analyses demonstrate that these functions are mediated mainly by the paternal Rnf12 allele. Moreover, we find that mammary epithelia are composed primarily of cells with an active Xp. These results identify sex-specific epigenetic regulation of murine mammary gland biology by RLIM/Rnf12 with implications for development, differentiation, evolution, and disease. RLIM-encoding mRNA is widely expressed in embryonic and adult mouse tissues, whereas RLIM protein expression is more restricted (Bach et al., 1999Bach I. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Carrière C. Bhushan A.

Dynamic expression of LIM cofactors in the developing mouse neural tube.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using immunohistochemistry, we detected robust expression of RLIM in virgin, pregnant, and lactating mammary epithelia in myoepithelial and luminal cell layers, as indicated by its colocalization with cytokeratin 14 and 18 (CK14 and CK18), respectively (Figures S1A and S1B available online). We targeted the Rnf12 KO to mammary glands using transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase (Cre) under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR) (Wagner et al., 1997Wagner K.U. Wall R.J. St-Onge L. Gruss P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Garrett L. Li M. Furth P.A. Hennighausen L. Cre-mediated gene deletion in the mammary gland.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). By crossing MMTV-Cre (MC) mice with Rosa26-loxP-stop-loxP-lacZ (R26R) animals (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4157) Google Scholar), Cre expression in early ducts was confirmed (Figure S1C). Indeed, RLIM expression was not detectable in mammary epithelia of virgin Rnf12fl/fl × MC females (fl/fl × MC) (Figure S1D), indicating correct targeting. Investigating mammary glands that lack RLIM (fl/fl × MC) revealed a dramatic inhibition of alveolar morphogenesis, whereas ductal development and branching appeared normal in virgin females (Figures 1A and S2A). Examining various mammary stages in first-time pregnant and lactating females showed that the phenotype became apparent ∼16.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and was highly pronounced at lactating stages (Figure 1A). Because the maternal Rnf12 allele drives development of extraembryonic placental trophoblast cells (Shin et al., 2010Shin J. Bossenz M. Chung Y. Ma H. Byron M. Taniguchi-Ishigaki N. Zhu X. Jiao B. Hall L.L. Green M.R. et al.Maternal Rnf12/RLIM is required for imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in mice.Nature. 2010; 467: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we compared mammary phenotypes of heterozygous females with either a maternal or paternal deletion of the Rnf12 gene (flm/WT × MC and WT/flp × MC, respectively). Surprisingly, though we detected minimal mammary defects in flm/WT × MC lactating females, WT/flp × MC females displayed a phenotype comparable to that observed in fl/fl × MC females (Figure 1B). This was not due to indirect effects of Cre expression because (1) mammary phenotypes generated with a maternally or paternally transmitted MC transgene were similar (data not shown), ruling out parental effects of the MC driver; (2) induced Cre levels were similar in all animals tested (Figure S1E); (3) alveolar differentiation and milk production appeared comparable in control females with and without Cre expression (Figures 1A and 1B; see also Figure 2); and (4) Cre-negative females carrying a paternal germline deletion of Rnf12 (fl/Δp) displayed a similar phenotype as WT/flp × MC or fl/fl × MC females (Figure 1B). However, some fl/fl × MC, WT/flp × MC, and fl/Δp females escaped a clear mammary phenotype at a low rate (less than one 1 of 8 of more than 30 animals tested per genotype), suggesting that additional factors may compensate for RLIM loss in a minority of animals. We also detected inhibited alveolar differentiation in mammary glands of lactating WT/flp females using K14-Cre (Dassule et al., 2000Dassule H.R. Lewis P. Bei M. Maas R. McMahon A.P.

Examining milk production using antibodies directed against general milk proteins (Asselin-Labat et al., 2007Asselin-Labat M.L. Sutherland K.D. Barker H. Thomas R. Shackleton M. Forrest N.C. Hartley L. Robb L. Grosveld F.G. van der Wees J. et al.Gata-3 is an essential regulator of mammary-gland morphogenesis and luminal-cell differentiation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) revealed reduced staining intensity in females carrying a paternal Rnf12 mutation (Figure 2A), and RT-qPCR performed on RNA isolated from L1 glands confirmed significantly lower levels of mRNAs encoding milk proteins whey acidic protein (WAP), α-casein, and β-casein (Figure 2B). Indeed, these females were often unable to support their litters, resulting in a significantly lower 3 day survival rate of pups (Figures 2C and S2C). These results demonstrate a critical role of the paternal Rnf12 allele for differentiating alveolar cells. As mice were bred in a congenic C57BL/6 background to eliminate strain-specific influences, these results indicate a sex-specific parent-of-origin effect. We next investigated the significance of the paternal function of Rnf12 for milk production in relation to its maternal function during imprinted XCI. Only the maternal Rnf12 allele should be subject to selection pressure in females, given that: (1) failure of the XCI process leads to lethality specifically in females, (2) maternal, but not paternal, Rnf12 is required for imprinted XCI, and (3) Rnf12 KO males are viable and fertile (Shin et al., 2010Shin J. Bossenz M. Chung Y. Ma H. Byron M. Taniguchi-Ishigaki N. Zhu X. Jiao B. Hall L.L. Green M.R. et al.Maternal Rnf12/RLIM is required for imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in mice.Nature. 2010; 467: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This suggests that loss-of-function mutations in the Rnf12 gene could lead to a gender bias toward males, which represents an unfavorable strategy for reproduction in mice (Hamilton, 1967Hamilton W.D. Extraordinary sex ratios. A sex-ratio theory for sex linkage and inbreeding has new implications in cytogenetics and entomology.Science. 1967; 156: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). To explore the long-term genetic interactions of maternal and paternal Rnf12 functions in affecting gender bias for populations of feral mice, we pursued a stochastic agent-based modeling approach (Grimm et al., 2005Grimm V. Revilla E. Berger U. Jeltsch F. Mooij W.M. Railsback S.F. Thulke H.H. Weiner J. Wiegand T. DeAngelis D.L. Pattern-oriented modeling of agent-based complex systems: lessons from ecology.Science. 2005; 310: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). We constructed the simplest possible model that incorporated important factors such as age-dependent checkpoints for mating and death, seasonal variation in food growth, and density-dependent predation. Furthermore, we incorporated known constants for mouse maturation age, litter size, metabolism, and life span and manually adjusted the free parameters to ensure that simulation behavior matched expected values for average colony size and average mouse age (Table S1). Each simulation was initialized with equal numbers of males and females WT for Rnf12 and was allowed to iteratively progress through time (Figures 3A, 3B , S3A, and S3B), keeping track of each mouse's age, Rnf12 genotype, energy level (a function of food consumption and constant metabolic rate), gestation time, and seasons (Table S1). Because individual simulations show a high degree of variability in gender bias as a function of time, we calculated the average probabilities of encountering a shortage of females that may be considered a crisis event in different scenarios (≤20%, 27.5%, and 35% females) (Figures 3C and S3C and Table S2). Results show that, given random mutation in each generation of either allele, the maternal XCI function led to a gender bias at all population sizes and significantly reduced the average time until a given colony encountered a gender crisis (Figure 3D). Introducing the paternal Rnf12 functions for milk production in mammary glands in the model mitigated the gender bias, even at the experimentally observed 30% penetrance. Gender bias introduced by the maternally imprinted XCI function was almost completely mitigated by the paternally imprinted milk function in colony sizes of 250 animals and partially with sizes of 100 and 500 animals (Figures 3D and S3D). Importantly, the effect of the maternal XCI function as well as the mitigation of gender biasing by the paternally imprinted milk function was qualitatively independent of all simulation parameters, including: seasonal food fluctuations, variations in food consumption, the magnitude of predation, the length of the breeding season, the propensity for mating, colony size, and choice of crisis threshold (data not shown). However, both effects were quantitatively most dramatic for colonies of moderate size, high average birth frequency, and high average survival time. Examining hypothetical dominant or recessive regimes showed that only the imprinted regime resulted in rescue (Figures S3B and S3D ). Thus, although these simulations represent only one of many natural selection conditions found in nature, our qualitative predictions suggest that the paternal functions of Rnf12 in milk production tend to balance out biases caused by maternal Rnf12 functions by providing selection pressure on the paternal allele and that this may have evolutionary relevance when considering crisis situations in fluctuating populations.Figure S3Only the Imprinted Inheritance Regime Shows Gender Bias Rescue by the Secondary Rnf12 Function, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Workflow for measuring probability of gender crisis using the agent based stochastic models.(B) Logical rules defining XCI and mammary gland-dependent survival of mice under the imprinting and other hypothetical inheritance regimes (refer to Figure 3A).(C) Trajectories of the fraction of females in sample simulations of 100, 250, and 500 mice with red regions representing gender crisis states of < 20%, < 27.5%, and < 35% females, respectively.(D) Average simulation T1/2 values (a measure of the probability to encounter a crisis state, see methods) for populations of 100, 250, and 500 mice.

Next, we examined the contributions of the Rnf12 alleles to RLIM protein levels by comparing RLIM expression in adult virgin mammary tissues of heterozygous WT/flp × MC and flm/WT × MC females. Whereas RLIM was expressed in more than 95% and ∼80% of mammary epithelial cells in fl/fl and flm/WT × MC females, respectively, only ∼20% of cells stained RLIM positive in WT/flp × MC mammary glands (Figures 4A and S4A). Costainings with RLIM and CK14 or CK18 antibodies of differentiating primary mammary epithelial cells isolated from virgin females showed that the majority of CK14- or CK18-positive cells isolated from flm/WT × MC animals also expressed RLIM. However, most WT/flp × MC epithelial cells positive for CK14 or CK18 stained negative for RLIM (Figure S4B ). These data show that RLIM expression in myoepithelial and luminal mammary cells originates mainly from transcription of the paternal Rnf12 allele. Importantly, whereas we detected many living RLIM-negative epithelial cells in mammary glands of virgin WT/flp × MC females that stained positive for DAPI (Figure 4A), in lactating glands, only RLIM-positive cells participated in alveolar epithelia (Figure 4B). This indicates that cells lacking RLIM are able to participate in the formation of ductal, but not alveolar, structures, suggesting crucial functions of RLIM specifically for differentiating alveolar cells.Figure S4Expression Mainly of Paternal RLIM in Virgin Mammary Epithelial Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Summary of RLIM positive cells in virgin mammary glands of adult heterozygous females (10 weeks) as counted on sections of mammary glands (see Figure 4A).

To investigate the effects underlying the observed mammary phenotype, we examined proliferation rates via immunostainings using antibodies directed against phospho-S10 histone H3 (P-H3), specifically recognizing cells in mitosis (Cui et al., 2004Cui Y. Riedlinger G. Miyoshi K. Tang W. Li C. Deng C.X. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Inactivation of Stat5 in mouse mammary epithelium during pregnancy reveals distinct functions in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8037-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We detected no significant difference in the percentage of mitotic cells in mammary tissues of pregnant fl/fl × MC and fl/fl controls at 16.5 dpc (Figure S5A ), consistent with similar levels of estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin (Prl) in blood samples at L1 (data not shown). However, staining with antibodies against cleaved caspase 3, a marker for apoptotic cells (Gown and Willingham, 2002Gown A.M. Willingham M.C. Improved detection of apoptotic cells in archival paraffin sections: immunohistochemistry using antibodies to cleaved caspase 3.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), showed massive cell death occurring in mammary glands of pregnant females lacking RLIM (Figure 5). Apoptotic cells were initially detected at 11.5 dpc and in significantly increased numbers at 16.5 dpc (Figures 5A and 5B) and were still detectable at lactating stages (Figure S5B). Indeed, whereas we counted only ∼1% and ∼2% of caspase 3-positive cells in alveoli of MC and flm/WT × MC females, respectively, at 16.5 dpc, more than 10% of cells stained positive in alveoli of females with a paternal Rnf12 deletion (Figures 5B and S5C). In addition, cultured mammary epithelial cells isolated from fl/Δp virgin females showed mostly mutually exclusive staining when costained with cleaved caspase 3 and RLIM antibodies, indicating that apoptosis occurred primarily in cells lacking RLIM (Figure 5C). This result was corroborated by the fact that only RLIM-positive cells from fl/fl × MC females were present after 10 days in culture, which were mainly composed of Cre-negative cells of nonepithelial origin (e.g., fibroblasts; data not shown). Costainings of differentiating primary mammary cells revealed that both CK14- and CK18-positive cells were affected by cell death (Figure S5D). Addition of pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh led to significantly increased cell numbers in differentiating primary mammary epithelial cells from fl/fl × MC, but not WT/WT animals when compared to untreated cells (Figure 5D), demonstrating that cell death occurred via apoptosis. Moreover, whereas numbers of differentiating RLIM-negative mammary cells isolated from fl/fl × MC animals did not change upon lentiviral expression of a Myc-tag alone when compared to uninfected cells, physiological levels of exogenous Myc-RLIM (Figure S6A ) resulted in significantly increased cell numbers (Figures 5E; and S6B). This rescue reflected a decrease in apoptosis because Myc-RLIM-infected and control-infected cells displayed similar rates of proliferation (Figure S6C). These data show that RLIM acts as a survival factor in milk-producing alveolar cells and suggest that the main cause of the mammary phenotype in females with a mutated Rnf12 gene is due to apoptosis.Figure 5RLIM/Rnf12 Is a Critical Survival Factor for Alveolar CellsShow full caption(A) Staining of mammary sections from 11.5 dpc pregnant"
https://openalex.org/W2065618636,"Dscam1 potentially encodes 19,008 ectodomains of a cell recognition molecule of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily through alternative splicing. Each ectodomain, comprising a unique combination of three variable (Ig) domains, exhibits isoform-specific homophilic binding in vitro. Although we have proposed that the ability of Dscam1 isoforms to distinguish between one another is crucial for neural circuit assembly, via a process called self-avoidance, whether recognition specificity is essential in vivo has not been addressed. Here we tackle this issue by assessing the function of Dscam1 isoforms with altered binding specificities. We generated pairs of chimeric isoforms that bind to each other (heterophilic) but not to themselves (homophilic). These isoforms failed to support self-avoidance or did so poorly. By contrast, coexpression of complementary isoforms within the same neuron restored self-avoidance. These data establish that recognition between Dscam1 isoforms on neurites of the same cell provides the molecular basis for self-avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W2038114697,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) correlates with disruption of cell-cell adhesion, loss of cell polarity and development of epithelial cell malignancy. Identifying novel molecules that inhibit EMT has profound potential for developing mechanism-based therapeutics. We previously demonstrated that the endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29) is a novel factor that can drive mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and induce cell growth arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, we show that ERp29 is an important molecule in establishing epithelial cell integrity during the MET. We demonstrate that ERp29 regulates MET in a cell context-dependent manner. ERp29 overexpression induced a complete MET in mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells through downregulating the expression of transcriptional repressors (for example, Slug, Snai1, ZEB2 and Twist) of E-cadherin. In contrast, overexpression of ERp29 induces incomplete MET in basal-like BT549 cells in which the expression of EMT-related markers (for example, vimentin; cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and E-cadherin) and the transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin were not altered. However, ERp29 overexpression in both cell-types resulted in loss of filamentous stress fibers, formation of cortical actin and restoration of an epithelial phenotype. Mechanistic studies revealed that overexpression of ERp29 in both cell-types upregulated the expression of TJ proteins (zonula-occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin) and the core apical-basal polarity proteins (Par3 and Scribble) at the membrane to enhance cell-cell contact and cell polarization. Knockdown of ERp29 in the epithelial MCF-7 cells decreased the expression of these proteins, leading to the disruption of cell-cell adhesion. Taken together, ERp29 is a novel molecule that regulates MET and epithelial cell integrity in breast cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1980226777,"Disruption of glandular architecture associates with poor clinical outcome in high-grade colorectal cancer (CRC). Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) regulates morphogenic growth of benign MDCK (Madin Darby Canine Kidney) cells through effects on the Rho-like GTPase cdc42 (cell division cycle 42). This study investigates PTEN-dependent morphogenesis in a CRC model. Stable short hairpin RNA knockdown of PTEN in Caco-2 cells influenced expression or localization of cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factors and inhibited cdc42 activation. Parental Caco-2 cells formed regular hollow gland-like structures (glands) with a single central lumen, in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. Conversely, PTEN-deficient Caco-2 ShPTEN cells formed irregular glands with multiple abnormal lumens as well as intra- and/or intercellular vacuoles evocative of the high-grade CRC phenotype. Effects of targeted treatment were investigated. Phosphatidinylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) modulating treatment did not affect gland morphogenesis but did influence gland number, gland size and/or cell size within glands. As PTEN may be regulated by the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), cultures were treated with the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone. This treatment enhanced PTEN expression, cdc42 activation and rescued dysmorphogenesis by restoring single lumen formation in Caco-2 ShPTEN glands. Rosiglitazone effects on cdc42 activation and Caco-2 ShPTEN gland development were attenuated by cotreatment with GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist. Taken together, these studies show PTEN-cdc42 regulation of lumen formation in a 3D model of human CRC glandular morphogenesis. Treatment by the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone, but not PI3K modulators, rescued colorectal glandular dysmorphogenesis of PTEN deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2000535830,"The receptor for advanced glycation endproduct (RAGE) is involved in diabetic complications and chronic inflammation, conditions known to affect the sensitivity towards apoptosis. Here, we studied the effect of genetically depleting RAGE on the susceptibility towards apoptosis. In murine osteoblastic cells, RAGE knockout increased both spontaneous and induced apoptosis. Decreased levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 protein and increased intrinsic apoptosis were observed in Rage(-/-) cells. Furthermore, loss of RAGE increased expression of the death receptor CD95 (Fas, Apo-1), CD95-dependent caspase activation and extrinsic apoptosis, whereas NF-kB-p65 nuclear translocation was diminished. Importantly, depletion of RAGE reduced the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 and p73 and increased their nuclear translocation. The increase of p53 and p73 transactivational activity was essential for the RAGE-dependent regulation of apoptosis, because knockdown of p53 and p73 significantly decreased apoptosis in RAGE-deficient but not in RAGE-expressing cells. Thus, the RAGE-mediated posttranslational regulation of p53 and p73 orchestrates a sequence of events culminating in control of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways."
