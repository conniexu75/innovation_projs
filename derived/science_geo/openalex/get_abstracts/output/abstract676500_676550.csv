https://openalex.org/W3175119564,"Integrating synthetic biology into wearables could expand opportunities for noninvasive monitoring of physiological status, disease states and exposure to pathogens or toxins. However, the operation of synthetic circuits generally requires the presence of living, engineered bacteria, which has limited their application in wearables. Here we report lightweight, flexible substrates and textiles functionalized with freeze-dried, cell-free synthetic circuits, including CRISPR-based tools, that detect metabolites, chemicals and pathogen nucleic acid signatures. The wearable devices are activated upon rehydration from aqueous exposure events and report the presence of specific molecular targets by colorimetric changes or via an optical fiber network that detects fluorescent and luminescent outputs. The detection limits for nucleic acids rival current laboratory methods such as quantitative PCR. We demonstrate the development of a face mask with a lyophilized CRISPR sensor for wearable, noninvasive detection of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature within 90 min, requiring no user intervention other than the press of a button. Wearable materials are endowed with synthetic biology circuits to detect biomolecules, including SARS-CoV-2 RNA."

Here we report a leadless, battery-free, fully implantable cardiac pacemaker for postoperative control of cardiac rate and rhythm that undergoes complete dissolution and clearance by natural biological processes after a defined operating timeframe. We show that these devices provide effective pacing of hearts of various sizes in mouse, rat, rabbit, canine and human cardiac models, with tailored geometries and operation timescales, powered by wireless energy transfer. This approach overcomes key disadvantages of traditional temporary pacing devices and may serve as the basis for the next generation of postoperative temporary pacing technology."
https://openalex.org/W3174716159,"Programmable C•G-to-G•C base editors (CGBEs) have broad scientific and therapeutic potential, but their editing outcomes have proved difficult to predict and their editing efficiency and product purity are often low. We describe a suite of engineered CGBEs paired with machine learning models to enable efficient, high-purity C•G-to-G•C base editing. We performed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen targeting DNA repair genes to identify factors that affect C•G-to-G•C editing outcomes and used these insights to develop CGBEs with diverse editing profiles. We characterized ten promising CGBEs on a library of 10,638 genomically integrated target sites in mammalian cells and trained machine learning models that accurately predict the purity and yield of editing outcomes (R = 0.90) using these data. These CGBEs enable correction to the wild-type coding sequence of 546 disease-related transversion single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with >90% precision (mean 96%) and up to 70% efficiency (mean 14%). Computational prediction of optimal CGBE-single-guide RNA pairs enables high-purity transversion base editing at over fourfold more target sites than achieved using any single CGBE variant."

We found that unilateral SC inactivation produced significant decision biases and changes in reaction times consistent with a causal role for the primate SC in perceptual decision-making. Fitting signal detection theory and sequential sampling models to the data showed that SC inactivation produced a decrease in the relative evidence for contralateral decisions, as if adding a constant offset to a time-varying evidence signal for the ipsilateral choice. The results provide causal evidence for an embodied cognition model of perceptual decision-making and provide compelling evidence that the SC of primates (a brainstem structure) plays a causal role in how evidence is computed for decisions—a process usually attributed to the forebrain."
https://openalex.org/W3176042246,"CpG islands (CGIs) represent a widespread feature of vertebrate genomes, being associated with ~70% of all gene promoters. CGIs control transcription initiation by conferring nearby promoters with unique chromatin properties. In addition, there are thousands of distal or orphan CGIs (oCGIs) whose functional relevance is barely known. Here we show that oCGIs are an essential component of poised enhancers that augment their long-range regulatory activity and control the responsiveness of their target genes. Using a knock-in strategy in mouse embryonic stem cells, we introduced poised enhancers with or without oCGIs within topologically associating domains harboring genes with different types of promoters. Analysis of the resulting cell lines revealed that oCGIs act as tethering elements that promote the physical and functional communication between poised enhancers and distally located genes, particularly those with large CGI clusters in their promoters. Therefore, by acting as genetic determinants of gene-enhancer compatibility, CGIs can contribute to gene expression control under both physiological and potentially pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3175577244,"The rapidly acting antidepressants ketamine and scopolamine exert behavioral effects that can last from several days to more than a week in some patients. The molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of these antidepressant effects are unknown. Here we show that methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) phosphorylation at Ser421 (pMeCP2) is essential for the sustained, but not the rapid, antidepressant effects of ketamine and scopolamine in mice. Our results reveal that pMeCP2 is downstream of BDNF, a critical factor in ketamine and scopolamine antidepressant action. In addition, we show that pMeCP2 is required for the long-term regulation of synaptic strength after ketamine or scopolamine administration. These results demonstrate that pMeCP2 and associated synaptic plasticity are essential determinants of sustained antidepressant effects. How ketamine and scopolamine produce sustained antidepressant effects remains unknown. Kim et al. show that BDNF-dependent MeCP2 phosphorylation drives sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine and scopolamine with distinct synaptic plasticity changes."
https://openalex.org/W3175832158,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARs-CoV-2. The virus is transmitted from person to person through droplet infections i.e. when infected person is in close contact with another person. In January 2020, first report of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces, has made it clear that human wastewater might contain this virus. This may illustrate the probability of environmentally facilitated transmission, mainly the sewage, however, environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal oral transmission is not yet clear. We used existing Pakistan polio environment surveillance network to investigate presence of SARs-CoV-2 using three commercially available kits and E-Gene detection published assay for surety and confirmatory of positivity. A Two-phase separation method is used for sample clarification and concentration. An additional high-speed centrifugation (14000Xg for 30 min) step was introduced, prior RNA extraction, to increase viral RNA yield resulting a decrease in Cq value. A total of 78 wastewater samples collected from 38 districts across Pakistan, 74 wastewater samples from existing polio environment surveillance sites, 3 from drains of COVID-19 infected areas and 1 from COVID 19 quarantine center drainage, were tested for presence of SARs-CoV-2. 21 wastewater samples (27%) from 13 districts turned to be positive on RT-qPCR. SARs-COV-2 RNA positive samples from areas with COVID 19 patients and quarantine center strengthen the findings and use of wastewater surveillance in future. Furthermore, sequence data of partial ORF 1a generated from COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage sample also reinforce our findings that SARs-CoV-2 can be detected in wastewater. This study finding indicates that SARs-CoV-2 detection through wastewater surveillance has an epidemiologic potential that can be used as supplementary system to monitor viral tracking and circulation in cities with lower COVID-19 testing capacity or heavily populated areas where door-to-door tracing may not be possible. However, attention is needed on virus concentration and detection assay to increase the sensitivity. Development of highly sensitive assay will be an indicator for virus monitoring and to provide early warning signs."
https://openalex.org/W3173579953,"All cells fold their genomes, including bacterial cells, where the chromosome is compacted into a domain-organized meshwork called the nucleoid. How compaction and domain organization arise is not fully understood. Here, we describe a method to estimate the average mesh size of the nucleoid in Escherichia coli. Using nucleoid mesh size and DNA concentration estimates, we find that the cytoplasm behaves as a poor solvent for the chromosome when the cell is considered as a simple semidilute polymer solution. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a poor solvent leads to chromosome compaction and DNA density heterogeneity (i.e., domain formation) at physiological DNA concentration. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the heterogeneous DNA density negatively correlates with ribosome density within the nucleoid, consistent with cryoelectron tomography data. Drug experiments, together with past observations, suggest the hypothesis that RNAs contribute to the poor solvent effects, connecting chromosome compaction and domain formation to transcription and intracellular organization."

https://openalex.org/W3175556239,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are glutamate-gated calcium-permeable ion channels that are widely implicated in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we report a gallery of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human GluN1-GluN2A NMDA receptor at an overall resolution of 4 Å in complex with distinct ligands or modulators. In the full-length context of GluN1-GluN2A receptors, we visualize the competitive antagonists bound to the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, respectively. We reveal that the binding of positive allosteric modulator shortens the distance between LBDs and the transmembrane domain (TMD), which further stretches the opening of the gate. In addition, we unexpectedly visualize the binding cavity of the ""foot-in-the-door"" blocker 9-aminoacridine within the LBD-TMD linker region, differing from the conventional ""trapping"" blocker binding site at the vestibule within the TMD. Our study provides molecular insights into the crosstalk between LBDs and TMD during channel activation, inhibition, and allosteric transition."
https://openalex.org/W3173545700,"L-Dopa decarboxylase ( DDC ) is the most significantly co-expressed gene with ACE2 , which encodes for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor a ngiotensin- c onverting e nzyme 2 and the interferon-inducible truncated isoform dACE2 . Our group previously showed the importance of DDC in viral infections. We hereby aimed to investigate DDC expression in COVID-19 patients and cultured SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, also in association with ACE2 and dACE2 . We concurrently evaluated the expression of the viral infection- and interferon-stimulated gene ISG56 and the immune-modulatory, hypoxia-regulated gene EPO . Viral load and mRNA levels of DDC , ACE2 , dACE2 , ISG56 and EPO were quantified by RT-qPCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients, showing no or mild symptoms, and from non-infected individuals. Samples from influenza-infected patients were analyzed in comparison. SARS-CoV-2-mediated effects in host gene expression were validated in cultured virus-permissive epithelial cells. We found substantially higher gene expression of DDC in COVID-19 patients (7.6-fold; p = 1.2e-13) but not in influenza-infected ones, compared to non-infected subjects. dACE2 was more elevated (2.9-fold; p = 1.02e-16) than ACE2 (1.7-fold; p = 0.0005) in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. ISG56 (2.5-fold; p = 3.01e-6) and EPO (2.6-fold; p = 2.1e-13) were also increased. Detected differences were not attributed to enrichment of specific cell populations in nasopharyngeal tissue. While SARS-CoV-2 virus load was positively associated with ACE2 expression (r≥0.8, p&lt;0.001), it negatively correlated with DDC , dACE2 (r≤−0.7, p&lt;0.001) and EPO (r≤−0.5, p&lt;0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant correlation between DDC and dACE2 expression was observed in nasopharyngeal swab and whole blood samples of both COVID-19 and non-infected individuals (r≥0.7). In VeroE6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 negatively affected DDC , ACE2 , dACE2 and EPO mRNA levels, and induced cell death, while ISG56 was enhanced at early hours post-infection. Thus, the regulation of DDC , dACE2 and EPO expression in the SARS-CoV-2-infected nasopharyngeal tissue is possibly related with an orchestrated antiviral response of the infected host as the virus suppresses these genes to favor its propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3163258177,"Social liberals tend to be less pathogen-avoidant than social conservatives, a pattern consistent with a model wherein ideological differences stem from differences in threat reactivity. Here we investigate if and how individual responses to a shared threat reflect those patterns of ideological difference. In seeming contradiction to the general association between social conservatism and pathogen avoidance, the more socially conservative political party in the United States has more consistently downplayed the dangers of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. This puzzle offers an opportunity to examine the contributions of multiple factors to disease avoidance. We investigated the relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautionary behavior in light of the partisan landscape of the United States. We explored whether consumption of, and attitudes toward, different sources of information, as well as differential evaluation of various threats caused by the pandemic—such as direct health costs versus indirect harms to the economy and individual liberties—shape partisan differences in responses to the pandemic in ways that overwhelm the contributions of social conservatism. In two pre-registered studies, socially conservative attitudes correlate with self-reported COVID-19 prophylactic behaviors, but only among Democrats. Reflecting larger societal divisions, among Republicans and Independents, the absence of a positive relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautions appears driven by lower trust in scientists, lower trust in liberal and moderate sources, lesser consumption of liberal news media, and greater economic conservatism."
https://openalex.org/W3177356489,"In Australia in March 2020 a national public health directive required that non-essential workers stay at home, except for essential activities. These restrictions began easing in May 2020 as community transmission slowed.This study investigated changes in COVID prevention behaviours from April-July 2020, and psychosocial predictors of these behaviours.An Australia-wide (national) survey was conducted in April, with monthly follow-up over four months. Participants who were adults (18+ years), currently residing in Australia and who could read and understand English were eligible. Recruitment was via online social media. Analysis sample included those who provided responses to the baseline survey (April) and at least one subsequent follow-up survey (N = 1834 out of a possible 3216 who completed the April survey). 71.7% of the sample was female (n = 1,322). Principal components analysis (PCA) combined self-reported adherence across seven prevention behaviours. PCA identified two behaviour types: 'distancing' (e.g. staying 1.5m away) and 'hygiene' (e.g. washing hands), explaining 28.3% and 24.2% of variance, respectively. Distancing and hygiene behaviours were analysed individually using multivariable regression models.On average, participants agreed with statements of adherence for all behaviours (means all above 4 out of 7). Distancing behaviours declined each month (p's < .001), whereas hygiene behaviours remained relatively stable. For distancing, stronger perceptions of societal risk, self-efficacy to maintain distancing, and greater perceived social obligation at baseline were associated with adherence in June and July (p's<0.05). For hygiene, the only significant correlate of adherence in June and July was belief that one's actions could prevent infection of family members (p < .001).High adherence to COVID prevention behaviours were reported in this social media sample; however, distancing behaviours tended to decrease over time. Belief in social responsibility may be an important aspect to consider in encouraging distancing behaviours. These findings have implications for managing a shift from government-imposed restrictions to individual responsibility."

https://openalex.org/W3174400450,"Public health and social measures have been implemented around the world in a bid to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Public compliance with these measures is key in successfully controlling the pandemic. This online survey assessed the compliance and attitude of adults residing in the southern African Kingdom of Eswatini to government protection, activity and travel measures aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19. A rapid online survey, comprising of 28 questions, was administered in May 2020. More than 90% of respondents knew the virus could kill anyone and most respondents (70%) reported to be compliant to public health and social measures. Females, those who did not use public transport and those aged 30 years and above were significantly (p&lt;0.01) more compliant, particularly to protective and travel measures. Social media, television and official government websites were the primary source of ongoing COVID-19 information for respondents of this online survey, and these methods should continue to be employed to reach the public who regularly use the internet. More than half of essential workers who responded to the online survey reported to have their own personal protective equipment; however, 32% either did not have any protective equipment or shared their equipment with other staff members. Due to the survey being online, these results should not be generalised to populations of low socioeconomic status."
https://openalex.org/W3174508273,"Background During infectious disease outbreaks, healthcare workers are at high risk of infection, infecting others, and psychological distress. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of stress and anxiety in physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and assess their associated factors. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan Region, from March 28 to April 15, 2020. An online self-administered survey questionnaire was used to collect data from physicians working in specialized COVID-19 centers and other healthcare facilities. The level of stress was measured based on the 10-items Perceived Stress Scale. The level of anxiety was measured based on the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. Results A total of 370 participants responded to the perceived stress component of the survey, of whom 57 (15.4%) had low perceived stress, 249 (67.3%) had moderate stress, and 64 (17.3%) had high stress. Being female was significantly associated with having moderate/high stress (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.40 (95% CI 1.31–4.39)). A total of 201 participants responded to the generalized anxiety disorder component of the survey, of whom 19 (9.5%) had no anxiety, 57 (28.4%) had mild anxiety, 79 (39.3%) had moderate anxiety, and 46 (22.9%) had severe anxiety. Working in COVID-19 centers (AOR = 2.23 (95% CI 1.02–4.86)) and being general practitioners (AOR = 4.16 (95% CI 1.14–15.14)) were significantly associated with having moderate/severe anxiety. Conclusion A considerable proportion of physicians experience stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan region. Generalists and those in special COVID-19 units report the greatest anxiety. There a need to establish mechanisms to reduce the risks of stress and anxiety among physicians. Mental health coping interventions through counseling should be based on COVID-19 protocol guidelines. Interventions should also emphasize physicians’ ability to work safely and efficiently in providing care to the patients."

Here we show that theta rhythmicity is greatly amplified when rats run in virtual reality. A novel eta rhythm emerged in the CA1 cell layer, primarily in interneurons. Thus, multisensory experience governs hippocampal rhythms. Virtual reality can be used to boost or control brain rhythms and to alter neural dynamics, wiring and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3173741810,"We investigated the association between oral hygiene indicators of periodontitis, tooth loss, and tooth brushing on the longitudinal fasting glucose level in non-diabetic subjects. Using a nationwide health screening database in Korea, we included non-diabetic individuals who received a health screening program with oral health check in 2009-2010. We constructed a linear mixed model for the longitudinal data of fasting glucose from the baseline to 2015. During the 4.84-year of median follow-up, 91,963 individuals (mean age 56.2 at baseline) underwent 392,780 health examinations with fasting glucose level (mmol/L). The presence of periodontitis was 39.3%. In the multivariate linear mixed analysis, periodontitis was related with increased fasting glucose levels (β = 0.0084, standard error = 0.0035, p = 0.018). Similarly, tooth loss was associated with increased level of fasting glucose (β = 0.0246, standard error = 0.0038, p < 0.001). Compared with tooth brushing ≤2 times/day, tooth brushing ≥3 times/day was associated with decreased fasting glucose levels (β = -0.0207, standard error = 0.0033, p < 0.001). Our data showed that periodontitis and tooth loss were associated with increased fasting glucose levels in non-diabetic individuals. The study findings imply that frequent tooth brushing may reduce fasting glucose levels. Further research is needed to determine the effect of periodontal intervention on glycemic control."
https://openalex.org/W3176381893,"Providing sufficient testing capacities and accurate results in a time-efficient way are essential to prevent the spread and lower the curve of a health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with recent research investigating how simulation-based models and tools could contribute to mitigating the impact of COVID-19, a discrete event simulation model is developed to design optimal saliva-based COVID-19 testing stations performing sensitive, non-invasive, and rapid-result RT-qPCR tests processing. This model aims to determine the adequate number of machines and operators required, as well as their allocation at different workstations, according to the resources available and the rate of samples to be tested per day. The model has been built and experienced using actual data and processes implemented on-campus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where an average of around 10,000 samples needed to be processed on a daily basis, representing at the end of August 2020 more than 2% of all the COVID-19 tests performed per day in the USA. It helped identify specific bottlenecks and associated areas of improvement in the process to save human resources and time. Practically, the overall approach, including the proposed modular discrete event simulation model, can easily be reused or modified to fit other contexts where local COVID-19 testing stations have to be implemented or optimized. It could notably support on-site managers and decision-makers in dimensioning testing stations by allocating the appropriate type and quantity of resources."

Forty interviews were conducted with adolescent girls, their caregivers, Village Health Team Members, health workers and school administrators involved in HPV vaccination. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. NVivo version 11 was used for data management and content thematic approach for analysis guided by the Social Ecological Model.At individual level, low levels of knowledge about the vaccine, girls' frequent mobility between vaccine doses, school absenteeism and drop out, fear of injection pain and discouragement from caregivers or peers were key barriers. At the health facilities level, reported barriers included: few healthcare workers, inadequate knowledge about HPV vaccine, limited social mobilization and community engagement to promote the vaccine, limited availability of the HPV vaccine, unreliable transportation, lack of reminder strategies after the first dose of the vaccine, lack of vaccination strategy for out-of-school girls and un-friendly behaviour of some healthcare workers. Concerns about safety and efficacy of the vaccine, negative religious and cultural beliefs against vaccination, rumors and misconceptions about the vaccine, mistrust in government intentions to introduce the new vaccine targeting girls, busy schedules and the gendered nature of care work were key community level barriers.Our study revealed an interplay of barriers at individual, health facility and community levels, which prevent initiation and completion of HPV vaccination among adolescent girls. Strengthening HIV vaccination programs and ensuring high uptake requires providing appropriate information to the girls plus the community, school and health facility stakeholders; addressing cold chain challenges as well as adequate training of vaccinators to enable them respond to rumors about HPV vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3173293755,"The olfactory system serves a critical function as a danger detection system to trigger defense responses essential for survival. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive such defenses in mammals are incompletely understood. Here, we have discovered an ultrasensitive olfactory sensor for the highly poisonous bacterial metabolite hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in mice. An atypical class of sensory neurons in the main olfactory epithelium, the type B cells, is activated by both H2S and low O2. These two stimuli trigger, respectively, Cnga2- and Trpc2-signaling pathways, which operate in separate subcellular compartments, the cilia and the dendritic knob. This activation drives essential defensive responses: elevation of the stress hormone ACTH, stress-related self-grooming behavior, and conditioned place avoidance. Our findings identify a previously unknown signaling paradigm in mammalian olfaction and define type B cells as chemosensory neurons that integrate distinct danger inputs from the external environment with appropriate defense outputs."

Age-related disparities were examined both overall and by primary cause. Compared to women &lt;35, the 2016–2017 US maternal mortality rate was twice as high for women aged 35–39, four times higher for women aged 40–44, and 11 times higher for women aged 45–54 years. Obstetric hemorrhage was the leading cause of death for women aged 35+ with rates 4 times higher than for women &lt;35, followed by postpartum cardiomyopathy with a 3-fold greater risk. Obstetric embolism, eclampsia/preeclampsia, and Other complications of obstetric surgery and procedures each had a two-fold greater risk of death for women aged 35+. Together these 5 causes of death accounted for 70.9% of the elevated maternal mortality risk for women aged 35+. The excess maternal mortality risk for women aged 35+ was focused among a few causes of death and much of this excess mortality is preventable. Early detection and treatment, as well as continued care during the postpartum year is critical to preventing these deaths.

https://openalex.org/W3176138239,"Targeted HIV testing strategies are needed to reach remaining undiagnosed people living with HIV and achieve the UNAIDS' 95-95-95 goals for 2030. HIV self-testing (HIVST) can increase uptake of HIV testing among young people, but user perspectives on novel distribution methods are uncertain. We assess the acceptability, perceived challenges, and recommendations of young adult lay counselor-led campus-based HIVST delivery among tertiary school students aged 18-24 years in Zimbabwe.We purposively sampled participants from an intervention involving campus-based HIVST using lay workers for distribution. We conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) among young adults from 10 universities and colleges in Zimbabwe who: (1) self-tested on campus; (2) self-tested off campus; and (3) opted not to self-test. We audio recorded and transcribed all interviews. Using applied thematic analysis, two investigators identified emergent themes and independently coded transcripts, achieving high inter-coder agreement.Of the 52 young adults (53.8% male, 46.1% female) interviewed through 26 IDIs and four FGDs, most IDI participants (19/26, 73%) favored campus-based HIVST, describing it as a more autonomous, convenient, and socially acceptable experience than other facility or community-based HIV testing services. Despite general acceptability, participants identified challenges with this delivery model, including: perceived social coercion, insufficient privacy and access to post-test counseling. These challenges influenced some participants to opt against self-testing (6/52, 11.5%). Recommendations for improved implementation included integrating secondary distribution of test kits and increased HIV counseling options into campus-based programs.Barriers to HIV testing among young people are numerous and complex. As the number of new HIV infections among youth continue to grow worldwide, targeted strategies and youth friendly approaches that increase access to testing are needed to close the diagnostic coverage gap. This is the first study to describe young adult acceptance of campus-based delivery of HIVST by lay counselors in Zimbabwe."
https://openalex.org/W3173671444,"Autoimmune diseases, often triggered by infection, affect ~5% of the worldwide population. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)–a painful condition characterized by the chronic inflammation of joints—comprises up to 20% of known autoimmune pathologies, with the tendency of increasing prevalence. Molecular mimicry is recognized as the leading mechanism underlying infection-mediated autoimmunity, which assumes sequence similarity between microbial and self-peptides driving the activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. T lymphocytes are leading immune cells in the RA-development. Therefore, deeper understanding of the capacity of microorganisms (both pathogens and commensals) to trigger autoreactive T cells is needed, calling for more systematic approaches. In the present study, we address this problem through a comprehensive immunoinformatics analysis of experimentally determined RA-related T cell epitopes against the proteomes of Bacteria, Fungi, and Viruses, to identify the scope of organisms providing homologous antigenic peptide determinants. By this, initial homology screening was complemented with de novo T cell epitope prediction and another round of homology search, to enable: i ) the confirmation of homologous microbial peptides as T cell epitopes based on the predicted binding affinity to RA-related HLA polymorphisms; ii ) sequence similarity inference for top de novo T cell epitope predictions to the RA-related autoantigens to reveal the robustness of RA-triggering capacity for identified (micro/myco)organisms. Our study reveals a much larger repertoire of candidate RA-triggering organisms, than previously recognized, providing insights into the underestimated role of Fungi in autoimmunity and the possibility of a more direct involvement of bacterial commensals in RA-pathology. Finally, our study pinpoints Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP as the most potent (most likely mimicked) RA-related autoantigen, opening an avenue for identifying the most potent autoantigens in a variety of different autoimmune pathologies, with possible implications in the design of next-generation therapeutics aiming to induce self-tolerance by affecting highly reactive autoantigens."
https://openalex.org/W3174994844,"Regulation of dendritic cell functions is a complex process in which several mediators play diverse roles as a network in a context-dependent manner. The precise mechanisms underlying dendritic cell functions have remained to be addressed. Semaphorins play crucial roles in regulation of various cell functions. We previously revealed that Semaphorin 3E (Sema3E) contributes to regulation of allergen-induced airway pathology partly mediated by controlling recruitment of conventional dendritic cell subsets in vivo, though the underlying mechanism remained elusive. In this study, we investigate the potential regulatory role of Sema3E in dendritic cells. We demonstrated that bone marrow-derived dendritic cells differentiated from Sema3e-/- progenitors have an enhanced migration capacity both at the baseline and in response to CCL21. The enhanced migration ability of Sema3E dendritic cells was associated with an overexpression of the chemokine receptor (CCR7), elevated Rac1 GTPase activity and F-actin polymerization. Using a mouse model of allergic airway sensitization, we observed that genetic deletion of Sema3E leads to a time dependent upregulation of CCR7 on CD11b+ conventional dendritic cells in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, aeroallergen sensitization of Sema3e-/- mice lead to an enhanced expression of PD-L2 and IRF-4 as well as enhanced allergen uptake in pulmonary CD11b+ DC, compared to wild type littermates. Collectively, these data suggest that Sema3E implicates in regulation of dendritic cell functions which could be considered a basis for novel immunotherapeutic strategies for the diseases associated with defective dendritic cells in the future."

The present study focused on the elements that appeared of significance in the legal outcome, including medico-legal evaluation, source of the crime report and circumstance of the assault. Methods It was conducted a retrospective analysis of all the judgments issued by the Public Prosecutor’s Office at a Court of a Metropolitan Italian city regarding sexual and domestic violence, from January 1 st 2011 to 31st December 31 st 2015. Examination regarded the demographic information of the victim and of the defendant, information on the crime, the circumstances of the aggression and medical information retrieved. Sentences were subsequently divided into two categories based on the legal outcome (conviction vs acquittal) and the different characteristics of the two sub-populations were compared to verify if there were variables significantly associated to the judge’s final judgment. Results Over the 5 years taken into consideration, there have been 1342 verdicts regarding crimes of sexual violence (374 cases) and regarding abuses against family members or cohabitants (875): other 93 cases regarded both sexual violence and abuse. 66.3% ended in conviction of the offender and 33.7% in acquittal of the accused. Cases of conviction were more frequent when they involved: use of a weapon by the assailant, as well as if the assailant had a criminal record and had a history of drug abuse or other addictions; duration of proceeding less 22 months and a civil party involved; presence of clinical documentation together with other deposition in addition to victim’s deposition; also frequent episodes of violence and application of precautionary measures were associated to conviction. Conclusions Many factors seem able to influence the judge’s judgment, although clearly each case must be singularly evaluated. The mere presence of medical documentation, without the support of other sources of evidence, such as the victim’s statement or further declarations, however, is almost always not definitive for the verdict. Despite so, in cases where there are multiple sources of evidence, clinical documentation can provide useful elements and can give clues on the consistency between the history told and injuries observed."

A strategic multilevel approach with specific reagent purchase and delivery, regional trainings, in-country missions, and the provision of technical support was established for timely preparedness of national reference laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 detection. All countries should be prepared to timely detect any potential pandemic emerging agent. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection implementation throughout the Americas showed the importance of an efficient and coordinated laboratory response for preparedness. Here we present how in 25 days the Americas Region went from no SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capacity, to molecular detection fully implemented in 28 Member States, under the coordinated strategy of the Pan American Health Organization and collaborative work at regional and country level with national authorities and public health laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W3176485259,"Objective Quantify changes in workload in relation to the anatomic pathologist workforce. Methods In house pathology reports for cytology and surgical specimens from a regional hospital laboratory over a nine- year period (2011–2019) were analyzed, using custom computer code. Report length for the diagnosis+microscopic+synoptic report, number of blocks, billing classification (L86x codes), billings, national workload model (L4E 2018), regional workload model (W2Q), case count, and pathologist workforce in full-time equivalents (FTEs) were quantified. Randomly selected cases (n = 1,100) were audited to assess accuracy. Results The study period had 574,093 pathology reports that could be analyzed. The coding accuracy was estimated at 95%. From 2011 to 2019: cases/year decreased 6% (66,056 to 61,962), blocks/year increased 20% (236,197 to 283,751), L4E workload units increased 23% (165,276 to 203,894), W2Q workload units increased 21% (149,841 to 181,321), report lines increased 19% (606,862 to 723,175), workforce increased 1% (30.42 to 30.77 FTEs), billings increased 13% ($6,766,927 to $7,677,109). W2Q in relation to L4E underweights work in practices with large specimens by up to a factor of 2x. Conclusions Work by L4E for large specimens is underrated by W2Q. Reporting requirements and pathology work-up have increased workload per pathology case. Work overall has increased significantly without a commensurate workforce increase. The significant practice changes in the pathology work environment should prompt local investment in the anatomic pathology workforce."
https://openalex.org/W3174273607,"Impaired lung function is independently associated with higher rates of disability, however, few studies have examined the association between lung function and functional limitation. This study aimed to assess this association and dose-response relationship in older adults.Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2012) was used as a cross-sectional study. Lung function was determined by Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Functional limitation in older adults was identified by six self-reported questions on physical function. 3070 adults aged 60 and over were enrolled in our study. Logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline models were applied to examine the association between lung function and the risk of functional limitation.FEV1 and FVC were inversely associated with the risk of functional limitation. In the full adjusted model, compared with the lowest tertile of FEV1, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of functional limitation for tertile 2 and tertile 3 were 0.5422 (0.3848-0.7639) and 0.4403 (0.2685-0.7220), and the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of functional limitation for tertile 2 and tertile 3 of FVC were 0.5243 (0.3503-0.7848) and 0.3726 (0.2072-0.6698). Furthermore, an inverse association persisted after stratified analysis by gender and sensitivity analysis. Dose-response analyses showed that the odds of functional limitation declined with increase in FEV1 and FVC in a nonlinear manner.Lung function was inversely associated with functional limitation among older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3175203680,"Previous studies have established that sex workers experience discrimination and stigma within healthcare settings, limiting their access and receipt of culturally safe care. These barriers impact sex workers' ability and desire to routinely engage with the healthcare system. Community empowerment interventions that are culturally safe offer an effective strategy to improve access to services and health outcomes for sex workers.This project was designed to inform the development of community empowerment interventions for sex workers by understanding their self-management, health promotion, and harm reduction needs.In-depth interviews (N = 21) were conducted with sex workers in Chicago. Transcripts of individual interviews were analyzed in Dedoose using rapid content analysis.Participants had a mean age of 32.7 years; 45% identified as White, 20% as Black, 15% as Latinx, and 20% as multiple races; 80% identified as Queer. A total of 52% of participants identified as cisgender women, 33% as transgender or gender fluid, 10% as cisgender men, and 5% declined to answer. Themes of self-management practices, stigmatizing and culturally unsafe experiences with healthcare providers, and the prohibitive cost of healthcare emerged as consistent barriers to routinely accessing healthcare. Despite identifying patient-centered care as a desired healthcare model, many participants did not report receiving care that was respectful or culturally responsive. Themes also included developing strategies to identify sex worker-safe care providers, creating false self-narratives and health histories in order to safely access care, and creating self-care routines that serve as alternatives to primary care.Our findings demonstrate how patient-centered care for sex-workers in Chicago might include holistic wellness exercises, accessible pay scales for services, and destigmatizing healthcare praxis. Focus on culturally safe healthcare provision presents needs beyond individualized, or even community-level, interventions. Ongoing provider training and inbuilt, systemic responsivity to patient needs and contexts is crucial to patient-centered care."

Method The iTRAQ technique was applied to compare DEPs in the serum of a CIH rat model and control group. Biological analysis of DEPs was performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia to explore related biological functions and signaling pathways. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to validate their expression in sera from patients with OSA and CIH rats. Results Twenty-three DEPs (fold change ≥1.2 or ≤0.833, p &lt;0.05) were identified, and two DEPs (unique peptides&gt;3 and higher coverage) were further verified by ELISA in the CIH rat model and OSA subject: apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4, p &lt;0.05) and Tubulin alpha-1A chain (TUBA1A, p &lt;0.05). Both groups showed significant differences in the expression levels of DEPs between the CIH and control groups and the severe OSA and non-OSA groups. APOA4 was found to be upregulated and TUBA1A downregulated in both the sera from OSA patients and CIH rats, on comparing proteomics results with clinical results. There were two pathways that involved three DEPs, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway ( p &lt;0.05) and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction ( p &lt;0.05). Conclusion APOA4 and TUBA1A may be potential novel biomarkers for CIH and OSA, and may play an important role in the development of OSA complications."
https://openalex.org/W3176694107,"Among patients with acute respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, tracheostomies are typically placed after approximately 7 to 10 days. Yet half of patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving tracheostomy will die within a year, often within three months. Existing mortality prediction models for prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as the ProVent Score, have poor sensitivity and are not applied until after 14 days of mechanical ventilation. We developed a model to predict 3-month mortality in patients requiring more than 7 days of mechanical ventilation using deep learning techniques and compared this to existing mortality models.Retrospective cohort study. Setting: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III Database. Patients: All adults requiring ≥ 7 days of mechanical ventilation. Measurements: A neural network model for 3-month mortality was created using process-of-care variables, including demographic, physiologic and clinical data. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) was compared to the ProVent model at predicting 3 and 12-month mortality. Shapley values were used to identify the variables with the greatest contributions to the model.There were 4,334 encounters divided into a development cohort (n = 3467) and a testing cohort (n = 867). The final deep learning model included 250 variables and had an AUROC of 0.74 for predicting 3-month mortality at day 7 of mechanical ventilation versus 0.59 for the ProVent model. Older age and elevated Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) Score on intensive care unit admission had the largest contribution to predicting mortality.We developed a deep learning prediction model for 3-month mortality among patients requiring ≥ 7 days of mechanical ventilation using a neural network approach utilizing readily available clinical variables. The model outperforms the ProVent model for predicting mortality among patients requiring ≥ 7 days of mechanical ventilation. This model requires external validation."
https://openalex.org/W3176825081,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Though immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized lung cancer therapy in recent years, there are several factors limiting the therapeutic efficacy of ICI-based immunotherapy in lung cancer. Recent evidence suggests that one such mechanism is the phenotypic shift of tumor-infiltrating macrophages away from an anti-tumor M1 phenotype and towards an anti-inflammatory and tumor-permissive M2 phenotype. Though this phenomenon is well documented, the means through which the lung tumor microenvironment (TME) usurps macrophage function are poorly described. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a known driver of both lung cancer pathobiology as well as M2 polarization, and its signaling is antagonized by the tumor suppressor gene HAI-1 (SPINT1). Using a combination of genomic databases, primary NSCLC specimens, and in vitro models, we determined that patients with loss of HAI-1 have a particularly poor prognosis, hallmarked by increased HGF expression and an M2-dominant immune infiltrate. Similarly, conditioned media from HAI-1-deficient tumor cells led to a loss of M1 and increased M2 polarization in vitro, and patient NSCLC tissues with loss of HAI-1 showed a similar loss of M1 macrophages. Combined, these results suggest that loss of HAI-1 is a potential means through which tumors acquire an immunosuppressive, M2-dominated TME, potentially through impaired M1 macrophage polarization. Hence, HAI-1 status may be informative when stratifying patients that may benefit from therapies targeting the HGF pathway, particularly as an adjuvant to ICI-based immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3174762026,"Dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses continue to be a major public health burden. Aedes mosquitoes, the primary vectors responsible for transmitting these viral pathogens, continue to flourish due to local challenges in vector control management. Yeast interfering RNA-baited larval lethal ovitraps are being developed as a novel biorational control tool for Aedes mosquitoes. This intervention circumvents increasing issues with insecticide resistance and poses no known threat to non-target organisms. In an effort to create public awareness of this alternative vector control strategy, gain stakeholder feedback regarding product design and acceptance of the new intervention, and build capacity for its potential integration into existing mosquito control programs, this investigation pursued community stakeholder engagement activities, which were undertaken in Trinidad and Tobago. Three forms of assessment, including paper surveys, community forums, and household interviews, were used with the goal of evaluating local community stakeholders' knowledge of mosquitoes, vector control practices, and perceptions of the new technology. These activities facilitated evaluation of the hypothesis that the ovitraps would be broadly accepted by community stakeholders as a means of biorational control for Aedes mosquitoes. A comparison of the types of stakeholder input communicated through use of the three assessment tools highlighted the utility and merit of using each tool for assessing new global health interventions. Most study participants reported a general willingness to purchase an ovitrap on condition that it would be affordable and safe for human health and the environment. Stakeholders provided valuable input on product design, distribution, and operation. A need for educational campaigns that provide a mechanism for educating stakeholders about vector ecology and management was highlighted. The results of the investigation, which are likely applicable to many other Caribbean nations and other countries with heavy arboviral disease burdens, were supportive of supplementation of existing vector control strategies through the use of the yeast RNAi-based ovitraps."

https://openalex.org/W3176634549,"During spermatogenesis, nuclear architecture of male germ cells is dynamically changed and epigenetic modifications, in particular methylation of histones, highly contribute to its regulation as well as differentiation of male germ cells. Although several methyltransferases and demethylases for histone H3 are involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis, roles of either histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) methyltransferases or H4K20 demethylases during spermatogenesis still remain to be elucidated. Recently, RSBN1 which is a testis-specific gene expressed in round spermatids was identified as a demethylase for dimethyl H4K20. In this study, therefore, we confirm the demethylase function of RSBN1 and compare distributions between RSBN1 and methylated H4K20 in the seminiferous tubules. Unlike previous report, expression analyses for RSBN1 reveal that RSBN1 is not a testis-specific gene and is expressed not only in round spermatids but also in elongated spermatids. In addition, RSBN1 can demethylate not only dimethyl H4K20 but also trimethyl H4K20 and could convert both dimethyl H4K20 and trimethyl H4K20 into monomethyl H4K20. When distribution pattern of RSBN1 in the seminiferous tubule is compared to that of methylated H4K20, both dimethyl H4K20 and trimethyl H4K20 but not monomethyl H4K20 are disappeared from RSBN1 positive germ cells, suggesting that testis-specific distribution patterns of methylated H4K20 might be constructed by RSBN1. Thus, novel expression and function of RSBN1 could be useful to comprehend epigenetic regulation during spermatogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W3174654052,"Introduction Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a highly clonal pathogen causing infections in various settings. The aim of this study was to determine if healthcare-associated (HA) MRSA isolates with the same spa -type originating from two geographically distinct hospitals in South Africa were genetically related based on PFGE. Furthermore, a small subset of MRSA isolates were characterised with WGS and then compared to PFGE to determine if PFGE is still a reliable method to define outbreaks and/or transmission chains. Methods Staphylococcus aureus isolated from blood cultures (BC) were submitted to the Centre for Healthcare-Associated Infections, Antimicrobial Resistance and Mycoses (CHARM) as part of a laboratory-based surveillance programme (GERMS-SA). The identified HA-MRSA isolates underwent molecular characterisation [Staphylococcal Chromosome Cassette (SCC) mec and spa -typing]. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on selected isolates with the same spa -type. Twenty-one MRSA isolates were selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) based on spa- type, PFGE clustering, time and place of isolation. Results Eighteen percent (n = 95/529) and 33% (n = 234/710) of isolates collected, from two public tertiary academic hospitals in the Gauteng (GAU) and the Western Cape (WC) provinces, were identified as MRSA, respectively. The most dominant clone in the GAU hospital was t037-III-MRSA (43.2%; n = 41/95). The most dominant clones in the WC hospital was t037-III-MRSA (23.9%, n = 56/234) and t045-I-MRSA (23.5%, n = 55/234). The GAU-t037-III-MRSA cases and WC-t045-I-MRSA cases occurred in the paediatric patient population, whereas the WC-t037-III-MRSA cases occurred in the adult patient population. A novel spa -type (t19935) was detected in the GAU hospital. PFGE showed that the GAU- and WC-t037-III-MRSA isolates were genetically indistinguishable, as well as most of the WC-t045-I-MRSA isolates. The Vienna/Hungarian/Brazilian clone and British EMRSA-3 clone were in circulation and a low frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (≤20) differences was observed among isolates with the same spa -type. Conclusion The low number of SNP differences is suggestive of uninterrupted strain transmission and the persistence of t037-III-MRSA and t045-I-MRSA from 2013 to 2017 in the two studied hospitals. Alternative infection prevention and control strategies should be considered to supplement control efforts."

We propose a methodology to identify authors with multiple affiliations co-hosted by two organizations for a prolonged period of time, which distinguishes them from authors who change jobs or only hold short appointments. We apply this methodology to all authors and organizations residing in the Netherlands and find 626 organizations with at least one co-affiliated researcher. We perform a regression analysis of the inter-organizational network spanned by all co-affiliated researchers, and find strong negative effects of travel time. We also find that researchers who hold multiple affiliations, often cross the institutional boundaries between university, industry, government, healthcare and public research organizations. In particular, university-affiliated researchers tend to be most active in bridging to organizations in other institutional spheres. We end with some reflections for future studies and implications for science policy."
https://openalex.org/W3176514497,"HIV status awareness is critical for HIV prevention and care but HIV testing rates remain low in Uganda, especially among men. One suggested approach to increase access and utilisation of HIV testing services is HIV self-testing. We explored perceptions of pregnant and lactating women and their male partners who attended antenatal care, and health care providers in a government hospital in Kampala, Uganda, about HIV self-testing for initial or repeat testing for women and their partners during pregnancy and postpartum We draw implications for scaling-up this new testing approach in Uganda.This was a qualitative study conducted at Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, between April and December 2017. We conducted in-depth interviews with five pregnant or lactating women and their five male partners; five focus group discussions (two with women, two with health workers and one with male partners of women attending antenatal care) and five key informant interviews with health workers providing prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) services. Data were analysed using content thematic approach.There was limited awareness about HIV self-testing especially among pregnant or lactating women and their male partners. Study participants mentioned that HIV self-testing would enable people to know their HIV status faster, they thought the approach would be cost- and time-saving compared to health facility-based HIV testing, improve confidentiality and reduce stigma for those who test HIV positive. They expressed however, a general fear that HIV self-testing would lead to harm to self and others in case one tested HIV positive, including suicide, violence among couples, intentional transmission of HIV, and limited linkage to care due to lack of counselling. The likely misinterpretation of HIV test results especially among those with no or limited education, and possible coercion exerted by male partners on their wives were other potential concerns raised about the use of HIV self-testing.There was limited knowledge about HIV self-testing among pregnant and lactating women, their partners and health workers. While the self-testing modality was perceived to be critical for helping people, especially those in casual and distant relationships, to know their HIV status and that of their partners, most study participants believed that HIV self-testing could potentially result in a multitude of negative outcomes in the absence of pre- and post-test counselling. Successful scale-up and integration of self-testing in HIV programs requires community education, provision of information materials and making self-test kits accessible and affordable, especially in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W3177457629,"Flexible targeted helping is considered an advanced form of prosocial behavior in hominoids, as it requires the actor to assess different situations that a conspecific may be in, and to subsequently flexibly satisfy different needs of that partner depending on the nature of those situations. So far, apart from humans such behaviour has only been experimentally shown in chimpanzees and in Eurasian jays. Recent studies highlight the prosocial tendencies of several bird species, yet flexible targeted helping remained untested, largely due to methodological issues as such tasks are generally designed around tool-use, and very few bird species are capable of tool-use. Here, we tested Goffin's cockatoos, which proved to be skilled tool innovators in captivity, in a tool transfer task in which an actor had access to four different objects/tools and a partner to one of two different apparatuses that each required one of these tools to retrieve a reward. As expected from this species, we recorded playful object transfers across all conditions. Yet, importantly and similar to apes, three out of eight birds transferred the correct tool more often in the test condition than in a condition that also featured an apparatus but no partner. Furthermore, one of these birds transferred that correct tool first more often before transferring any other object in the test condition than in the no-partner condition, while the other two cockatoos were marginally non-significantly more likely to do so. Additionally, there was no difference in the likelihood of the correct tool being transferred first for either of the two apparatuses, suggesting that these birds flexibly adjusted what to transfer based on their partner´s need. Future studies should focus on explanations for the intra-specific variation of this behaviour, and should test other parrots and other large-brained birds to see how this can be generalized across the class and to investigate the evolutionary history of this trait."
https://openalex.org/W3173957290,"Autotetraploid rice exhibited hybrid vigor and greater genetic variation compared to diploid rice, but low pollen fertility is a major hindrance for its utilization. Our previous analysis revealed that large number of pollen fertility genes were exhibited down-regulation in autotetraploid rice. Hence, it is of utmost importance to reveal the expression patterns of pollen fertility genes with high accuracy. To find stable reference genes for autotetraploid rice, we compared the pollen development stages between diploid and autotetraploid rice, and 14 candidate genes were selected based on transcriptome analysis to evaluate their expression levels. Autotetraploid rice (i.e. Taichung65-4x) displayed lower seed set (40.40%) and higher percentage of abnormalities during the pollen development process than its diploid counterpart. To detect the candidate reference genes for pollen development of autotetraploid and diploid rice, we used five different algorithms, including NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt method, geNorm and Re-Finder to evaluate their expression patterns stability. Consequently, we identified two genes, Cytochrome b5 and CPI, as the best candidate reference genes for qRT-PCR normalization in autotetraploid and diploid rice during pre-meiosis, meiosis, single microspore and bicellular pollen development stages. However, Cytochrome b5 was found to be the most stably expressed gene during different pollen development stages in autotetraploid rice. The results of our study provide a platform for subsequent gene expression analyses in autotetraploid rice, which could also be used in other polyploid plants."

https://openalex.org/W3176564609,"Quantitative assessment of pulmonary blood flow distribution is important when determining the clinical indications for treating pulmonary arterial branch stenosis. Lung perfusion scintigraphy is currently the gold standard for quantitative blood flow measurement. However, it is expensive, cannot provide a real-time assessment, requires additional sedation, and exposes the patient to ionizing radiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a novel technology for measuring pulmonary blood flow distribution in each lung by conventional X-ray pulmonary angiography and to compare its performance to that of lung perfusion scintigraphy.Contrast-enhanced X-ray pulmonary angiography images were acquired at a frame rate of 30 frames per second. The baseline mask image, obtained before contrast agent injection, was subtracted from subsequent, consecutive images. The time-signal intensity curves of two regions of interest, established at each lung field, were obtained on a frame-to-frame basis. The net increase in signal intensity within each region at the torrent period during the second cardiac cycle before contrast agent enhancement over the total lung field was measured, and the right-to-left ratio of the signal intensity was calculated. The right-to-left ratio obtained with this approach was compared to that obtained with scintigraphy. Agreement of the right-to-left ratio between X-ray angiography and lung scintigraphy measurements was assessed using linear fitting with the Pearson correlation coefficient.The calculation of the right-to-left ratio of pulmonary blood flow by our kinetic model was feasible for seven children as a pilot study. The right-to-left ratio of pulmonary blood flow distribution calculated from pulmonary angiography was in good agreement with that of lung perfusion scintigraphy, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91 and a slope of linear fit of 1.2 (p<0.005).The novel diagnostic technology using X-ray pulmonary angiography from our kinetic model can feasibly quantify the right-to-left ratio of pulmonary blood flow distribution. This technology may serve as a substitute for lung perfusion scintigraphy, which is quite beneficial for small children susceptible to radiation exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3176611630,"Dynamic compaction is a cost-effective foundation treatment technology, that is widely used in various types and conditions of foundations. However, due to the limitation of natural conditions (water content between 3% and 8%) in north-western China, it is difficult to meet the requirements of the optimal water content during dynamic compaction. To better treat a foundation with a low water content, a series of model tests were carried out by using homemade test equipment to study the influence of the ramming energy and η value on the efficiency of dynamic compaction under a low water content. The results showed that the improvement of the energy level could compensate for the poor effect of dynamic compaction caused by a low water content in arid regions. Compared with that at the optimal water content, the efficiency of dynamic compaction was 58.1% to 66.2% at a low water content and excited the optimal energy level. Increasing the η value was also beneficial to improving the effect of dynamic compaction. Hence, the optimal energy level combined with the appropriate η value is of great merit in treating the foundation of arid regions by using the dynamic compaction method, which provides new parameter suggestions and engineering guidance for dynamic compaction construction in arid areas."

Association between endometriosis and extraovarian clear cell cancers is unclear. This study aimed to assess the association between surgically diagnosed endometriosis and risk of extraovarian clear cell cancers according to the type of endometriosis (i.e., ovarian, peritoneal, and other endometriosis) and the site of clear cell cancer.In this register-based historic cohort study we identified all women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registry 1987-2012. Data on extraovarian clear cell cancers of these women were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry. The follow-up started January 1st, 2007 or at endometriosis diagnosis (if later), and ended at emigration, death or on the December 31st, 2014. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for each site of clear cell carcinoma (intestine, kidney, urinary tract, gynecological organs other than ovary), using the Finnish female population as reference.The endometriosis cohort consisted of 48,996 women, including 22,745 women with ovarian and 19,809 women with peritoneal endometriosis. Altogether 23 extraovarian clear cell cancers were observed during 367,386 person-years of follow-up. The risk of extraovarian clear cell cancer was not increased among all women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis (standardized incidence ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.56-1.33) nor in different types of endometriosis. The incidence of clear cell cancer in any specific site was not increased either.The risk of extraovarian clear cell cancers in women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis is similar to that in the general population in Finland."

This study was designed to survey pulmonologists to identify barriers to early diagnosis and subsequent appropriate use of biologics for SA in Croatia.A pulmonologist group with expertise in SA developed the initial list of questions, with the final questionnaire created according to a 2-round Delphi method. The resulting survey consisted of 23 items consequently divided into 4 domains: 1) Pulmonologists' demographics and professional experiences; 2) Concerns about asthma management; 3) Attitudes toward SA diagnosis; and 4) Beliefs and attitudes regarding the use of biologics in managing SA. The given answers represented the respondents' estimates.Eighty-four surveys were analyzed, with pulmonologists observing that general practitioners often inaccurately diagnose asthma and treat acute exacerbations. Although specialist centers are capably and correctly equipped, the time to diagnose patients with SA is approximately 3.5 months, with initial use of biologics delayed an additional 2 months. The primary indications for prescribing biologics are conventional therapy with oral glucocorticoids (91.7%) and frequent acute exacerbations (82.1%). In addition to improper diagnosis (64.3%), many patients with SA do not receive the indicated biologics owing to strict administrative directives for reimbursement (70.2%) or limited hospital resources (57.1%).The limitations of this survey include the subjective nature of the collected data, the relatively small sample size, and the lack of the biologic efficacy evaluation.Croatian pulmonologists observed that a significant number of patients with SA who are eligible for biologics are not prescribed them, largely because of an inaccurate and/or delayed diagnosis, a delayed referral to a specialist center, highly restrictive criteria for reimbursement, and/or institutional budgetary limitations."
