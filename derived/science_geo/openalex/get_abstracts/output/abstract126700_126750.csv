https://openalex.org/W1984830754,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products, RAGE, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules differentially expressed on a range of cell types. Ligation of RAGE perturbs homeostatic mechanisms and, potentially, provides a basis for cellular dysfunction in pathologic situations in which its ligands accumulate. To understand factors underlying RAGE expression, we cloned the 5′-flanking region of the RAGE gene and characterized putative regulatory motifs. Analysis of the putative promoter region revealed the presence of three potential NF-κB-like and two SP1 binding sites. Transient transfection of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells using chimeric 5′-deletion constructs linked to luciferase reporter revealed that the region −1543/−587 contributed importantly to both basal and stimulated expression of the RAGE gene. This region of the RAGE gene contained three putative NF-κB-like binding sites and was responsible for increased luciferase activity observed when endothelial or smooth muscle cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. DNase I footprinting assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that two of the three NF-κB-like binding sites (1 and 2) were likely functional and responsive to stimuli. Upon simultaneous mutation of NF-κB-like sites 1 and 2, both basal promoter expression and response to stimulation with LPS, as measured by relative luciferase activity, were significantly diminished. These results point to NF-κB-dependent mechanisms regulating cellular expression of RAGE and suggest a means of linking RAGE to the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2046053482,"Caveolae are plasma membrane-attached vesicular organelles. Caveolin-1, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal component of caveolae membranes in vivo. Both caveolae and caveolin are most abundantly expressed in terminally differentiated cells: adipocytes, endothelial cells, and muscle cells. Conversely, caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression are lost or reduced during cell transformation by activated oncogenes such as v-abl and H-ras(G12V); caveolae are absent from these cell lines. However, its remains unknown whether down-regulation of caveolin-1 protein and caveolae organelles contributes to their transformed phenotype.Here, we have expressed caveolin-1 in oncogenically transformed cells under the control of an inducible-expression system. Regulated induction of caveolin-1 expression was monitored by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. Our results indicate that caveolin-1 protein is expressed well using this system and correctly localizes to the plasma membrane. Induction of caveolin-1 expression in v-Abl-transformed and H-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells abrogated the anchorage-independent growth of these cells in soft agar and resulted in the de novo formation of caveolae as seen by transmission electron microscopy. Consistent with its antagonism of Ras-mediated cell transformation, caveolin-1 expression dramatically inhibited both Ras/MAPK-mediated and basal transcriptional activation of a mitogen-sensitive promoter. Using an established system to detect apoptotic cell death, it appears that the effects of caveolin-1 may, in part, be attributed to its ability to initiate apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells. In addition, we find that caveolin-1 expression levels are reversibly down-regulated by two distinct oncogenic stimuli. Taken together, our results indicate that down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression and caveolae organelles may be critical to maintaining the transformed phenotype in certain cell populations.

Caveolae are cell surface specializations that represent a subcompartment of the plasma membrane (1Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem.

Morphologically, they appear as 50–100 nm vesicular structures near or attached to the plasma membrane (3Simionescu N. Simionescu M. Palade G.E. J.

Although caveolae are present in most cell types, they are most abundant in terminally differentiated cells such as adipocytes, endothelial cells, type I pneumocytes, and skeletal muscle cells (reviewed in Ref. 5Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.S. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). During adipocyte differentiation, the number of caveolae increases ∼10-fold until they represent up to 20% of the surface area of the plasma membrane (6Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.-L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); similarly, both caveolin mRNA and protein are induced ∼20–25-fold during this process (7Scherer P.E.

The exact function of caveolae remains unknown; however, they are thought to participate in cellular transport processes and signal transduction (9Anderson R.G.W. Current Opin.

Recently, a family of caveolin-related proteins has been identified; caveolin has been re-termed caveolin-1 (8Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It has been proposed that caveolin family members function as scaffolding proteins (21Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These and other signaling molecules appear to be tightly associated as a discrete complex with caveolin-1 as shown using a polyhistidine-tagged form of caveolin for detergent-free affinity purification of caveolae membranes (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Based on these and other observations, we and others have proposed the “caveolae signaling hypothesis,” which states that caveolar localization of certain inactive signaling molecules could provide a compartmental basis for their regulated activation and explain cross-talk between different signaling pathways (10Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 30Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J.

In support of this idea, caveolin-1 binding can functionally suppress the GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G-proteins and inhibit the kinase activity of Src-family tyrosine kinases through a common caveolin domain, termed the caveolin-scaffolding domain (25Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Thus, we have suggested that caveolin may function as a negative regulator of many different classes of signaling molecules through the recognition of specific caveolin-binding motifs (33Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Modification and/or inactivation of caveolin-1 expression appears to be a common feature of the transformed phenotype. Historically, caveolin was first identified as a major v-Src substrate in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells (34Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this observation, Glenney and co-workers (34Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed that caveolin may represent a critical target during cell transformation. In direct support of this notion, caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression are reduced or absent in NIH 3T3 cells transformed by a variety of activated oncogenes (v-abl, Bcr-abl, and H-ras (G12V)); caveolae organelles are also missing from these transformed cells (35Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These findings may also have relevance to human cancers. Using differential display and subtractive hybridization techniques, Sager and co-workers have identified a number of “candidate tumor suppressor genes” these are genes whose mRNAs are down-regulated in human mammary carcinomas (36Sager R. Sheng S. Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Zou Z. Stenman G. Swisshelm K. Chen Z. Hendrix M.J.C. Pemberton P. Rafidi K. Ryan K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; LIX: 537-546Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this screening approach, caveolin-1 was independently identified as one of 26 gene products down-regulated during mammary tumorigenesis. In addition, caveolin-1 expression was absent in several transformed cell lines derived from human mammary carcinomas including: MT-1, MCF-7, ZR-75–1, T47D, MDA-MB-361, and MDA-MB-474 (36Sager R. Sheng S. Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Zou Z. Stenman G. Swisshelm K. Chen Z. Hendrix M.J.C. Pemberton P. Rafidi K. Ryan K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; LIX: 537-546Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, caveolin-1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in normal mammary epithelium. However, it remains unknown whether a loss of caveolin-1 expression contributes to the oncogenic phenotype. Here, we have recombinantly expressed caveolin-1 in oncogenically transformed NIH 3T3 cell lines by employing an inducible expression system. Our results indicate that regulated induction of caveolin-1 expression in v-Abl-transformed and H-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells abrogated the growth of these cells in soft agar. These results are in accordance with the previous observations that (i) caveolin-1 is most abundantly expressed in terminally differentiated cells (5Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.S. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and (ii) caveolin-1 is dramatically down-regulated in oncogenically transformed cell lines (35Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). mAb 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. 2297 directed against caveolin-1 was the generous gift of Dr. John R. Glenney (Transduction Laboratories). The mAb 9E10 was provided by the Harvard Monoclonal Antibody Facility (Cambridge, MA). The cDNA for caveolin-1 was as we described previously (30Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The NIH 3T3 cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive form of v-Abl was the generous gift of Dr. Naomi Rosenberg (Tufts University School of Medicine). A variety of other reagents were purchased commercially: donor calf serum, fetal bovine serum, pre-stained protein markers (Life Technologies, Inc.); IPTG (dioxane-free; Sigma and Calbiochem, Inc.); hygromycin B (Calbiochem., Inc.); SeaPlaque low-melting temperature-agarose (American Bioanalytical); and lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed, Inc.); anti-myc (polyclonal) IgG (MBL, Inc.). MEK (PD 98059) and p38 MAP kinase inhibitors (SB202190 and SB203580) were purchased from Calbiochem., Inc. Normal and transformed NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% donor calf serum, as described previously (35Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). F11 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For inducible expression of caveolin-1, we used the LacSwitch Inducible Mammalian Expression system (Stratagene, Inc.). Briefly, a previously described C-terminally myc-tagged form of caveolin-1 (37Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the NotI site of the vector pOP13CAT containing modified sequences from the lac operon, generating pOP13-Cav-1. v-Abl-transformed and H-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with pOP13-Cav-1 and p3′SS (a vector encoding the lac-repressor and hygromycin resistance), as suggested by the manufacturer. After selection in medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml hygromycin, resistant colonies were picked by trypsinization using cloning rings. Individual clones were screened for IPTG-based induction of recombinant caveolin-1 expression by Western blot analysis using both anti-caveolin-1 (mAb 2297) and anti-myc (polyclonal) IgG. Induction was carried out for 20–40 h in medium containing 5 mm IPTG, as suggested by the manufacturer (Stratagene, Inc.). Cells were extracted for 45 min on ice with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15m NaCl) containing 60 mm octylglucoside (30Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J.

The protein content of these extracts was determined using a BCA protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were probed with anti-caveolin IgG (mAb 2297; 1/200) or anti-myc IgG (polyclonal; 1/500). Approximately 50 μg of cell extract was routinely loaded per lane. Bound IgG were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL system (Amersham and Pierce, Inc.). The relative amount of caveolin expressed in transformed cells was determined by comparison with standard dilutions of an extract of normal NIH 3T3 cells. All reactions were performed at room temperature. v-Abl-transformed and H-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells harboring inducible caveolin-1 expression were plated onto coverslips and cultured in normal growth medium with or without 5 mm IPTG for 20–40 h. Cells were then briefly washed three times with PBS and fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (8Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl.

After permeabilization, cells were rinsed with PBS and treated with 25 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min to quench free aldehyde groups. For immunolabeling, the cells were then successively incubated with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin containing: (i) a 1:300 dilution of mAb 9E10 directed against themyc-epitope; and (ii) lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml). Incubations with primary and secondary antibodies were 60 min each. Cells were washed three times with PBS between incubations. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent and observed under a Bio-Rad MR600 confocal fluorescence microscope. Cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde, post-fixed with OsO4, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate as described (30Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J.

Caveolae were identified by their characteristic flask-shape, size (50–100 nm), and location at or near the plasma membrane (1Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem.

Growth in soft agar was assayed as we described previously with minor modifications (35Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 104 cells of each cell line were suspended in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% donor calf serum and O.33% SeaPlaque low-melting temperature-agarose. These cells were plated over a 2-ml layer of solidified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% donor calf serum and 0.5% agarose, and cells were allowed to settle to the interface between these layers at 37 °C. After 20 min, the plates were allowed to harden at room temperature for 30 min before returning to 37 °C. The plates were fed every 2–3 days by overlaying with 2-ml of medium containing O.33% agarose. After 7–10 days, colonies were photographed under low magnification (× 4 or 6). In the case of IPTG induction, cells were induced with 5 mm IPTG for 20–40 h before plating; the agarose contained 22 mm IPTG to adjust for restricted diffusion in a semi-solid matrix. Activation of c-fospromoter activity was measured as we described previously (40Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Okamoto T. Homma Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31955-31961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells were co-transfected with a c-fospromoter-CAT plasmid and a plasmid encoding H-Ras (G12V). To evaluate the possible effect of caveolin on Ras activation, the caveolin-1 cDNA (pCB-7-Cav-1) or vector alone (pCB-7) was included during the co-transfection. CAT activity was measured essentially as described previously (40Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Okamoto T. Homma Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31955-31961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TUNEL assay was performed with a kit distributed by Oncor, as described previously (41Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T. Komatsuzaki K. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Giambarella U. Nishimoto I.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, F11 cells or COS-7 cells (∼4 × 104 cells/well) were seeded onto glass coverslips with in a 24-well dish. After transfection with the pCB-7 vector alone or with pCB-7-Cav-1, the cells on glass coverslips were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels are down-regulated in NIH 3T3 cells transformed by a variety of activated oncogenes, including v-abl and H-ras (G12V) (35Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether reductions in caveolin-1 levels are a direct consequence of the oncogenic stimulus. Alternatively, cells that express reduced levels of caveolin-1 may simply be preferentially selected for oncogenic transformation. To address this issue, we have employed an NIH 3T3 cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive form of v-Abl (43Engelman A. Rosenberg N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4242-4251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This form of v-Abl contains two missense mutations engineered within its kinase domain that render the kinase inactive at the non-permissive temperature (39 °C). As shown in Fig. 1, shift to the non-permissive temperature abrogates tyrosine phosphorylation of its cellular substrates; caveolin-1 levels are induced during inactivation of the kinase and return to levels seen in normal NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.1, panel B). These results demonstrate that caveolin-1 levels can be down-regulated by an oncogenic stimulus. Normal and v-Abl transformed NIH 3T3 cells are shown for comparison; note that this temperature shift does not effect either tyrosine phosphorylation or caveolin-1 expression in these cells (Fig. 1, panel A). In a second independent approach, we evaluated the effect of a MEK inhibitor on the expression of caveolin-1 in H-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. The MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, selectively inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of MEK (MAP kinase kinase) and therefore prevents activation of MAP kinase (p44 and p42) and its substrates (44Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar). PD 98059 does not affect the activity of activated MEK or other serine/threonine protein kinases, including Raf-1, MAPK, JNK, cyclin A/cdk2, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C. Treatment with PD 98059 is known to reverse the phenotype of Ras-transformed 3T3 cells (44Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that treatment of H-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells with PD 98059 dramatically up-regulates caveolin-1 protein expression (∼15–20-fold induction). These results clearly indicate that down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression in Ras-transformed cells is mediated by constitutive activation of the MEK/MAP kinase (p44 and p42) pathway. In contrast, treatment with specific inhibitors of p38 MAP kinases (SB202190 or SB203580 (45Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3113) Google Scholar)) had no effect on caveolin-1 expression levels although these compounds markedly changed the morphology of the Ras-transformed cells. As caveolin-1 expression is down-regulated during cell transformation, it has been previously suggested that caveolin-1 could function as a candidate transformation suppressor protein (35Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 36Sager R. Sheng S. Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Zou Z. Stenman G. Swisshelm K. Chen Z. Hendrix M.J.C. Pemberton P. Rafidi K. Ryan K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; LIX: 537-546Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we proceeded to stably transfect v-Abl-transformed and H-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells with the caveolin-1 cDNA under the control of a constitutive cytomegalovirus-based promoter. However, none of the selected clones expressed the caveolin-1 protein (not shown). As the identical construct has been expressed well in other non-transformed mammalian cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (37Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), we speculated that expression of caveolin-1 in transformed cells could negatively affect their growth. To test this hypothesis, we next transfected v-Abl-transformed and H-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells with the caveolin-1 cDNA under the control of an inducible mammalian expression system (LacSwitch; see “Experimental Procedures”). In this system, addition of 5 mm IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside) to the culture media allows for regulated expression of the inserted gene product. IPTG is a non-hyrolyzable galactose analog that is non-toxic to NIH 3T3 cells and other mammalian cells at concentrations up to 130 mm (46Wyborski D.L. Short J.M. Nucleic Acids Res."
https://openalex.org/W2042392347,"Sphingomyelin hydrolysis through the activation of sphingomyelinases has become a potentially important signaling pathway with the product ceramide implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. However, little is known about the regulation of sphingomyelinases. In this study, we show that the magnesium-dependent, neutral pH-optimum and membrane-associated sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) is inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, by glutathione (GSH) at physiological concentrations with a greater than 95% inhibition observed at 5 mm GSH. The inhibitory effect of GSH was reproduced by γ-glutamyl-cysteine, but not the cysteinyl-glycine fragment of GSH. The S-modified GSH analogs were as effective as GSH in inhibiting the N-SMase. On the other hand, neither dithiothreitol nor β-mercaptoethanol had any effect on the N-SMase, suggesting that the sulfhydryl in GSH is not required for inhibition of N-SMase. GSH had no effect on the acid pH-optimum SMase, whereas dithiothreitol inhibited the acid SMase. These results suggest that in cells the N-SMase is inactive in the presence of physiological concentrations of GSH (1–20 mm). Finally, treatment of cultured Molt-4 cells with the GSH synthesis inhibitor,l-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine, resulted in a time-dependent depletion of GSH, accompanied by an increased hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and production of ceramide. Since GSH depletion is observed in a variety of cells in the process of cellular injury and apoptosis, these studies suggest that depletion of GSH may be an important mechanism in activation of N-SMase. This mechanism may therefore bring together the fields of oxidative stress and signaling through products of sphingomyelin hydrolysis.

Sphingolipids have emerged as important components of signal transduction pathways involved in a variety of cellular processes. This is best illustrated in the case of the sphingomyelin (SM) 1The abbreviations used are: SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; N-SMase, neutral magnesium-dependent SMase; A-SMase, acid SMase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSO,l-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine. cycle (1Okazaki T.

In this pathway, a number of extracellular agents such as tumor necrosis factor α (2Kim M.-Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol.

In turn, ceramide has been suggested to play important roles in differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inflammation, and the regulation of eukaryotic stress responses (9Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the ceramide generated in response to the action of extracellular agents appears to derive from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, not much is known about the mechanisms regulating the activity of the involved SMases. To date, at least five types of SMases have been identified. An acidic sphingomyelinase (A-SMase) was first discovered and found to have an optimum pH at 5.0 (10Spence M.W. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 3-23PubMed Google Scholar). Although the acidic sphingomyelinase has been primarily found to reside in the lysosomes, it has also been detected as a soluble form in cytosol and extracellular media (11Quintern L.E. Weitz G. Nehrkorn H. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been cloned, and it is deficient in Neimann-Pick cells (12Kitagawa T. Jpn. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 32: 55-69Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It is also suggested to play a role in radiation-induced apoptosis (13Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.-C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) and has been described to be activated by Fas (14Cifone M.G. De Maria R. Roncaioli P. Rippo M.R. Azuma M. Lanier L.L. Santoni A. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor-α (15Schutze S. Potthof K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). A neutral pH-optimum and magnesium-dependent SMase (N-SMase) has also been described (16Chatterjee S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 25-47PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is associated with the plasma membrane. It is found to be activated in response to tumor necrosis factor-α, Fas, Ara-C, and serum deprivation, and its activation appears to be closely related to growth suppression and apoptosis (6Strum J.C. Small G.W. Pauig S.B. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15493-15497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M.

Cell. 1992; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Recently, a cytosolic magnesium-independent neutral SMase was partially purified from HL-60 cells following treatment with vitamin D3 (19Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a zinc-dependent acidic SMase was detected in sera from a variety of species (20Spence M.W. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. St C. Cook H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5358-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies suggest that it is derived from the lysosomal A-SMase (21Schiessel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K., J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Finally, an alkaline pH-optimum SMase has been described in intestinal cells (22Nyberg L. Duan R.D. Axelson J. Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In ongoing studies on characterizing N-SMase, we discovered that this enzyme was inhibited in vitro by physiologically relevant concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and it was activated in cells depleted of GSH. Glutathione, a tripeptide (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine), is the most abundant nonprotein thiol-containing small molecule in mammalian cells. It plays a critical role in cellular defense against oxidative stress by inactivating free radials, reactive oxygen species, and a variety of cytotoxic electrophiles including alkylating agents. GSH functions as an antioxidant by directly reacting with free radicals, conjugating with various agents to form S-substituted adducts nonenzymatically or through the action of GSHS-transferase, and serves as a substrate for GSH peroxidase (23Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, cells maintain a high level of intracellular GSH (1–20 mm). In this study, we report on the effects of GSH on N-SMase. The implications of inhibition of N-SMase by GSH will be discussed. Molt-4 human leukemia cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). RPMI 1640 and fetal calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Glutathione and related compounds were from Sigma. Leukotrienes were from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Stripped rat brains were from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR). DEAE-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [N-methyl-14C]Sphingomyelin was synthesized as described previously (19Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molt-4 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105/ml and grown to near confluence (1.5 × 106/ml) before use. Molt-4 cells (2.5 × 109) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized with a Teflon pestle glass homogenizer in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A). The post-nuclear homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the pellet was dissolved in 1% Triton X-100 in lysis buffer. The Triton X-100-soluble fraction was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After washing off the unbound proteins, the enzymes were eluted by stepping to 1 m NaCl in buffer A, followed by a gradient of Triton X-100 from 0–1% in buffer A. Fractions (4 ml) were collected and assayed for activities of N-SMase and A-SMase. The recovery of the N-SMase over the DEAE-Sepharose column was typically greater than 85%. For isolating SMases from rat brain, 4 rat brains were used and the procedure was the same as that for Molt-4 cells as described above. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The activity of both N-SMase and A-SMase were determined using a mixed micelle assay system (19Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determining N-SMase activity, enzyme preparation (5–10 μl, 0.5–1 μg of protein) diluted to 50 μl with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was mixed with 10 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (100,000 dpm) dissolved in 0.05% Triton X-100 in 50 μl of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm magnesium chloride. The reaction proceeded for 30 min at 37 °C and was then terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) followed by 0.2 ml of H2O. After phase separation, a portion of the upper phase was removed and the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. A-SMase activity was determined using [14C]sphingomyelin resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The identity of the product in the upper phase was confirmed by thin layer chromatography as described (19Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molt-4 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105/ml in complete medium, rested for 24 h, and then treated with or without 250 μml-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO) for various time intervals. Afterward, cells were pelleted and total cellular lipids extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (49Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Ceramide content was determined using a modified diacylglycerol kinase assay as described previously (7Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5325-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 8Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F.

Yonehara S. Hannun Y.A. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). SM level was measured as described previously (8Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellular lipids were separated by TLC using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30:8:5). The sphingomyelin spots were visualized by iodine staining, scraped, and measured for phosphate. Sphingomyelin was quantitated using an external standard and was normalized to total phosphate. Intracellular GSH content was determined by the Griffith (50Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) modification of Tietze's enzymatic procedure (51Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107) were resuspended in 400 μl of 10% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. The acid-precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 2000 × g. To determine the GSH content, aliquots of the acid-soluble supernatant were mixed with 125 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 6.3 mm EDTA, 0.21 mm NADPH, and 0.6 mm5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in a total volume of 1 ml. Upon addition of glutathione reductase, the increase in absorption at 412 nm was monitored and used to determine the amount of GSH in the sample by comparison to a reference curve generated with known amounts of GSH standard. Protein content was determined by the Bradford dye binding assay (52Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The formation of GSH fragments, γ-glutamyl-cysteine and cysteinyl-glycine, was examined by incubating N-SMase preparation with GSH for a given time, and an aliquot of the mixture was separated on a silica thin layer chromatographic plate developed with a solvent system of 1-butanol, pyridine, and water (1:1:1, v/v) as reported by Tate and Meister (48Tate S.S. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7593-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The compounds were identified by spraying with ninhydrin and their migration compared with authentic standards. As part of the biochemical characterization of N-SMase, we examined the effect of reducing agents on the in vitroactivity of the enzyme. To this end, we partially purified the N-SMase from the membranes of Molt-4 cells which have very little cellular acidic SMase activity. On DEAE-Sepharose column, three peaks of SMase activity were resolved (see Fig. 4 A). Peak I (flow-through) contained predominantly A-SMase and peak II (salt elution) had a small quantity of A-SMase. Peak III (detergent elution) had the highest activity of N-SMase (4 times that of peak II) and no A-SMase activity. The N-SMase in peak III was typically 50–100-fold purified over post-nuclear homogenate, and the N-SMase in peak II was 10–20-fold purified. Therefore, the N-SMase in peak III was used for this study. The partially purified N-SMase was preincubated with the reducing agents of interest, and this was followed by incubation with 10 mol% of radiolabeled sphingomyelin substrate in a Triton X-100 mixed micelle assay in the presence of 5 mm magnesium. The radiolabeled product formed after a 30-min incubation with substrate was separated by organic solvent extraction and its quantity determined by liquid scintillation counting. The reaction was linear within the range of the amount of enzyme protein, concentration of substrate, and incubation time used in this study. As shown in Fig. 1, preincubation of N-SMase for 15 min at 37 °C with concentrations of GSH ranging from 1 to 20 mm resulted in an inhibition of the N-SMase within a very narrow GSH concentration range. Little inhibition was detected at concentrations of GSH below 2 mm, whereas GSH above 4 mm gave rise typically to a 90–100% inhibition of N-SMase (Fig. 1 A). Dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mm were completely ineffective in inhibiting the N-SMase (Fig. 1 A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that physiological concentrations of GSH are inhibitory to the neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase and that this inhibitory property of GSH does not appear to be a general property of thiol-containing reducing agents.Figure 1Inhibition of N-SMase by GSH. A, effect of reducing agents on N-SMase activity. DEAE-Sepharose-purified N-SMase (1 μg of protein) from Molt-4 cells was preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of GSH, DTT, or β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) in 50 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 mol% [14C]SM in a Triton X-100 (0.05% final concentration) mixed micelle containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction product was extracted and radioactivity determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are mean ± S.D. from three separate experiments performed in duplicate. B, time course for GSH inhibition of N-SMase. DEAE-purified Molt-4 cell N-SMase was preincubated at 37 °C with 0–5 mm GSH for 0–15 min prior to the initiation of activity assay. Results are mean of duplicate determinations and are representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inhibition by GSH of the N-SMase was enhanced by preincubation of GSH with the enzyme. When no preincubation time was allowed, GSH at 5 mm inhibited the enzyme activity by 30% (Fig.1 B). When the enzyme was preincubated with GSH for time periods ranging from 5 to 15 min, the degree of inhibition progressively increased such that preincubation with 5 mmGSH for 5, 10, and 15 min resulted in a 70, 90, and 100% inhibition, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Preincubation of the enzyme with GSH for time periods longer than 15 min did not result in further inhibition (data not shown). Interestingly, for preincubation time intervals longer than 5 min, similar degree of inhibition was observed for GSH concentrations between 3 and 5 mm (Fig.1 B). To rule out effects of preincubation on stability of the enzyme or GSH, the following experiments were performed. First, preincubation of N-SMase, in the absence of GSH, for up to 20 min at 37 °C prior to the initiation of activity assay (30 min) did not affect the enzyme activity (data not shown). Second, thin layer chromatography analysis of GSH (5 mm) following incubation with N-SMase preparation for up to 60 min at 37 °C under the conditions identical to SMase assay did not indicate any metabolism of GSH to either γ-glutamyl-cysteine or cysteinyl-glycine (data not shown). To study the reversibility of GSH inhibition of N-SMase, enzyme was preincubated with 3 mm GSH for 15 min at 37 °C and then assayed for SMase activity or diluted 5 times to achieve a final concentration of GSH of 0.6 mm before activity assay. N-SMase activity (standardized based on equal amount of enzyme) was completely recovered after diluting out GSH. These results show that inhibition is reversible, and that the enhancement of inhibition by preincubation is not a result of metabolism of GSH or an irreversible change in the enzyme. We next examined the specificity for GSH inhibition of the N-SMase by testing the effects on the enzyme activity of GSH related compounds. As shown in Fig. 2, glutamic acid, glutamine, and glycine at concentrations up to 10 mm were totally ineffective in inhibiting the enzyme (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, cysteine exhibited a triphasic mode of action for its effect on the N-SMase. An initial inhibitory phase was observed with concentrations of cysteine from 0.05 to 1 mm, and this was followed by a stimulatory phase for concentrations between 1 and 2.5 mm. At concentrations starting at 2.5 mm and up to 10 mm, cysteine was inhibitory, almost completely coinciding with that of GSH (Fig. 2 B). When the enzyme was preincubated with the GSH fragment cysteinyl-glycine, a biphasic mode of action was observed. At concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 mm, cysteinyl-glycine was partially inhibitory of the enzyme, which was followed by reversal of its inhibition at concentrations from 1 to 10 mm, closely resembling the initial two phases for cysteine (Fig.2 C). In contrast to cysteine, at concentrations beyond 2 mm, cysteinyl-glycine did not show further inhibition toward N-SMase. The effect of another fragment of GSH, γ-glutamyl-cysteine, on the enzyme activity was very similar to that of GSH except that γ-glutamyl-cysteine was slightly more potent such that the range for total inhibition was from 1–3 mm for this fragment (Fig. 2 C; 2–4 mm for GSH). These results showed that the minimal configuration of GSH required for inhibition resided in the γ-glutamyl-cysteine segment of the molecule, which faithfully reproduced the effects of GSH on N-SMase. Since DTT and β-mercaptoethanol did not inhibit the enzyme, we next addressed the requirement for the free sulfhydryl group on GSH. For these experiments, we used oxidized GSH, GSSG, and the thiol-modified GSH molecules, S-methyl GSH and S-ethyl GSH. BothS-methyl GSH and S-ethyl GSH were equally potent as GSH in inhibiting the enzyme (Fig. 2 D). Surprisingly, oxidized glutathione GSSG was more effective than GSH in inhibiting the enzyme, with an apparent EC50 of between 0.5 and 1 mm compared with 2.5 mm for GSH (Fig.2 D). The greater potency of GSSG did not seem to arise from spontaneous reduction of GSSG to two molecules of GSH. First, GSSG was more than twice as potent as GSH. Second, the inhibition of N-SMase activity by GSSG was not altered in an oxidizing environment created by co-incubation with H2O2 (100 μm). In this case, the EC50 remained at 0.5 mm. Because leukotrienes are GSH-modified bioactive lipid molecules important in cellular regulations, we also examined their effects on the activity of the N-SMase in vitro. As shown in Fig.2 F, amounts of leukotrienes C4 and D4 well above physiologically relevant concentrations had no effect on the activity of the enzyme. Taken together, these results suggested that the minimal requirement for inhibiting the N-SMase was γ-glutamyl-cysteine and that the free sulfhydryl group on the GSH molecule was not essential for the inhibitory effect. Next, we examined the interaction of GSH with the substrate sphingomyelin and the activator magnesium. To study the interaction of GSH with sphingomyelin, enzyme was preincubated with 0–2.5 mm GSH followed by incubation with 1–20 mol% of sphingomyelin. As shown in Fig. 3 A, concentrations of GSH ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 mm gave rise to similar degrees of inhibition over a broad range of substrate concentrations. Because of the steep nature of the inhibitory effect of GSH on the N-SMase, we could not construct reliable double-reciprocal plots for these studies. However, since increasing concentrations of substrate did not overcome inhibition by GSH, the mode of inhibition did not appear to be of the competitive type. Similarly, when the enzyme was preincubated with 0–2.5 mm GSH followed by incubation with 10 mol% of sphingomyelin in the presence of 0–10 mm magnesium, a sharp inhibition was observed between 1.5 and 2 mm GSH over a broad range of magnesium concentrations. Again, the inhibition did not appear to be of a competitive nature (Fig. 3 B). We next investigated whether the inhibitory effect of GSH was specific to the N-SMase. To this end, we resolved, on a DEAE-Sepharose column the A-SMase and N-SMase prepared from detergent-solubilized rat brain homogenate which contains substantial amounts of both enzymes. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the majority of the A-SMase was found in peak I (flow-through) with a small amount in peak II, while peaks II and III contained approximately 35% and 65% of the N-SMase activity, respectively. The N-SMase in peak III was more pure than that in peak II and was essentially free of A-SMase activity (Fig.4 A). Therefore, we compared the effect of GSH on the activity of enzyme preparations from peak I (A-SMase) and peak III (N-SMase). When preincubated with 1–10 mm GSH, N-SMase from rat brain was inhibited by GSH with a complete inhibition at 2 mm GSH, while DTT was totally ineffective (Fig.4 B). In contrast, GSH up to 10 mm had little effect on the activity of A-SMase from rat brain, while DTT significantly abolished the activity of the acid SMase (Fig.4 C) as reported previously (24Yamanaka T. Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38 (2nd Ed.): 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similar results for GSH and DTT were obtained for purified human placenta A-SMase of commercial source (data not shown). Finally, we analyzed the effect of the levels of GSH in intact cells on the hydrolysis of SM and the generation of ceramide. Cultured Molt-4 cells were treated with 250 μm BSO for 12–48 h, and the total intracellular GSH content was determined. As shown in Fig.5 A, treatment of cells with BSO resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the intracellular level of GSH. The GSH level of the BSO-treated Molt-4 cells dropped to 18 and 9% of that of untreated cells at 24 and 48 h post-treatment, respectively. When ceramide content in the BSO-treated cells was examined, an increase in the cellular ceramide level was observed as early as 12 h post-treatment of cells with BSO (Fig.5 B). The ceramide level at 24 and 48 h after BSO treatment was significantly higher than that of untreated cells (68% and 102% over that of corresponding control, respectively). A 32% decrease in SM content was observed in cells treated with 250 μm BSO for 48 h (Fig. 5 C), indicating that the ceramide generated was due to the activation of a sphingomyelinase. In this study we demonstrate that glutathione at physiologically relevant concentrations inhibits the neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase but not the acidic sphingomyelinase and that depletion of cellular GSH results in the hydrolysis of SM and generation of ceramide. The inhibition of the neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase does not appear to be a general characteristic of thiol-containing reducing agents since dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol were ineffective. Moreover, the free sulfhydryl of GSH is not required since inhibition was still observed with the thiol-modified GSHs, S-ethyl andS-methyl GSH, as well as with oxidized glutathione, GSSG. Studies with analogs and fragments of GSH suggest that the structural requirements for inhibition reside in the γ-glutamyl-cysteine moiety of GSH. This structural specificity in inhibiting N-SMase suggests that GSH may function as a specific allosteric regulator of N-SMase. However, since partially purified sphingomyelinases were used in this study, we cannot rule out the possibility of an indirect mechanism of action for GSH inhibition of the N-SMase. The precise mechanism responsible for GSH inhibition of the N-SMase remains to be elucidated. Our results raise a number of physiologic implications. Current estimation of intracellular concentrations of free GSH in most cell types suggests a range between 1 and 10 mm (25Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 26Meister A. Science. 1983; 220: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). In hepatic cells, the lower limit of intracellular GSH level is believed to be around 3 mm and the higher limit 20 mm. This leads us to speculate that under resting and stable conditions, the N-SMase in the cells exists as an inactive enzyme in the presence of GSH. Depletion of GSH from the cell may then relieve the inhibition by GSH, resulting in activation of N-SMase. Depletion of GSH has been described for several agents such as oxidative and alkylating agents, tumor necrosis factor-α, and Fas in various cell types (27Slater A.F.G. Stefan C. Nobel I. van den Dobblelsteen D.J. Orrenius S. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These include lung epithelial cells exposed to high doses of O2 (28Christie N.A. Slutsky A.S. Freeman B.A. Tanswell A.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the leukemic cell lines HL-60, U937, and K562 exposed to the alkylating agent melphalan (29Fernandes R.S. Cotter T.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and U937 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide and protein synthesis inhibitors (30Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Maresca V. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition to depletion, GSH levels may be reduced by extrusion from the cell as has been observed with Fas, which causes a rapid efflux of GSH from cells. Cells with reduced GSH levels either undergo apoptosis or become more sensitive to various death-inducing agents (29Fernandes R.S. Cotter T.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 31Beaver J.P. Waring P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar, 32Levine E.S. Friedman H.S. Griffith O.W. Colvin O.M. Raynor J.H. Lieberman M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For example, Kain and associates reported that depletion of GSH in a neural cell line committed it to apoptosis (33Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Restoring and/or maintaining the intracellular GSH content through increased synthesis or addition of exogenous GSH or GSH methyl esters appears to protect cells from damage/death otherwise inflicted by the cytotoxic agents. In fact, Chiba et al. reported that a Fas-resistant human T cell line reverted to Fas sensitivity upon inhibition of its GSH synthesis capacity (34Chiba T. Takahashi S. Sato N. Ishii S. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1164-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Since activation of N-SMase leads to the generation of ceramide, changes in GSH levels may influence ceramide levels through N-SMase. In turn, this direct biochemical coupling may tie-in the various regulators and modulators of the redox state of the cell (and of GSH levels) with ceramide-mediated cellular responses. These include cell differentiation (5Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A.

Generation of ceramide has been attributed to the activation of N-SMase in studies with serum starvation (8Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A.

Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The fact that GSH depletion is frequently observed in most of these situations suggests that the levels of cellular GSH regulates, at least in part, ceramide generation. We show that, in Molt-4 cells, the GSH synthesis inhibitor BSO not only, as predicted, depletes the GSH content of these cells, but also causes the hydrolysis of SM and generation of ceramide. These data demonstrate that GSH may indeed play a role in regulating SM hydrolysis and ceramide generation in cells. As a corollary to this hypothesis, N-SMase in the cells may remain inactive until GSH is depleted. This would argue against the possibility that under physiological conditions N-SMase can be activated without the depletion of GSH. Alternatively, a mechanism may exist for activating N-SMase by overriding the inhibition by GSH. While the intracellular GSH levels are between 1 and 20 mm, the level of free intracellular cysteine is believed to be in the high micromolar range. In studying the uptake of radiolabeledl-[35S]cysteine by human fibroblasts, Bannai and Kitamura (42Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) estimated that the intracellular concentration of cysteine was approximately 0.1 mm. In another study by Luet al. (43Lu S.C. Ge J.-L. Kuhlenkamp J. Kaplowitz N. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the ratio of total hepatic GSH to cysteine was found to be around 42 to 1. Combined with the fact that the intracellular GSH in hepatocytes is 3–20 mm and that intracellular cysteine transported from outside of the cell is rapidly metabolized (26Meister A. Science. 1983; 220: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), the actual level of intracellular cysteine is probably very low and in the micromolar range (75–500 μm). Therefore, the inhibition by cysteine of N-SMase observed in vitro may not be very relevant physiologically, but cannot be discounted at this point. Interestingly, depletion of both GSH and cysteine has been reported in several studies (44Mutoh H. Ota S. Hiraishi H. Ivey K.J. Terano A. Sugimoto T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G65-G70PubMed Google Scholar, 45Gerard-Monnier D. Fougeat S. Chaudiere J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 46Pierson H.F. Fisher J.M. Rabinovitz M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 4727-4731PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the in vitro inhibition of N-SMase by the oxidized glutathione, GSSG, observed in this study may not have much physiological relevance. GSSG is formed as a result of the reaction of GSH with reactive oxygen species. Compared with GSH, GSSG exists in cells at a much lower concentration (20–40 μm) due to the activity of glutathione reductase, which favors the formation of GSH (23Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 47Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 69-85PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, GSSG was found to be approximately 3 times more effective than GSH in inhibiting N-SMase, whereas in cells the ratio of GSH/GSSG is generally considered to be in the range of 100–500. Therefore, in cells under normal conditions N-SMase is more likely to be inhibited by GSH, but not GSSG. In conclusion, inhibition of N-SMase by GSH as shown in this study serves as a direct link between two important areas involved in the regulation of mammalian stress responses, the oxidative stress, and the sphingomyelin/ceramide cycle. A diverse array of agents and factors initiate the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and the generation of ceramide leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, many of these same agents and factors cause the depletion of GSH in the course of inducing apoptosis. Further investigation is required to understand the relationship between GSH and sphingomyelinases at the cellular level. We thank Dr. Lina M. Obeid for critical review of this manuscript."

To better understand the mechanism of IFN-γ action in modulating the cell death response independently of p53 function, we analyzed the death of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, following treatment with IFN-γ and various cytotoxic agents. Here we show that IFN-γ modulates cell death by sensitizing the cells to killing by numerous pro-apoptotic stimuli but not pro-necrotic stimuli. Furthermore, we show that select genes from several important apoptosis-related gene families are induced by IFN-γ, including the apoptosis-signaling receptors CD95 (Fas/APO-1) and TNFR 1 and interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (Ice) family members Ice, CPP32(Yama, apopain), ICE rel -II(TX, Ich-2), Mch-3 (ICE-LAP3, CMH-1), Mch-4, and Mch-5 (MACH, FLICE). Of the bcl-2 family members, IFN-γ directly induced bak but notably not bax, which is activated by p53. The IFN-responsive transcriptional activator interferon regulatory factor-1 was also strongly induced and translocated into the nucleus following IFN-γ treatment. We propose that IFN-γ modulates a p53-independent apoptotic pathway by both directly and indirectly inducing select apoptosis-related genes.

Cell death is an essential event in the development and function of multicellular organisms. Two forms of cell death have been described, necrosis and apoptosis (1Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.R. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12616) Google Scholar), which differ in the nature of their induction stimulus, underlying signaling and effector mechanisms, morphological features, and the degree to which they are subject to therapeutic intervention (for review, see Refs. 1Kerr J.F.R.

Necrosis is usually the result of catastrophic cell damage that leads to metabolic failure, early loss of membrane integrity, and often to inflammation and further tissue damage. Apoptosis, or physiological cell death, is a genetically programmed active process that occurs in all multicellular organisms and plays a major role in development, tissue homeostasis, defense, and, when dysregulated, many diseases. It is generally considered that apoptosis is marked by cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies that are phagocytosed by other cells. Recent evidence indicates that apoptosis can be regulated through p53-dependent and -independent pathways (6Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar, 7Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). This has been most clearly demonstrated in T lymphocytes, which are particularly susceptible to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Normal thymocytes readily undergo apoptosis following treatment with ionizing radiation, etoposide, glucocorticoids, or calcium ionophores. Thymocytes lacking p53 are resistant to apoptotic cell death following treatment with ionizing radiation and etoposide, but retain normal sensitivity to glucocorticoids and calcium ionophores. However, mitogen-activated mature T lymphocytes lacking p53 do undergo apoptosis following irradiation or genotoxic treatments (8Strasser A. Harris A.W. Jacks T. Cory S. Cell. 1994; 79: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate the existence of p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. More recently, the p53-independent apoptotic pathway utilized by the mitogen-activated mature T lymphocytes was shown to require transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1The abbreviations used are: IRF, interferon regulatory factor; IFN, interferon; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor; Ab, antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; CHX, cycloheximide; PI, propidium iodide. 1The abbreviations used are: IRF, interferon regulatory factor; IFN, interferon; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor; Ab, antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; CHX, cycloheximide; PI, propidium iodide.-1, because activated splenocytes lacking IRF-1 were resistant to apoptotic cell death after treatment with irradiation and genotoxic drugs (9Tamura T.

IRF-1 is a transcription factor that activates type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible genes, has tumor-suppressive activities and when inactivated, may be linked to the development of hematopoietic malignancies (for review, see Ref. 10Taniguchi T. Harada H. Lamphier M.S. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, there are at least two different anti-oncogenic transcription factors, p53 and IRF-1, required for distinct apoptotic pathways. Apoptosis may be induced by a variety of physiological signals such as TNF-α and CD95L (for review, see Refs. 11Nagata S. Golstein P.

Various cell lines display an increased sensitivity to cytotoxic signaling through TNFR 1 or CD95 following treatment with IFN-γ (14Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp.

The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, is particularly responsive to IFN-γ, which markedly increases its sensitivity to TNF-α-mediated as well as anti-Fas antibody (Ab)-mediated cytotoxicity. Additionally, HT-29, like many other tumor cell lines, has a mutated p53 gene that results in a non-functional protein (17Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar). The biological effects of IFN-γ are mediated by the expression of new gene products (for review, see Ref. 18Sen G. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and the IFN-γ-induced sensitivity of HT-29 cells to TNF-α-mediated or anti-Fas Ab-mediated cell death may be partly attributed to the up-regulation of CD95 and TNFR 1. However, it is possible that other apoptosis-related gene products are regulated by IFN-γ, and when induced, could participate in different apoptotic pathways following treatment with various cytotoxic agents. Two gene families that play critical roles in apoptosis are ced-9/bcl-2 and ced-3/Ice. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are important intracellular modulators of apoptosis and can be divided into two groups based on their ability to either suppress (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) or enhance (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bcl-xS) cell death following an apoptotic signal (for review, see Refs. 19Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 20Nunez G. Clarke M.F.

ICE family members are cysteine proteases that participate in both the signaling and effector functions of the apoptotic pathway presumably through a hierarchical proteolytic cascade (for review, see Refs. 23Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar and 24Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand mechanisms of p53-independent cell death pathways, we analyzed the type of cell death induced by different cytotoxic agents and the apoptosis-related genes that were expressed in HT-29 cells following IFN-γ treatment. HT-29 cells (ATCC HTB-38) were grown in McCoy's 5a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Cells were seeded (1 × 105/ml) in six-well plates (Corning) for the cell death assay or in flasks for DNA, RNA, or protein analysis and grown to 60–80% confluence. IFN-γ (Boehringer Mannheim) was then added (200 units/ml), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After washing, cytotoxic agents were added and the cells were incubated an additional 2 h (for pro-necrotic agents) or 24 h (for pro-apoptotic agents). Non-adherent cells were collected by aspiration, and adherent cells were harvested using 0.25% Trypsin/0.05% EDTA. Cells were counted on a Coulter Counter ZM and Coulter Channelyser 256. The percentage of dead cells was calculated as a ratio of detached cells to the total number of cells/well. For morphological analysis, propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) and Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) were added to wells and the cells were analyzed by luminescence microscopy. DNA was isolated from adherent and non-adherent cells separately by proteinase K-phenol method as described (25Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 7.43–7.52 and 9.14–9.23, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). DNA samples were treated with 100 μg/ml of DNase-free RNase, extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA. DNA samples (10 μg) were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels (25Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 7.43–7.52 and 9.14–9.23, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar) and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Total RNA was isolated from HT-29 cells by the single-step acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). RNA samples (20 μg) were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose, 2.2m formaldehyde gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then prehybridized and hybridized at 42 °C in a standard solution containing 40% formamide (25Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 7.43–7.52 and 9.14–9.23, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). Standard high stringency washing conditions were used (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). The cDNA probes (see below) were excised from their respective vectors, gel-purified, and 32P-labeled (27Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Following hybridization and autoradiography, the blots were stripped by washing for 10 min at 100 °C in 0.5% SDS followed by an additional 10 min at 25 °C (in the same preheated solution) with shaking. The blots were rehybridized with 32P-labeled β-actin cDNA to account for the variation in RNA loading and transfer to nitrocellulose. Quantitation of Northern blot hybridization was performed using a flatbed scanner (HP Scan-Jet 4c) to digitize the autoradiographic signals and Adobe Photoshop 3.0 to measure the pixel intensities. The relative intensity of each signal was normalized to the β-actin signal to give a normalized value (NV) and the fold activation for each gene or protein was then calculated (NV+IFN-γ/NV−IFN-γ). cDNAs containing the coding regions of the bcl-2 and Ice family members,TNFR 1, and soluble CD95 (FasΔTM) were generated by RT-PCR using the Hot Start/Ampliwax method described by the supplier (Perkin Elmer). The template DNAs for RT-PCR were either previously cloned cDNAs (bak,ICE rel -II, and FasΔTM) or cDNA that was reverse transcribed from various tissue or cell line total RNAs using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase as described by supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR primers were designed based on the published sequences for bcl-2 (28Cleary M.L. Smith S.D. Sklar J.

For thebcl-x L/bcl-x SPCR, 50 μg of HT-29 total RNA (plus or minus IFN-γ treatment) was reverse transcribed as above. RT-PCR was performed as above using ∼25 ng of cDNA as template and the following primers: FP (5′-AGATCTGAATTCGTAAAGCAAGCGCTGAGG-3′) and RP (5′-AGATCTAAGCTTGAAGAGTGAGCCCAGCAG-3′). The oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method with an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer, purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and desalted on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Cell extracts for Bak, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x analysis were prepared by lysing 1 × 107HT-29 cells in 200 μl of 1 × phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g, and supernatants were saved. Cytosol and nuclei-containing cell extracts for IRF-1 analysis were prepared by lysing 1 × 107 HT-29 cells in 200 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g, and the cytosol-containing supernatants were separated from the nuclei-containing pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of the above buffer and sonicated. The samples were quantitated by the Bradford assay (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) and fractionated (25–100 μg of protein/lane) by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20). For Bak analysis, the blot was incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-Bak antiserum in blocking buffer followed by a 1-h incubation with anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) and then developed using the ECL method (Amersham). The anti-Bak antiserum was generated in rabbits using purified recombinant Bak produced in yeast and used at 1:5000 dilution. The anti-Bcl-x, -Bax, -Bcl-2, and -IRF-1 antibodies were used as recommended by supplier (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 is relatively insensitive to killing by TNF-α and anti-Fas Ab but can be killed by these cytotoxic agents after pretreatment with IFN-γ (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 14Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 15Fransen L. Van Der Heyden J. Ruysschaert R. Fiers W. Eur. J. Cancer Clin.

Pretreatment of HT-29 cells with IFN-γ not only increases their sensitivity to killing by TNF-α and anti-Fas Ab, it also increases their sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner to a variety of apoptotic stimuli that act through different mechanisms (Fig. 1 A). Staurosporin induces apoptosis by inhibiting protein kinases (45Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cisplatin causes DNA-DNA and DNA-protein cross-linking (46Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), while adriamycin inhibits topoisomerase II (47Calabresi P. Chabner B.A. Gilman A.G. Rall T.W. Nies A.S. Taylor P. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 8th Ed. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 1202-1263Google Scholar). Ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid, is a second messenger in apoptotic pathways induced by different agents, including TNF-α and anti-Fas Ab (48Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 49Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Various methods were used to confirm that these agents induced apoptotic cell death. HT-29 cells were treated with IFN-γ and staurosporine and then were stained with PI and Hoechst 33342. Luminescent microscopy revealed cells with condensed chromatin, a nuclear morphology characteristic of apoptosis (Fig.2). Many of the cells with condensed chromatin were impermeable to PI (white arrows), indicating that nuclear changes preceded the increase in outer membrane permeability. In other cells (black arrow), both chromatin condensation and outer membrane permeability had occurred, indicating a later stage of apoptosis. In addition, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA isolated from staurosporine- or ceramide-treated cells showed nucleosomal DNA laddering (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that HT-29 cells are dying by an apoptotic mechanism.Figure 2Luminescent microscopy of HT-29 cells treated with various cytotoxic agents. HT-29 cells were pretreated with IFN-γ and then incubated 9 h with 1 μg/ml staurosporine or 2 h with 1.5 mg/ml ethacrynic acid. Control cells were only pretreated with IFN-γ. Cells were stained with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and analyzed by luminescent microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the above experiments, we observed an increase of 10–20% in cell death following IFN-γ treatment in the absence of any additional pro-apoptotic stimuli. Thus, it is possible that HT-29 cells pretreated with IFN-γ are more sensitive to any cytotoxic agent. However, we found that the sensitivity of HT-29 cells to the pro-necrotic agents, potassium cyanide and ethacrynic acid, was identical in IFN-γ-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). Ethacrynic acid was shown to induce necrotic cell death in HT-29 cells by luminescent microscopy (Fig. 2), as evidenced by PI staining of the cells (outer membrane permeability) in the absence of chromatin condensation (white triangular arrows). DNA electrophoresis of KCN-treated cells displayed a lack of nucleosomal DNA laddering (data not shown). Thus, IFN-γ sensitizes HT-29 cells to pro-apoptotic but not pro-necrotic stimuli. This indicates that p53-independent apoptotic pathway(s) are being modulated by IFN-γ and suggests the mode of action involves the regulation of apoptosis-related proteins, including those downstream of ceramide. Since the known biological effects of IFN-γ require gene expression, we decided to investigate the effects of IFN-γ on expression of apoptosis-related genes in HT-29 cells. mRNA and, in some cases, protein levels of members from several known families of apoptosis modulators were analyzed before and after IFN-γ treatment. Northern blot analysis of bcl-2 family members revealed thatbak and mcl-1 mRNA levels were induced 5.4- and 1.4-fold, respectively, after 16 h of IFN-γ treatment, whereas the levels of bax, bcl-x, andbad mRNA were unchanged (Fig. 3,A and D). bcl-2 mRNA was not detectable in HT-29 cells before or after IFN-γ treatment (data not shown). Alternate splicing of the bcl-x transcript results in two distinct mRNAs whose protein products either inhibit (Bcl-xL) or accelerate (Bcl-xS) cell death (29Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). Since the difference in size between the two transcripts is too small to distinguish by Northern blot analysis, the ratio ofbcl-x L to bcl-x s mRNAs was determined by RT-PCR. This analysis indicated that the ratio of the two transcripts was unchanged following IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 3B). Bak protein levels increased 4.5-fold in HT-29 cells following 16 h of IFN-γ treatment, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3,C and D). The increase in Bak protein is consistent with the corresponding increase in bak mRNA levels. Both Bax and Bcl-x protein levels remain unchanged following IFN-γ treatment, which is consistent with their constant mRNA levels (Fig. 3, C and D). Analysis of ICE family members by Northern blotting indicated thatIce, Mch3, Mch4, Mch5,CPP32, and ICE rel -II mRNA levels increased in HT-29 cells following 16 h of IFN-γ treatment (Fig.4, lane 3 versus lane 1), whereasIch-1 and Mch2 mRNA levels remained constant (data not shown). The largest fold induction was seen withMch4, Mch5, and Mch3 (6.0-, 4.7-, and 4.0-fold, respectively). Ice mRNA levels also increased significantly, whereas CPP32 andIce rel -II mRNA levels were up-regulated only 1.9- and 1.6-fold, respectively. The fold activation for Icegene induction could not be accurately determined in this experiment because of a lack of signal in the uninduced cells (lane 1). The levels of TNFR 1 and CD95 mRNA also increased in HT-29 cells in response to 16 h of IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 4), which is consistent with the increased levels of cell surface TNFR 1 (16Tsujimoto M. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2441-2444PubMed Google Scholar) and CD95 (14Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). CD95 mRNA levels were dramatically increased (13.5-fold), while TNFR 1 mRNA levels showed a modest induction (2.3-fold). IFN-γ-regulated genes can be either directly or indirectly induced (18Sen G. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Direct gene induction requires no protein synthesis, whereas indirect gene activation requires the synthesis of additional proteins such as transcriptional activators. To test whether the IFN-γ-inducible apoptosis-related genes were directly or indirectly induced, Northern blot analysis was performed with HT-29 RNA following IFN-γ treatment of the cells in the absence or presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 4, lane 4 versus lane 2).bak and Mch5 gene expression appeared to be directly induced by IFN-γ, since their fold induction was largely cycloheximide-independent. bak mRNA levels were induced 5.0- and 6.0-fold by IFN-γ in the presence and absence of CHX, respectively, whereas Mch5 mRNA levels were increased 4.3- and 4.7-fold by INF-γ in the presence and absence of CHX, respectively. Mch4 gene expression was increased 3.0- and 6.0-fold in the presence and absence of CHX, respectively, suggesting both direct and indirect pathways of induction by IFN-γ. AlthoughCD95 mRNA levels increased 2.0-fold in the presence of CHX, a 13.5-fold increase was observed in the absence of CHX, indicating that most of the induction by IFN-γ requires protein synthesis. Minimal or no increases in mRNA levels were observed with ICE rel -II, CPP32, Mch3,mcl-1, and TNFR 1 in the presence of CHX, indicating they were primarily indirectly induced by IFN-γ. It should be noted that cycloheximide treatment alone results in increased levels of most of the transcripts (Fig. 4, lane 2 versus lane 1), presumably because of its ability to block translation of proteins involved in mRNA turnover (50Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of the apoptosis-related genes were analyzed at various times following IFN-γ treatment by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5).mcl-1 and Mch5 mRNA levels showed moderate increases at 1 h of IFN-γ treatment (1.8- and 2.7-fold, respectively) with peak levels of expression occurring by 4 h of IFN-γ treatment. CD95 and Mch3 mRNA levels also increased after 1 h of IFN-γ treatment (3.7- and 1.9-fold, respectively) but continued to increase up to 16 h (9.3- and 3.7-fold, respectively). Increased levels of bak andMch4 mRNA were not detected until 4 h of IFN-γ treatment (3.0- and 2.0-fold, respectively) while IcemRNA induction was even further del"
https://openalex.org/W2051894528,"Steroid receptors are recovered from hormone-free cells in multiprotein complexes containing hsp90, p23, an immunophilin, and often some hsp70. The immunophilin, which can be of the FK506- or cyclosporin A-binding class, binds to hsp90 via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, and different receptor heterocomplexes exist depending upon which immunophilin occupies the TPR-binding region of hsp90. We have recently reported that a protein serine/threonine phosphatase that is designated PP5 and contains four TPRs binds to hsp90 and is co-purified with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Chen, M.-S., Silverstein, A. M., Pratt, W. B., and Chinkers, M. (1996) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 271, 32315–32320). In this work, we show that PP5 is recovered with both GR that is nuclear and GR that is cytoplasmic in hormone-free cells. Approximately one-half of the GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes in L cell cytosol contains an immunophilin with high affinity FK506 binding activity, such as FKBP51 or FKBP52, and ∼35% contains PP5. Only a small (but undetermined) fraction of the native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes contain the cyclosporin A-binding immunophilin CyP-40. PP5, FKBP52, and CyP-40 exist in separate heterocomplexes with hsp90, and competition binding experiments with the PP5 TPR domain suggest that the three proteins occupy a common binding site on hsp90. A 55-residue connecting region between the N-terminal TPR domain of human PP5 and its C-terminal phosphatase domain has 50% amino acid homology and 22% identity with the central portion of the peptidylprolyl isomerase domain of human FKBP52. Of the 9 residues in this portion of FKBP52 involved in high affinity interactions with FK506, 3 residues are retained and 4 have homologous substitutions in PP5. Although immunoadsorbed PP5 did not bind [<sup>3</sup>H]FK506, we found that both rabbit PP5 in reticulocyte lysate and purified rat PP5 were specifically retained by an FK506 affinity matrix. Thus, we propose that PP5 possesses properties of an immunophilin with low affinity FK506 binding activity and that it determines a major portion of the native GR heterocomplexes in L cell cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2166914418,"The 5′-cap and the poly(A) tail act synergistically to increase the translational efficiency of eukaryotic mRNAs, which suggests that these two mRNA elements communicate during translation. We report here that the cap-associated eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), i.e. the two isoforms of the cap-binding complex (eIF-4F and eIF-iso4F) and eIF-4B, bind to the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) both in the presence and absence of poly(A) RNA. The interactions between PABP and eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and eIF-4B were measured in the absence of poly(A) RNA using far Western analysis and confirmed by direct fluorescence titration studies. The functional consequence of the interaction between these initiation factors and PABP was examined using RNA binding assays and RNA mobility shift analysis. eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and eIF-4B promoted PABP activity through a shift in its equilibrium affinity for poly(A). eIF-iso4G, the large subunit of eIF-iso4F, was the subunit responsible for the interaction between eIF-iso4F and PABP and was the subunit that promoted PABP RNA binding activity. Truncation analysis of eIF-iso4G indicated that a domain close to its N-terminal end appeared to be involved in binding PABP. These results suggest that the interaction between PABP and eIF-4B and eIF-iso4G may be involved in mediating the functional co-dependence observed between the cap and the poly(A) tail during translation. The 5′-cap and the poly(A) tail act synergistically to increase the translational efficiency of eukaryotic mRNAs, which suggests that these two mRNA elements communicate during translation. We report here that the cap-associated eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), i.e. the two isoforms of the cap-binding complex (eIF-4F and eIF-iso4F) and eIF-4B, bind to the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) both in the presence and absence of poly(A) RNA. The interactions between PABP and eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and eIF-4B were measured in the absence of poly(A) RNA using far Western analysis and confirmed by direct fluorescence titration studies. The functional consequence of the interaction between these initiation factors and PABP was examined using RNA binding assays and RNA mobility shift analysis. eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and eIF-4B promoted PABP activity through a shift in its equilibrium affinity for poly(A). eIF-iso4G, the large subunit of eIF-iso4F, was the subunit responsible for the interaction between eIF-iso4F and PABP and was the subunit that promoted PABP RNA binding activity. Truncation analysis of eIF-iso4G indicated that a domain close to its N-terminal end appeared to be involved in binding PABP. These results suggest that the interaction between PABP and eIF-4B and eIF-iso4G may be involved in mediating the functional co-dependence observed between the cap and the poly(A) tail during translation. Most eukaryotic mRNAs contain a cap (m7GpppN) and a poly(A) tail, which are functionally co-dependent regulators of translation (1Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The cap serves as the binding site for eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 4E (a subunit of eIF-4F), and the poly(A) tail binds the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Plants also contain an isoform of eIF-4F, called eIF-iso4F (2Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The translation initiation factors eIF-4F, eIF-4B, and eIF-4A are thought to participate in the ATP-dependent binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (reviewed in Refs. 3Rhoads R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholarand 4Thach R.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 177-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Specifically, these factors likely catalyze the ATP-dependent unwinding of any secondary structure of the mRNA. eIF-4G, the large subunit of eIF-4F, also binds eIF-3, an initiation factor thought to be necessary for 40 S subunit recruitment to an mRNA (5Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that PABP may play a role during translation initiation: PABP has been shown to be necessary for 40 S ribosomal subunit binding to an mRNA and for formation of the 48 S initiation complex (6Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 7Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Moreover, the functional co-dependence observed between the cap and the poly(A) tail (1Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 8Monroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) suggests that there might be an interaction between PABP and one or more of those initiation factors associated with the cap. eIF-4F and eIF-4B were implicated as playing a role in mediating the interaction between the cap and the poly(A) tail in that exogenous poly(A) added to wheat germ lysate inhibited translation, but its effect was reversed following the addition of eIF-4F and eIF-4B (9Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The poly(A)-mediated sequestration of eIF-4F and eIF-4B may have been a result of their binding to the PABP·poly(A) complex or their binding directly to the poly(A) RNA itself. These studies suggest that the 3′-end of an mRNA plays a role during initiation and that PABP may interact either directly or indirectly with those initiation factors associated with the 5′-cap. In this report, we used far Western analysis, fluorescence titration, and RNA mobility shift assays to demonstrate that PABP does bind eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and eIF-4B either in the presence or absence of poly(A) and that their interaction increases PABP RNA binding activity. The T7-based construct containing the (A)50 tract has been described previously (1Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The DNA concentration was quantitated spectrophotometrically following linearization and brought to 0.5 mg/ml. In vitro transcription was carried out as described previously (10Yisraeli J.K. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mmATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm UTP, 0.5 mmGTP, 10 mm DTT, 0.3 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 unit/μl T7 RNA polymerase. Radiolabeled probes were made as uncapped RNAs using [α-32P]ATP. The full-length transcripts were resolved and electroeluted from 4% polyacrylamide gels, and RNA yields were quantitated spectrophotometrically. For all steps in its purification (11Le H. Chang S.-C. Tanguay R.L. Gallie D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), PABP activity was followed using binding to poly(A) RNA as determined by complex formation in a mobility shift assay. Briefly, the 25–60% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction of wheat germ extract was applied to Affi-Gel blue (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer A (100 mm KAc, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT). The column was washed with Buffer A containing 4 m NaCl. PABP was eluted with Buffer A containing 2 m guanidine HCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight against several changes of Buffer A containing 50 mm KAc. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A containing 50 mmKAc. The effluent from the Mono Q column was collected and applied to a poly(A)-Sepharose 4B affinity column equilibrated in Buffer A. PABP was eluted with Buffer A containing 1 m urea and 2m LiCl and dialyzed extensively. Wheat germ eIF-4F and eIF-iso4F (12Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), eIF-4B (13Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 538-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and eIF-2 and eIF-3 (14Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Recombinant eIF-iso4G and eIF-iso4E were purified as described (15van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 200 ng of BSA, PABP, or initiation factors in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT was applied to a nitrocellulose membrane using a slot-blot apparatus. The membrane was blocked with 10 mg/ml nonfat milk protein in buffer at room temperature for 40 min. The membrane was then probed for 90 min with 3 μg/ml purified PABP or with a fraction derived from either wheat embryos or wheat leaves that was enriched for PABP. The membrane was washed three times in 10 mg/ml BSA, dried, and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min. The membrane was incubated with anti-wheat PABP antibodies, rinsed, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibodies (for the detection of PABP) or anti-mouse antibodies (for the detection of eIF-iso4E) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The signal was visualized using chemiluminescence detection. All solutions for fluorescence were prepared in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm KAc, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. The formation of the binary protein-protein complexes was studied by direct fluorescence titration. A solution of purified PABP (0.6–0.8 μm) was titrated with increasing amounts of one of the other proteins, eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, eIF-4B, or eIF-4A. In some experiments, T2 RNase was present (5 units). All fluorescence measurements were performed with a Spex τ II spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm; emission was monitored at 310 or 320 nm; and the slit widths were 1.5 mm for both excitation and emission. The normalized fluorescence difference (ΔF/ΔF max) between the protein-protein complex and the sum of the individual fluorescence spectra was used to determine the equilibrium association constant (K d ). The details of the data fitting are described elsewhere (16Firpo M.A. Connelly M.B. Goss D.J. Dahlberg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For all gel shift assays, radiolabeled (A)50 RNA was synthesized in vitro and gel-purified to remove the DNA template, unincorporated nucleotides, and less than full-length RNA. 1 ng of radiolabeled RNA and the indicated amount of protein were used for the binding reactions in a 15-μl volume containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml yeast RNA, and 1 mm MgATP for 15 min at 0 °C. Following incubation, 2 μl of 80% glycerol and 2 μl of 2.5 mg/ml heparin were added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 10 min at 0 °C. The RNA-protein complexes were resolved on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. A PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) was used to quantitate the amount of RNA in the complexes. To investigate whether the cap-associated initiation factors (eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and eIF-4B) interact with PABP, we used far Western analysis, which assays for protein/protein interactions. eIF-4F and eIF-iso4F can be purified from wheat germ as a two-subunit (no eIF-4A) or three-subunit (containing eIF-4A) complex depending on the purification scheme employed (2Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Webster C. Gaut R.L. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Roberts J.K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23341-23346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF-iso4F, the isoform of eIF-4F found only in plants, exhibits all of the same activities as eIF-4F (2Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small subunits of eIF-4F and eIF-iso4F, which are referred to as eIF-4E and eIF-iso4E, respectively, are functionally analogous and are ∼50% similar at the amino acid level (2Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large subunits of eIF-4F and eIF-iso4F, which are referred to as eIF-4G and eIF-iso4G, respectively, differ in their molecular masses. eIF-4G is 220 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, whereas eIF-iso4G is 86 kDa. The genes encoding eIF-4E, eIF-iso4E, and eIF-iso4G have been isolated from wheat (18Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the proteins have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli (15van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether an interaction between the large (eIF-iso4G) and small (eIF-iso4E) subunits of eIF-iso4F could be detected using the far Western assay as these two proteins exhibit a strong interaction (15van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Metz A.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31033-31036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant eIF-iso4G was applied to three sets of nitrocellulose membranes using a slot-blot apparatus. eIF-4A and BSA were applied to the same membrane to serve as negative controls. The use of slot blots allowed the purified factor to be immobilized directly onto the membrane and to avoid the denaturation a protein undergoes during SDS-PAGE. The membrane was then incubated with crude extract derived from wheat germ or wheat leaves or with a solution of 10 mg/ml BSA. Following incubation with the extract, the membranes were washed and probed with anti-eIF-iso4E antibodies, and the signal was determined using chemiluminescence. A positive signal for eIF-iso4E indicates that the eIF-iso4E that was present in an extract has bound to the immobilized eIF-iso4G. Following incubation of the membrane with wheat germ extract, eIF-iso4E was detected bound to eIF-iso4G, but not to the eIF-4A or BSA control (Fig.1 A, top panel). Similar results were obtained when wheat leaf extract was used instead of wheat germ extract (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). eIF-iso4E was not detected when the membrane was incubated with BSA (Fig.1 A, bottom panel), demonstrating that the eIF-iso4E signal observed in the top and middle panels is not due to cross-reaction between the anti-eIF-iso4E antibodies and recombinant eIF-iso4G.Figure 1Far Western analysis of eIF-iso4E and eIF-iso4G binding (A) and the interaction between PABP and eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and eIF-iso4F (B). 200 ng of each protein indicated was immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes using slot blotting. In A, the membranes were then incubated with crude wheat germ extract (top panel), wheat leaf extract (middle panel), or BSA (bottom panel). The membranes were probed for the presence of bound eIF-iso4E using Western analysis with mouse anti-eIF-iso4E antibodies. In B, the membranes were incubated with a wheat germ fraction enriched for PABP. Each initiation factor present in the last lane of each panel was incubated with milk protein instead of wheat germ extract. The membranes were then probed for the presence of bound PABP using anti-PABP antibodies. The Western signal was detected by chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether eIF-4B, eIF-4F, or eIF-iso4F could selectively bind PABP when presented with a complex protein solution from wheat germ, 200 ng of each purified factor was immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a PABP-containing fraction from wheat germ. As before, eIF-4A and BSA were used as negative controls. In another control, a membrane to which a purified factor was bound was incubated with milk protein instead of wheat germ extract. Both the test and control membranes were then probed with anti-wheat PABP antibodies, and the signal was revealed using chemiluminescence. PABP was detected bound to eIF-4B (Fig. 1 B, top panel), eIF-4F (middle panel), and eIF-iso4F (bottom panel), but not to the eIF-4A or BSA control. No PABP was detected when eIF-4B, eIF-4F, or eIF-iso4F was incubated with milk protein, demonstrating that these purified factors are free of PABP and that the anti-PABP antibodies do not cross-react with the factors. As the wheat germ extract used as the source of PABP in Fig.1 B may contain poly(A) RNA, the question of whether PABP interacts with the initiation factors in the absence of poly(A) could not be addressed when crude wheat germ extract was used as the source of PABP. To examine the requirement for poly(A) in the interaction between PABP and the initiation factors, PABP was purified from wheat germ to near homogeneity (11Le H. Chang S.-C. Tanguay R.L. Gallie D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and used in the far Western analysis. As the purification procedure for PABP involved the denaturation of PABP following Affi-Gel blue chromatography and the removal of poly(A) RNA on subsequent purification using a Mono Q column, the PABP used in these assays should be free of poly(A). However, whether residual RNA remained in the purified PABP was determined directly by subjecting the PABP preparation either to 3′-end labeling using [32P]pCp and RNA ligase or to 5′-end labeling following phosphatase treatment. No nucleic acid was detected in 2 μg of PABP (detection limit of 50 pg) following the resolution of either end-labeled reaction on a sequencing gel (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and eIF-iso4F, indicating that nucleic acids are not present in these preparations. To examine whether purified poly(A)-free PABP could bind to the cap-associated initiation factors, 200 ng of purified eIF-4B, eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, eIF-iso4G, and eIF-iso4E was immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane. eIF-4A and BSA were again included as negative controls, and purified PABP was included as a positive control for the Western analysis. The membrane was then incubated with 3 μg/ml purified PABP. Following probing with the anti-wheat PABP antibodies, PABP was detected bound to eIF-4B, eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and recombinant eIF-iso4G, but not to eIF-iso4E or eIF-4A (Fig.2 A). PABP appeared to bind more strongly to eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and eIF-iso4F than to recombinant eIF-iso4G; however, the far Western assay is, like Western assays in general, only semiquantitative, and differences in the extent of binding must be viewed cautiously. The results with purified PABP confirm the results obtained with crude wheat extract and suggest that PABP interacts with the cap-associated factors even in the absence of poly(A). These results also indicate that it is the eIF-iso4G subunit of eIF-iso4F that interacts with PABP. However, to more rigorously establish the requirements for poly(A) in the interaction between PABP and the cap-associated factors, far Western assays were performed in the presence of poly(A) RNA or in the presence of T2 RNase (Fig. 2,B and C, respectively). The far Western analysis was carried out exactly as described for Fig. 2 A, except that 3 μg/ml poly(A) RNA was added to the PABP incubation solution of the membrane in Fig. 2 B and 40 units/ml T2 RNase was added to the PABP incubation solution of the membrane in Fig. 2 C. The presence of T2 RNase did not affect the binding of PABP to eIF-4B, eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, or recombinant eIF-iso4G (Fig. 2 C), confirming that PABP binding to the factors occurs in the absence of poly(A) and that when a stoichiometric amount of poly(A) was included in the incubation reaction, PABP binding to the factors was not significantly affected (Fig. 2 B). To establish the equilibrium binding constant (expressed as K d ) for PABP and either eIF-4B, eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, or eIF-4A, direct fluorescence titration studies were performed using purified PABP and initiation factors. The natural fluorescence of PABP is altered following the binding of a tightly associated protein. A solution of PABP can therefore be titrated with increasing amounts of a PABP-binding protein, and the shift in fluorescence can be used to calculate the K d . Such a fluorescence spectrum resulting from the presence of PABP and eIF-4B in the same cuvette is shown in Fig. 3 and is compared with the sum of the fluorescence spectra of separate samples of PABP and eIF-4B at the same concentration as that used in the mixed sample (Fig. 3 A). The spectrum of the PABP·eIF-4B complex not only shows an increase in fluorescence intensity, but also shows a shift in emission maximum of ∼8 nm, which demonstrates that an interaction is occurring between the two proteins. Similar spectra were obtained for PABP·eIF-4F and PABP·eIF-iso4F. Following the titration of PABP with eIF-4B, eIF-4F, or eIF-iso4F, the difference between the fluorescence obtained from the combination of PABP and each factor and the sum of their individual fluorescences can be plotted as a function of the factor used for the titration. An example of this is shown in Fig. 3 B for PABP and eIF-4F and in Fig. 3 C for PABP and eIF-iso4F, which are plots of the normalized difference between the fluorescence of PABP/eIF-4F or PABP/eIF-iso4F and the sum of the individual fluorescences of PABP and eIF-4F or PABP and eIF-iso4F. From such analyses, the equilibrium binding constant can be calculated (16Firpo M.A. Connelly M.B. Goss D.J. Dahlberg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for the interactions between PABP and eIF-4B, PABP and eIF-4F, and PABP and eIF-iso4F (Table I). All three of these initiation factors showed a strong interaction with PABP in the absence of poly(A). No interaction was detected between PABP and eIF-4A. Direct fluorescence titrations were also performed in the presence of T2 RNase to ensure that no intact RNA was present. The binding affinity between PABP and each of these initiation factors in the presence of T2 RNase was identical to that observed in its absence. The equilibrium binding constant calculated for each of the initiation factors with PABP is about an order of magnitude stronger than the K d determined for the interaction between eIF-4A and eIF-iso4F in the presence of ATP or 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the eIF-4A/eIF-iso4F interaction in the absence of ATP (20Balasta M.L. Carberry S.E. Friedland D.E. Perez R.A. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18599-18603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the PABP/eIF interactions are approximately an order of magnitude stronger than the interaction between eIF-4F and eIF-4B. 2M. L. Balasta and D. J. Goss, unpublished data. These data confirm the results obtained from the far Western analyses, and the calculated equilibrium binding constants indicate that the interaction between PABP and eIF-4B, eIF-4F, or eIF-iso4F is quite strong and likely to be physiologically relevant.Table ISummary of the K d values for the wheat germ PABP/initiation factor interactionsInteractionK dnmPABP + eIF-4B≤15PABP + eIF-iso4F<40PABP + eIF-4F≤40PABP + eIF-4AND1-aND, none detected.These values were determined from nonlinear least-squares analysis of three sets of binding curves for each value.

The interaction between PABP and the cap-associated initiation factors may be involved in the functional co-dependence observed between the cap and the poly(A) tail (1Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) and may help to explain the role of PABP in promoting the formation of the 48 S initiation complex (6Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To investigate what the functional consequences of these interactions might be on PABP function, we examined whether the association of eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, or eIF-4B with PABP affects PABP RNA binding activity to poly(A) using mobility shift analysis (Fig.4). Purified eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, eIF-4B, eIF-4A, and PABP were added either individually or in combination to binding reactions containing radiolabeled (A)50 RNA, and the binding products were resolved using native PAGE. Two complexes, designated complexes A and B, were observed when PABP bound (A)50 (Fig. 4,lane 2) and are characteristic of the PABP/(A)50interaction. Complex B was seen only upon PABP binding to poly(A) and was not observed for eIF-4B, eIF-4F, or eIF-iso4F (Fig. 4, lanes 3–6 and lanes 12–16). As the packing density for PABP is one molecule bound for every 25 adenosine residues, the (A)50 RNA used in these studies should be long enough to accommodate two molecules of PABP. Complex B may represent a single bound PABP, and complex A may represent two PABPs bound to (A)50. Previous studies demonstrated that eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and eIF-4B bind poly(A) specifically (9Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the preference of eIF-4B for poly(A) was confirmed recently with the mammalian homolog (21Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA. 1996; 2: 38-50PubMed Google Scholar). Although PABP·(A)50 complex formation can be detected when as little as 1–2 ng of PABP is used in the binding reaction, higher levels of eIF-4F, eIF-iso4F, and eIF-4B are needed to detect their binding to poly(A). The K d (app)(i.e. apparent K d as determined by gel shift analysis) for wheat PABP is ∼10 nm (11Le H. Chang S.-C. Tanguay R.L. Gallie D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which is similar to the values of 5 nm determined for yeast PABP (22Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and 7 nm measured for human PABP (23Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, PABP exhibits a greater affinity for poly(A) than does eIF-4B (K d (app) = 55 nm), eIF-4F (K d (app) = 400 nm), or eIF-iso4F (K d (app) > 400 nm) (9Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol.

To maintain the gel shifts in the linear range of the assay, it is necessary that no more than 50% of the poly(A) RNA in any binding reaction be complexed with protein. Consequently, the binding complexes formed between 1 pmol of eIF-4F or eIF-iso4F, which is 10-fold less than that used in our previous study (9Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (A)50 are not quite visible in the exposure in Fig. 4(lanes 3 and 13, respectively), but eIF-4B binding to (A)50 can be seen as a faint complex (lanes 4 and 14). Complex formation occurred to a greater extent when both eIF-4F and eIF-4B were present in the binding reaction (Fig. 4, lane 5) relative to the complexes formed by each factor individually (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). eIF-4A did not bind poly(A) to a detectable level either here (Fig. 4, lane 1) or in previous studies (9Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 1224Google Scholar). Although eIF-4A exhibits weak RNA binding activity as detected by direct fluorescence titration (20Balasta M.L. Carberry S.E. Friedland D.E. Perez R.A. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18599-18603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its affinity for RNA in that analysis was an order of magnitude less than that measured for eIF-iso4F. The addition of eIF-4A to eIF-4F/eIF-4B in the binding reaction only slightly increased complex formation relative to the combination of eIF-4F and eIF-4B (Fig. 4, compare lane 6with lane 5). The eIF-4F·poly(A), eIF-iso4F·poly(A), and eIF-4B·poly(A) complexes migrated at approximately the same position on these native gels, in agreement with our previous study (9Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The migration of proteins on a native polyacrylamide gel is determined by both their size and charge. eIF-4B and eIF-iso4F are similar in molecular mass and are highly basic proteins, whereas eIF-4F is larger, but is also less basic (25Gall"
https://openalex.org/W2161538812,"Aldose reductase (AR) has been implicated in osmoregulation in the kidney because it reduces glucose to sorbitol, which can serve as an osmolite. Under hyperosmotic stress, transcription of this gene is induced to increase the enzyme level. This mode of osmotic regulation of AR gene expression has been observed in a number of nonrenal cells as well, suggesting that this is a common response to hyperosmotic stress. We have identified a 132-base pair sequence ∼1 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start site of the AR gene that enhances the transcription activity of the AR promoter as well as that of the SV40 promoter when the cells are under hyperosmotic stress. Within this 132-base pair sequence, there are three sequences that resemble TonE, the tonicity response element of the canine betaine transporter gene, and the osmotic response element of the rabbit AR gene, suggesting that the mechanism of osmotic regulation of gene expression in these animals is similar. However, our data indicate that cooperative interaction among the three TonE-like sequences in the human AR may be necessary for their enhancer function.

Mammalian kidneys are constantly exposed to steep osmotic gradients because of the urine-concentrating mechanism. However, kidney cells, especially the epithelial cells lining the inner renal medulla, are protected from the osmotic effect of concentrated sodium ion and urea in the interstitium by accumulating organic osmolytes such as sorbitol, betaine, inositol, glycerophosphocholine, and taurine (1Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These organic osmolytes are involved in maintaining cell volume and electrolyte contents without perturbing the protein structure and function over a wide range of concentrations (2Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar). Sorbitol is one of the principal organic osmolytes in the inner medulla (3Gullans S.R. Blumenfeld J.D. Balschi J.A. Kaleta M. Brenner R.M. Heilig C.W. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F626-F634PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bagnasco S. Balaban R. Fales H.M. Yang Y.-M. Burg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5872-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is produced via the reduction of d-glucose by the enzyme aldose reductase (AR 1The abbreviations used are: AR, aldose reductase; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ORE, osmotic response element. 1The abbreviations used are: AR, aldose reductase; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ORE, osmotic response element.; EC1.1.1.21). AR is present in a variety of tissues including kidney (5Ohta M. Tanimoto T. Tanaka A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), liver (6Petrash J.M. Srivastava S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 707: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), ocular lens, and retina (7Srivastava S.K. Goldblum R.M. Hair G.A. Das B. Lens Res. 1984; 2: 309-320Google Scholar) and in erythrocytes (8Das B. Srivastava S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 238: 670-679Google Scholar). Although AR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diabetic complications such as diabetic cataracts, retinopathy, and neuropathy (9Lee A.Y. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2780-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10Kador, P. F., and Kinoshita, J. H. (1985) Am. J. Med., 79, Suppl. 5A, 8–12.Google Scholar, 11Greene D.A. Lattimer S. Ulbrecht J. Carroll P. Diabetes Care. 1985; 8: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the physiological role of this enzyme is still unclear, except that in the renal medulla, it produces sorbitol to serve as an osmoprotectant (12Burg M.B. Kidney Int. 1988; 33: 635-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and in the testis, in conjunction with sorbitol dehydrogenase, it synthesizes fructose, the major energy source for sperm (13King T.F. Mann T. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1959; 151: 226Crossref Google Scholar). The expression of the AR gene in the renal medulla of mammals has been shown to be osmotically regulated. In this tissue, AR mRNA and sorbitol content increase during dehydration or antidiuresis and decrease during diuresis (14Cowley B.D. Ferraris Jr., J.D. Carper D. Burg M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F154-F161PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments on PAP-H25 cells derived from rabbit renal papillae demonstrated that external hyperosmolality enhances transcription of the AR gene (15Smardo F.L. Burg Jr., M.B. Garcia-Perez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C776-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a rapid increase in AR mRNA (16Garcia-Perez A. Martin B. Murphy H.R. Uchida S. Murer H. Cowley Jr., B.D. Handler J.S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by an increase in AR activity and sorbitol content (17Uchida S. Garcia-Perez A. Murphy H. Burg M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, several genes other than aldose reductase are known to be regulated by osmolality. They include the myo-inositol, betaine, and taurine transporters (18Burg M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, how the initial signal of external hyperosmolality is relayed to the nucleus to induce the expression of these genes is still unknown. Recently, the sequence of the putative osmotic response element of the canine betaine transporter gene, TonE, was described (19Takenaka M. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29379-29381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), providing a starting point to understand this interesting mode of gene regulation. In addition, while we were preparing this report, the 11-bp osmotic response element (ORE) essential for osmoregulation of the rabbit AR gene was reported and found to be located 1105 bp upstream of the transcription start site (20Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a putative functional ORE found to be located 3.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the aldose reductase gene (21Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We hereby show that this putative AR ORE resulted from a cloning artifact occurring at 1066 bp (MboI restriction site) upstream of the initiation transcription site in a human aldose reductase gene isolated from a commercially obtained genomic library constructed by partial digestion with MboI restriction enzyme. In this study, we have identified an osmotic response region of the human AR gene within a 132-bp region located 1235 bp upstream of the transcription start site of human AR gene. Within this region, there are three sequences homologous to TonE of the canine betaine transporter gene and to the ORE of the rabbit AR gene. The osmotic response function is reduced when any one of these three sequences is mutated, suggesting that these sequences have to work in concert to provide maximum transcription induction. Chang liver cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in isosmotic growth medium (Eagle's basal medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine; ≈300 mosmol/kg of H2O) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. To investigate the osmotic induction of AR mRNA, these cells (3 × 106) were seeded onto 100-mm culture dishes and incubated in fresh isosmotic growth medium for 24 h. The medium were removed, and the cells were incubated in either isosmotic or hyperosmotic growth medium (isosmotic medium supplemented with 5m NaCl to final concentrations of 50 mm (≈380 mosmol/kg of H2O) and 100 mm (≈500 mosmol/kg of H2O)). A total of 1 × 107cells were used to extract RNA in each experiment. Total RNA was extracted by a modification of the protocol of Auffray and Rougeon (22Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). Chang liver cells on culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; scraped off the dishes; and then transferred into tubes containing 1.5 ml of 3 m LiCl and 6 m urea solution. These cells were kept on ice, mixed, and homogenized by a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematic, Lucerne, Switzerland) for 1–2 min with a 30-s interval. The homogenate was kept on ice overnight. Total RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed twice with the 3 m LiCl and 6 m urea solution, drained, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of Tris/EDTA buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 200 μg of proteinase K. The resuspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min. RNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) and precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol at −20 °C for 2 h. The mixtures were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The RNA was washed in 70% ethanol and resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. 20 μg of each total RNA sample from Chang liver cells was loaded on 1.2% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) by capillary blotting in 20 × SSC. The membrane was first incubated with prehybridization buffer (7% SDS and 0.25 m sodium phosphate) at 65 °C for 1 h and then with hybridization buffer containing [α-32P]dCTP-labeled human AR cDNA probe and incubated at 65 °C for 12 h. The AR cDNA probe (23Chung S. LaMendola J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14775-14777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated from a Bluescript subclone and labeled by random priming of DNA polymerase (Megaprime kit, Amersham International) to a specific activity of 1–2 × 109 cpm/μg. After hybridization, the filter was washed with 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C with intensifying screens. The filter was then stripped in 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS at 100 °C and rehybridized to an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled human β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To obtain the promoter sequence of AR, a human genomic DNA library in λFIXII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using two [γ-32P]ATP 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide primers derived from the genomic clone we described before (24Ko B.C.B. Lam K.S.L. Wat N.M.S. Chung S.S.M. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar): ARpr1, 5′-GAATCTTAACATGCTCTGAACC-3′ and ARpr2, 5′-GCCCAGCCCTATACCTAGT-3′. Both primers are located 2.1 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the AR gene. An [α-32P]dCTP-labeled AR cDNA was used as a hybridization probe in the secondary screening. Southern blot hybridization using different probes was used to confirm the identity of the genomic clone AR5. As shown in Fig. 2 A, probe S spans from −1536 to −1174 of AR5; probe Co spans from −1099 to −468, which is common to both AR5 and the AR gene of Ruepp et al. (21Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); and probe G spans from −3339 to −2765 of the AR gene identified by Ruepp et al. (21Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Probe G was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of amplification primers, Prpr1 (−3339 to −3320, 5′-ATGCAACTAGAGTGTCCACC-3′) and Prpr2 (−2765 to −2785, 5′-AGGTTCTACTGGTTCTACTAC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into a plasmid vector and verified by DNA sequence determination. Caucasian and Chinese DNAs were digested withKpnI, HindIII, and EcoRV restriction enzymes and hybridized to radioactively labeled probes S, Co, and G, respectively, in a Southern blot.Figure 2Southern blot hybridization with the AR5 and 6A3a probes. A, the structures of clones AR5 and 6A3a are schematically shown. The asterisk indicates position −1066, upstream of which the sequences of the two clones are different. Probe Co (−1099 to −468) is common to both clones. Probe S is from −1535 to −1174 of AR5, and probe G is from −3339 to −2765 of 6A3a.B, in each panel, lanes 1 and 2contain DNA from a Caucasian, and lanes 3 and 4contain DNA from a Chinese. DNAs in lanes 1 and 3were digested with HindIII and KpnI, and DNAs inlanes 2 and 4 were digested with EcoRV and KpnI. Lane M contains a 1-kb molecular size marker with one band hybridized to 1.6 kb and serves as a point of reference. Probes Co and S hybridized to identical bands of expected size, indicating that the sequences represented by these two probes are contiguous in the genome. Probe G hybridized to bands different from those of probe Co, and the sizes of these bands are different from those predicted from the sequence of 6A3a, indicating that clone 6A3a is probably made up of two disjoined fragments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two luciferase reporter vectors (pGL3), one controlled by the SV40 promoter (SVLuc) and the other being promoterless (BLuc), were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase reporter vector controlled by the adenovirus promoter (ADGal) was purchased from CLONTECH. The various reporter constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 3. 2.8AR.BLuc was constructed by subcloning a 2.8-kb fragment of AR 5′-flanking sequence, which spans from −2733 to +41, into the unique HindIII-NcoI site immediately upstream of the luciferase gene of BLuc. A series of progressively shorter AR constructs, namely Del1.BLuc, Del2.BLuc, Del3.BLuc, Del4.BLuc, Del4.1.BLuc, and Del5.BLuc, was made by restriction digestion of 2.8AR.BLuc with SacI andHindIII in the multiple cloning site on the backbone of BLuc, followed by a unidirectional nested deletion in the 2.8-kb human AR 5′-flanking region of 2.8AR.BLuc using the exonuclease III/mung bean nuclease deletion kit (Stratagene). The lengths of different deletions were determined by DNA sequence analysis and are indicated in Fig. 3. To confirm the location of the osmotic response region, p132-SVLuc was made by inserting a 132-bp fragment (from −1235 to −1104) into theKpnI-SmaI site immediately upstream of the SV40 promoter of SVLuc. −1235−1174 CTTACATGGAAAAATATCTGGGCTAGTCTGTTCTGTATAAATTTTTCCAGGAGGGAGCACTTTA‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖CGCGGAATGTACCTTTTTATAGACCCGATCAGACAAGACATATTTAAAAAGGTCCTCCCTCGTGAAATGCGC Fragment AB −1235−1174 CTTACATTTCGAAATATCTGGGCTAGTCTGTTCTGTATAAATTTTTCCAGGAGGGAGCACTTTA‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖CGCGGAATGTAAAGCTTTATAGACCCGATCAGACAAGACATATTTAAAAAGGTCCTCCCTCGTGAAATGCGC Fragment mAB −1235−1174 CTTACATGGAAAAATATCTGGGCTAGTCTGTTCTGTATAATTGCCAGAGGAGGGAGCACTTTA‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖CGCGGAATGTACCTTTTTATAGACCCGATCAGACAAGACATATTTAACGGTCTCCTCCCTCGTGAAATGCGC Fragment AmB −1173−1134 CGCGTAAAGAAAGCACCAAATGGAAAATCACCGGCATGGAGTTTC‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖ ATTTCTTTCGTGGTTTACCTTTAGTGGCCGTACCTCAAAGA Fragment C −1173−1103 CGCGTAAAGAAAGCACCAAATAGAAAATCACCGGCATGGAGTTTC‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖ ATTTCTTTCGTGGTTTATCTTTTACTGGCCGTACCTCAAAGAGCT Fragment mC −1132−1103 GATCCGAGAGACCTGGTGCTTGAGTCACTACCAG‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖ GCTCTCTGGACCACGAACTCAGTGATGGTCCTAG Fragment D To better understand if there is more than one putative osmotic response element within the 132-bp fragment, six double-stranded oligonucleotides were made and then engineered to form different reporter constructs as described below (nucleotides that differ from the wild-type sequence are in boldface). pAB-SVLuc was constructed by cloning fragment AB into theKpnI-MluI site upstream of the SV40 promoter of SVLuc, pC-SVLuc by inserting fragment C into theMluI-XhoI site of the SV40 promoter of SVLuc, pABC-SVLuc by inserting fragment C into theMluI-XhoI site of pAB-SVLuc, and pABCD-SVLuc by inserting fragment D into the BglII site of pABC-SVLuc. pABmCD-SVLuc was constructed by inserting fragment mC into theMluI-XhoI site and fragment D intoBglII site of pAB-SVLuc, respectively; and pmABCD-SVLuc and pAmBCD-SVLuc were constructed by inserting fragments mAB and AmB into the KpnI-MluI site of SVLuc, respectively, followed by inserting fragment C into theMluI-XhoI site and fragment D into theBglII site of SVLuc. The sequences of all the constructs were verified by DNA sequence determination. The sequence of the 5′-flanking region of AR5 was obtained by sequencing the clones generated by nested deletions. Sequencing was performed using the fmol™ DNA sequencing system purchased from Promega and later using the ABI prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Plasmid DNAs were purified as described (25Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1996) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, p. 1.7.6, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar) with CsCl ultracentrifugation steps. The promoter activities of various constructs were determined in transiently transfected Chang liver cells. In each transfection experiment, Chang liver cells were seeded into six 60-mm culture dishes (6 × 105 cells/dish) and incubated for 24 h in isosmotic medium before transfection. Cells were then cotransfected with 2 μg of luciferase reporter construct and 1 μg of β-galactosidase reporter construct using Tfx-50 reagent (Promega) in serum-free medium. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in fresh isosmotic medium (≈300 mosmol/kg of H2O) for 12 h. A set of three dishes was changed to fresh isosmotic medium, while the other set was changed to fresh hyperosmotic medium (100 mm NaCl; ≈500 mosmol/kg of H2O). After incubation for 12 h, the cells were harvested after washing with phosphate-buffered saline and adding 400 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity expressed as relative light units was assayed by mixing 10–20 μl of cell extracts with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol, and the light emitted was measured by a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Berlin, Germany). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in the same way, except that the cell extracts were assayed with reaction buffer containing chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Total cell protein was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using γ-globulin as the standard. Pilot studies showed that the amount of cell extract used falls within the linear range of luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. In each transfection experiment, the luciferase activity in relative light units/μg of total cell protein was normalized by β-galactosidase activity in relative light units/μg of total cell protein. A minimum of three independent transfections were done for each construct. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. Chang liver cells (1 × 107) were initially grown in isosmotic medium (≈300 mosmol/kg of H2O) in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. The medium was replaced by either fresh isosmotic or hyperosmotic medium (100 mm NaCl; ≈500 mosmol/kg of H2O) for another 24 h. The cells were washed and scraped into 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 1 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of cold Buffer A (10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were again pelleted and resuspended in 45 μl of Buffer A with 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Samples were incubated for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant fraction was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of cold Buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 15 min. After vortexing, the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction containing the DNA-binding proteins was diluted with 60 μl of modified Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.05m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol), divided into aliquots, and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using γ-globulin as the standard. The 132-bp fragment (−1235 to −1104) containing the osmotic response region was released from p132-SVLuc by digestion with the restriction enzymes KpnI and XhoI. The resulting fragment was then labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment. Nuclear extracts (1–4 μg) were incubated with 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled 132-bp probe in 20 μl of binding reaction mixture containing 12 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 1 μg of pGEM-7zft (Promega). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the mixture was electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (79:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 45 mm Tris borate, 45 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and exposed for 1–2 days at −70 °C with intensifying screens. For competition experiments, 10- and 50-fold molar excesses of unlabeled 132-bp fragment were added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. Hyperosmolality has been shown to induce the expression of the AR gene in a number of cell lines tested in addition to renal cell lines (26Kaneko M. Carper D. Nishimura C. Millen J. Bock M. Hohman T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Petrash J.M. Flath M. Sens D. Bylander J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We found that Chang liver cells, a human liver cell line, also induce AR expression in response to hyperosmotic stress. Fig.1 shows the time- and osmolality-dependent changes in AR mRNA in Chang liver cells following exposure to medium supplemented with either 50 mm (≈380 mosmol/kg of H2O) or 100 mm (≈500 mosmol/kg of H2O) NaCl. Control cells showed a relatively constant level of AR mRNA throughout the time course of 36 h. In cells maintained in hyperosmotic medium, there was an induction of AR mRNA expression within 12 h, reaching a maximum within 24 h and remaining at steady state at 36 h. After 24 h, there was a 30-fold induction of AR mRNA in cells maintained in hyperosmotic medium. The maximum hyperosmotic induction was higher in 100 mm NaCl-treated cells than in 50 mmNaCl-treated cells despite a slight decrease of β-actin mRNA expression in 100 mm NaCl-treated cells. The above results suggest that the expression of the AR gene in Chang liver cells is regulated by high salt level in the medium; hence, this cell line was used as a host to identify the cis-acting element(s) in the AR gene involved in osmotic regulation of transcription. We have previously obtained a human AR genomic DNA clone (1K8) containing sequence up to 2.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site (24Ko B.C.B. Lam K.S.L. Wat N.M.S. Chung S.S.M. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In order not to miss the regulatory sequence farther upstream, we set forth to clone larger fragments of the upstream sequence. Six clones were isolated from primary screening of the human genomic library using oligonucleotides deduced from the 1K8 sequence (see “Materials and Methods”) as probes. Two clones were confirmed to contain the AR gene using AR cDNA as a probe in the secondary screening and by comparing part of their sequences with published data (29Wang K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16052-16058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Graham A.G. Brown L. Hedge P.J. Gammack A.J. Markham A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6872-6877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the two clones (AR5) was found to span −15 to +4 kb relative to the transcription start site of the AR gene. Preliminary experiments showed that a putative ORE is located within a 2.8-kb fragment containing the transcription start site and 41 bp of exon 1 (see below). The sequence of this fragment and exon 1 and 513 bp of intron 1 sequence from AR5 were determined and deposited in the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank. The sequence from positions −650 to +617 is identical to the available published sequence with the exception of 8 bp (30Graham A.G. Brown L. Hedge P.J. Gammack A.J. Markham A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6872-6877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the 2.8-kb fragment contains the region upstream of the AR gene, and it is unlikely that it is part of an AR pseudogene. A discrepancy became apparent between this region and a corresponding region of a putative aldose reductase gene promoter containing a functional ORE (clone 6A3a) located ∼3.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site (21Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sequence of this 5′-flanking upstream region was found to be entirely different from that of AR5 upstream of position −1066 (anMboI site), whereas the sequences downstream of that position are identical in the two clones. This suggested that either AR5 or 6A3a consists of two disjoined fragments linked together during cloning. This was tested by Southern blot hybridization, and the results, shown in Fig. 2, indicate that the 2.8-kb fragment within AR5 is contiguous in the genome, while clone 6A3a probably consists of part of the AR gene linked to a fragment from a different part of the genome. This artifact occurred during the construction of the partially digested MboI human genomic library (21Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), CLONTECH. To locate the ORE of the human AR gene, the 2.8-kb fragment of the genomic clone AR5 containing −2694 to +41 of the AR gene was fused to the luciferase reporter gene (2.8AR.BLuc) and transfected into Chang liver cells. The β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the adenovirus promoter was included in every transfection to monitor the efficiency of transfection. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were switched to either isosmotic or hyperosmotic medium. After 12 h of incubation in these media, cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 3, transfected cells incubated in hyperosmotic medium have 12.5-fold higher luciferase activity than those incubated in isosmotic medium, suggesting that the 2.8-kb fragment contains an ORE as previously shown for the rabbit aldose reductase gene (31Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Martin B.M. Burg M.B. Gracia-Perez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10742-10746Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Inclusion of a 5-kb upstream fragment did not affect the osmotically induced transcription activity (data not shown), and this fragment was not analyzed further. The location of the ORE within the 2.8-kb fragment was further delimited by 5′ to 3′ nested deletions and testing the shortened fragments in transient transfection assays as described earlier. The results are summarized in Fig. 3. Deletions from −2694 to −1900 did not appreciably affect the osmotically induced activity of the reporter gene. There was a slight drop in osmotic inducible activity when the sequence was shortened from −1900 to −1500 and another minor drop when shortened to −1235. The AR 5′-flanking sequences deleted to −1235 can still be induced by hyperosmotic medium by 7.6-fold over those in isosmotic medium. Further deletion to −1104 totally obliterated the osmotic response. These results indicate that the major ORE is located in the 132-bp sequence between −1235 and −1104 and that there may be an auxiliary ORE between −1900 and −1235 that is required for full osmotic response. To test if the 132-bp sequence alone is sufficient to direct osmotically induced transcription and to te"
https://openalex.org/W2034856007,"Leptin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone, is one of the central regulators of body weight homeostasis. In humans and rodents, two major forms of leptin receptors (OB-R) are expressed. The short form (OB-RS), considered to lack signaling capability, is detected in many organs. In contrast, OB-R long form (OB-RL) predominates in the hypothalamus, but is also present at low levels in peripheral tissues. Transient transfection experiments have demonstrated that OB-RL transduces an intracellular signaling similar to interleukin (IL)-6 type-cytokine receptors. To define the specificity by which OB-R induces genes and cooperates with signal transduction pathways utilized by other hormones and cytokines, rat and human hepatoma cell lines were generated which stably express human OB-RL. Hepatoma cell lines selected for appreciable levels of OB-RL mRNA display enhanced leptin binding and responded to leptin with an IL-6 receptor-like signaling that includes the activation of STAT proteins, induction of acute-phase plasma proteins, and synergism with IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. A leptin-mediated recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to insulin receptor substrate-2 was also detected. However, no significant tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-2 and modulation of the immediate cell response to insulin were observed. The data suggest that OB-RL action in hepatic cells is equivalent to that of IL-6 receptor. However, leptin does not play a specific role in muting insulin action on hepatoma cells and therefore may not contribute to the diabetic symptoms associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2004779654,"Upon infection of soybean roots, nitrogen-fixing bacteria become enclosed in a specific organelle known as the symbiosome. The symbiosome membrane (SM) is a selectively permeable barrier that controls metabolite flux between the plant cytosol and the symbiotic bacterium inside. Nodulin 26 (NOD 26), a member of the aquaporin (AQP) water channel family, is a major protein component of the SM. Expression of NOD 26 in Xenopus oocytes gave a mercury-sensitive increase in osmotic water permeability (P f). To define the biophysical properties of NOD 26 water channels in their native membranes, symbiosomes were isolated from soybean root nodules and the SM separated as vesicles from the bacteria. Permeabilities were measured using stopped-flow fluorimetry in SM vesicles with entrapped carboxyfluorescein. Osmotic water permeability (P f) of SM was high, with a value of 0.05 ± 0.003 cm/s observed at 20 °C (mean ± S.E.; n = 15). Water flow exhibited a low activation energy, was inhibited by HgCl2 (0.1 mm), and exhibited a unit conductance of 3.2 ± 1.3 × 10−15 cm3/s, a value 30-fold lower than that of AQP 1, the red blood cell water channel. Diffusive water permeability (P d) was 0.0024 ± 0.0002 cm/s, and the resulting P f toP d ratio was 18.3, indicating that water crosses the SM in single file fashion via the NOD 26 water channel. In addition to high water permeability, SM vesicles also show high mercury-sensitive permeability to glycerol and formamide, but not urea, suggesting that NOD 26 also fluxes these solutes. Overall, we conclude that NOD 26 acts as a water channel with a single channel conductance that is 30-fold lower than AQP 1. Because the solutes that permeate NOD 26 are far larger than water, and water appears to cross the channel via a single file pathway, solute flux across NOD 26 appears to occur by a pathway that is distinct from that for water.

Soil bacteria of the Rhizobium andBradyrhizobium genera invade the roots of specific leguminous plants and establish a nitrogen fixing symbiosis. During this process, a developmental program is triggered resulting in the formation of root nodules. The bacterium becomes enclosed in a specific organelle, the symbiosome (1Roth E. Jeon K. Stacey G. Palcios R. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Genetics of Plant Microbe Interactions. ADS Press, St. Paul, MN1988: 220-225Google Scholar), within the infected cells of the nodule. This organelle is delimited by a membrane of plant origin, known as the symbiosome membrane (SM). 1The abbreviations used are: SM, symbiosome membrane; NOD 26, nodulin 26; AQP, aquaporin; CF, carboxyfluorescein; MIP, major intrinsic protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ANTS, aminonaphthalenetrisulfonic acid. This membrane regulates the efflux of fixed nitrogen from the endosymbiont to the plant cytosol as well as the influx of dicarboxylates (e.g.malate) from the plant, providing energy for nitrogen fixation (2Day D.A. Udvari M.K. Symbiosis. 1993; 14: 175-189Google Scholar, 3Whitehead L.F. Tyerman S.D. Salom C.L. Day D.A. Symbiosis. 1995; 19: 141-154Google Scholar, 4Streeter J.G. Symbiosis. 1995; 19: 175-196Google Scholar). During nodule development, the expression of a number of nodule-specific proteins, known as nodulins, is induced. One of these proteins, nodulin 26 (NOD 26), is a major protein component of the SM (5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). NOD 26 is a member of an ancient family of membrane channel proteins that include bacterial glycerol transporters, aquaporin (AQP) water channels, and various other intrinsic membrane proteins (6Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 7Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Structural similarities shared by family members include the presence of six putative transmembrane α-helical domains with highly conserved NPA motifs found within the loop structures between these helices (7Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions are relatively hydrophilic and are exposed to the cytosolic compartment. It has previously been shown that NOD 26 is phosphorylated specifically and uniquely, in vitro and in vivo, at Ser-262 within the carboxyl-terminal domain by a calcium-dependent protein kinase of the CDPK family (5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Weaver C.D. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8954-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The symbiosome represents a metabolically active compartment with several transport activities that are essential for support of the symbiosis (2Day D.A. Udvari M.K. Symbiosis. 1993; 14: 175-189Google Scholar, 3Whitehead L.F. Tyerman S.D. Salom C.L. Day D.A. Symbiosis. 1995; 19: 141-154Google Scholar, 4Streeter J.G. Symbiosis. 1995; 19: 175-196Google Scholar). The observation that NOD 26 is expressed only during nodule formation and is a major membrane component of this organelle argues for its importance in SM function. However, the question of the role that NOD 26 plays in symbiosome function is an open one. Similar to the major intrinsic protein of the lens (MIP or AQP 0) (11Zampighi G.A. Hall J.E. Kreman M. Proc.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17858-17862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation confers voltage-sensitive gating behavior on the channel (15Lee J.W. Zhang Y. Weaver C.D. Shomer N.H.

However, recent experiments involving expression of MIP in Xenopus oocytes have led to a reevaluation of the channel properties of this protein, and it is now clear that MIP possesses aquaporin activity in this system (16Mulders S.M.

To address a potential aquaporin function for NOD 26 in rhizobia symbioses, we have also examined the water and solute transporting activities of NOD 26 in its native membrane, both to define its potential role in symbiosome function and to compare its transport properties with other members of the AQP family. For expression in Xenopus oocytes, a NOD 26 cDNA (18Zhang Y. Roberts D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was cloned into the BglII site of the pXβG-evl plasmid (19Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. Peter Agre). Capped cRNA encoding NOD 26 (flanked by 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions of theXenopus β-globin mRNA) was produced by in vitro transcription of XbaI linearized plasmid by T3 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). Xenopus oocytes (stage VI) were prepared as described previously (17Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and were injected with 50 nl of water (Control) or 50 nl of 1 mg/ml NOD 26 cRNA. Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in ND96 media for 24 h prior to analysis. Osmotic water permeability (P f) of oocytes was measured at 10 °C by monitoring the change in cross-sectional area of the oocyte upon 70% dilution as described (16Mulders S.M. Preston G.M. Deen P.M.T. Guggino W.B. van Os C.H. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9010-9016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The relative change in volume (V/V 0) was calculated as follows (Equation 1). (A/A0) 3/2=V/V0Equation 1 A 0 and V 0 are the cross-sectional area and cell volume, respectively, at time 0, andA and V are the cross-sectional area and cell volume, respectively, at time = t.P f was calculated as shown in Equation 2. Pf={d(V/V0)/dt}{V0/S0}÷{ΔOsm×VW×(Sreal/Ssphere)}Equation 2 S 0 is the geometric surface area of the oocyte at time 0, ΔOsm is the osmotic gradient,V w is the partial molar volume of water,S real is the actual area of the oolemma, andS sphere is the surface area of the oocyte assuming it is a sphere. AnS real/S sphere value of 9 was used for all P f calculations. This factor corrects for the increase in surface area due to the presence of folds and microvilli in the oolemma (16Mulders S.M.

Measurements of reversible HgCl2 inhibition of water flux were done as follows. After P f determination, oocytes were incubated in ND96 media containing 3 mmHgCl2 for 4 min. P f was then remeasured in diluted ND96 in the presence of 3 mmHgCl2. Reversibility was shown by then incubating the same oocytes in ND96 containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and no HgCl2 for 15 min prior to a third P fdetermination. Between each measurement, oocytes were rinsed and incubated in ND96 medium containing no agents for 20 min. Nodulated soybean plants(Glycine max cv Essex) were grown by a modification of the procedure described by Weaver et al. (5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Weaver C.D. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8954-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Soybeans were planted in vermiculite and were inoculated directly by watering with a dilute culture of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110. Inoculation was repeated 1 week later. Plants were grown in a greenhouse with supplementary lighting. Nodules (20 to 40 g) were harvested from 28- to 40-day-old soybean plants, and symbiosomes were isolated by a modification of a previous procedure (5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Nodules were gently crushed in a buffer (1.5 ml/g of nodules) containing 20 mm MES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 20 mm sodium isoascorbate, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 10 mm MgSO4, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 350 mmmannitol. The extract was filtered through Miracloth, and symbiosomes were isolated by centrifugation (5,550 rpm in a Sorvall HS-4 rotor (4936 × g)) on a Percoll step gradient (7 ml of extract on a 15 ml of gradient consisting of 5 ml each of 30, 60, and 80% Percoll in 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 3 mmMgSO4, 350 mm mannitol). Pure symbiosomes were collected from the 60/80% Percoll interface. The symbiosomes were washed in 25 mm MES-bis-trispropane, 3 mmMgSO4, 350 mm mannitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.O (wash buffer). The final washed symbiosome pellet was suspended in 3–4 ml of wash buffer containing 20 mm carboxyfluorescein (CF) and was vortexed 2 min. Symbiosome membrane (SM) vesicles were separated from bacteroids by differential centrifugation. Bacteroids were pelleted at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall HS-4 rotor (5874 × g). The supernatant, containing the SM vesicles, was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The final vesicle pellet was suspended in 25 mm MES-bis-trispropane, 3 mm MgSO4, 20 mm CF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.0. Permeability measurements were performed as described (20Negrete H. Rivers R.

Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) using a stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (SF.17MV, Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) with a measured dead time of 0.7 ms to monitor the fluorescence quenching of CF entrapped within the vesicles. Extravesicular fluorescence was quenched completely using anti-CF antibody (21Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 22Kuypers F.A. Roelofsen B. Berendsen W. Op Den Kamp J.A.F. Van Deenen L.L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2260-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 490 nm. The emission wavelength was filtered with a 515-nm cutoff filter. Fluorescence data from the stopped-flow device from 5 to 10 individual determinations were averaged and fit to a single exponential curve using software supplied by Applied Photophysics. The software utilizes a nonlinear regression (Marquardt) algorithm calculated from the time course using the “Curfit” routine. Osmolalities of all solutions were measured by freezing point depression (Precision Instruments Osmette A osmometer, Natick, MA). NOD 26 containing vesicles were washed three times with buffer solution (25 mm MES, 3 mm MgSO4 titrated to pH 7.0 with NaOH; osmolality 45 mOsm/kg). P f was determined by abruptly doubling the osmolality of the extravesicular solution with additional sucrose and monitoring the time-dependent quenching of entrapped CF. Upon mixing, intravesicular CF concentration increased as water efflux occurred, leading to concentration-dependent CF quenching. P f was calculated from the time course of relative fluorescence by comparing single exponential time constants fitted to simulated curves in which P f was varied. Simulated curves were calculated using a commercially available software package (MathCad) from the osmotic permeability equation (Equation 3). dV(t)/dt=(Pf)(SAV)(MVW)·{[Cin/V(t)]−Cout}Equation 3 V(t) is the relative volume of the vesicles at time t, P f is osmotic water permeability, SAV is the vesicle surface area-to-volume ratio, MVW is the molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol), and Cin and Cout are the initial concentrations of total solute inside and outside the vesicle, respectively.SAV was calculated from the vesicle diameters, which were measured by quasielastic light scattering using a Nicomp Model 270 submicron particle analyzer. Since the volume within the vesicle was small compared with the volume outside, it was assumed that Cout remained constant throughout the experiment. Parameters from the exponential fit (amplitude and end point) were used to relate relative fluorescence to relative volume using boundary assumptions that relative fluorescence and volume are 1.0 at time 0 and that relative volume reaches a known value (if at time 0 the osmolality outside is double that inside, the relative volume reaches 0.5) at the end of the experiment. Unit conductance (P f) for NOD 26 was determined by estimation of the NOD 26 content of the symbiosomes per unit surface area as described (23Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S. Smith B. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 24Zeidel M.L. Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Ambudkar S.V. Maunsbach A.B. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The number of vesicles per unit volume of preparation was determined by quantifying the total amount of entrapped CF per unit volume by lysing the vesicles with Triton X-100 and comparing the total fluorescence in the cuvette (SLM Aminco 500 C spectrofluorimeter) to standard curves obtained on the same instrument at identical settings using known quantities of CF. From the quench curve of the intact vesicles containing CF, the internal concentration was 20 mm. From this concentration, the total amount of CF per unit volume of the preparation, and the diameter of each vesicle, it was possible to calculate the total amount of vesicle surface area in the preparation. The density of NOD 26 per unit surface area of vesicle was determined from the concentration of NOD 26 in the SM preparations. Two separate procedures were used. First, the total protein concentration in the SM preparation was determined as described (5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the proportion of protein which is NOD 26 was estimated by densitometry of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel of vesicle preparation. The molar concentration was determined using a molecular weight of 28,887 calculated from the deduced amino acid composition of NOD 26. Second, a quantitative Western blot procedure with NOD 26 specific antibodies (18Zhang Y. Roberts D.M. Mol. Biol.

Concentration values determined by the two methods showed excellent agreement (data not shown). Based on the density of NOD 26 per unit surface area of vesicle, the unit conductance of NOD 26 (pf) could then be calculated as shown in Equation 4. pf=Pf÷SuDEquation 4 P f is the calculated osmotic water permeability in cm/s, and SuD is the density of channels per unit symbiosome surface area (number of channels/cm2). P d was measured as described (25Ye R. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), using the fluorophore aminonaphthalenetrisulfonic acid (ANTS; Molecular Probes, Junction city, OR), which exhibits enhanced fluorescence when exposed to deuterium. SM vesicles were prepared as described above except that ANTS (10 mm final concentration) was loaded in the place of CF. ANTS-loaded SM vesicles prepared in buffer containing H2O were mixed abruptly into isoosmotic medium containing 50% deuterium oxide (D2O) buffer. Because the time courses of these measurements were so rapid, they were performed at 12 °C instead of 20 °C to slow the rate and permit maximal definition of the time course of water diffusion. SM permeabilities to urea, glycerol, acetamide, and formamide were measured by loading the vesicles with the small nonelectrolytes and abruptly mixing them into isoosmotic medium containing half the intravesicular concentration of the permeant solute as described (20Negrete H. Rivers R. Gough A.H. Colombini M. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11627-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). As the permeant solute escaped from the vesicles, water osmotically followed, and the rate of vesicular shrinkage was dependent upon permeant solute exit. As with osmotic water permeability, vesicle shrinkage was monitored by the self-quenching of CF. Calculations of small nonelectrolyte (urea or glycerol) permeabilities were performed using Equation 5. dVrel/dt=Psolute(SA/V0)(1/141)(188/Vrel−235)Equation 5 The equation has been derived and validated as described previously (20Negrete H.

Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). P solute is the permeability coefficient (cm/s) for solute. V rel is the relative volume of the vesicles at a given time, andV 0 is their relative volume at time 0.SA is the surface area of the vesicles. By use of parameters from the single exponential curve fit to the data,P solute was solved using MathCad. The program SigmaStat (Jandel Corp., Corte Madera, CA) was used for the paired t test and for analysis of variance. Numerical results were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Fig. 1 shows P f values obtained in oocytes injected with water (control) or NOD 26 cRNA (NOD 26). Injection of NOD 26 cRNA markedly and significantly increasedP f above that of control oocytes (p < 0.001). This increase was abolished by exposure to HgCl2, and the mercurial sensitivity was reversed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (for both comparisons, p< 0.005). Consistent with the water flux through a protein channel, the E a calculated from Arrhenius plots was reduced 2-fold in NOD 26-injected oocytes compared with water injected controls (data not shown). Overall, these results are consistent with water flux through an aquaporin-like channel (reviewed in Ref. 7Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that NOD 26 cRNA encodes a mercurial-sensitive water channel. Since the symbiosome membrane represents a specialized plant membrane of which NOD 26 is a major (if not the major) protein component (5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Weaver C.D. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8954-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we set out to investigate further the water permeability of this protein in its native state in isolated SM vesicles. To perform permeability measurements, vesicles must behave as a single population in size measurements. Fig. 2 shows a representative quasielastic light scattering trace of SM vesicles. It is apparent that the vesicles exhibit a single population profile. The diameters obtained in two such measurements were 217 and 240 nm, so an average radius of 228 nm was used for all permeability calculations. Fig.3 shows representative time courses of osmotic vesicle shrinkage in the absence and presence of HgCl2. SM vesicles exhibit high water permeabilities with an averageP f of 0.05 ± 0.003 cm/s at 20 °C (mean ± S.E.; n = 15). Consistent with the mercury sensitivity of the NOD 26 aquaporin activity, treatment of vesicles with 0.1 mm HgCl2 drastically reducedP f to an average value of 0.00380 ± 0.0006 cm/s (n = 7). The effect of varying temperature (12–39 °C) on P f is shown in the form of an Arrhenius plot in Fig. 4. From the slope, the activation energy, E a, was determined and from three such plots averaged 3.3 ± 0.4 kcal/mol. This lowE a is characteristic for water flow through aquaporins (26Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores and Plasma Membranes, Theory and Reality. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar, 27Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers, and Pumps: An Introduction to Membrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 66-69Google Scholar). Based on immunoassay, the NOD 26 concentration in SM was estimated at 3 to 4 nmol/mg protein which represents 10% of the total SM protein. From this value and the calculated vesicle surface area, the conductance of each NOD 26 monomer was determined to be 3.2 ± 1.3 × 10−15 cm3/s (n = 3), a value 30-fold lower than that of AQP 1, the red blood cell water channel (23Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S. Smith B. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar).Figure 4Representative Arrhenius plot of SM water flux as a function of temperature.

Values for this ratio of greater than 1 have been interpreted to indicate that water molecules line up single file within the lumen of the pore and provide an estimate of the number of water molecules lined up within the single file portion of the pore at any one time (26Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores and Plasma Membranes, Theory and Reality. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar, 27Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers, and Pumps: An Introduction to Membrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 66-69Google Scholar). We therefore measured P d in NOD 26 containing SM vesicles to determine whether we could find evidence for single file water transport and, if so, to estimate the number of water molecules lined up within the pore at any one time. Fig. 5 shows a representative time course for diffusive water permeability in SM, measured using ANTS. Preequilibration of vesicles with H2O followed by exposure to D2O gave a rapid increase in ANTS fluorescence, as D2O replaced H2O in the vesicle interior. From the fluorescence trace (Fig. 5), an averageP d of 0.0024 ± 0.0002 cm/s at 12 °C was calculated (n = 3). At the same temperature,P f was 0.044 ± 0.005 cm/s (n = 4), representing a P f toP d ratio of 18.3. Solute permeabilities (P solute) were determined for the nonelectrolytes formamide, glycerol, acetamide, and urea. Representative time courses of solute fluxes are shown in Fig.6, and the average P solute values obtained for the various compounds are summarized as a histogram in Fig. 7. Formamide and glycerol showed significantly higher P solute values than acetamide and urea (analysis of variance). HgCl2 significantly inhibited solute permeability for all solutes except urea (paired ttest). However, the effect of mercuric ion was much more drastic with the higher permeability solutes (i.e. glycerol and formamide). Similar to its effect on water flux, treatment with HgCl2 results in a loss of 85–90% transport activity of glycerol and formamide solutes.Figure 7Solute permeability coefficients in the absence and presence of HgCl2. Histograms show the mean ± S.E. for measurements on 4–7 SM vesicle preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present studies provide new insights in two areas: the transport functions of the symbiosome membrane between enclosed rhizobia symbionts and the plant cytosol, and the water and solute transport properties of different aquaporins. The importance of NOD 26 in symbiosis can be inferred from the following observations. 1) It is a nodule-specific protein (28Fortin M.G. Morrison N.A. Verma D.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 2) It is found exclusively on the symbiosome membrane (10Weaver C.D. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8954-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), where it is a major component constituting approximately 10% of the total protein in this membrane. 3) It is a member of the aquaporin famil"

Monocyte activation in response to LPS results in the production of an array of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6, in addition to other inflammatory mediators. In the extreme, the inflammatory response to LPS is an important contributor to septic shock which may occur during infection with Gram-negative bacilli (1Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Zähringer U. Seydel U. Di Padova F. Schreier M. Brade H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 2Watson R.W.G. Redmond H.P. Bouchier-Hayes D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although there is an extensive body of knowledge about functional changes in monocytes induced by LPS, there is relatively less known about the signaling pathways used by LPS to bring about these changes. Recently, it has become clear that monocyte responses to LPS involve specific cell surface receptors leading to the activation of pathways containing both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases (3Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shapira L. Takashiba S. Champagne C. Amar S. Van Dyke T.E. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20725-20728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial events in at least one dominant LPS signaling pathway are dependent upon the glycophosphatidylinositol-linked membrane molecule, CD14 (7Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar). Binding of the complex of LPS and LPS-binding protein to CD14 results in the activation of multiple src family protein tyrosine kinases, and this appears to involve the physical association of p53/56 lyn with the receptor complex (6Stefanová I. Corcoran M.L. Horak E.M. Wahl L.M. Bolen J.B. Horak I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20725-20728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that LPS-mediated, CD14-dependent activation of p53/p56 lyn leads to its association with an activated form of the lipid kinase, PI 3-kinase (8Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1157-1165PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase results in the production of PIP3, which is known to be an activator of the PKC isoforms ζ, ε, and δ (9Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is of interest in the context of LPS signaling since evidence has recently been provided to show that a PKC activity is increased in LPS-treated monocytes (3Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shapira L. Takashiba S. Champagne C. Amar S. Van Dyke T.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1818-1824PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, this activity appears to be related to one or more PKC isoforms, the activation of which is sustained in the absence of phosphatidylserine, Ca2+, and diacylglycerol (3Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar). This latter finding suggests the possibility that LPS may activate one of the aPKC isoforms, either PKC-ζ, PKC-ι, or both. This subfamily of PKC isoforms differs from cPKC (α, βI, βII, γ) and nPKC (δ, ε, η, θ) subfamily members in that aPKC isoforms are neither receptors for phorbol esters nor are regulated by Ca2+ or diacylglycerols (11Konno Y. Ohno S. Akita Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 106: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol.

Rather, aPKCs exhibit activator-independent activity which is increased upon exposure to novel lipids such as PIP3 and ceramides (9Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lozano J. Berra E.

In light of the findings indicating that incubation of monocytes with LPS leads to the activation of both PI 3-kinase and a PKC with unusual properties, the objectives of the present study were to identify this PKC isoform and examine its regulation. The results presented show that PKC-ζ is rapidly activated in LPS-treated human monocytes, and this occurs downstream of activated PI 3-kinase. These findings are consistent with a model in which LPS activates p53/p56 lyn leading to increased PI 3-kinase activity and activation of PKC-ζ through the production of PIP3. Anti-PKC-ζ antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). These antibodies gave similar results and were used interchangeably. Histone III-S, bovine myelin basic protein from bovine brain (MBP), protamine sulfate, protein kinase inhibitor (rabbit sequence), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS),l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI), andl-α-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, were purchased from Sigma. Purified PIP3 was a gift from Dr. C.-S. Chen (University of Kentucky) and was prepared as described previously (17Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 5905-5910Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). LY294002 and microcystin were from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-PKC-α antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Peptide ε and anti-PI 3-kinase antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Mono Q columns and protein G-Sepharose were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, protein A-agarose, and electrophoresis reagents and supplies were purchased from Bio-Rad. U937 and THP-1 cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies Inc. Iscove's methyl cellulose, RPMI 1640, Hank's balanced salt solution, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Stem Cell Technologies (Vancouver, British Columbia). [γ-32P]ATP, enhanced chemiluminescence reagents, and enhanced chemiluminescence film were from Amersham Int. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli O127:B8) was from Difco. Human AB+ serum was provided by The Canadian Red Cross (Vancouver, British Columbia). Unless specified otherwise, all other reagents were of the highest quality available. Fractions of peripheral blood enriched in white blood cells were obtained from the Cell Separator Unit (Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Center). Monocytes were enriched (85–95% pure) by adherence as described previously (3Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers of adherent cells in RPMI 1640 were treated with LPS (solubilized in RPMI + 10% AB+ human serum, final serum concentration, 0.1%) rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, snap frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C prior to analysis. Cell lysates for column chromatography were prepared by lysing cells on ice (20 min) in fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 1.0 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 100 nm microcystin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g to remove insoluble material and were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Protein concentrations were determined with Bio-RadDC protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cells lysates for analysis of PI 3-kinase activity were prepared as described previously (8Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1157-1165PubMed Google Scholar) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 100 nm microcystin, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Monocyte cell lines were maintained in complete RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). Twelve to 15 h prior to incubation with LPS, cells were rendered quiescent in RPMI without FCS at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Following stimulation with LPS, cells were lysed immediately, and the detergent-soluble material was frozen at −70 °C until further analysis. PI 3-kinase activity was measured in U937 cells essentially as described previously (8Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1157-1165PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates (1–3 mg of protein) were loaded onto a Mono Q FPLC column pre-equilibrated in buffer A (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mmNa3VO4). Proteins were resolved with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0–0.8 m NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected, and aliquots were assayed for protein kinase activity or immunoreactivity as described below. Quiescent THP-1 cells were either untreated or were incubated with LPS for the times indicated. When the effects of PI 3-kinase inhibitors were being studied, cells were incubated with either 32 μm LY294002 or 100 nm wortmannin for 20 min prior to addition of LPS. Following treatment, cells were immediately lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl with protease and phosphatase inhibitors used at the same concentrations as described above). Lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose and PKC-ζ was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-PKC-ζ (5 μg per sample, Upstate Biotechnology). Kinase activity was measured in the immunoprecipitates using MBP as substrate as described previously (18Gómez J. Garcı́a A. Borlado L.R. Bonay P. Martı́nez-A C. Silva A. Fresno M. Carrera A.C. Eicher-Streiber C. Rebollo A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1516-1522PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of kinase activity was done by scintillation counting of the band corresponding to MBP. Incorporation of radioactivity into MBP in the absence of lysate was used as background and was subtracted from radioactivity present in the immunoprecipitates. Aliquots (5 μl) of column fractions were assayed for phosphotransferase activity using various substrates as described previously (3Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, assays were performed in a final volume of 25 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 12.5 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, [γ-32P]ATP (40 μm), and various substrates at the concentrations indicated below. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C at room temperature and were terminated by spotting 23 μl of the mixture on phosphocellulose filter squares. Filters were washed six times in 0.85% (v/v)O-phosphoric acid, and bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Cell lysates (1 mg), prepared from LPS-treated U937 cells, were incubated with either 7.5 μg of rabbit anti-protein kinase C-ζ antibody or 7.5 μg of monoclonal anti-PKC-α antibody for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then incubated for 1 h with either protein A-agarose or protein G-Sepharose. Solid phase complexes were washed 2 times with FPLC extraction buffer by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 1 min, and the supernatant fraction was subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with the same antibodies. Immunoadsorbed supernatants were fractionated by Mono Q chromatography as described above, and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting and protein kinase assays. pSRα-based mammalian expression plasmids, containing the entire coding regions of either wild-type bovine p85α or mutant bovine p85α (Δp85α), were kindly provided by Masato Kasuga (Kobe University School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan). The mutant has a deletion of 35 amino acids from residues 479–513 of bovine p85α and the insertion of two other amino acids (Ser-Arg) in the deleted position. This alteration prevents the association of mutant p85α with the p110 catalytic subunit. However, mutant p85α is able to compete with native p85 for binding to essential signaling proteins and behaves as a dominant negative mutant (19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K.

Cells were washed and resuspended in 800 μl of antibiotic-free RPMI (without FCS). Transfection was done using LipofectAMINE according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. pSRα plasmids containing either wild-type or mutant p85α were cotransfected along with pMC1neo-poly(A), a plasmid encoding resistance to the antibiotic, G418 sulfate. DNA-liposome complexes were added to the cells followed by a 5-h incubation after which the cultures were supplemented with RPMI containing 10% FCS, penicillin, and gentamicin. Expression of foreign DNA was allowed to proceed for 2 days followed by the addition of 350 μg/ml G418. After 4 days in G418, the cells were suspended in Iscove's methyl cellulose supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, FCS, bovine serum albumin, G418, and glutamine. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 days and colonies were picked and resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI + 10% FCS supplemented with G418. Thereafter cells were maintained in medium containing 350 μg/ml G418. Following incubation of adherent monocytes with LPS, cells were fractionated essentially as described previously (20Knutson K.L. Hoenig M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, monocytes were scraped into hypotonic fractionation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 4.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 2.3 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 100 nm microcystin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C while rotating. Lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate cytosolic from particulate fractions. The resulting pellets were extracted in fractionation buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for 20 min and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) to separate the detergent-insoluble and -soluble material. The resulting supernatant was taken to represent a membrane fraction. Twenty to 40 μg of the cytosolic and membrane fractions were then subjected to immunoblotting using anti-PKC-ζ antibodies. Following incubation of peripheral blood monocytes with LPS, cell lysates were fractionated by Mono Q chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1 A, one major peak of MBP kinase activity eluted between 370 and 410 mm NaCl. A second, minor peak was also frequently observed eluting at ∼300 mm NaCl. This latter peak had previously been identified as p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (3Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with lysates prepared from untreated cells, the mean increase in activity of the major peak was 2.5 ± 0.7 (mean ± S.E.,n = 6) fold. Since previous data had suggested that this activity was a lipid-independent isoform of PKC (3Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar), the possible presence of PKC-ζ was analyzed by immunoblotting fractions with an isoform-specific antibody. Immunoreactivity for PKC-ζ was observed in the fractions corresponding to the peak of kinase activity (Fig.1 B). The antibody recognized a protein of ∼80–85 kDa which was sometimes resolved into a doublet or triplet of closely migrating proteins. The specificity of antibody reactivity with this ∼80-kDa protein complex was confirmed by peptide competition. Thus, as shown in Fig. 1 B, an excess of the PKC-ζ peptide used as immunogen to raise the antibody specifically abrogated recognition of these bands, whereas nonspecific reactivity with other proteins was not eliminated. Activation of PKC-ζ in response to LPS was also observed in two human, promonocytic cell lines, THP-1 and U937 (Fig.2 A). The MBP kinase activities exhibited similar elution profiles, and immunoreactivity for PKC-ζ corresponded with the peaks of activity (Fig. 2 B). The effect of LPS onin vivo PKC-ζ activity was also examined in a parallel system by immune complex kinase assay. PKC-ζ was immunoprecipitated from lysates of control or LPS-treated THP-1 cells, and kinase activity was measured using MBP as substrate. As shown in Fig. 2 C, LPS treatment resulted in a rapid and transient increase in kinase activity that was apparent as early as 5 min, was maximal at 10 min, and was nearly back to base line by 30 min. Immunodepletion was used to examine further whether the peak of MBP kinase activity was accounted for by PKC-ζ. Prior to fractionation on Mono Q, lysates prepared from LPS-treated U937 cells were either untreated or immunoadsorbed with either of two anti-PKC-ζ antibodies. Anti-PKC-α was used as a control for specificity. As shown in Fig.3 A, immunoabsorption of lysates with anti-PKC-ζ antibodies resulted in a significant reduction in peak activity when compared with fractions from either unadsorbed lysates or to lysates immunoadsorbed with anti-PKC-α antibody. In fact, peak MBP kinase activity was reduced by treatment with anti-PKC-ζ to a level essentially equivalent to that observed in fractions from control (non-LPS-treated) cells. Immunoadsorption of MBP kinase activity also resulted in removal of PKC-ζ immunoreactivity from Mono Q fractions (Fig. 3 B) and was observed with anti-PKC-ζ antibodies from two different sources (data not shown).Figure 1A, LPS-induced activation of serine/threonine kinases in human monocytes incubated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or medium alone (final serum concentration, 0.1%). Following incubation (15 min), cells were lysed in FPLC extraction buffer, and detergent-soluble lysates were fractionated by Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography, and fractions were assayed for MBP kinase activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data shown are from one experiment and are representative of results obtained in >6 independent experiments. B, detection of PKC-ζ immunoreactivity in fractions corresponding to the major peak eluting from the column at 390–420 mm NaCl. Aliquots of the fractions (125 μl) were analyzed for the presence of PKC-ζ by immunoblotting with anti-PKC-ζ antibody. Specific recognition of the 80–85-kDa protein by anti-PKC-ζ antibody was determined by immunoblotting in the absence or presence of peptide used to raise the antibody. Bands that were eliminated by preadsorbing the antibody with the competing peptide were deemed specific. The results shown are from one of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Immunoadsorption of the major peak of MBP kinase activity with anti-PKC-ζ antibodies. U937 cells were either stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS or medium alone (final serum concentration, 0.1%), and detergent-soluble lysates were prepared for immunoadsorption as described under “Material and Methods.” Lysates from medium control and LPS-stimulated cells were either untreated or subjected to immunoadsorption with either of two rabbit anti-PKC-ζ antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc. (ζ1) or Santa Cruz (ζ2)) or anti-PKC-α (α) antibodies (specificity control). A, 1 mg of lysate from each sample was then fractionated by Mono Q chromatography, and MBP kinase activities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data shown are from one of three independent experiments that gave similar results. B, aliquots of fractions from LPS-treated samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PKC-ζ to confirm depletion of PKC-ζ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction is commonly used as a marker of activation of the kinase. Following incubation of normal human monocytes with LPS, cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PKC-ζ antibody. Fig. 4 shows that after exposure to LPS for 10 min, levels of PKC-ζ increased significantly in the membrane fraction. Because of the abundance of cytosolic PKC-ζ, and since only a fraction of this was translocated to the membrane, there was no apparent decrease in cytosolic PKC-ζ. Since PKC-ζ is known to behave differently from other PKC family members, experiments were done to biochemically characterize the putative PKC-ζ. Aliquots of Mono Q fractions containing PKC-ζ were analyzed for activity using multiple substrates as shown in Fig. 5 A. Of the different substrates tested, the kinase phosphorylated MBP (0.2 mg/ml), peptide ε (84 μm), and S6 peptide (0.1 mm) with similar efficiency. In comparison, activities toward Kemptide (0.2 mg/ml), histone (0.2 mg/ml), and protamine sulfate (0.2 mg/ml) were lower. This profile of substrate preferences is consistent with previous reports for PKC-ζ (10Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4799-4805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cofactor requirements for PKC-ζ have also been found to be different than those of other PKC isoforms (10Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B shows the activity of the kinase toward MBP in the presence or absence of various PKC activators and cofactors. PIP3, an activator of PKC-ζ, enhanced the activity of the kinase in Mono Q fractions prepared from control cells (Fig. 5 B) but not in those prepared from LPS-treated cells (data not shown). Unlike PIP3, neither arachidonic acid (alone or with diacylglycerol) nor phosphatidylserine significantly enhanced the activity of the kinase when compared with its activity detected in the absence of added lipids (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to these findings with PKC-ζ, when partially purified cPKC was tested in the presence of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol, arachidonic acid (50 μm) was observed to further enhance its activity (data not shown). PMA, a known activator of several PKC isoforms, was also tested in the presence of PS and Ca2+. The addition of PS, Ca2+, and PMA together resulted in an approximate 35% increase in activity when compared with activity in the absence of cofactors (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, fractions corresponding to cPKC (i.e. 15–20) showed a robust activation in response to the combination of PMA, PS, and Ca2+. Recent evidence has suggested a role for PI 3-kinase metabolites in a signaling cascade leading to the activation of PKC (9Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the potential involvement of PI 3-kinase in LPS-induced activation of PKC-ζ, cells were incubated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, prior to the addition of LPS. As shown in Fig. 6, when used at concentrations known to be relatively selective for inhibition of PI 3-kinase, both inhibitors markedly attenuated activation of PKC-ζ induced by LPS. The requirement for PI 3-kinase for activation of PKC-ζ was also examined in cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of p85 (Δp85). Stable transfection with Δp85 resulted in a significant reduction in both basal and LPS-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.7, A and B). In contrast, cells transfected with wild-type p85 showed increased PI 3-kinase activity in response to LPS stimulation. To assess the effects of Δp85 on activation of PKC-ζ by LPS, lysates of transfected cells were analyzed using Mono Q chromatography. As shown in Fig. 8activation of PKC-ζ by LPS was abrogated in cells transfected with Δp85, and cells expressing wild-type p85 showed enhanced PKC-ζ activity in response to LPS. Fig. 8 C demonstrates that PKC-ζ was expressed in Δp85 transfected cells and PKC-ζ immunoreactivity correlated with the peak kinase activity.Figure 8Attenuation of LPS-induced activation of PKC-ζ by a dominant negative mutant of the p85 subunit (Δp85) of PI 3-kinas"

This extracellular α-amylase is not homologous to the subcellular α-amylase previously isolated from the same organism. One of the most abundantly distributed polysaccharides in nature is starch, which is produced by plants; it is composed of two high molecular weight compounds, amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a linear chain of glucose residues linked with an α-1,4 bond. Amylopectin is a branched polymer where the α-1,4-linked glucose residues are branched every 17–26 residues with α-1,6-linked points. A wide variety of microorganisms are able to degrade and utilize this natural high molecular weight biopolymer by secreting starch-degrading enzymes. These enzymes act either from the nonreducing end of the chain acting as exo-enzymes producing low molecular weight products (i.e. β-amylase, glucoamylase, and α-glucosidase) or in the interior of the chain and in a random fashion acting as endo-enzymes and producing linear and branched saccharides with various lengths (i.e. α-amylase). A great number of α-amylases (E.C. 3.2.1.1) have been isolated from a variety of eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms, and they are described in a previous reports (1Antranikian G. FEMS Microbiol.

In this paper, we present the gene isolation, gene cloning, sequencing, and expression in E. coli and Bacillus subtilisand biochemical characterization of a new extracellular α-amylase from P. furiosus. Primary structure analysis and comparison with known α-amylase revealed that this enzyme belongs to family 13 of glycosyl hydrolases and does not show sequence homology to its subcellular counterpart from the same organism. Chemical for gel electrophoresis were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); the various substrates were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs and Boehringer Mannheim and used as recommended by the manufacturers. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs and used as recommended by the manufacturer. All the other chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The medium for visualization of amylase activity was Luria Broth agar containing (per 500 ml of agar) 10 ml of a dyed amylopectin solution prepared as follows: 12.5 g of amylopectin (Serva 2000–4000 kDa) was dissolved by boiling in 250 ml of water and cooled to room temperature, 30 ml of 4 m NaOH and 2.5 g of Cibacron Rot B were added, and the solution was incubated overnight. pH was adjusted to 7 with 4 m HCl. 500 ml of 96% ethanol was added with stirring to precipitate the amylopectin as a red, viscous precipitate. The supernatant was discarded, and the amylopectin was dissolved in 200 ml of water by slight heating. The precipitation with ethanol was repeated once more. The amylopectin was again dissolved in 200 ml of water and autoclaved and was then ready for use. E. coli has been described in Ref. 10Diderichsen B. Wedsted U. Hedegaard L. Jensen B.R. Sjoholm C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4315-4321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and cells were prepared for and transformed by electroporation using a Gene Pulser™ electroporator from Bio-Rad as described by the supplier. B. subtilis DN1885 has been described by Diderichsen et al. (10Diderichsen B. Wedsted U. Hedegaard L. Jensen B.R. Sjoholm C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4315-4321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and competent cells were prepared and transformed as described in Ref. 11Yasbin R.E. Wilson G.A. Young F.E. J.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar) was used for subclonings. The experimental techniques used to construct the plasmids were standard techniques within the field of recombinant DNA technology (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar).

Approximately 100 μg of DNA was partially digested with Sau3A and size-fractionated on a sucrose gradient, and fragments between 3 and 7 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. were pooled. The cloning vector pSJ1678 (see Fig. 1) was digested withBamHI, and a 3.8-kb fragment was purified from an agarose gel. Approximately 0.75 μg of vector fragment was ligated to ∼4 μg of size-fractionated P. furiosus chromosomal DNA and used to transform E. coli SJ2 by electroporation. The gene bank was plated on LB plates containing dyed amylopectin and supplemented with 6 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, each plate was replica plated onto two new plates, which were then incubated overnight at 37 °C. One of these was subsequently incubated at 60 °C overnight (see Fig. 2). pS2467 was digested with ClaI, the 4.5-kb fragment containing the α-amylase gene was ligated to AccI-digested pUC19 DNA, and the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli SJ2. Transformants were obtained containing the insert in each of the two possible orientations with respect to the cloning vectors. These clones were SJ2481 containing the pSJ2481 construct and clones SJ2482 containing pSJ2482 construct. pSJ2481 was 32P-labeled by nick translation using a commercial kit obtained from Amersham Corp. and used as a probe in a Southern analysis. Hybridization was overnight at 60 °C in 10 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA and 5 × SSC followed by two 15-min washes in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and one 15-min wash at 60 °C (see Fig. 3). 4.5 kb of the P. furiosus DNA insert clones on pSJ2467 was sequenced on both strands, using Sequenase™ (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) and a combination of subclones and oligonucleotide primers based on previously determined sequences. The plasmid pSJ1678 used for construction of the gene library is a shuttle vector able to replicate both in E. coli and B. subtilis. To test for expression of the amylase activity inB. subtilis, pSJ2467 was therefore transformed into competent cells of DN1885 selecting for resistance to chloramphenicol (6 μg/ml) on LB plates containing dyed amylopectin. 10 transformants were picked onto two new plates with dyed amylopectin along with SJ1678, which is DN1885/pSJ1678 as a control. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, one plate was transferred to 65 °C, whereas the other was kept at 37 °C. Seven hours later, the degradation of the amylopectin around the 10 transformants with pSJ2467 was apparent on the plate incubated at 65 °C because of the formation of a clear halo. No degradation halo was formed around the control strain (see Fig. 6). Preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in 1.5-mm-thick polyacrylamide gels (either homogeneous (5 or 12%, w/v) or gradient gels (5–30%, w/v)) at a constant voltage of 400 V for 24 h at 4 °C. The protein bands were visualized by silver staining (17Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Analytical 11.5% polyacrylamide slab electrophoresis in the presence 0.1% SDS was carried out at a constant current of 40 mA/gel for 3 h. Commercially available molecular weight markers were used to calibrate the gel. The protein band exhibiting α-amylase activity on the gel was detected by soaking the gels in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1% (w/v) starch for 1 h at 4 °C, further incubating the gels at 90 °C for 30 min, and staining the gels with 0.15% (w/v) iodine and 1.5% (w/v) potassium iodide until a clear zone became visible. Amylase activity was determined in the cell supernatant as described in Ref. 18Bergmeyer H.U. Grassl M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2. Verlag, Chemie, Weinheim1983: 151-152Google Scholar. In a typical assay, enzyme solution up to 100 μl was added to 250 μl of sodium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5) containing 1% (w/v) starch and incubated at 95 °C for 30 and 60 min. One unit of α-amylase is defined as the amount of the enzyme that liberates 1 μmol of reducing sugar/min with maltose as a standard. The activity- and temperature-dependent experiments were carried out in a water bath for the range between 40 and 90 °C, whereas for the range between 90 and 130 °C a glycerol bath was used. Activity tests above 100 °C were carried out in closed Hungate tubes to prevent boiling of the solution. For the determination of pH optimum activity, the following buffers were used for the different pH ranges: for pH 3.5–4.0, 50 mm citrate; for pH 4.5–6.0, 50 mm sodium acetate; and for pH 6.5–7.0, 50 mm potassium phosphate. The substrate specificity of the α-amylase was studied in 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.5 using 0.5 unit of purified enzyme/ml of reaction at 90 °C for 30 min. The final concentration of various substrates was 1% (w/v). Thermal stability experiments were performed at the indicated temperatures in the above mentioned baths, and the residual activity was determined in a typical enzyme assay solution. Sugars released by the enzymatic action of α-amylase from P. furiosus on starch were analyzed as follows. For each milliliter of acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.0), 0.5 unit of α-amylase was added. The final starch concentration was 1% (w/v), and the incubation was conducted at 90 °C. Samples were withdrawn after various time intervals. Each sample was purified with ion exchange resin (Serdolyt MB, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), and the sugars were analyzed by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-42 A column (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Sugars eluted were monitored by a differential refractometer (Knauer, Bad Homburg, Germany). The search for sequence homology to the other amylases performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLASTP network service (19Altschul S.F. Warren G. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar). P. furiosus (DSM 3638) was cultivated at 98 °C in a medium as described in Ref. 20Zillig W. Holz I. Klenk H.P. Trent J. Wunderl S. Janekovic D. Imsel E. Haas B. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1987; 9: 62-70Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar. 20-liter cultures were continuously gassed with H2/CO2 (80:20). Cell growth was paralleled by enzyme production and degradation of starch in the medium. By using continuous gassing, an enzyme activity above 1000 units/liter was detected. These growth conditions caused about 80% secretion of the enzyme into the culture fluid. The amount of the secreted enzyme reached the maximum after 18 h of cultivation (data not shown). The preparation of the DNA expression library was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig.1 shows the pSJ1678 vector that was used to clone and express the P. furiosus DNA library. Fig. 2 outlines the clone selection procedure used to isolate the α-amylase gene, which is based on the secretion of amylolytic activity from the recombinant cells and the detection of this activity around the colony(ies) by producing a clear halo. The qualitative detection of amylase activity on agar plates is also described under “Materials and Methods.” Among 10,000 colonies, five colonies have shown clear halos indicating degradation of the amylopectin on the 60 °C agar plates, whereas no halos were observed around the colonies on the plates that were kept at 37 °C. These five clones were taken from the 37 °C plates and named SJ2463 through SJ2467. Restriction digests using HindIII revealed that the P. furiosus DNA inserts on the four clones SJ2463, SJ2464, SJ2465, and SJ2467 shared a common DNA region without the inserts being totally identical, whereas the DNA contained on SJ2466 clone appeared unrelated to the other four clones. We used the construct pSJ2467, which contained an insert of approximately 4.5 kb, for further analysis. pSJ2467 was digested with ClaI, the 4.5-kb fragment containing the α-amylase gene was ligated to AccI-digested pUC19 DNA, and the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli SJ2. Transformants were obtained containing the insert in each of the two possible orientations with respect to the cloning vector. These were SJ2481 containing pSJ2481 and SJ2482 containing pSJ2482 (data not shown). Both clones produce α-amylase as detected on amylopectin plates at 60 °C. Fig. 4 schematically shows the various subconstructs and their phenotype, which represents the α-amylase activity. Further subcloning was preformed from pSJ2481. pSJ2487 (see Fig. 4) was constructed by deletion of the 1-kb XbaI fragment from pSJ2481 and transformation of the religated plasmid into E. coli SJ2. The resulting transformants were not able to produce halos on LB plates containing dyed amylopectin, indicating that this deletion had removed a DNA region of importance for expression of an active amylase protein. The 1-kb XbaI fragment from pSJ2481 was inserted into XbaI-digested pUC19 to give pSJ2489 and pSJ2490 (identical), which were used for sequencing. When a Southern blot (Fig. 3) prepared with digested genomic DNA from P. furiosus was probed with the32P-labeled pSJ2481, a 5.3-kb PstI fragment, a 3.1-kb HindIII fragment, a 5.3-kb XhoI fragment, and two EcoRI fragments of 0.7 and 2.4 kb were found to specifically hybridize to the probe. The blot also shows that pSJ2463, pSJ2464, pSJ2465, and pSJ2467 contain a common DNA region (aHindIII fragment of approximately 0.5 kb is common to pSJ2463, pSJ2464, pSJ2465, pSJ2467, and chromosomal P. furiosus DNA). It also proves that the insert of pSJ2481 is derived from the chromosome of P. furiosus and that a homologous DNA region exists in the chromosome of Pyrococcus woesei. The chromosomal P. woesei DNA was isolated according to the method described in Ref. 15Pitcher D.G. Saunders N.A. Owen R.J. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1989; 8: 151-156Crossref Scopus (1836) Google Scholar. Thus pSJ2481 hybridizes to exactly the same fragments in HindIII-digested P. woesei DNA as in HindIII-digested P. furiosus DNA. Both clones produced α-amylase as visualized by the appearence of clear halos on dyed amylopectin plates after incubation at 60 °C. The amylase-producing transformants look different when compared with transformants containing the pUC19 vector plasmid only. They form smaller and more translucent colonies. The open reading frame corresponding to the α-amylase gene was localized by subcloning (the ability of individual subclones to produce α-amylase was assayed on plates containing dyed amylopectin) as outlined on Fig. 4. The 4.5 kb of the P. furiosus DNA insert cloned on pSJ2467 was sequenced on both strands using Sequenase™ and a combination of subclones and primer walking. The DNA sequence of the α-amylase coding region, including the signal peptide coding region, is shown in Fig. 5. On the basis of the DNA sequence and N terminus amino acid sequence determination of the mature α-amylase, the amino acid sequences of the signal peptide and of the mature α-amylase have been deduced. The signal peptide is 25 amino acids long and is cleaved between Ala25 and Ala26. The DNA fragment containing the α-amylase gene encompasses 1740 nucleotides, with the initiation codon GTG at position +1 (Fig. 5). The 1380-base pair open reading frame encodes a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 52,843 Da. This agrees well with the apparent molecular mass of the protein, determined by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, of 54 kDa. Immediately upstream of the coding region is the sequence GAGGT identical to the putative ribosome-binding site of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene of P. woesei (GAGGT) (21Zwickl P. Fabry S. Bogedain C. Haas A. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4329-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A pyrimidine-rich region exists immediately downstream from the TAG termination codon in the α-amylase gene, like other archaebacterial sequences. A “box A” promoter region was also identified between −53 and −58. The G + C content of the α-amylase gene is 42.9%, slightly higher than the value reported for the total genome of 38% (7Fiala G. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 56-61Crossref Scopus (713) Google Scholar). As has been seen in other sequenced genes from extreme thermophiles, A and T are preferred bases in the third position of the codon (21Zwickl P. Fabry S. Bogedain C. Haas A. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4329-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pSJ1678 used for construction of the gene library is a shuttle vector able to replicate in both E. coli and B. subtilis. The amyM promoters, reading into the inserts cloned in this vector, are functional inE. coli, thus enhancing the chances that any gene cloned would be successfully expressed in this host. To examine the expression of the amylase activity in B. subtilis, pSJ2467 was therefore transformed into competent cells of DN1885 selecting for resistance to chloramphenicol (6 μg/ml) on LB plates containing dyed amylopectin. Few transformants were picked onto new plates with dyed amylopectin, and after incubation at 37 °C one plate was transferred to 65 °C, whereas the other was kept at 37 °C. Seven hours later a degradation of the amylopectin around the transformants with pSJ2467 was observed on the plates incubated at 65 °C as formation of a clear halo. No halo was formed at 37 °C for the control strain as shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig.7 (A–C), α-amylase from P. furiosus is active in a broad temperature range from 40 to 130 °C (Fig. 7 B) and in a pH range from 3.5 to 8.0 (Fig.7 A) Maximal activity is measured at 100–105 °C and pH 4.5. Conditions for incubation of P. furiosus α-amylase for the determination of pH and temperature optimum are described under “Materials and Methods.” Beside the extremely high temperature optimum, the α-amylase shows remarkable thermal stability as well as stability against chemical denaturation. As depicted in Fig. 7 C, incubation in a boiling water bath for 6 h causes a decrease in enzymatic activity of only 20%. Around 60% of the enzyme activity is still detectable after 120 °C for 1 h. Furthermore, after heating of the enzyme at 115 °C for 3 h, 35% of residual activity was determined. The same sample was able to recover about 75% of its initial activity after 3 h of incubation (renaturation period) at room temperature. Some activity is still detectable after 30 min at 130 °C. On the other hand, the α-amylase is 55% active in the presence of 1.5m urea or 61% in 0.3 m guanidine hydrochloride. The initial activity can be completely recovered after removing both denaturing agents by dialysis. The addition of 5 mm of molybdenum, calcium, or magnesium ions did not influence α-amylase activity. A slight decrease of activity could be detected in the presence of cobalt, nickel, and iron ions, and complete inhibition was found when 5 mm of zinc or copper ions was added. Because EDTA did not show any effect, we can assume that the addition of metal ions is not required for enzymatic activity (data not shown). The partially purified extracellular α-amylase from P. furiosus hydrolyzes native starch, soluble starch, amylopectin, maltodextrin, and amylose as shown in Table I. Main products of starch degradation were oligosaccharides such as maltohexaose, maltopentaose, maltotetraose, maltotriose, and maltose. The enzyme degrades the α-1,4 glycosidic linkage in starch in a random fashion and can be designated as an α-amylase.Table ISubstrate specificity of α-amylase from P. furiosusSubstrateConcentrationα-Amylase activity%w/v%Starch1100Amylose0.284Maltose10Maltotriose10Dextran10Maltodextran114Pullulan0.50Dextrin (white)154Xylan (Roth)0.53Xylan (Birchwood)0.52α-Cyclodextrin10β-Cyclodextrin10γ-Cyclodextrin10Starch (1%) + α-cyclodextrin (0.1%)96Starch (1%) + β-cyclodextrin (0.1%)81Starch (1%) + γ-cyclodextrin (0.1%)87The activity of α-amylase from P. furiosus using various substrates is shown.

HPLC analysis has shown that the distribution of oligosaccharides seen in the chromatograms is typical of endo-amylase attack. The major oligosaccharides formed on prolonged hydrolysis are DP4, DP6, and DP7 (data not shown). The National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST e-mail server was used to search the peptide sequence data bases (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, SwissProt, Pacific Investment Research, Inc. and GenPept) for proteins homologous to the α-amylase protein sequence (19Altschul S.F.

A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar). The α-amylase encoded by this open reading frame revealed homology to α-amylases and other starch-degrading enzymes from a variety of organisms including bacteria, insects, and plants, and it is classified in family 13 of the glycosyl hydrolases (3Henrissat B. Bairoch B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Nakajima and his colleagues (23Nakajima R.T. Imanaka T. Aiba S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1986; 23: 355-360Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar) have identified four short primary sequence motifs, which also have been identified in amylolytic enzymes with other activities. These motives were also found in our α-amylase and indicated as regions I to IV in the alignment shown in Fig.8 A. The highest scoring homologous sequences were all α-amylases, of both procaryotic and eucaryotic origin. A homology matrix based on the alignment is presented in Fig. 8 B. It reveals that theP. furiosus α-amylase has about 47% homology toBacillus licheniformis (Amy-Bacli) (24Yuuki T. Nomura T. Tezuka H. Tsuboi A. Yamagata H. Tsukagoshi N. Udaka S. J. Biochem.

We named our α-amylase “extracellular enzyme” to distinguish it from the subcellular enzyme. There are several differences between the two enzymes in terms of size, localization, and primary structure, which are summarized in Table II. Our extracellular α-amylase shows significant homology to the other α-amylase from a variety of organisms and has been classified in family 13 of glycosyl hydrolases, whereas the subcellular α-amylase shows strong homology only to α-amylase from D. thermophilum, and both have been included to an extra family 57 of glycosyl hydrolases.Table IIComparison of the two different α-amylases from P. furiosusPropertiesThis workLaderman et al.Amino acids461649Molecular mass (Da)5287576261Cellular localizationextracellularintracellularSignal peptideyesnoStart codonGTGGTGI–IV amylases conserved regionsyesnoT-rich region at the 3′ terminusyesnoComparison of some features of the extracellular α-amylase presented in this work and the subcellular α-amylase described by Ladermanet al.

We have isolated and sequenced the gene of a new extracellular α-amylase from the hyperthermophile archaeon P. furiosus. The gene was also expressed in E. coli and B. subtilis using a novel shuttle vector. The structure of the gene displays the typical characteristics of an archaeon gene with a typical ribosome binding site and a pyrimidine-rich region immediately downstream from the stop codon. The utilization of the GTG initiation codon, which is used relatively rarely, seems to be the rule inPyrococcus sp. genes isolated so far. The extracellular α-amylase enzyme is not very closely related to any other amylases of family 13 of glycosyl hydrolases. On the other hand it can be aligned to the other enzymes, and it has the conserved regions I-IV found in other amylases. From the structural features of the extracellular α-amylase gene and the subcellular described by Laderman et al. (5Laderman K.A. Asada K. Uemori T. Mukai H. Taguchi I. Kato I. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24394-24401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as their primary structure comparison, it is clear that these are two completely different enzymes. This archaeon converts starch or glycogen to small linear and branched oligosaccharides, which can be transported most probably by “dextrin premease” into the cell. The presence of intracellular α-amylase indicates that further carbohydrate metabolism by P. furiosus is performed intracellularly. The extracellular α-amylase from P. furiosus is one of a number of extremophilic enzymes that have been expressed in a mesophilic host in an active form. The fact that expression of amylase activity from a Pyrococcus α-amylase gene can be obtained in B. subtilis without any modification of the gene (for example replacement of the ribosome binding site) to allow more efficient initiation of translation is surprising. B. subtilis is quite restrictive in its acceptance of ribosome binding sites, and it is a frequent observation that cloned genes from non-Gram-positive organisms would not be expressed in B. subtilis without proper modification of their expression signals. To our knowledge, this expression of the P. furiosusα-amylase constitutes the first example of expression from an unmodified (or nonengineered) Pyrococcus gene inBacillus. The high thermostability of this pyrococcal α-amylase, its independence on metal ions, its unique substrate specificity, and its product pattern make this enzyme an interesting candidate for industrial application. It is therefore very important to employ genetic and fermentation techniques for the production of such enzymes on a large scale."
https://openalex.org/W2079500084,"A 1.6-kilobase pair full-length cDNA encoding a transcription factor homologous to the Maf family of proteins was isolated by screening a K562 cDNA library with the NFE2 tandem repeat probe derived from the globin locus control region. The protein, which was designated hMAF, contains a basic DNA binding domain and an extended leucine zipper but lacks any recognizable activation domain. Expressed in vitro, the hMAF protein is able to homodimerize in solution and band-shift the NFE2 tandem repeat probe. In addition to homodimers, hMAF can also form high affinity heterodimers with two members of the NFE2/CNC-bZip family (Nrf1 and Nrf2) but not with a third family member, p45-NFE2. Although hMAF/hMAF homodimers and hMAF/Nrf1 and hMAF/Nrf2 heterodimers bind to the same NFE2 site, they exert functionally opposite effects on the activity of a linked γ-globin gene. In fact, whereas all hMAF/CNC-bZip heterodimers stimulate the activity of a γ-promoter reporter construct in K562 cells, the association into homodimers that is induced by overexpressing hMAF inhibits the activity of the same construct. Thus variations in the expression of hMAF may account for the modulation in the activity of the genes that bear NFE2 recognition sites.

In the last decade, meticulous searches along the β-globin gene cluster have led to the identification of numerous regulatory DNA sequences located either in close proximity to the genes or at a distance in regions that were originally identified for their DNase I hypersensitivity (1Tuan D.

A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar), which is highly related to NFE2, thus extending the NFE2 family to three members and predicting the existence of a fourth member on the basis of linkage with other large gene families (COL,INT, and HOX) on specific chromosomes (38Chan J.Y. Cheung M.C. Moi P. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Hum. Genet. 1995; 95: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The three genes are highly homologous in the DNA binding domain and leucine zipper but as is usually the case among related transcription factors, they are completely different in the activation domain. The genes are also differently regulated as NFE2 is restricted to hematopoietic tissues, whereas NRF1 and NRF2 are ubiquitously expressed. Despite the dramatic decrease in the HS2 enhancer activity produced by the disruption of the NFE2 consensus enhancer sequence (5Moi P. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9000-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), knockout of the p45-NFE2 gene in mice resulted in a disorder of megakaryocyte maturation but only minimally decreased the expression of the globin genes (39Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors are able to compensate for the lack of p45-NFE2 activity. Although Nrf1 and Nrf2 are ubiquitous factors, both are highly expressed in erythroid tissues and are able to transactivate globin gene promoters. Thus Nrf1 and Nrf2 could potentially compensate for p45-NFE2 function in the p45-NFE2 knockout mouse. Although this would suggest an evolutionary redundancy to protect and maintain the crucial body function of oxygen delivery, the observation that none of these factors bind DNA by itself and the identification of the p45-NFE2-associated protein p18 (40Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that p45-NFE2 and the related factors might indeed play distinct functions by dimerization with their respective partners. Interestingly, the p45-NFE2 partner p18 belongs to another family of bZip transcription factors (the Maf family (41Fujiwara K.T. Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kawai S. Goto N. Kataoka K. Saegusa T. Shinno K.H. Nishizawa M. Virology. 1992; 188: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)) whose members in chickens have different levels of tissue expression and could therefore drive the functional specificity of the proteins with which they associate. Even though the small Maf proteins do not seem to have an activation domain, a recent report suggests that they are able to modulate the activity of p45-NFE2 according to their preferential association into homodimers or heterodimers, resulting in a negative or positive regulatory activity on the target genes, respectively (44Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar).These studies emphasize how our knowledge on the globin regulation would benefit from isolation of the proteins that associate with Nrf1 and Nrf2. It was also predictable on the basis of similarities in the dimerization domains among members of the NFE2 family that the partners for Nrf1 and Nrf2 could also be found within the family of the Maf oncogenes. Here we describe the cloning of a small human MAFcDNA (hMAF) through recognition site screening of a K562 cDNA library with a probe derived from the NFE2 tandem repeat motif of HS2. Even though hMAF shares strong structural homology with the other small Maf proteins in its leucine zipper, it heterodimerizes specifically with Nrf1 and Nrf2 but not with p45-NFE2. As a consequence of heterodimerization, Nrf1 and Nrf2 acquire the ability to bind and stimulate the activity of the target promoters, whereas hMAF homodimers (lacking any activation domain) apparently repress transcription by keeping the heterodimers from binding to their recognition sites.RESULTSThe recognition site probe screening yielded a dozen clones, 10 of which bound with clear specificity to the wild-type but not to the mutated NFE2 probe. Some of these clones have already been reported (37Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar), and here we present the cloning and characterization of one of the remaining clones.cDNA CloningThe primary screening yielded four overlapping cDNA clones of 300, 550, 600, and 1631 base pairs. As expected from an expression cloning procedure, all cDNAs contained a functional DNA binding domain composed of at least four heptads of the leucine zipper motif (51Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). The longest of the cDNAs contained a relatively short open reading frame as well as 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (Fig. 1). Since the 3′-end of the clone terminated with a putative poly(A) tail (a stretch of 23 adenines that was 14 nucleotides downstream from a poly(A) addition signal (TATAAA)), the 3′-untranslated region is likely to be complete. On the other hand, we found an in-frame stop codon within the sequences upstream of the initiation codon that will prevent the upstream extension of the internal open reading frame, confirming that the upstream sequences are truly untranslated and that the cDNA clone encodes a full protein product. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the sequences surrounding the first ATG conform well to the Kozak rule (52Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar) for optimal initiation of translation.Based on these observations the coding region for hMAF begins at nucleotide 190 and terminates at nucleotide 676. Other noteworthy features of the cDNA are the AT richness of the 3′-untranslated region and the presence of several putative destabilization signals (ATTTA). The latter feature suggests that the mRNA may undergo rapid turnover in vivo (53Domen J. Von Lindern M. Hermans A. Breuer M. Grosveld G. Berns A. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 103-112PubMed Google Scholar, 54Luthman H. Soderling-Barros J. Persson B. Engberg C. Stern I. Lake M. Franzen S.A. Israelsson M. Raden B. Lindgren B. Hjelmqvist L. Enerbäck S.

Commun. 1987; 148: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Predicted Protein StructureTranslation of the open reading frame embedded in our cDNA predicts a short protein of 162 amino acids and a molecular mass of 17.9 kDa. Since the amino acid sequence comparison in the protein data base revealed homology with the oncogene v-Maf and especially with the small Maf proteins, the clone was designated hMAF. Similar to the other small Maf proteins, hMAF has a classical bZip domain that takes up most of the protein structure. The leucine zipper is comprised of seven heptad repeats with the D position of the α-helix occupied by five leucines and by two leucine zipper-compatible highly conserved residues, a methionine in the middle and a valine in the terminal heptad. Comparison with the published small Maf protein sequences (Fig. 2) shows the highest degree of homology (93.2%) with the recently cloned chicken MafG (cMafG) (56Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and the lowest homology with the chicken MafF (64%) (41Fujiwara K.T. Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar). Thus even though our clone is referred to as hMAF throughout the text and in the figures, it should be considered the human homologue of cMafG. The evolution of hMAF and cMafG from the other small Maf proteins appears to be driven by an insertion of 14 amino acids C-terminal to the leucine zipper and by a premature termination in the polypeptide chain resulting in the truncation of the last eight residues.Figure 2Alignment of the known members of the small Maf family. The alignment covers the full protein sequences. Identical residues are located in the gray background. Gaps are represented by dashes. The alignment was generated with the Mac DNAsis software (Hitachi) by the Higgins-Sharp algorithm in automatic mode and at the following settings: gap penalty, 20; top diagonals, 10; fixed gap penalty, 4; K-tuple, 2; window size, 5; floating gap penalty, 10. The homology cMafG/hMAF is 93.2%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)hMAF Binding in Solution to the NFE2 Repeat MotifThe full-length and partial clones of hMAF were subcloned into prokaryotic (pET3a, Novagen) and eukaryotic (pcDNAI, Invitrogen) expression verctors flanked by phage RNA polymerase promoters. Proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation and assayed in band-shift experiments for their ability to bind probes derived from the core HS2 enhancer containing either the full NFE2/AP1 tandem repeat or the isolated left and right repeats. In a previous paper (5Moi P. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9000-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) we presented evidence that the most 5′ (left) repeat had a more extended consensus sequence and a higher binding affinity for NFE2 than the 3′ (right) repeat. Thus we postulated that in vivoNFE2 might be mainly recognizing the left repeat, whereas members of the AP1 family were probably binding to the right repeat. Both the full-length hMAF and a shorter protein truncated at amino acid position 110 (hMAFΔ) were able to bind strongly to the NFE2 tandem repeat probe (Fig. 3 A, lane 1, band c and Fig. 3 C, lane 15, band c), whereas binding to a single NFE2 site required the complete hMAF protein (Fig. 3 B, lane 3 and Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 5 and 9 to lane 15, where the truncated hMAFΔ produced band c).Figure 3Band-shift analysis. In panels A, B, C, and E the transcription factors assayed were the products of the in vitrotranslation reactions from reticulocyte lysates. In panel Dnuclear extracts from K562 were compared with in vitrotranslated protein products. fNFE2 and hNFE2 are the protein products of the two splicing variants of the NFE2 gene. The Δ symbol is used to indicate truncated proteins. All probes were derived from the NFE2/AP1 tandem repeat of HS2, which is schematically indicated on thetop of each panel by two linked open rectangles (a broken line rectangle is used to indicate the absence of a single repeat). Unlabeled oligonucleotides used in competition are preceded by opposing arrows (><) and derive from the left repeat (NFE2), the right repeat (AP1), and a mutant left repeat (NFM) carrying a nucleotide substitution that selectively abolishes NFE2 binding. In thelanes marked F the band-shift reactions did not contain any protein extract, whereas in the lanes L orLys they contained extracts of reticulocyte lysates incubated in the absence of DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As the bZIP proteins bind only after dimerization, these results were taken as evidence that hMAF can form stable homodimers and bind DNA in solution. Overall, the binding and competition experiments with the full tandem repeat and with the isolated left and right motifs indicate that hMAF binds with the highest affinity to the full NFE2 tandem repeat and, when tested individually, to the left NFE2 repeat.hMAF Heterodimerizes with Nrf1 and Nrf2Band-shift assays were also performed to assess the ability of hMAF to form heterodimers with the known members of the NFE2/CNC-bZip family. As p45-NFE2, Nrf1, and Nrf2 do not bind the DNA as homodimers and as they all have greater molecular masses than hMAF, the formation of heterodimers was expected to band-shift a second complex with slower mobility than the hMAF homodimer. Fig. 3 A (lanes 2, 5, and7) shows that a second slower mobility complex is indeed formed only when hMAF is mixed and preincubated with Nrf1 and Nrf2 and is never observed when combined with NFE2 (either the fetal (fNFE2) or the adult (hNFE2) splicing isoform (lanes 9 and11)). An even clearer result is obtained when the same experiments are repeated using truncated versions of the hMAF and Nrf1 proteins. An NRF1 cDNA spanning nucleotides 2184–3016 (Nrf1Δ) also cloned through recognition site screening with the tandem repeat probe encodes a shorter polypeptide that acquires the ability to form homodimers in band shifts of the tandem repeat probe (Fig. 3 C, lane 14 and Fig. 3 E,lane 3, band a). Thus Nrf1Δ in combination with the other partial clone hMAFΔ produces any possible species of homo- and heterodimers, greatly simplifying the assignment of the observed bands. The heterodimer hMAFΔ/Nrf1Δ (Fig. 3 C, lane 13 and Fig. 3 E, lane 4, band b) now shows a mobility intermediate between one of the two homodimers Nrf1Δ/Nrf1Δ and hMAFΔ/hMAFΔ (bands a andc, respectively, in Fig. 3 C, lanes 13–15 and Fig. 3 E, lanes 3–5). The appearance of the intermediate mobility complex (Fig. 3 C,lane 13 and Fig. 3 E, lane 4,band b) coincides with the attenuation of the signal corresponding to the hMAFΔ homodimer complex (Fig. 3 C,lane 13 and Fig. 3 E, lane 4,band c), confirming what was previously observed in the interaction between hMAF and Nrf2 (Fig. 3 A, lane 7, band a versus band c). Furthermore, splitting the NFE2 tandem repeat probe in the middle and assaying each NFE2 site separately in band shift shows that the heterodimer binds almost exclusively to the left site (Fig. 3 C, compare band b in lanes 3 and 7), whereas hMAFΔ and Nrf1Δ homodimers bind neither the left nor the right site (Fig.3 C, lanes 4, 5, 8, and9).It is also interesting to note that the complexes formed in band-shift analysis with the in vitro translated Nrf1/hMAF proteins show electrophoretic mobilities comparable to the most abundant complexes obtained with crude nuclear extracts from induced K562 cells (Fig. 3 D, lanes 3 and 4, bands a and b), indicating that Nrf1/hMAF heterodimers may participate in the formation of these complexes, which appear more abundant and migrate slower than the p18/NFE2 complexes (barely seen in these extracts).When the hMAF homodimers and hMAF/Nrf1 heterodimers bound to the tandem repeat are assayed for competition, the left (NFE2) and right (AP1) motifs competed efficiently, whereas the mutant left repeat NFM, which carries a T to G mutation in the NFE2 binding site thought to discriminate specifically among transcription factors NFE2 and AP1 (30Mignotte V. Wall L. de Boer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), was unable to compete (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–6and 8–10). These results indicate that both hMAF homodimers and hMAF/Nrf1 heterodimers have DNA binding affinities identical to the heterodimer p18-NFE2.Glutathione S-Transferase ExperimentsWe wanted to further confirm the selectivity of the hMAF/Nrf1 and hMAF/Nrf2 interactions with an independent assay based on the glutathioneS-transferase fusion analysis. The complete hMAF cDNA fused in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase gene in the vector pGEX2T (Pharmacia) and expressed in bacterial cells was anchored to glutathione-Sepharose beads and assayed for the ability to retain [35S]methionine-labeled Nrf1, Nrf2, NFE2, and hMAF proteins. After stringent washings the only proteins retained in the beads were Nrf1, Nrf2, and hMAF (Fig. 4). Thus the preferential interactions as defined by band-shift assays were confirmed.Figure 4Glutathione S-transferase assay. Denaturing SDS-PAGE of the [35S]methionine-labeled proteins specifically and not specifically retained by the beads of glutathione-Sepharose primed with the GST/hMAF fusion or with the GST protein, respectively, is shown. The same amount of labeled protein assayed in the binding reactions was loaded in the input lanes as a size reference marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Methylation Interference AnalysisA methylation interference assay was performed only for Nrf1Δ and hMAFΔ as they interacted to form any possible combination of homodimers and heterodimers, whereas for Nrf2 we were unable to find any truncation variant that allowed homodimer formation. The bands corresponding to the hMAFΔ/Nrf1Δ heterodimer (Fig. 3 C, lane 13 and Fig.3 E, lane 4, band b) and to the hMAFΔ and Nrf1Δ homodimers (Fig. 3 C, lanes 14 and15 and Fig. 3 E, lanes 3 and4, bands a and c, the latter separated in top and bottom sub-bands) were cut from a preparative gel and subjected to methylation-interference analysis. In the bottom sub-band formed by the Nrf1Δ homodimer (N/NB) the protection of G residues on the tandem NFE2 repeat probe was more pronounced on the left motif, whereas the top sub-band (N/NT) showed protection on both repeats (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and 3). The Nrf1Δ/hMAFΔ heterodimer, on the other hand, produced a unique band with protection restricted to the left motif (Fig. 5 B,lane 4), confirming that it preferentially binds to the 5′ NFE2 site of the tandem repeat. The lack of interference in the right motif may indicate that heterodimers binding to the left motif probably sterically hinder the binding of a second complex to the right motif. The hMAF homodimer (M/M) has an interference pattern that closely resembles that of the hMAF/Nrf1 heterodimers (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1 and 2), confirming a previous observation in which the small subunit of the p18-NFE2 heterodimer drives binding site specificity (40Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pattern of binding interference with the methylated G nucleotides in the sense strand of the HS2 core enhancer is shown. Lane labels correspond to the bands produced by the homodimers hMAFΔ/hMAFΔ (M/M), Nrf1Δ/Nrf1Δ (top band,N/NT), Nrf1Δ/Nrf1Δ (bottom band,N/NB), heterodimers Nrf1Δ/hMAFΔ (N/M), and free DNA (F). On the right side of eachpanel the G nucleotides that interfered with protein binding are represented with open circles for homodimers and withopen squares for heterodimers.

https://openalex.org/W2046276916,"Although the major function of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is cholesterol esterification, our previous studies showed that it can also hydrolyze platelet-activating factor (PAF). Because of the structural similarities between PAF and the truncated phosphatidylcholines (polar PCs) generated during lipoprotein oxidation, we investigated the possibility that LCAT may also hydrolyze polar PCs to lyso-PC during the oxidation of plasma. PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), which is known to hydrolyze polar PCs in human plasma, was completely inhibited by 0.2 mm p-aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Pefabloc), a new serine esterase inhibitor, which had no effect on LCAT at this concentration. On the other hand, 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) completely inhibited LCAT but had no effect on PAF-AH. Polar PC accumulation during the oxidation of plasma increased by 44% in the presence of 0.2 mm Pefabloc and by 30% in the presence of 1 mmDFP. The formation of lyso-PC was concomitantly inhibited by both of the inhibitors. The combination of the two inhibitors resulted in the maximum accumulation of polar PCs, suggesting that both PAF-AH and LCAT are involved in their breakdown. Oxidation of chicken plasma, which has no PAF-AH activity, also resulted in the formation of lyso-PC from the hydrolysis of polar PC, which was inhibited by DFP. Polar PCs, either isolated from oxidized plasma or by oxidation of labeled synthetic PCs, were hydrolyzed by purified LCAT, which had no detectable PAF-AH activity. These results demonstrate a novel function for LCAT in the detoxification of polar PCs generated during lipoprotein oxidation, especially when the PAF-AH is absent or inactivated.

Although it is generally described as a cholesterol-esterifying enzyme because of its well known physiological function, it is in fact a specialized phospholipase A, whose primary substrate is phosphatidylcholine (PC). Unlike the traditional phospholipases A, which transfer an acyl group from the PC to water, it normally transfers the acyl group to unesterified cholesterol, forming cholesteryl ester and lyso-PC. We previously demonstrated that LCAT can also transfer the acyl group from PC to lyso-PC instead of to cholesterol, thus catalyzing a futile cycle of PC-lyso-PC transesterification (3Subbaiah P.V.

Acta. 1993; 1168: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The enzyme does act as a phospholipase A in the absence of an acyl acceptor, releasing the acyl group as a free fatty acid (5Piran U. Nishida T. J. Biochem.

All of the above reactions require the presence of an apoprotein activator, which is believed to facilitate the interaction of the enzyme with the lipid interface. They are also reversibly inhibited by 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), a thiol-blocking agent, which apparently inhibits the reactions by steric hindrance (7Francone O.L. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1716-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to the hydrolysis of the long chain acyl-ester groups of the diacyl PCs, LCAT has been shown to hydrolyze synthetic water-soluble esters (8Bonelli F.S. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14723-14728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the platelet-activating factor (PAF), a highly bioactive phosphoglyceride containing an acetyl group at the sn-2-position (9Liu M.

However, unlike the long chain acyl transfer and hydrolytic reactions, the hydrolysis of the short chain esters by LCAT does not require an apoprotein activator and is not inhibited by DTNB (8Bonelli F.S.

Some of the early products of the lipoprotein oxidation are polar derivatives of PC, which contain a short chain acyl group at the sn-2-position terminating in COOH, CHO, or CH2OH and which are formed by the oxidative fragmentation of the di- and polyunsaturated fatty acids present at thesn-2-position of lipoprotein PC (12Tanaka T. Minamino H. Unezaki S. Tsukatani H. Tokumura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Kamido H. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1876-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these polar PC products have proinflammatory properties similar to PAF, because they can interact with the PAF receptor on various cells (14Smiley P.L. Stremler K.E. Prescott S.M.

Acta. 1988; 962: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The biological activities of the oxidized PCs depend upon the presence of the sn-2 short chain acyl group, because treatment with phospholipase A abolishes their proinflammatory (14Smiley P.L.

Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) effects. The polar phospholipids containing an aldehyde function may also form Schiff-base complexes with the amino groups of the apoproteins and render the lipoproteins more atherogenic (20Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar). Such complexes have in fact been demonstrated in the foam cells from human atherosclerotic lesions (21Itabe H. Takeshima E. Iwasaki H. Kimura J. Yoshida Y. Imanaka T. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15274-15279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid hydrolysis of the oxidized PC products is therefore critical in preventing their proinflammatory and proatherogenic effects. It is generally believed that their hydrolysis is carried out by the PAF acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH), an enzyme that is predominantly associated with LDL in plasma (16Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, this enzyme is not present in the plasma of certain species such as birds (22Cabot M.C. Faulkner L.A. Lackey R.J. Snyder F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 78B: 37-40Google Scholar), and several cases of inherited or acquired deficiencies of the enzyme have been reported in the human population (23Miwa M. Miyake T. Yamanaka T. Sugatani J. Suzuki Y. Sakata S. Araki Y. Matsumoto M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 24Tetta C. Bussolino F. Modena V. Montrucchio G. Segoloni G. Pescarmona G. Camussi G. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1990; 91: 244-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PAF-AH activity of human plasma is rapidly inactivated during the oxidation of LDL (25Liapikos T.A. Antonopolou S. Karabina S.A.P. Tsoukatos D.C. Demopoulos C.A. Tselepis A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Dentan C. Lesnik P. Chapman M.J. Ninio E. Arterioscler.

Invest. 1994; 93: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and it is therefore possible that it cannot account for the hydrolysis of all the oxidized PCs generated during the oxidation of LDL. Our recent investigations on the effect of lipoprotein oxidation on LCAT showed that while its cholesterol esterification activity is destroyed rapidly, its ability to transfer the oxidized acyl group of PC to exogenous lyso-PC is retained or even stimulated (28Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This reaction, which was named lysolecithin acyltransferase II (LAT II), is not dependent upon the presence of an apoprotein activator, and it was insensitive to sulfhydryl blocking agents. On the basis of these results we proposed that LCAT may also hydrolyze the oxidized PC to lyso-PC. The present study provides experimental evidence that LCAT can indeed hydrolyze the oxidized PCs generated during lipoprotein oxidation and that it may account for a significant percentage of the phospholipase A activity found in the plasma following lipoprotein oxidation. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), Pefabloc (4-(2-amino ethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), DTNB, egg PC, cholesterol, and unlabeled sn-1-palmitoyl lyso-PC were purchased from Sigma. AAPH (2,2′-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride) was obtained from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). [4-14C]Cholesterol (33 mCi/mmol), 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl lyso-PC (56.8 mCi/mmol), 2-[3H-acetyl]PAF, and sn-1-palmitoyl 2-linoleoyl [1-14C]PC (50 mCi/mmol) were from DuPont NEN.Sn-1-palmitoyl 2-linoleoyl PC, sn-1-palmitoyl 2-arachidonoyl PC, and PAF were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and sn-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl [1-14C]PC (55 mCi/mol) was from American Radiochemicals (St. Louis, MO). Blood was drawn in EDTA (1.0 mg/ml) from normal healthy volunteers (ages 26–50) who had fasted overnight. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and was used immediately for oxidation studies. Pooled human plasma was also obtained from a local blood bank (United Blood Services) for the purification of LCAT and the preparation of HDL. Chicken blood, which was obtained from a local poultry supply company, was transported at 4 °C to the laboratory and was centrifuged immediately to prepare the plasma. Chicken serum (frozen) was purchased from Sigma for the purification of chicken LCAT. Human LCAT and apolipoprotein A-1 were purified from plasma as described earlier (29Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. Bolan P.J. Paltauf F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The final preparations gave single bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In some cases, partially purified LCAT (after the phenyl-Sepharose step) was used, instead of the highly purified preparation. Chicken LCAT was purified by the same procedure as used for the human enzyme (29Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. Bolan P.J. Paltauf F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that the starting material was frozen serum. LCAT activity was determined by the esterification of labeled free cholesterol to cholesteryl ester using proteoliposome substrate (30Chen C.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described earlier (28Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. Bolan P.J. Paltauf F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LAT II activity was estimated by the esterification of labeled lyso-PC to polar PC, which moves with sphingomyelin on silica gel TLC (28Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 nmol of 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl lyso-PC was dispersed in Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA) and was added to 100 μl of plasma, followed by the addition of 10 mm mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixture, in a final volume of 0.4 ml, was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.0 ml of methanol, and the lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer procedure (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Extracted lipids were separated on silica gel TLC plates using the solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v). Spots corresponding to lyso-PC, PC, and sphingomyelin were scraped, and their radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6500) after adding 0.5 ml of water and 5 ml of scintillation fluid (CytoScint, ICN Biomedical). Quench correction was made by the H number (Beckman Instruments). The radioactivity in the sphingomyelin region represents the LAT II activity (formation of labeled polar PC), whereas the radioactivity in the PC represents LAT I reaction (28Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Control tubes were included in each assay where the reaction was stopped at 0 min. PAF-AH activity was determined by the release of labeled acetate from3H-labeled PAF (9Liu M. Subbaiah P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6035-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 32 nmol of 3H-acetate-labeled PAF in Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer and the enzyme source in a final volume of 0.4 ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 5–30 min, the reaction mixture was extracted (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), and aliquots of the aqueous and chloroform layers were counted in a liquid scintillation counter to determine the radioactivity in free acetate and in the unhydrolyzed PAF, respectively. Oxidation of human or chicken plasma was carried out with varying concentrations of the free radical generator AAPH. For the assay of LCAT and LAT II reactions, 0.1 ml of plasma was diluted with Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer and 2.0 mmDTNB. AAPH (0–60 mm final concentration) dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was added, and oxidation was carried out at 37 °C for varying periods of time. Aliquots of the oxidized plasma were used for the enzyme assays. To determine the effects of inhibitors, 0.2 ml of plasma was oxidized with 50 mm AAPH in the presence of various combinations of 2.0 mm DTNB, 0.2 mm Pefabloc, and 1.0 mm DFP at 37 °C for 16 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.0 ml of methanol containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. Lipids were extracted (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) after acidification to pH 3.0 and separated on silica gel TLC using the solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (65:35:8, v/v/v). The spots corresponding to PC, sphingomyelin, lyso-PC, and origin were scraped into glass tubes, and the lipid phosphorus was estimated by the modified Bartlett procedure (32Marinetti G.V. J. Lipid Res. 1962; 3: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). When labeled PC was oxidized in the presence of whole plasma, the labeled PC was added in ethanol solution (1% of final volume). Human plasma was oxidized with 50 mm AAPH in the presence of 1.0 mm DFP and 0.2 mm Pefabloc, by 50 mm AAPH, for 16 h, at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) after acidification to pH 3.0 with HCl and were separated on silica gel TLC using the solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (65:35:8, v/v/v). The area corresponding to sphingomyelin (and polar PC) was scraped into glass tubes, and the lipids were eluted (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). After evaporation of the solvent, the lipids were redissolved in Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer and were reacted with purified chicken LCAT for 1 h at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted and separated on a silica gel TLC plate, and lipid phosphorus was measured in sphingomyelin (with polar PC) and lyso-PC regions (32Marinetti G.V. J. Lipid Res. 1962; 3: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The percentage of hydrolysis was calculated as the percentage of total lipid phosphorus appearing in the lyso-PC spot. 1 mg of 16:0–20:4 PC or 16:0–18:2 PC, labeled at the sn-2-acyl group (400,000 dpm), was solubilized in normal saline by adding 5 mm sodium deoxycholate. Oxidation was carried out with 50 mm AAPH for 2 h in a final volume of 0.8 ml. Lipids were extracted (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and separated on TLC using a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide, (65:35:8, v/v/v). Spots corresponding to the origin, lyso-PC, sphingomyelin, and PC were scraped, and lipids were extracted again and redispersed in 1.0 ml of Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer. After the determination of lipid phosphorus, 60 nmol of each product (containing 15,000 dpm) was treated with 50 μl of purified chicken LCAT in a total volume of 400 μl, at 37 °C for 1 h. After lipid extraction (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), 0.5 ml of water layer was used for counting radioactivity. The chloroform layer was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and redissolved in 1.0 ml of methanol, from which 0.5 ml was used for counting radioactivity. The hydrolysis of polar PC by chicken LCAT was calculated as the percentage of the counts recovered in aqueous layer after subtraction of the blank (sample incubated in the absence of enzyme). To determine the relative roles of LCAT and PAF-AH in the hydrolysis of oxidized phospholipids we first sought to identify an inhibitor that can specifically inhibit PAF-AH, the enzyme known to carry out this hydrolysis in human plasma (16Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although both PAF-AH and LCAT are serine-dependent enzymes, we found that a recently described inhibitor of PAF-AH, namely Pefabloc (p-aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride) (33Dentan C. Tselepis A.D. Chapman M.J. Ninio E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has no effect on LCAT activity at low concentrations (Fig. 1). Freshly prepared plasma (in EDTA) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of either Pefabloc or DFP, and then the hydrolysis of PAF and the esterification of free cholesterol were studied using exogenous labeled substrates, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The PAF-AH activity of the plasma was almost completely inhibited by Pefabloc at a concentration of 0.1 mm, whereas the LCAT activity was not affected below 1.0 mm concentration (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, DFP, at a concentration of 0.25 mm was sufficient to inhibit most of the cholesterol esterification, while it had no effect on PAF-AH even at 1.0 mm concentration (Fig.1 B). A higher concentration of DFP (>1.0 mm) did inhibit PAF-AH, with the complete inhibition occurring at 10 mm, in accordance with published results (34Steinbrecher U.P. Pritchard P.H. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Sevanian A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Ladu B.N. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 774-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that one can inhibit PAF-AH activity without affecting LCAT, and vice versa. Taking advantage of the differential inhibition of the two enzyme activities, we determined the relative contribution of each for the hydrolysis of polar PC to lyso-PC during lipoprotein oxidation. Freshly prepared human plasma was oxidized for 16 h at 37 °C with 50 mm AAPH in the presence of different inhibitors, and the concentrations of PC, polar PC (with sphingomyelin), and lyso-PC were determined by lipid phosphorus, following their TLC separation. Since lyso-PC is formed by the cholesterol esterification reaction also, we added DTNB (2 mm) to all samples to inhibit this reaction. Our previous results showed that while DTNB inhibits cholesterol esterification, it has no effect on the LAT II reaction (9Liu M. Subbaiah P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6035-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and therefore presumably has no effect on the hydrolysis of oxidized PC also. Our experiments also showed that when isolated plasma sphingomyelin was dispersed in 5 mm sodium deoxycholate and treated with 20 mmAAPH for 16 h at 37 °C, there was no change in its mobility on TLC plate or its phosphorus content, whereas under the same conditions plasma PC was extensively oxidized to polar PC (results not shown). These results demonstrate that the concentration of sphingomyelin is constant during the oxidation of plasma and that any increase in lipid phosphorus in this spot is due to an increase in polar PC. Therefore, we subtracted the sphingomyelin value of control (unoxidized) sample from all of the experimental samples to calculate the increase in polar PC. When the plasma was oxidized with AAPH in the presence of DTNB, there was an increase in the concentration of lyso-PC as well as polar PC with a concomitant decrease in PC concentration (Fig.2). When the PAF-AH activity was inhibited by Pefabloc (0.2 mm) during oxidation, the increase in lyso-PC was inhibited by 62%, and the concentration of polar PC was further increased by 44%, while the decrease in PC was only marginally affected. When LCAT was specifically inhibited by DFP (1 mm), the increase in lyso-PC was inhibited by 67%, and the accumulation of polar PC was increased by 30%, when compared with the plasma that was oxidized in the presence of DTNB alone. As shown above, the PAF-AH activity is almost fully functional at this concentration of DFP. When both LCAT and PAF-AH were inhibited during the oxidation, there was a further increase in the accumulation of polar PC, compared with either inhibitor alone. However, the effect on lyso-PC formation was not additive. A possible reason for this is the presence of some polar PC in the lyso-PC region (see below). These results show that not all of the hydrolysis of polar PC can be attributed to PAF-AH in human plasma and that LCAT (or another DFP-sensitive enzyme) may also contribute to the hydrolysis. Further evidence for the involvement of more than one enzyme in the hydrolysis of polar PC was obtained from the oxidation of labeled 16:0–20:4 PC after its equilibration with plasma PC. The labeled PC, containing [1-14C]arachidonate at thesn-2-position, was first equilibrated with endogenous PC by incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm DTNB. The plasma was then oxidized with 20 mm AAPH for 16 h at 37 °C, in the presence of various inhibitors, and the amount of radioactivity was determined in the lipid and water-soluble products. After the separation of oxidized lipids on TLC plate, four zones, corresponding to PC, sphingomyelin (polar PC), lyso-PC, and origin were counted, as described by Tanaka et al. (12Tanaka T. Minamino H. Unezaki S. Tsukatani H. Tokumura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since the label was present in the sn-2-acyl group, the radioactivity in the lyso-PC region is also due to polar PC products and not lyso-PC itself. Based on the R F values reported by Tanaka et al. (12Tanaka T. Minamino H. Unezaki S. Tsukatani H. Tokumura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we tentatively identified the polar PCs in the sphingomyelin region as the sn-2-monocarboxylate andsn-2-ω-hydroxymonocarboxylate products and those in the lyso-PC region and origin as the sn-2-dicarboxylate products. The counts in the latter two were combined for the presentation (Fig. 3). The radioactivity in the aqueous layer represents the products of hydrolysis of polar PCs. The results show that the radioactivity in labeled polar PC was significantly increased in the presence of either Pefabloc or DFP, as expected, while that in water-soluble products is decreased. The decrease in aqueous products was greater in the presence of Pefabloc, compared with DFP. However, the combination of the two inhibitors did not decrease water-soluble radioactive products any further, although the increase in polar PC was additive. Since the combination of the two inhibitors resulted in significantly greater accumulation of polar PC than either inhibitor alone, these results show that both enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of polar PCs. Similar results were obtained when the 2-acyl-labeled 16:0–18:2 was oxidized in the presence of whole plasma. However, the percentage of radioactivity appearing in the aqueous layer was much lower, and the percentage of label in the lyso-PC region was higher (results not shown). The presence of label in the lyso-PC region indicates that some of the lipid phosphorus estimated as lyso-PC in the previous experiment (Fig.2) is actually polar PC, and we may have overestimated the lyso-PC in these experiments. This may account for the lack of complete inhibition of lyso-PC formation even in the presence of the two inhibitors, because the polar PC actually increases in the presence of inhibitors.

Membrane glycerophospholipids, once thought to serve only as structural components of the cell, are now known to play central roles in a host of signal transduction pathways.

TNFα is a pleiotropic cytokine, which has a central role in mediating immune regulation and inflammatory response via binding to its 55- and 75-kDa membrane receptors, termed TNFR-1 and TNFR-2, respectively (for review, see Refs. 15Smith C.A.

Recent studies have shed some light on the upstream events that may mediate a common death signaling pathway for both TNF and Fas involving recruitment of the death domain-associated protein FADD (18Chinnaiyan A.M.

TNFα and Fas also both induce sphingomyelinase activation and the generation of ceramide, which can induce apoptosis and may play a role in apoptotic signaling by these cytokines (7Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 8Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y.

TNFα is additionally known to activate the transcription factor NF-κB (21Osborn L. Kunkel W. Nabel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 22Lowenthal J.W. Ballard D.W. Bogerd H. Böhnlein E. Greene W.C. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3121-3128PubMed Google Scholar) which is thought to mediate the TNFα-induced expression of a variety of genes including the IL-2 receptor. NF-κB belongs to the Rel family of transcription factors and in its inactive state exists in the cytosol as a heterodimer bound to the inhibitory complex I-κB (for review, see Refs. 23Grilli M. Chiu J.J. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar and 24Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). Stimulation at the cell surface by cytokines such as TNFα and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or by lipopolysaccharide initiates a poorly understood set of signaling events, which result in the phosphorylation and degradation of I-κB, thus allowing the free NF-κB dimer to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of κB-responsive elements (25Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The TNF receptor-associated proteins TRADD and TRAF-2 have been implicated in signaling to NF-κB by TNFR-1 (27Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 28Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether ceramide generated in response to TNFα is involved in NF-κB activation. Some studies have suggested an essential role for this lipid second messenger in NF-κB activation and a dependence on ceramide generated by acid sphingomyelinase activity in particular (29Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 30Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, other studies have provided evidence against a role for ceramide in this signaling pathway (12Dbaibo G.S. Obeid L.M Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17762-17766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Betts J.C. Agranoff A.B. Nabel G.J. Shayman J.A. J. Biol.

Aggarwal B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in the current study we sought to clarify the potential role of ceramide in the TNFα and Fas mechanisms of NF-κB activation. In this study, we demonstrate that cell-permeable analogs of ceramide were unable to induce either I-κB degradation or nuclear translocation of NF-κB in intact Jurkat T cells. Likewise, treatment of cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase, which has been shown to increase intracellular ceramide levels via cleavage of membrane sphingomyelin (36Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), failed to activate NF-κB. TNFα remained a potent activator of NF-κB in cells from a patient with Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPA), which lack acid sphingomyelinase activity (37Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,38Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2601-2624Google Scholar). Treatment of Jurkat T cells with cross-linking antibodies to APO-1/Fas caused both a marked increase in intracellular ceramide levels and apoptosis. However, Fas was unable to signal nuclear translocation of NF-κB at early or late time points. Pretreatment of Jurkat cells with YVAD.CMK, a site-specific inhibitor of ICE-like proteases (39Cain K. Inayat-Hussein S.H. Couet C. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), inhibited both Fas-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis, but not TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. Furthermore, in Jurkat cells treated with TNFα, we observed no increase in intracellular ceramide formation in the time course needed for activation of NF-κB (1–10 min). Thus, Fas induced intracellular ceramide increases in an ICE-like protease-dependent manner without activating NF-κB, whereas TNFα activated NF-κB within minutes independent of ceramide and ICE-like proteases. Finally, we show that ceramide inhibits PMA-induced activation of NF-κB. Taken together, these lines of evidence strongly suggest that ceramide is a specific component of apoptotic signaling pathways and not of the pathways leading to NF-κB activation. Jurkat T cells were obtained from ATCC, Rockville, MD. Niemann-Pick A and normal skin fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Institute (National Institute on Aging). TNFα was a kind gift from Dr. Phil Pekala (East Carolina University). Anti-Fas monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase was purchased from Sigma. C2- and C6-ceramide were synthesized as described (2Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Poly(dI·dC) and poly(dN6) were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Anti-NF-κB monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-I-κB monoclonal antibody was purchased from Rockland, Inc. YVAD.CMK (Bachem Bioscience, King of Prussia, PA) was dissolved in Me2SO before addition to medium (final Me2SO concentration 0.2%, v/v), and appropriate solvent controls were used. Jurkat (acute lymphocytic T cell leukemia) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Niemann-Pick type A skin fibroblasts and normal skin fibroblasts were grown in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at densities between 2 × 105 and 1.2 × 106 cells/ml under standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). Treatment with bacterial sphingomyelinase was carried out as described (35Higuchi M. Singh S. Jaffrezou J.P. Aggarwal B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear extraction procedure was modified from Dignam (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) and Osborn (21Osborn L. Kunkel W. Nabel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). After treatments, medium was removed and approximately 107 cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was rapidly frozen in dry ice and ethanol and then thawed by resuspending in 100 μl of ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) resulting in approximately 100% lysis. The nuclei were pelleted by microcentrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclei were suspended in 15 μl of Buffer C (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was mixed gently for 20 min at 4 °C, and then microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted with 40–70 μl of Buffer D (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay. Reactions were performed in a 20-μl volume, using 8–10 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 1 μg of poly(dN)6, and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin. Incubations were in the presence of HDKE buffer with the following final concentrations: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. 1 μl of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (20,000–50,000 cpm) was added to each reaction. After incubation for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 6 μl of 15% Ficoll solution containing indicator dyes. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of antibody was added to appropriate samples, which were then incubated for 1 h on ice prior to addition of Ficoll solution. Equal amounts of the reaction mixture were loaded on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE and were run at 200 V. Gels were transferred to Whatman filter paper, dried at 80 °C for 2 h, and exposed to film at −80 °C for 4–12 h. The probe utilized was a synthetic NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide with the following sequence: 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. It was end-labeled using T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The mutant oligonucleotide used in competition experiments had the following sequence: 5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. After treatments were carried out, cytosolic extracts from Jurkat cells were prepared by washing 107 cells in ice-cold PBS and resuspending pellet in ice-cold homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% leupeptin, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The cells were then lysed by sonication and ultracentrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C to separate cytosolic from nuclear and membrane components. An aliquot of the supernatant was removed for protein determination, and the remainder of the supernatant was mixed (1:1) with 2 × sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples containing equivalent amounts of protein were then analyzed by Western blot analysis using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) by Amersham. Jurkat T cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml and treated for the indicated times as described. Cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar); lipids were dried and resuspended in 1 ml of chloroform. Duplicate aliquots of 100 μl were set aside for phosphate measurements (42Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), and 100 μl was utilized in the Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase assay as modified for ceramide (43Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Van Veldhoven P.P. Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ceramide was quantitated by using external standards and was normalized to phosphate. Niemann-Pick fibroblasts were washed with PBS and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to attain a final concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were lysed via three cycles of freezing and thawing. Homogenate was obtained by centrifuging the total cell lysate for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C. Sphingomyelinase activity was assayed in all fractions using 14C-labeled sphingomyelin as described (45Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether TNFα-induced ceramide generation is a sufficient signal for NF-κB activation, Jurkat T cells were treated with varying concentrations of synthetic cell-permeable ceramide analogs and were then assayed for nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 1, A and B). These cell-permeable analogs have been shown to mimic the cytotoxic (apoptotic) effects of TNFα at micromolar concentrations (7Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). However, neither C2- nor C6-ceramide was able to induce nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB as compared with untreated and TNFα-treated controls over both short and extended time courses. To evaluate the possibility that endogenously generated ceramide may provide a signal that the synthetic analogs lack, cells were treated with bacterial sphingomyelinase (Fig. 1 C). Incubation of leukemic cell lines with bacterial sphingomyelinase has been shown to result in the hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin and the generation of intracellular ceramide in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (36Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this treatment likewise failed to signal nuclear translocation of NF-κB in Jurkat T cells. Activation of NF-κB was also studied by using Western blot analysis of its cytosolic inhibitor, I-κBα. Upon treatment of cells with a variety of inducers of NF-κB, I-κBα is phosphorylated and proteolyzed, thereby releasing NF-κB and allowing the free heterodimer to enter the nucleus and bind to target gene promoter regions (23Grilli M. Chiu J.J. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 24Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). I-κBα proteolysis has been shown to be a necessary regulated step in the activation of NF-κB by TNFα (25Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Treatment of Jurkat T cells with TNFα resulted in proteolysis of I-κBα within 10 min (data not shown), and after 30 min near-complete proteolysis of the band was observed (Fig.2). Treatment with varying concentrations of cell-permeable ceramide and bacterial sphingomyelinase did not induce I-κBα proteolysis as compared with untreated control (Fig. 2), further suggesting the divergence of ceramide-mediated pathways from the signaling events leading to NF-κB activation. TNFα signaling through the 55-kDa receptor has been shown to result in activation of sphingomyelinase with both neutral and acidic pH optima, and there has been evidence that a ceramide signal generated by the acid sphingomyelinase in particular is a necessary and sufficient signal for NF-κB activation (29Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). To more closely evaluate the possible role of acid sphingomyelinase in this pathway, we studied skin fibroblasts from a patient with Niemann-Pick disease type A, a lysosomal storage disease characterized at the cellular level by complete lack of acid sphingomyelinase activity and clinically by pathological sphingomyelin accumulation (37Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2601-2624Google Scholar). To confirm the phenotype of the cell line, post-nuclear extracts from the Niemann-Pick fibroblasts and from age-matched normal skin fibroblasts were assayed for sphingomyelinase activity in neutral and acidic pH ranges (Table I). The Niemann-Pick fibroblast line completely lacked acid sphingomyelinase activity and displayed only a small amount of neutral sphingomyelinase activity, while the normal skin fibroblast line displayed acid and neutral sphingomyelinase activities of 49.25 and 2.50 nmol/mg protein/h, respectively. Despite a complete lack of acid sphingomyelinase activity in the Niemann-Pick fibroblasts, the TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB remained unimpaired as compared with controls (Fig. 3 A). Nuclear translocation was evident within 15 min of treatment with TNFα. Therefore, the kinetics of NF-κB activation in the enzymatically deficient fibroblast line are identical to those seen in the skin fibroblast controls and in Jurkat and other hematopoietic cell lines. The specificity of NF-κB activation by TNFα in the Niemann-Pick fibroblasts is shown in Fig. 3 B. A monoclonal antibody specific for the p65 subunit of the NF-κB dimer caused retardation of the TNFα-induced band, resulting in a characteristic “supershift,” whereas an anti-c-Rel monoclonal antibody did not cause a supershift (lanes 3 and4). Specificity was further demonstrated by competitive washout of the band by addition of excess cold κB consensus oligonucleotide and the inability of mutant κB oligonucleotide to compete with the band (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and6). This evidence suggests that activation of acid sphingomyelinase is not a required step in the signaling pathway linking TNFα binding at the cell surface to the activation of NF-κB.Table IAcid and neutral sphingomyelinase activities in Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPA) and normal human skin fibroblastsNPANormal skin fibroblastsAcid sphingomyelinase1-anmol/mg protein/h.049.27Neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase1-anmol/mg protein/h.0.252.50Cells were harvested and enzyme activities measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a nmol/mg protein/h.

Other evidence has implicated ceramide as a downstream effector of the apoptotic pathway; treatment of SKW6.4 cells with a monoclonal cross-linking antibody has been shown to result in activation of membrane bound neutral sphingomyelinase and a subsequent 2–3-fold increase in intracellular ceramide levels within 16 h of treatment (13Tepper C.G.

In the present study, we treated Jurkat T cells with anti-Fas antibodies and observed a greater than 5-fold increase in ceramide levels over control within 12 h and a greater than 7-fold increase over control within 20 h as assessed by diacylglycerol kinase assay (Fig. 4 A). At the concentrations studied, anti-Fas antibody induced 80–90% cell death after 24 h (data not shown). TNFα induces a well characterized activation of NF-κB in Jurkat and other hematopoietic cell lines (21Osborn L. Kunkel W. Nabel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A combination of genomic, cDNA. and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques was used to isolate the carboxyl-terminal end of MUC6. The 3′ nontandem repeat region contained 1083 base pairs of coding sequence (361 amino acids) followed by 632 base pairs of 3′-untranslated region. The coding sequence consists of two distinct regions; region 1 contained the initial 270 amino acids (62% Ser-Thr-Pro with no Cys residues), and region 2 contained the COOH-terminal 91 amino acids (22% Ser-Thr-Pro with 12% Cys). Although region 1 had no homology to any sequences in GenBank, region 2 had approximately 25% amino acid homology to the COOH-terminal regions of human mucins MUC2, -5, and -5B and von Willebrand factor. The shortness of region 2 would leave little of the peptide backbone exposed to a potentially hostile environment. Antibody studies suggest that MUC6 in its native form exists as a disulfide-bonded multimer. The conservation of the 11 cysteine positions in region 2 suggests the importance of this short region to mucin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2019054621,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) supports the survival and differentiation of distinct populations of peripheral and central neurons. NGF binds to two classes of cell-surface receptors, the protein tyrosine kinase TrkA and the smaller p75 receptor lacking intrinsic catalytic activity. It has been suggested that both receptors are required for NGF high affinity binding, although TrkA appears to be sufficient for transducing most of the biological effects of NGF. Some evidence suggests that p75 could play a modulatory role on TrkA activation by an as yet unknown mechanism. In this study, we have investigated functional roles of p75 using a purified triple mutant NGF (triNGF) deficient in p75 binding but retaining significant TrkA binding and activation. The mutant was found to be as potent as wild type NGF at promoting survival of serum-deprived TrkA-expressing fibroblasts. On developing chick sensory neurons, survival responses to mutant and native NGF were indistinguishable when assayed at nanomolar concentrations. However, triNGF was 3- to 4-fold less potent than wild type NGF at lower concentrations (i.e. 10−11m). Interestingly, in PC12 cells coexpressing TrkA and p75, no high affinity binding sites for triNGF could be detected. The reduced responsiveness to triNGF in sensory neurons was increasingly evident at later developmental stages; late embryonic neurons did not respond at all to concentrations of triNGF that were saturating at earlier developmental stages. Likewise, although no difference could be seen between wild type and mutant NGF on the survival responses of embryonic rat superior cervical ganglion sympathetic neurons, the mutant was much less potent than native NGF on postnatal sympathetic neurons. In sensory neurons, the decrease in responsiveness to triNGF correlated with a developmental reduction in the expression of both p75 and TrkA. Thus, NGF binding to p75 enhances responsiveness to ligand, particularly when this is present at limiting concentrations. During development, p75 modulates responsiveness to NGF so that binding to p75 becomes increasingly important in neurons undergoing a down-regulation of NGF receptors. These results support a ligand-dependent modulatory role for p75 in NGF-mediated neuron survival consistent with p75 functioning as a TrkA regulator and/or signaling receptor.

Neurotrophins are structurally and functionally related trophic factors involved in the development, survival, and maintenance of vertebrate neurons. In mammals four members have been characterized to date, nerve growth factor (NGF), 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; triNGF, triple mutant nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NT-, neurotrophin-; wt, wild type; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; SCG, superior cervical ganglion. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) (1Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Each neurotrophin supports distinct neuronal populations in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The main targets of NGF are sympathetic neurons as well as subpopulations of sensory and central neurons. On NGF-responsive neurons, 125I-NGF binding studies have shown two distinct classes of binding sites that differ in their affinity, a major class with a K d of 10−9m and a less abundant class with aK d of 10−11m (2Rodriguez-Tébar A. Dechant G. Gotz R. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 3Sutter A. Riopelle R.J. Harris-Warrick R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5972-5982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NGF association for both sites is very fast, being close to diffusion limited. However, the rate of dissociation differs markedly, being fast for the low affinity and slow for the high affinity site (4Schechter A.L. Bothwell M.A. Cell. 1981; 24: 867-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The dose-response curves for neurotrophin-induced effects on neurons together with the finding that NGF expression in vivo is in the picomolar range have suggested that most biological effects are mediated by high affinity receptors (5Meakin S.O. Shooter E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 6Barde Y.A. Edgar D. Thoenen H. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Intensive research eventually led to the identification of genes encoding two structurally unrelated classes of cell-surface receptors interacting with the neurotrophins, the common neurotrophin receptor p75 and members of the protein tyrosine kinase receptor family Trks. p75 is a transmembrane glycoprotein distantly related to the tumor necrosis factor receptor, CD40 and Fas/APO-1, and contains a short cytoplasmic tail lacking any known catalytic activity. p75 binds to all neurotrophins with equal affinity although with different rate constants (2Rodriguez-Tébar A. Dechant G. Gotz R. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 7Rodriguez-Tébar A. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1990; 4: 487-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Cells expressing only p75 display a single NGF-binding site with a K d of ≈10−9m and fast association and dissociation kinetics. p75 therefore exhibits the characteristics of the fast binding site found in NGF-responsive cells. Trks are single membrane spanning receptors with a large cytoplasmic domain that is autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon ligand binding. Binding and activation of different Trk receptors by neurotrophins is ligand-specific, i.e. NGF activates TrkA, BDNF and neurotrophin-4 activate TrkB, and neurotrophin-3 is the preferred ligand of TrkC. TrkA displays some of the properties of the high affinity NGF-binding site, most notably a slow dissociation of NGF (8Meakin S.O. Suter U. Drinkwater C.C. Welcher A.A. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2374-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, TrkA also shows binding characteristics that are not consistent with the kinetics of the slow site seen in neurons. The association rate of NGF to TrkA is slow, resulting in a K d of ≈10−9m. Several models have been proposed to account for the molecular composition of the high affinity binding site. Hempsteadet al. (9Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) and Kaplan et al. (10Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) have postulated that NGF binds to either TrkA or p75 with low affinity, whereas co-expression of both receptors results in formation of high affinity binding sites. In contrast, equilibrium binding analyses demonstrated that a small number of high affinity binding sites are also present on fibroblasts expressing high amounts of TrkA in the absence of p75 (11Klein R. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), and Jing et al. (12Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) found that co-expression of p75 on fibroblasts expressing TrkA did not increase the number of high affinity binding sites. Importantly, more recent experiments have demonstrated the importance of a high p75 to TrkA ratio for the generation of NGF binding sites with the kinetic properties of the receptors seen in neurons and NGF-responsive cell lines (13Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of Trks clearly demonstrates that Trks can function as signaling receptors. In agreement with this, several studies have confirmed that Trks are both necessary and sufficient to mediate many of the effects elicited by neurotrophins (for a review see Ref. 14Lewin G.R. Barde Y.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for null mutations in genes encoding neurotrophins and cognate Trks display striking similarities in their phenotypes, demonstrating that in vivo the neurotrophins mediate, to a large extent, their effects through activation of Trk receptors. Mutant animals display severe abnormalities in the nervous system, and most die shortly after birth, underlining the functional importance of these molecules during development. The p75 null mutant animals display a less severe phenotype, with p75 −/− mice living to several months of age but with reduced fertility. In addition mutant mice display significant abnormalities in developing sensory and sympathetic neurons (15Lee K.-F. Li E. Huber L.J. Landis S.C. Sharpe A.H. Chao M.V. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 737-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). p75 has been proposed to be involved in retrograde transport of neurotrophins (16Johnson E.M.J. Taniuchi M. Clark H.B. Springer J.E. Koh S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 923-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ligand discrimination (17Clary D.O. Reichard L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, recent in vitro studies have shown that binding of NGF to p75 can stimulate sphingomyelin hydrolysis (24Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and activation of the transcription factor NFκB (25Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhäuser N. Böhm-Mattei R. Baeuerle P. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) in some non-neuronal cells in culture. p75 has also been suggested to play a modulatory role on signaling through TrkA. Absence of p75 or blocking of NGF binding to p75 reduces the responsiveness of several TrkA-mediated effects, including tyrosine autophosphorylation and cell differentiation (26Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Ibáñez C.F. Persson H. Kaplan D.R. Benedetti M. Chao M.V. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 27Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Moreover, neurons from trigeminal and superior cervical ganglia of p75 −/− mice show a shifted NGF dose-response curve at later stages of development (28Lee K.L. Davies A.M. Jaenisch R. Development. 1994; 120: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Davies A.M. Lee K.L. Jaenisch R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 565-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Taken together, results from immortalized cell lines and gene knock-out animals suggest that p75 affects NGF dosage sensitivity. While several models have been proposed to explain how p75 could function in this context, the molecular mechanism(s) is still unclear. In the present study, we probed the possible roles of p75 on survival responses of normal neurons using a purified mutant NGF where p75 binding had been selectively abolished by mutation of exposed charged residues (30Ibáñez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These mutations, however, did not affect TrkA binding and activation. By comparing the biological effects elicited by native and mutant NGF on different responsive cells, the relative contribution of NGF-p75 interactions to NGF-dependent neuron survival can be investigated. Our results indicate that during development, p75 expression becomes increasingly important in regulating neuronal responsiveness to NGF. Expression of p75 could enable the individual neuron to respond adequately to low ligand concentrations or decreased receptor levels, thus improving the probability of survival in the developmental competition for trophic support. The generation of MG-87-NIH3T3 TrkA fibroblasts, kindly provided by George Yancopoulos, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., has previously been described (31Glass D.J. Nye S.H. Hantzopoulos P.

Anti-pan Trk and anti-p75 rabbit polyclonal antisera were a gift from David Kaplan, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD. A 771-base pair EcoRI fragment encoding mutant NGF (K32A + K34A + E35A) was introduced in baculovirus using a kit of reagents from CLONTECH. A recombinant virus clone was used for production of mutant NGF in insect cells, and protein was purified essentially as described previously (32Rydén M. Murray-Rust J. Glass D. Ilag L.L. Trupp M. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald N.Q. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and silver staining showed that triNGF preparations displayed >90% purity. Wild type NGF and triNGF were labeled with 125I-Na (Amersham Corp.) by the lactoperoxidase method as described previously (33Ibáñez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Steady-state competitive bindings were performed at 4 °C as described previously (34Rydén M. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5623-5627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Saturation bindings were performed in triplicate wells with 106 cells/ml and serial dilutions of radioiodinated factors in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml glucose. Cell pellets were counted in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was measured in parallel incubations to which a 3–500-fold molar excess of unlabeled wtNGF was added, and all results were corrected for this nonspecific binding. MG-87-NIH3T3 TrkA cells or A875 human melanoma cells expressing high levels of p75 were affinity labeled with radioiodinated ligand and chemically cross-linked using either N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (Pierce). Receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated overnight at +4 °C in the presence of proteinase inhibitors and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screens at −70 °C. Dissociated chick DRG neurons from different developmental stages were affinity labeled with 1 nm125I-NGF, followed by chemical cross-linking with sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (Pierce). 100 or 350 μg of protein (determined by the Bradford method) from each reaction was then separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screens at −70 °C. Chick dorsal root ganglia were homogenized in 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate and β-mercaptoethanol, and RNA was isolated as described previously. (35Trupp M. Rydén M. Jörnvall H. Timmusk T.

Fragments derived from chick TrkA (kindly provided by Pantelis Tsoulfas, NCI) and chick p75 (36Ernfors P. Hallböök F. Ebendal T. Shooter E.M. Radeke M.J. Misko T.P. Persson H. Neuron. 1988; 1: 983-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pBS KS+ (Stratagene). Riboprobes were generated from linearized plasmids using either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) and [32P]αCTP. Equal amounts of total RNA (5 μg) were analyzed by RNase protection assay according to manufacturer's instructions (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). To control for differences in RNA loading a chick glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase riboprobe (a kind gift from Finn Hallböök, Biomedicinskt Centrum, Uppsala, Sweden) labeled at low specific activity was added to each sample for subsequent standardization. Samples were separated in 5% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, dried, and exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screens at −70 °C. Autoradiograms were analyzed with an image analysis system (Leica); for quantification, all samples signals were standardized using the signal obtained with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe. Biological activities in TrkA-expressing MG87-NIH3T3 fibroblasts were assayed as described previously (34Rydén M. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5623-5627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a 96-well plate 20,000 cells/well were incubated in serial dilutions of native or mutant NGF in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). After a 4-day incubation, cellular acid phosphatase was measured using a kit of reagents fromCLONTECH. Neurotrophin-mediated survival and proliferation were expressed in units of optical density measured at 405 nm. Dissociated neurons from dorsal root and superior cervical ganglia were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (1:1) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, glutamine, and antibiotics. DRG cells were preplated on plastic for 2 h in order to enrich for neurons. 24-Well plates coated with poly-l-ornithine and laminin were seeded at a density of 105 cells/well in the presence of serial dilutions of factors. Neuronal survival was determined after 48–72 h by phase contrast microscopy, scoring the number of surviving neurons in a defined area of triplicate wells. A mutant NGF with Lys-32, Lys-34, and Glu-35 replaced by Ala (triNGF) was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf-21 insect cells and purified to homogeneity by a combination of ion exchange, size exclusion, and reverse phase chromatographies. The binding properties of purified triNGF to p75-expressing A875 melanoma cells and TrkA-expressing fibroblasts were in agreement with a previous report using protein from conditioned media of transiently transfected COS cells (30Ibáñez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The mutant showed a 70-fold reduction in binding to p75 expressed on A875 cells (wild type NGF IC50 2.57 nm; triNGF IC50 153 nm) (Fig.1 A), while binding to TrkA was comparable to native NGF (wild type NGF IC50 1.53 nm; triNGF IC50 2.43 nm) (Fig. 1 B). Receptor binding was also assessed by affinity labeling and chemical cross-linking. Ligand-receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated using antisera against either TrkA or p75 and separated by SDS-PAGE.125I-NGF was efficiently cross-linked to TrkA expressed on 3T3-TrkA cells and to p75 monomers and dimers on A875 cells (Fig.1 C, lane 1 and 5). 125I-triNGF was cross-linked to TrkA to a comparable extent (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). However, triNGF bound 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently to p75 (Fig. 1 C, lane 6), in agreement with the competition binding assays and confirming the TrkA selectivity of the mutant.Figure 1TriNGF lacks binding to p75 but retains wild-type binding to TrkA. A and B, steady-state competitive binding assays were performed in the presence of125I-NGF and increasing concentrations of either wtNGF (filled squares) or triNGF (open squares) on cells expressing p75 (A875 human melanoma cells, A) or TrkA (MG-87-NIH3T3 TrkA, B). TriNGF displayed a 70-fold decrease in IC50 compared with wtNGF on p75 expressing cells but retained a virtually unimpaired binding to TrkA. C, radioiodinated wt- and triNGF were used to affinity label TrkA (MG-87-NIH3T3 TrkA, lanes 1–4) or p75 (A875 human melanoma cells, lanes 5 and 6) expressing cells. Ligand-receptor complexes were chemically cross-linked usingN-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, respectively, immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Where indicated cold NGF was used as a control for specific binding.

In serum-free medium, these cells can survive and proliferate in response to NGF, in a dose-dependent manner that is readily quantifiable. Wild type NGF and triNGF were equally effective at stimulating a proliferative response in these cells starting at 7 ng/ml (≈0.3 nm) (Fig. 2), showing that the binding of the mutant to TrkA resulted in normal receptor activation and downstream signaling. We next investigated whether loss of p75 binding affected the interaction of triNGF with high and low affinity binding sites on PC12 cells expressing both p75 and TrkA receptors. Saturation binding assays were performed at equilibrium using purified radioiodinated ligands. In agreement with previous reports (37Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), Scatchard transformation of the data showed that native NGF bound to two distinct classes of binding sites, a high affinity site of K d 3 × 10−11m and a low affinity site ofK d 3 × 10−9m (Fig.3 A). In contrast, 125I-triNGF displayed only low affinity binding with K d 4.3 × 10−9m (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that interaction with high affinity receptors requires NGF binding to p75. In an effort to clarify the role of p75 in physiologically relevant cells, we studied the effects of wild type and mutant NGF on primary cultures of NGF-responsive neurons. We reasoned that given the comparable TrkA activation profile of the two ligands, differences in biological activity could be attributed to the inability of triNGF to bind to p75. We compared survival-promoting activities of native and mutant NGF in dissociated cultures of embryonic day 9 (E9) chicken dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressing both p75 and TrkA receptors. In this assay, triNGF showed a close to wild type dose-response relationship at concentrations above 0.3 ng/ml (≈12 pm) (Fig.4). Below this concentration, however, the mutant NGF was clearly impaired in its biological potency; at 40 pg/ml (≈1.5 pm), triNGF rescued less than 10% of the neurons surviving in the presence of equivalent concentrations of native NGF. The shift in responsiveness occurred at concentrations corresponding to the dissociation constant of high affinity binding of NGF to these cells (37Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J.

Previous studies have shown a reduced survival response to NGF during development in neurons of p75 −/− mice (28Lee K.L. Davies A.M. Jaenisch R. Development. 1994; 120: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Davies A.M. Lee K.L. Jaenisch R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 565-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, those studies could not establish whether NGF responsiveness was dependent on the mere presence of p75 on the cell membrane or whether NGF binding to p75 was also required. In addition, they could not rule out differences in the neurons secondary to the loss of p75. We investigated the responsiveness of chicken DRG neurons prepared from embryos of different developmental stages ranging from E7 to E18 to a concentration of native and mutant NGF (5 ng/ml) which was saturating at early times of development (see Fig. 4). At early embryonic stages (E7–E11), triNGF was comparable to wtNGF; both proteins were able to rescue close to 100% of the plated neurons at 5 ng/ml. At later developmental stages, increasing numbers of DRG neurons became NGF-independent and survived in the absence of any added factor (Fig.5 A, solid circles). At E18, 50% of the neurons plated still depended on exogenous NGF for survival. However, the reduction in responsiveness was dramatic for the mutant NGF; at E14 30–40% less of the plated neurons responded to this molecule compared with native NGF, and at later stages, the response to triNGF was virtually null (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, the mutant NGF displays a substantially reduced bioactivity at later stages in DRG development, indicating that not only expression of but also binding to p75 is required for normal NGF responsiveness during sensory neuron development. We also studied sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) of the rat, which undergo naturally occurring cell death during early postnatal development (38Wright L.L. Cunninham T.J. Smolen A.J. J. Neurocytol. 1983; 12: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Survival dose-response relationships were studied for wild type and mutant NGF at two developmental stages, E16.5 and postnatal day 2 (P2). At E16.5, no difference in potency or efficacy could be observed between mutant and native NGF, even at low concentrations (Fig. 6 A). However, on P2 SCG neurons, a clear reduction in biological activity was detected for the mutant NGF at concentrations below 1 ng/ml (Fig. 6 B), again indicating that binding of NGF to p75 is essential for survival of NGF-dependent peripheral neurons during later stages of development. p75 and TrkA mRNA levels were measured by RNase protection assay in chick DRG neurons at two different stages of development marking the beginning and the ending of the switch in responsiveness to the mutant NGF, i.e. E8 and E16, respectively. Prior to homogenization, DRG cells were dissociated, and neurons were enriched by pre-plating in uncoated plastic dishes. The levels of mRNA expression of both TrkA and p75 in chick DRG neurons were found to decrease from E8 to E16 (Fig. 7,A and B). The decrease in TrkA and p75 mRNA levels was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the levels of surface receptors as demonstrated by affinity labeling with125I-NGF followed by chemical cross-linking (Fig.7 C). Despite the developmental reduction in the absolute levels of NGF receptors, the relative levels of expression of TrkA and p75 did not show a significant change. In rodent SCG neurons, on the other hand, p75 and TrkA mRNA levels have been reported to increase during development (39Wyatt S. Davies A.M. J. Cell Biol."

The binding of multiple fibroblast growth factors by heparin may be necessary for dimerization of the FGF receptor. Analytical ultracentrifugation of FGF-2 in the presence of heparin-derived saccharides shows that both an active heparin octasaccharide and an inactive heparin-like disaccharide induce fibroblast growth factor-2 self-association. Analysis of the data indicates that the heparin octasaccharide induces a monomer-dimer-tetramer assembly of FGF-2 while the disaccharide induces a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Evidence is presented indicating that the dimer conformation induced by the heparin octasaccharide is a side by side dimer with the FGF-2 molecules cis to the heparin, while the disaccharide-induced dimer is a head to head dimer in which FGF-2 molecules are trans to the ligand. These results, combined with previous studies, support the model that formation of a specific side by side heparin-induced FGF-2 dimer is required for activation of the FGF receptor.

Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; HS, heparin or heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; FGF-1, fibroblast growth factor-1; HS-8, sulfated heparin octasaccharide; SOS, sucrose octasulfate; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; EGF, epidermal growth factor. is a cytokine whose biological activity is dependent on heparin or heparan sulfate (HS, collectively) (1Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The binding of FGF-2 and heparin to the FGF receptor (FGFR) activates a signal transduction cascade, eventually stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Cells that are activated by FGF-2 require two classes of receptors: low-affinity receptors which are heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and high-affinity receptors which are transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (2Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The heparin or HSPG low-affinity receptors are thought to bind to FGF initially and present FGF to the FGF receptor (3Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar), leading to a ternary FGF·HS·FGFR complex that can then activate the FGF signal transduction pathway (1Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). It has been shown that activation of the FGF signal transduction pathway occurs upon dimerization of the FGF tyrosine kinase receptor and transphosphorylation of each kinase domain (4Bellot F. Crumley G. Kaplow J.M. Schlessinger J. Jaye M. Dionne C.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2849-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The role of heparin in activating the FGF signaling pathway is unclear. Heparin has been shown to interact with the FGF receptor directly (5Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and may facilitate the formation of a high-affinity FGF·FGFR complex by bridging the two proteins and binding to each (6Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Another model is that heparin may activate the FGFR by binding several FGFs, thereby recruiting two cell-surface FGFRs and promoting transphosphorylation of the FGFR kinase domains (1Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Heparin has been shown to bind multiple FGF molecules (1Ornitz D.M.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that one FGF molecule can bind per every 4–5 saccharide units in heparin. Heparin-induced oligomerization of FGF-1 and FGF-2 has been observed by cross-linking studies (1Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 9Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); cross-linking has also confirmed dimerization of FGF-2 by an active nonsulfated oligosaccharide analog (11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These results support the model that heparin binds multiple FGFs to activate the receptor, but the question remains whether heparin is merely binding multiple FGFs nonspecifically along the long heparin chain, or whether heparin is involved in forming a specific dimer conformation of FGF-2 that is required for activation of the FGFR. Recently, the crystal structures of two biologically active, nonsulfated oligosaccharides bound to FGF-2 were determined (11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These structures both showed three binding sites (labeled 1, 2, and 2′) for the oligosaccharides. Site 1 corresponded to the well characterized high-affinity heparin-binding site (7Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 12Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1274-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Sites 2 and 2′, previously undescribed, brought together two FGF-2 molecules by simultaneously binding to a single saccharide ligand, suggesting that the biological activity of these small nonsulfated compounds may be due to ligand-mediated dimerization of FGF-2. This hypothesis was supported by a cross-linking experiment showing FGF-2 dimerization in the presence of one of these ligands (11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Venkataraman and colleagues (13Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) compared this FGF-2/nonsulfated oligosaccharide structure with six crystal structures of apo-FGF-2 and found that all of the structures exhibited identical side by side positioning of the FGF-2 monomers. The authors proposed that apo-FGF-2 has a weak dimerization interface close to the site 2/site 2′ region that promotes formation of a side by side dimer. Such a dimer would allow the binding of a single heparin chain of 8–10 saccharide units (corresponding to what has been reported as the shortest active heparin fragment (1Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 14Ishihara M. Tyrrell D.J. Stauber G.B. Brown S. Cousens L.S. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4675-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) to the high-affinity heparin-binding site (site 1) contributed by each FGF-2 molecule (illustrated in Fig. 4 C). In their modeling studies, Venkataraman et al. (13Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) showed that the binding of a heparin dodecasaccharide to a side by side FGF-2 dimer (with both FGF-2 molecules cis to the heparin ligand) would stabilize the dimer by increasing the protein contact surface area from 761 Å2 in the apo-dimer to 2036 Å2 in the heparin-bound dimer. To better understand the role of heparin and heparin-like compounds in oligomerizing FGF-2, we have used analytical ultracentrifugation to analyze the association state of FGF-2 in the presence of the shortest reported biologically active heparin fragment, an octasaccharide (HS-8) (1Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). For comparison, we also analyzed the association state of FGF-2 in the presence of sucrose octasulfate (SOS), an inactive sulfated disaccharide which binds to FGF-2 (20Arakawa T. Wen J. Philo J.S. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) but is too short to bridge the high-affinity heparin-binding sites of a putative side by side dimer. FGF-2 was generously provided by J. Abraham (Scios Nova) as a stock solution of 8.3 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 9% sucrose. Heparin octasaccharide fragment HS-8 (derived from heparin by nitrous acid depolymerization) in phosphate-buffered saline was a gift from C. Svahn (Pharmacia). The sodium salt of SOS was a gift from Bukh Meditec. Concentration of protein was determined spectrophotometrically ( A2800.1% = 0.964 (16Pantoliano M.W. Horlick R.A. Springer B.A. Van Dyk D.E. Tobery T. Wetmore D.R. Lear J.D. Nahapetian A.T. Bradley J.D. Sisk W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). For all titration experiments involving HS-8, FGF-2 was dialyzed extensively against a buffer containing 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.9, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), and 140 mm NaCl. The solutions of FGF-2 and HS-8 were then diluted into “sedimentation buffer” containing 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-ME, to achieve a final NaCl concentration of 20 mm. For the study of the effect of salt, FGF-2 was dialyzed against sedimentation buffer, and NaCl was added to appropriate levels as indicated under “Results.” For titration experiments involving SOS, the stock solution of FGF-2 was initially diluted 100-fold into the sedimentation buffer and reconcentrated to approximately 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon centricon 10). However, because interference with sucrose was observed (see “Results”), later titration and salt effect experiments were carried out with FGF-2 extensively dialyzed in sedimentation buffer. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted using a Beckman XL-A Optima analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an absorbance optical system. Runs were carried out at 20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm, at 20 °C. Six-channel, charcoal-filled epon centerpieces with quartz windows were used in a four-hole Ti-60a titanium rotor. Sample volumes in the two inner sample wells of each centerpiece were 100 μl, and the outer well contained 90 μl. Each sample well contained 10 μl (inner two wells) or 30 μl (outer well) of FC43 (Beckman), an inert fluorocarbon oil that displaces the sample solution in the outermost region of the well, thereby maximizing the data that can be collected. The reference wells were filled with 125 μl of the appropriate buffer. Radial scans at 280 nm were collected between 5.9 and 7.2 cm as the average of five measurements, with a step size of 0.001 cm. The samples were allowed to achieve sedimentation equilibrium over the course of 14–20 h, depending on the rotor speed. Samples were considered at equilibrium when sequential scans 2 h apart were superimposable. The partial specific volume of FGF-2 was calculated as 0.734 g/ml based on its amino acid composition, using values from Ref. 17Laue T.L. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar. The contribution of ligand to the partial specific volume of FGF-2 was considered to be negligible, since the partial specific volumes of sugars are similar to proteins (17Laue T.L. Shah B.D.

The Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar) and since the mass of FGF-2 is substantially larger than the masses of the ligands used. The buffer density was determined to be 0.995 g/ml, calculated from tables in Ref. 17Laue T.L. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar and the density of β-ME. The raw data files were edited using the program REEDIT (D. Yphantis) and then analyzed by global nonlinear least-squares analysis using the program NONLIN (18Johnson M.L. Correira J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). All data files were first fitted to a single-species model to yield a value for the reduced buoyant molecular weight ς. The reduced molecular weight can be directly determined from the absorption curve, and it is related to the apparent monomer molecular weight (M) by the following equation, ς=∂lncr∂(r2/2)=sω2D=M(1−v¯ρ)ω2RTEquation 1 where c r is the concentration of the macromolecule at radial position r in the cell, sis the apparent sedimentation coefficient, D is the diffusion coefficient, v̄ is the partial specific volume of the macromolecule, ρ is the buffer density, ω2 is the square of the rotor's angular velocity (rpm π/30)2, R is the gas constant in g/mol K, andT is the absolute temperature. The data was then fitted to successively higher order assembly models (monomer-dimer, monomer-dimer-trimer, monomer-dimer-trimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer-tetramer, etc.), according to the equation, Yr=δj+exp[lnAO+ς(r2/2−ro2/2)]+Equation 2 ∑n=2mNexp[lnKN+lnAo+ς(r2/2−ro2/2)]where Y r is the absorbance at any radial point r, δ j is the baseline offset for the jth experiment, A o is the absorbance at reference point r o, K N is the association constant for the assembly reaction in which N monomers (M) form the assembled species M N, and ς is the reduced buoyant molecular weight as described above. Several models were analyzed to determine the simplest model that gave the best fit. A model was deemed to fit the data well when the residuals were small and randomly distributed, the square root of the variance was under 0.01, and the freely varying ς corresponded closely to the actual monomer molecular weight of FGF-2 (ς = 1.868 for apo-FGF-2; M r = 17,100). At high concentration gradients the refractive index of the sample solution may be affected, causing steps in the absorbance curve (19Burz D.S. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3341-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This causes poor fits to the data in the high absorbance range, regardless of the assembly model used. When this occurred, data files exhibiting such steps were slightly truncated to remove the steps in the absorbance curve and allow satisfactory fitting. The final results are reported for fits where ς was fixed at 1.9 (FGF-2/SOS) or 2.0 (FGF-2/HS-8), corresponding to a liganded FGF-2 monomer consistent with the particular model, to maintain consistency. Data files from three different speeds (20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm) were simultaneously fit for each experimental run to better resolve the fitted parameters. This allows for the most accurate determination of association constants. The association constants reported by NONLIN are in absorbance concentration units, and were converted to molar association constants by the following equation, KM=Kabs([M0] n−1/n)(εb) n−1Equation 3 where K m is the molar association constant inm−1, K abs is the absorbance association constant in inverse absorbance units as reported by NONLIN, M o is the monomer molecular weight in g/mol, n is the stoichiometry of association, ε is the extinction coefficient, and b is the path length (1.2 cm for the cells used) (19Burz D.S. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3341-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). FGF-2 (585 nm) was cross-linked in the presence of varying amounts of SOS and HS-8. Cross-linking and electrophoresis were done as described in Ref. 11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar. Dimer band intensities were quantified by scanning densitometry. The density of each dimer band was corrected by subtracting the density observed in the absence of saccharide; this corrects for nonspecific random cross-linking in the absence of saccharide. Each experiment consisted of a control sample of apo-FGF-2 as well as samples of FGF-2 in the presence of a saccharide ligand. Apo-FGF-2 consistently sedimented as a single species whose molecular weight clearly corresponded to that of a monomer (calculatedM r = 17,100) (data not shown). To determine whether heparin-derived compounds induce FGF-2 self-association in solution, sedimentation experiments with FGF-2 in the presence of HS-8 or sucrose octasulfate were carried out. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out with FGF-2 and various concentrations of saccharide ligand. The first set of experiments included solutions of 11.9 μm FGF-2 with 5.95, 11.9, 17.9, 23.8, 47.6, 119, or 238 μm HS-8. The data at HS-8 concentrations below 47.6 μm fit best to a monomer-dimer-tetramer association scheme, as shown in Fig.1, A and B. Fits to monomer-dimer-trimer or monomer-dimer-trimer-tetramer assembly models resulted in more non-random residuals and higher square roots of variance. The data for HS-8 concentrations of 47.6 μm or above fit best to a monomer-dimer equilibrium, as shown in Fig.1 B. The highest levels of association were seen at 5.95 μm HS-8; the monomer-dimer dissociation constant at this HS-8 concentration was 4.42 μm (K2 in Fig.4 B), and the dimer-tetramer stepwise dissociation constant was 109 μm (Kx in Fig. 4 B). The dimerization association constants showed a slight decrease with increasing HS-8 concentration, as shown in Fig. 1 B. The tetramerization (monomer-tetramer) association constants K4 also decreased with increasing HS-8 concentration, and tetramerization fell off to undetectable levels at HS-8 concentrations of 47.6 μm or above. The negative slope implies that although HS-8 is required for FGF-2 dimerization under these conditions, higher concentrations of HS-8 interfere with FGF-2 assembly. This is presumably due to saturation of the heparin-binding site on FGF-2, which would shift the equilibrium toward FGF-2 monomers, each bound to a single HS-8 molecule. To compare the action of HS-8 on FGF-2 with that of another sulfated saccharide, sedimentation experiments were also carried out with FGF-2 and SOS. These experiments included solutions of 11.9, 17.9, 23.8, 119, 238, 476, 714, or 952 μm SOS in 11.9, 17.9, 23.8, or 47.6 μm FGF-2. All solutions containing FGF-2 and SOS exhibited an FGF-2 monomer-dimer equilibrium, as shown in Fig.2 A for a representative set of data. However, the data from the FGF-2/SOS experiments showed no clear trend with increasing concentrations of SOS, which we suspected was due to interference from residual sucrose in the FGF-2 storage buffer (sucrose may interfere with binding of SOS, as another nonsulfated oligosaccharide (11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) has been shown to bind to the same site to which SOS binds (15Zhu X. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Structure. 1993; 1: 27-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). Therefore, in a second set of experiments, solutions were prepared after the FGF-2 had been extensively dialyzed in sedimentation buffer (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.9, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-ME), and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out. As before, all the data fit best to a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The highest levels of association were seen at 952 μm SOS; the monomer-dimer dissociation constant at this SOS concentration was 92.91 μm. The dimerization constant increased with increasing SOS in an approximately linear fashion between 119 and 952 μm SOS, as shown in Fig. 2 B. This shows that binding of SOS in this range of concentration is positively linked to FGF-2 dimerization. However, in the lower range (below 119 μm) of SOS concentration studied, although fits to monomer-dimer equilibria were excellent, no clear trend in the value of the association constant was observed (data not shown). Fig. 2 B shows that the data for the sucrose-containing solutions with SOS concentrations equal to or higher than 476 μm (open squares) coincided with the data from the sucrose-free solutions. High concentrations of SOS would appear to compete effectively with sucrose for binding to FGF-2. The observation of a SOS-induced dimer was intriguing and could be interpreted as a mere artifact of the relatively high FGF-2 concentrations used. Therefore, FGF-2 dimerization in the presence of SOS at two concentrations (4 and 12 μm) was monitored by cross-linking, a more sensitive technique. FGF-2 concentration was 585 nm, well below the concentrations used for the sedimentation equilibrium experiments. A control experiment with HS-8 was also performed. Dimerization of FGF-2 was clearly observed in the presence of both SOS and HS-8. Addition of 4.0 or 12 μmSOS reproducibly increased FGF-2 dimerization by 22.2 or 22.3%, respectively, over nonspecific cross-linking (in the absence of saccharide), and addition of equivalent concentrations of HS-8 increased FGF-2 dimerization by 49.9 and 25.5% over nonspecific levels. Results for HS-8 were similar to previously published data for a 16-saccharide heparin fragment (11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These results verify that both SOS and HS-8 are capable of inducing dimerization of FGF-2 at lower concentrations of FGF-2 than can be reliably observed using most biophysical techniques, and in a different buffer system (22 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) than that used in the sedimentation studies. To further characterize this system, sedimentation experiments were also carried out with varying salt concentrations. Solutions of 17.9 μm FGF-2 with 17.9 μm HS-8 were prepared in sedimentation buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 m NaCl). Solutions of FGF-2/HS-8 at low salt concentrations (0 and 0.05 m NaCl) showed the monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibrium described above. However, at NaCl concentrations above 50 mm, the equilibrium shifted to a monomer-dimer equilibrium and subsequently to a single monomeric species at 1 m NaCl, as shown in Fig.3 A. Sedimentation experiments were also carried out for FGF-2·SOS complexes; solutions of 17.9 μm FGF-2 and 17.9 μm SOS were prepared in sedimentation buffer containing 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1m NaCl. A monomer-dimer equilibrium was observed at NaCl concentrations between 0 and 0.25 m NaCl, but at NaCl concentrations of 0.5 and 1 m NaCl, only a single monomeric species was observed, as shown in Fig. 3 B. The sedimentation equilibrium experiments described above reveal that HS-8 induces a monomer-dimer-tetramer assembly of FGF-2 at low HS-8 concentrations. The proposed self-association process for FGF-2 induced by HS-8 is illustrated in Fig.4 B. The HS-8-induced monomer-dimer assembly of FGF-2 is consistent with the information currently known about FGF-heparin interactions. Calorimetric studies using low M r heparin (M r∼ 3000 or approximately 10 saccharide units) have shown that two FGF-2 molecules bind per heparin molecule (7Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies with a 16-saccharide heparin have also detected FGF-2 dimers and trimers (1Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In the study presented here, an active heparin fragment of minimal size (8 saccharide units) was used; yet, this short heparin fragment promotes the formation of FGF-2 dimers with a moderately high association constant. Since the site size for heparin binding is ∼4–5 saccharide units per FGF molecule (1Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar,7Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 8Mach H.

There are three possibilities for the configuration of the FGF-2 molecules bound to HS-8: 1) the FGF-2 molecules are located in trans relative to the heparin; 2) the FGF-2 molecules are bound to neighboring sites on heparin but are not in contact with each other; 3) the FGF-2 molecules are bound to neighboring sites (incis) on heparin and are in contact with each other. Venkataraman et al. (13Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have argued that the third configuration is the most likely. Indeed, the crystal structures of FGF-2 bound to heparin fragments or to nonsulfated heparan analogs (11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar,12Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) suggest that HS-8 could bind across two adjacent FGF-2 monomers, stabilizing an FGF-2 “side by side” dimer cis to the heparin as illustrated in Fig. 4, B and C. Heparin has been reported by both NMR and x-ray diffraction studies to be a helical polysaccharide in solution with a 2-fold screw symmetry between successive disaccharide units (23Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem J. 1993; 293: 848-849Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). As a result, every fourth saccharide residue has approximately the same orientation with a translation of 16.5 to 16.7 Å along the heparin chain. An octasaccharide of heparin therefore consists of two side by side near-identical orientations of a tetrasaccharide, with an overall length of 33.0–33.4 Å. This corresponds closely to the width of the FGF-2 molecule (11Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Aside from H2:CO2 and acetate, the majority are methylotrophic substrates such as methylated thiols, methanol, and methylamines. Methanogenesis from a methylotrophic substrate requires methyl group abstraction and subsequent methylation of the thiol of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (coenzyme M or CoM).1 Methyl-CoM is then converted to methane with reducing equivalents obtained from the concomitant oxidation of the methylotrophic substrate to carbon dioxide (1Ferry J.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 13-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Thauer R.K. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The methylamines are important methylotrophic substrates in marine environments where they arise from the anaerobic breakdown of choline derivatives, betaine, and trimethylamine oxide (3King G.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 48: 719-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the breakdown of trimethylamine (TMA) methyl groups are sequentially removed from the substrate with the intermediate production of dimethylamine (DMA) and monomethylamine (MMA), which are subsequently consumed for the production of methane. DMA or MMA can also serve as sole carbon and energy source (4Naumann E. Fahlbusch K. Gottschalk G. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 138: 79-83Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Hippe H. Caspari D. Fiebig K. Gottschalk G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).The final step of CoM methylation with each methylamine is catalyzed by the same polypeptide. This is the 37-kDa methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferase, termed MtbA, that was originally identified in cells grown on acetate (6Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12890-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but was found in highest abundance in cells grown on TMA (7Yeliseev A. Gaertner P. Harms U. Linder D. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MtbA was shown to be involved in the MMA:CoM methyl transfer reaction due to its stimulation of this activity in cell extracts (8Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4410-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of MtbA from cell extracts with immobilized antibodies greatly diminished CoM methylation with TMA, DMA, or MMA, but each activity could be fully restored by supplementing the MtbA-depleted extract with purified MtbA (9Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5189-5194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MtbA does not contain a corrinoid prosthetic group, and since little corrinoid exists inM. barkeri that is not protein-bound (10Dangel W. Schulz H. Diekert G. König H. Fuchs G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 52-56Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), these results indicated that corrinoid-binding proteins must be involved in CoM methylation from each methylamine.This prediction was confirmed with the reconstitution of MMA-dependent CoM methylation reaction (11Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with highly purified proteins (Fig. 1 A; also see Fig. 9). A 50-kDa polypeptide, MtmB, which lacks a detectable prosthetic group, was required for the methylation with MMA of MtmC, a 29-kDa corrinoid-binding protein. The two independently isolated proteins can form a complex and are most active in CoM methylation at a MtmB:MtmC ratio of 2. Methyl-MtmC serves as substrate for CoM methylation as catalyzed by MtbA. These three protein components are sufficient for MMA:CoM methyl transfer in vitro in the presence of Ti(III) citrate and methyl viologen. The latter two components are required for reductive activation of MtmC to the active Co(I) form, since MtmC is isolated in a mixture of the Co(II) and Co(III) redox states. Use of this reductant and redox mediator circumvents a requirement for a physiological ATP-dependent reductive activation system that is not yet completely resolved (12Daas P.J.H. Wassenaar R.W.

The TMA, MMA, and methanol-dependent CoM methylation systems are analogous to the MtbB1-, MtbC-, and MtbA-mediated methylation of CoM with DMA. This figure is not meant to represent higher order structures of the proteins involved but is designed to indicate protein components with analogous roles. Each pathway has an enzyme of approximately 50 kDa that demethylates the growth substrate and methylates its cognate corrinoid protein. MtaB and MtbB1 have now been shown to methylate free cobalamin with the indicated substrates, whereas MtmB is required for methylation of the corrinoid bound to MtmC. MttB forms a tight complex with MttC, and therefore the postulated role of this MttC as a TMA:corrinoid methyltransferase has not been directly demonstrated. Each methylated cognate corrinoid protein is demethylated by a methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferase for the methylation of CoM. The corrinoid proteins are homologous proteins, as are the CoM methylases. However, the methyltransferases initiating the CoM methylation reactions have no obvious sequence similarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TMA:CoM methylation has also been resolved to three purified polypeptides (14Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the 52-kDa MttB and the 26-kDa MttC polypeptides are required to catalyze TMA-specific CoM methylation in the presence of MtbA. MttB and MttC do not separate during purification. Dissociation of MttB and MttC using gel permeation in the presence of SDS demonstrated that each mole of MttC bound 1 mol of corrinoid, whereas no corrinoid was bound by MttB (14Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Methanol-dependent methylation of CoM also requires a minimum of three polypeptides. Methanol was the first methylotrophic substrate of M. barkeri for which the pathway of CoM methylation was elucidated. Methyltransferase I is a corrinoid-containing enzyme composed of two tightly bound polypeptides, MtaB and MtaC (15van der Meijden P. te Brömmelstroet B.W. Poirot C.M. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 629-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sauer K. Harms U. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The 51-kDa MtaB subunit uses methanol to methylate the corrinoid prosthetic group of the 28-kDa MtaC subunit, as shown by the capability of recombinant MtaB to methylate free cob(I)alamin (17Sauer K. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Methyl-MtaC is then demethylated to generate methyl-CoM by MtaA, a methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferase (16Sauer K. Harms U. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18van der Meijden P. Heythuysen H.J. Pouwels A. Houwen F. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) which is homologous to MtbA (19LeClerc G.M. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18725-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Harms U. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Reductive activation of MtaC can be accomplished with either Ti(III) citrate (16Sauer K. Harms U. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or the partially resolved ATP-dependent corrinoid activation system (12Daas P.J.H. Wassenaar R.W. Willemsen P. Theunissen R.J. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22339-22345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MtbA does not function in the methylation of CoM with MMA or DMA but will function to a limited extent in the TMA-dependent CoM methylation pathway (14Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Thus, methanol and TMA-dependent CoM methylation systems are analogous to the MMA:CoM methylation scheme shown in Fig.1 A. Each system has in common a requirement for a small corrinoid-binding polypeptide, yet these are distinct corrinoid-binding proteins specific for each pathway. As demonstrated for the methanol and MMA systems, methylation of the corrinoid protein with a methylotrophic substrate requires a separate protein such as MtmB or MtaB. The methylated corrinoid is then demethylated by a methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferase such as MtaA or MtbA.The DMA:CoM methyl transfer pathway has not previously been reconstituted with highly purified proteins. However, in addition to the CoM methylase MtbA, another protein was recently implicated in DMA:CoM methyl transfer by Wassenaar et al. (21Wassenaar R.W. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Wassenaar R.W. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and designated DMAMT (see Fig. 1 B). Purified preparations of homodimeric DMAMT contained 0.45 mol of corrinoid/mol of 50-kDa DMAMT polypeptide. DMAMT and MtbA alone were insufficient for DMA:CoM methyl transfer and required addition of methyltransferase activation protein (MAP), a protein involved in ATP-dependent reductive activation of the corrinoid, as well as a fraction from a primary DEAE separation of cell extract that contained hydrogenase activity (22Wassenaar R.W. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A mechanism was proposed in which DMAMT methylated with DMA its own bound corrinoid prosthetic group, which was then demethylated by MtbA and CoM (Fig. 1 B). This scheme stands in contrast with the resolved pathway for MMA:CoM methyl transfer (Fig. 1 A) and the analogous pathways for TMA and methanol-dependent CoM methylation in that a small discrete corrinoid-binding protein is not required.In this paper, we describe the isolation of a small corrinoid protein, MtbC, from M. barkeri which stimulated DMA:CoM methyl transfer when added to cell extract. MtbC was used in an assay to isolate MtbB1, a DMA:corrinoid methyltransferase that does not have a corrinoid prosthetic group. Highly purified MtbB1, MtbC, and MtbA are sufficient to catalyze in vitro CoM methylation by DMA in a manner most analogous to the resolved MMA:CoM methylation reaction.DISCUSSIONThis work describes the first complete resolution of a pathway for the methylation of CoM with DMA using only highly purified proteins. MtbB1, MtbC, and MtbA are sufficient, and each necessary, for in vitro transfer of methyl groups from DMA to CoM. Our data support a model for the interaction of these proteins in the methylation of CoM with DMA that is analogous to the reactions for CoM methylation with TMA, MMA, and methanol (Fig. 9). In each of these pathways, a small corrinoid protein (26–29 kDa) specific for that pathway interacts with two methyltransferases to initiate CoM methylation from the methylotrophic substrate. The first methyltransferase methylates the corrinoid protein with the methanogenic precursor, whereas the second methyltransferase catalyzes the demethylation of the corrinoid protein and methylation of CoM.Several lines of evidence support this model of DMA:CoM methylation reaction in M. barkeri. MtbC is a 24-kDa corrinoid protein that specifically stimulated CoM methylation from DMA when added to cell extracts. Furthermore, purified MtbC was used as a component of the DMA:CoM methyl transfer assay employed to isolate MtbB1, a DMA:corrinoid methyltransferase. MtbB1 is the first protein reported to catalyze the direct methylation of non-protein bound cob(I)alamin with DMA. This indicates that MtbB1 possesses the active site used in DMA-dependent methylation of the corrinoid prosthetic group of MtbC. Purified MtbB1, MtbC, and MtbA can methylate CoM with DMA but not other methylamines. These results are consistent with a model in which MtbB1 specifically methylates the corrinoid prosthetic group of MtbC with DMA, and methyl-MtbC is subsequently demethylated by the methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferase, MtbA.Wassenaar et al. (21Wassenaar R.W. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Wassenaar R.W. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) have postulated the existence of a different pathway of DMA:CoM methylation in M. barkeri (Fig.1 B). In their work, they proposed that a 50-kDa DMA methyltransferase, DMAMT, binds corrinoid and automethylates its prosthetic group which is then demethylated by MtbA to methylate CoM. Their proposed pathway does not include a small corrinoid protein such as MtbC, rather, DMAMT was reported to bind 0.45 mol of corrinoid/mol of polypeptide and was suggested to serve both as a corrinoid-binding protein and as a DMA:corrinoid methyltransferase. The full relationship of DMAMT to the DMA methyltransferase isolated here (MtbB1) is unknown, but the N termini are 88% identical. The key difference between the two proteins is that our homogeneous preparations of MtbB1 do not bind detectable corrinoid and clearly methylate with DMA a discrete corrinoid protein, MtbC. The complete sequence of DMAMT has not yet been published. We have obtained the full sequence of MtbB1, and it has no detectable homology with any corrinoid-binding protein (30Paul L. Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (see also GenbankTM accession number AF102623). The specific activity of DMA demethylation measured for purified MtbB1 is comparable to that reported for DMAMT. The native structure of the two proteins may also be different. DMAMT is reported to be a dimer, whereas MtbB1 is a tetramer or pentamer.If both DMAMT and MtbB1 represent gene products that are homologous across their entire length, then it seems clear that DMAMT-bound corrinoid is not essential for activity, and a small corrinoid protein, MtbC, supplies the corrinoid cofactor for the DMA:CoM methyltransferase reaction. However, it is possible that both pathways are present in methanogens. Recently, it was demonstrated that chloromethane utilization by an aerobic methylotroph requires a protein that is a fusion of a methylotrophic corrinoid protein and MtbA homolog (31Vannelli T. Messmer M. Studer A. Vuilleumier S. Leisinger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4615-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that the DMA methyltransferase-corrinoid protein fusion proposed by Wassenaar et al. (21Wassenaar R.W. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Wassenaar R.W. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) might be feasible. However, since DMAMT required unresolved protein fractions to carry out in vitro DMA:CoM methyl transfer, it is difficult to determine if a small corrinoid protein is functioning in the DMAMT-dependent methylation of CoM. Wassenaaret al. (22Wassenaar R.W. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) acknowledged that a small corrinoid protein could have been added to their assays as part of non-homogeneous MAP and MtbA preparations. Further resolution of the DMAMT-dependent DMA:CoM methyl transfer system, and the sequencing of the gene encoding DMAMT, should establish whether a pathway of DMA:CoM methyl transfer exists other than that illustrated in Fig. 9.Recently, the genes encoding two polypeptides required to initiate TMA:CoM methylation, MttB and MttC (see Fig. 9), were cloned and sequenced (30Paul L. Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (see also GenBankTM accession numberAF102623). Two open reading frames were identified near these genes, which initially could not be assigned to gene products. However, the N termini of MtbB1 and MtbC obtained in this study indicate that each of these open reading frames encode proteins involved in the DMA-dependent methylation of CoM. Interestingly, the genesmttB, mttC, mtbC, and mttBare encoded on a single transcript found in TMA-grown cells (30Paul L. Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cotranscription of the genes encoding MtbC and MtbB1 is consistent with the function of these two independently isolated proteins in the DMA:CoM methyl transfer reaction. It is of further interest that both the mtbB1 and mtbC genes are cotranscribed with genes for initiating TMA catabolism. Since M. barkerigenerates DMA as an intermediate of methanogenesis from TMA, cotranscription of both TMA and DMA methyltransferase genes would be an efficient means of coordinating expression of these methyltransferases.The protein sequence predicted for MtbC from its gene, mtbC, is approximately 50% similar to the predicted protein sequences from the genes encoding the methylotrophic corrinoid proteins of TMA (MttC) (30Paul L. Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), MMA metabolism (MtmC) (32Burke S.A. Lo S.L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3432-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and methanol metabolism (MtaC) (16Sauer K. Harms U. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Each of these corrinoid proteins are in turn homologous to the cobalamin-binding domain of corrinoid-dependent methionine synthase and mutases (16Sauer K. Harms U. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Burke S.A. Lo S.L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3432-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Drennan C.L. Huang S.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The homology of the corrinoid protein isolated here, MtbC, to these other small discrete corrinoid proteins involved in methanogenesis from methylotrophic substrates is consistent with our results demonstrating a role for MtbC in a CoM methylation pathway, that is DMA:CoM methyl transfer.MtmB, MtbB1, and MttB are each implicated in analogous reactions, the methylation of corrinoid with methylamines. However, now that proteins and genes for all three methyltransferases have been identified, it is somewhat surprising to observe that the methylamine methyltransferases are not homologous (30Paul L. Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Burke S.A. Lo S.L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3432-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), see also GenBankTM accession number AF102623. This may explain the presence of the different, yet homologous, methylotrophic corrinoid proteins of methylamine-dependent methanogenesis. Although each corrinoid protein serves as a methyl donor for the same CoM methylase, MtbA, the differences in primary sequence must be necessary in order to optimize interaction of a particular corrinoid protein with one of the non-homologous methylamine:corrinoid methyltransferases. These differences appear to lead to highly specific interactions between a methyltransferase and its cognate corrinoid protein and the dedication of a particular corrinoid protein to a particular pathway. Presumably, this specificity occurs with all three of the small corrinoid proteins identified as involved in methylamine metabolism. Unfortunately, this cannot be easily tested with the proteins initiating CoM methylation with TMA, since MttB and MttC form a complex that is difficult to separate. However, our results with the resolved MMA:CoM and DMA:CoM methyl transfer systems do illustrate this specificity. There is little detectable interaction between the MMA methyltransferase and the DMA corrinoid protein or between the DMA methyltransferase and the DMA corrinoid protein. Neither corrinoid protein will detectably support the non-cognate methyltransferase in CoM methylation. This lack of activity in CoM methylation coincides with the inability of either methyltransferase to methylate rapidly the corrinoid prosthetic group of the non-cognate corrinoid protein.MtbC greatly enhances the interaction of MtbB1 with corrinoid. During the course of this study, the observed rates of DMA-dependent methylation of CoM with the reconstituted system varied from 0.8 to 2.2 μmol/min/mg MtbB1. MtbB1 methylation of the corrinoid bound to MtbC is therefore much faster than observed for the methylation of free cobalamin, since 20 μm cobalamin did not replace MtbC in the resolved DMA:CoM reaction. Indeed, even with 2.5 mm cobalamin, the rate of MtbB1-dependent methylation of corrinoid with DMA was slow relative to the rates observed for MtbB1-, MtbC-, and MtbA-mediated methylation of CoM with DMA. These results further illustrate the unique role of the corrinoid-binding protein MtbC in greatly, and specifically, enhancing the interaction of corrinoid with the DMA:corrinoid methyltransferase, MtbB1. Methanosarcina barkeri is a methanogenic archaeon capable of methanogenesis from a wide range of substrates. Aside from H2:CO2 and acetate, the majority are methylotrophic substrates such as methylated thiols, methanol, and methylamines. Methanogenesis from a methylotrophic substrate requires methyl group abstraction and subsequent methylation of the thiol of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (coenzyme M or CoM).1 Methyl-CoM is then converted to methane with reducing equivalents obtained from the concomitant oxidation of the methylotrophic substrate to carbon dioxide (1Ferry J.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 13-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Thauer R.K. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The methylamines are important methylotrophic substrates in marine environments where they arise from the anaerobic breakdown of choline derivatives, betaine, and trimethylamine oxide (3King G.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 48: 719-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the breakdown of trimethylamine (TMA) methyl groups are sequentially removed from the substrate with the intermediate production of dimethylamine (DMA) and monomethylamine (MMA), which are subsequently consumed for the production of methane. DMA or MMA can also serve as sole carbon and energy source (4Naumann E. Fahlbusch K. Gottschalk G. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 138: 79-83Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Hippe H. Caspari D. Fiebig K. Gottschalk G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The final step of CoM methylation with each methylamine is catalyzed by the same polypeptide. This is the 37-kDa methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferase, termed MtbA, that was originally identified in cells grown on acetate (6Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12890-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but was found in highest abundance in cells grown on TMA (7Yeliseev A. Gaertner P. Harms U. Linder D. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MtbA was shown to be involved in the MMA:CoM methyl transfer reaction due to its stimulation of this activity in cell extracts (8Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4410-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of MtbA from cell extracts with immobilized antibodies greatly diminished CoM methylation with TMA, DMA, or MMA, but each activity could be fully restored by supplementing the MtbA-depleted extract with purified MtbA (9Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5189-5194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MtbA does not contain a corrinoid prosthetic group, and since little corrinoid exists inM. barkeri that is not protein-bound (10Dangel W. Schulz H. Diekert G. König H. Fuchs G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 52-56Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), these results indicated that corrinoid-binding proteins must be involved in CoM methylation from each methylamine. This prediction was confirmed with the reconstitution of MMA-dependent CoM methylation reaction (11Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with highly purified proteins (Fig. 1 A; also see Fig. 9). A 50-kDa polypeptide, MtmB, which lacks a detectable prosthetic group, was required for the methylation with MMA of MtmC, a 29-kDa corrinoid-binding protein. The two independently isolated proteins can form a complex and are most active in CoM methylation at a MtmB:MtmC ratio of 2. Methyl-MtmC serves as substrate for CoM methylation as catalyzed by MtbA. These three protein components are sufficient for MMA:CoM methyl transfer in vitro in the presence of Ti(III) citrate and methyl viologen. The latter two components are required for reductive activation of MtmC to the active Co(I) form, since MtmC is isolated in a mixture of the Co(II) and Co(III) redox states. Use of this reductant and redox mediator circumvents a requirement for a physiological ATP-dependent reductive activation system that is not yet completely resolved (12Daas P.J.H. Wassenaar R.W.

Chemokines are structurally and functionally related 8–10-kDa polypeptides, involved in the recruitment of white blood cells into areas of inflammation and their subsequent activation (1Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 12: 17-46PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). In addition, some chemokines are able to regulate the proliferative potential of hematopoietic progenitor cells, endothelial cells, and certain types of transformed cells (3Oppenheimer J.J.

Cytokine. 1991; 3: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Based on whether the first two cysteine moieties are separated by one amino acid moiety or are adjacent, chemokines belong to the α-chemokine or CXC chemokine family (e.g. interleukin-8) or the β-chemokine or CC chemokine family (e.g. RANTES 1The abbreviations used are: RANTES, regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; CC-CKR, CC chemokine receptor; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; [Ca2+] i, cytosolic free calcium concentration. and MCP-1). CXC chemokines preferentially attract and affect neutrophils, while CC chemokines chemoattract and affect eosinophils, monocytes, and T cells with relative potencies that differ between the different members of this family.

Here we describe the identification, cloning, and in vitroexpression of a novel human CC chemokine, tentatively named MCP-4. This chemokine shows a high level of amino acid sequence homology (62%) with human MCP-1. Following expression of MCP-4 inDrosophila S2 cells, an N terminus-processed protein (amino acid residues 24–98) was purified from the conditioned medium, and alignment with the sequences of other mature forms of members of the CC chemokine family suggests that this polypeptide represents mature MCP-4. MCP-4 (residues 24–98) binds and induces functional responses in freshly isolated human monocytes but not in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. We also show that binding of MCP-4 (residues 24–98) to monocytes is at least in part due to the CC-CKR-2B receptor, a conclusion supported by data obtained in recombinant CHO cells expressing this receptor. Using immunohistochemical methods, we also show that MCP-4 is expressed in human atherosclerotic carotid and coronary arteries and that the expression is associated with vascular endothelial cells and macrophages. Recombinant human MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, RANTES, and MIP-1α were from R & D Systems, Europe Ltd. and Advanced Protein Products.125I-Labeled MCP-1 and RANTES were from Amersham International UK (specific activity, 2000 Ci/mmol). Dextran T500 was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; NycoPrepTM1.068 was from Nycomed UK; PBS and RPMI 1640 were from Life Technologies, Inc.; HEPES (ultrapure) and ionomycin were from Calbiochem; Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes, Inc.; bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) and naphthyl-butyrate esterase kit were purchased from Sigma; Diff-Quik stain was from B. M. Browne Ltd.; multiple tissue blots for Northern blotting and a tissue-specific protein solution of normal human tissues for Western blotting were purchased from CLONTECH Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Ready made human multiple tissue blots from DNA Technologies Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) were also used for Western blotting. All other reagents were analytical grade (AnalaR). MCP-4 was initially identified at Human Genome Sciences (Rockville, MD) by random sequencing of expressed sequence tags in a cDNA library from an 8-week-old human fetus, and a full-length clone was identified and sequenced subsequently. MCP-4 was expressed in a Drosophila cell culture system (17Van der Straten A. Johansen H. Rosenberg M. Sweet R.W. Curr. Methods Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 1-8Google Scholar,18Angelichio M. Beck J.A. Johansen H. Ivey-Hoyle M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5037-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The MCP-4 coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the cDNA clone as substrate and the following pair of primers: 5′-TCCCCGCGGCCACCATGAAAGTTTCTGCAGTGCTT-3′ (SacII site and initiator methionine codon underlined) and 5′-GCTCTAGACTATTAAGTCTTCAGGGTGTGAGCT-3′ (XbaI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with SacII and XbaI, cloned intoSacII/XbaI-digested vector pMTAL, and sequenced to ensure the absence of PCR-generated mutations. This placed the open reading frame between a copper sulfate-inducible metallothionein promoter and an SV40 late polyadenylation site. This vector was introduced into Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells by co-transfection with a vector carrying a hygromycin B resistance gene. Hygromycin B-resistant cells were selected as a stable polyclonal population, induced with copper sulfate, and examined for expression by Western blot analysis using an antiserum raised in rabbits immunized with a MCP-4 peptide. Cells were adapted to serum-free medium (19Ramos, L., Oka, M., and Murname, A. (1992) Patent WO 92/05247.Google Scholar) and scaled to 10 liters to generate conditioned medium for purification. Ten ml of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 7.4) was added per liter of conditioned medium, which was then diluted 1:1 (v/v) with deionized/distilled water. The diluted medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter to remove particulates and subsequently loaded, via a peristaltic pump, at 14–15 ml/min onto a 10-ml bed volume Sepharose-S Fast Flow column previously equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. After sample loading, the column was washed with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, until the absorbance at 280 nm of the effluent returned to base line. Bound material was then eluted from the column with 1 m NaCl in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.0. The eluate was concentrated using an Amicon Stir Cell concentrator using a YM3 3,000-Da cut-off membrane. The concentrated eluate was applied to a Superdex 75 size exclusion column equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and developed using the same buffer. Fractions were analyzed by 17.5% SDS-PAGE, and those containing MCP-4 were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon Stir Cell concentrator using a YM3 membrane, filter-sterilized through a 0.22-μm membrane filter, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. Samples of the purified MCP-4 were subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis, quantitative amino acid analysis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry to confirm the integrity and concentration of the product. MCP-4 was hydrolyzed in vacuo under 6 nHCl for 20 h at 110 °C. The resulting hydrolysate was analyzed by ion exchange amino acid analysis using postcolumn ninhydrin detection on a Beckman 6300 analyzer equipped with a System Gold data acquisition system (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 470A gas phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) equipped with a Beckman 126/166 system (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) for on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis. Data were acquired using System Gold chromatography software (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Samples were spotted directly onto Polybrene-coated GF/C filters (Applied Biosystems), and standard ABI sequencing cycles were used. Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry data for MCP-4 were obtained on a Vestec LaserTec Research laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Vestec Corp., Houston, TX). Samples were prepared for analysis by mixing MCP-4, in PBS, pH 7.0, with sinapinic acid (saturated solution in 33% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) for a final concentration of 1 μm. Apomyoglobin (Sigma) was included as an internal calibrant (MH2+ = 8476.8 Da). Desorption/ionization was accomplished using a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Spectra were averaged over ∼50 laser scans. Calibrations were carried out using a customized version of IGOR on a Macintosh personal computer. Human peripheral blood monocytes were prepared from the blood of normal healthy volunteers, essentially as described by Boyum (20Boyum A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 108: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Blood was collected into anticoagulant (1 part 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, to 9 parts blood) and then centrifuged for 5 min at 600 ×g. The upper layer of platelet-rich plasma was removed and centrifuged for 15 min at 900 × g to pellet the platelets. The upper layer of platelet-poor plasma was removed and added back to the packed red cells; the pelleted platelets were discarded. Dextran T500 was added (10 volumes of EDTA blood to 1 volume of 6% (w/v) dextran in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl), and the erythrocytes were allowed to sediment at unit gravity for 30 min. The resultant leukocyte-rich plasma was removed and centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of the supernatant, and the suspension was underlayered with 3 ml of NycoPrepTM1.068 and then centrifuged for 15 min at 600 × g. The mononuclear layer at the interface between the plasma and the NycoPrepTM1.068 was removed and washed through PBS by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 × g. The mononuclear layer typically contained ≥80% monocytes, determined by staining cytocentrifuge preparations for nonspecific esterase using α-naphthyl butyrate. Cell viability (typically >95%) was assessed as the ability to exclude trypan blue. Oligonucleotide primers 5′-TGGGGTACCCCACAACATGCTGTCCACATCTCGTTCTCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAACGGATCCTCGTTTTATAAACCAGCCGAG-3′ (antisense) containing KpnI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (underlined), were synthesized based on the published sequence of the human CC-CKR-2B receptor (10Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). These primers were used to produce a full-length cDNA for this receptor by PCR with human placenta cDNA as the template. The expected product of 1.1 kilobase pairs was digested with KpnI and BamHI and inserted into the equivalent sites of the mammalian expression vector pCDN. The insert of the resulting construct was completely sequenced to confirm its identity and orientation. To obtain a stable cell line expressing the CC-CKR-2B receptor, the pCDN:CC-CKR-2B expression plasmid was electroporated into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Stable cell lines were isolated by growing cells in the absence of nucleosides. Those cell lines that grew out of selection were then analyzed for CC-CKR-2B expression using a radiolabeled MCP-1 binding assay. The cell line used here, C11, was found to express approximately 200,000 receptors/cell. Monocytes were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium without bicarbonate containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% azide.125I-Labeled chemokines (MCP-1 or RANTES, about 2 × 104 cpm) were incubated with 1–2 × 106cells in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokines (MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-4, RANTES, or MIP-1α) for 15 min at 37 °C in a 96-well plate in a final volume of 0.2 ml. After the incubation, 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4) was added, and cells were collected onto a polyethyleneimine-treated Whatman GF/C filter using a Brandell cell harvester. Filters were washed with 4 ml of cold wash buffer, and the radioactivity bound to the filters was counted in a γ-counter. For competition studies, the IC50 was calculated with a curve fitting program (GraFit, Erithacus Software, London), using a four-parameter logistic, cpmbound = cpmmax/(1 + ([L]/IC50) s )+ cpmns, where cpmmax represents the binding without competitor, [L] is the competitor concentration, cpmns is the nonspecific binding, and s is the slope factor. The cpmboundwas corrected for “no cell” controls. To obtain theK d and capacity of binding for individual chemokines, specific binding data from homologous displacement experiments were fitted into a single site ligand binding equation using the GraFit best fit program. Chemokine binding to the CHO cells, expressing the human CC-CKR-2B receptor, were performed essentially as described above except that 125I-labeled chemokines were diluted with unlabeled chemokine to a specific activity of 400 Ci/mmol and used in a final concentration of 0.6 nm. Cells were incubated with 125I-labeled chemokines plus or minus unlabeled chemokines for 30 min at 37 °C. For measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, monocytes were incubated with 0.5 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose), pH 7.4, at 37 °C, supplemented with 1% albumin (w/v) and 1 mmCaCl2. After loading with Fura-2, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g and then resuspended in buffer containing no added albumin, to a cell density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, and kept at room temperature until use. This protocol resulted in a cytosolic Fura-2 concentration of ∼100 μm. Serial dilutions of chemokines in PBS plus 0.1% albumin (w/v) (sterile filtered) were added to aliquots (0.7 ml) of cell suspension. The Fura-2 fluorescence of monocyte suspension was measured at 37 °C in a single excitation, single emission (500 nm) wavelength Perkin-Elmer LS5 fluorometer. [Ca2+] i was calculated from changes in fluorescence measured at a single excitation wavelength of 340 nm, as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Ca2+] i measurements in CHO cells, expressing the human CC-CKR-2B receptor were performed essentially as described above for monocytes. After loading with Fura-2/AM, cells (1 × 106/ml) were kept in ice-cold medium (118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 25 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm KH2PO4, 11 mm glucose, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% gelatin (pH 7.4). Aliquots (2 ml) of cell suspension were prewarmed at 37 °C for 5 min in 3-ml plastic cuvettes, and fluorescence was measured in a fluorometer (Johnson Foundation Biomedical Group) with magnetic stirring and temperature controlled at 37 °C. Excitation was set at 340 nm, and emission was set at 510 nm. [Ca2+] i was calculated as described for monocytes. For studies in monocytes on cross-desensitization of calcium responses, chemokines were added sequentially with a 2-min interval, and [Ca2+] i transients were recorded. The concentrations used in these studies varied for each chemokine and were set at levels known to induce the maximal response for [Ca2+] i mobilization (see above). Cell migration was evaluated using a 48-well modified Boyden microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). 25-μl aliquots of chemokines, diluted in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) were placed in the wells of the lower compartment, and 50-μl aliquots of monocyte suspension in RPMI 1640 (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were placed in the upper wells of the chamber; the two components were separated by a polycarbonate filter with a 5-μm pore size. The chamber was incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2, for 60 min. After incubation, the filter sheet was removed, and the nonmigrated cells were scraped from its upper surface. The filter was stained with Diff-Quik, and the number of migrated cells was counted (5 fields/well), using a × 40 objective and × 10 ocular containing a 10-mm2 counting grid. Multiple tissue blots were commercially purchased and prepared as described in the accompanying literature from the manufacturer. Denatured MCP-4 cDNA (50 ng) was labeled with [32P]CTP using Klenow reagent. Multiple tissue blots were probed using ExpressHyb solution and after washing were exposed on X-Omat (Kodak) x-ray development film for between 48 and 96 h. Total RNA (3 μg/sample) isolated from quiescent human pulmonary smooth muscle cells and cells treated with serum for the indicated times were immobilized on nitrocellulose filters and hybridized to either32P-labeled MCP-4 cDNA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, as described previously (22Elshourbagy N.A. Korman D.R. Wu H.-L. Sylvester D.R. Lee J.A. Nuthalaganti P. Bergsma D.J. Kumar C.S. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3873-3879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial antibodies used for the monitoring of the expression of recombinant MCP-4 were raised in rabbits after injection of a synthetic MCP-4 peptide (cysteine 58 to isoleucine 73). Subsequent polyclonal antibodies against MCP-4 were raised in rabbits using purified E. coli-expressed His-tagged MCP-4. The antiserum CS09, used for immunodetection of MCP-4 in the present study, was highly specific for MCP-4 (E. coli- as well as Drosophila-expressed MCP-4) and showed no cross-reactivity whatsoever with related chemokines (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, eotaxin, MIP-1α, or RANTES) in Western blot analysis. MCP-4 protein expression in human tissues was studied by Western blot analysis. Tissue-specific protein solutions of normal human tissues were obtained from CLONTECH, fractionated (75 μg of protein/lane) on a 16% polyacrylamide gel and blot on nitrocellulose membranes. Commercial, ready made human multiple tissue blots (75 μg of protein extracts of normal human tissues) were also used and obtained from DNA Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Immunoblots were probed with antiserum CS09 (1:2000 dilution) using the ECS (Amersham) detection system. The lower limit of detection was determined using dilutions of pure MCP-4 and found to be ∼1 ng of MCP-4. Tissues used in this study were coronary arteries (n = 6) from heart transplant recipients and carotid endarterectomy specimens (n = 2) from patients undergoing vascular reconstructive surgery for arterial occlusive disease. Tissue specimens were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Specimens were mounted in Tissue-Tek OCT compound embedding medium (Agar Scientific Ltd, Essex, UK) for cryostat sectioning. Serial transverse tissue sections (10 μm) were thaw mounted onto Superfrost+ slides (BDH, Leicestershire, UK). Sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min and stored at −70 °C until use. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method and the rabbit polyclonal antiserum for MCP-4 CS09 (see above). All incubations were done at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Briefly, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating slides in 0.6% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating sections in normal swine serum before applying the primary antibody. Optimal primary antibody concentrations were predetermined by titration, and slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:1000 dilution. Slides were then incubated in biotinylated swine anti-rabbit antibody (Dako, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 30 min, washed, and incubated with avidin/biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) for 30 min. Slides were then stained with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate (Vector Laboratories). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through a graded series of alcohols, and mounted in DPX. Negative controls were omission of primary antibody and substitution of primary antibody with normal rabbit serum. The cellular composition of the plaques was determined using the following mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-CD68, (a specific human monocyte/macrophage marker), anti-α-actin (smooth muscle), and anti-Von Willebrand factor (endothelial cells), all from Dako. The method was the same as above except that primary antibody incubations were for 30 min at room temperature. These were followed by incubation with a biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dako). The derived amino acid sequence of the full-length open reading frame for the novel chemokine is given in Fig. 1. Full-length MCP-4 consists of 98 amino acid residues, and an amino acid sequence alignment with known human chemokines showed a high homology to MCP-1 (62% similarity), MCP-3 (61%), and eotaxin (59%) with lower homologies to MCP-2, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (52, 37, 39, and 29%, respectively). Based upon these sequence homologies and functional properties (see below), we propose to adopt the name MCP-4 as used throughout this manuscript. To allow functional studies with this novel chemokine, MCP-4 was expressed inDrosophila S2 cells, a system previously shown to correctly recognize and remove human cytokine signal sequences (18Angelichio M. Beck J.A. Johansen H. Ivey-Hoyle M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5037-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Johanson K. Appelbaum E. Doyle M. Hensely P. Zhao B. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Young P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9459-9471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Growth medium from a stably transfected Drosophila S2 cell line carrying the expression vector for MCP-4 was analyzed by immunoblot, using an antiserum raised against a synthetic MCP-4 peptide. A 9-kDa protein band was detected that was absent from medium from control cells (Fig. 2 A). After purification by ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, the final preparation contained a 9-kDa species as visualized on a stained polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 B). Mass spectrometry showed a predominant peak with a mass of 8583 Da, corresponding to the size expected (8580 Da) for a protein extending from glutamine 24 (cyclized to pyroglutamatic acid) to the end of the open reading frame (Fig. 2 C). A minor peak at 8782 Da was also observed, which is close to the mass expected (8780 Da) for a molecule extending from leucine 22 to the end of the open reading frame. N-terminal sequence analysis indicated that most of the material in the preparation was blocked, as expected for a protein with an N-terminal pyroglutamatic acid. However, minor sequences starting at unblocked glutamine 24 (QPDALNVPST) and at leucine 22 (LAQPDALNVP) were detected. These results show that over 90% of the material in this preparation has glutamine 24 (cyclized or free) at the N terminus. This N-terminal sequence aligns very well with the consensus sequence QPDAV for mature human CC chemokines (compare Fig. 1) and is likely to represent the product of MCP-4 maturation in humans. The nature of the minor sequence in Drosophila cell expression (MCP-4 starting at leucine 22) is presently unknown; however, MCP-4 maturation by signal sequence cleavage at the glycine 21–leucine 22 bond and subsequent removal of the leucine 22-alanine 23 dipeptide seems unlikely, since proline at a position 3 residues upstream of a signal peptide cleavage site (as proline 19 would be) is not generally found (24Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The effect of mature (residues 24–98) MCP-4 (hereafter referred to as MCP-4) on chemotaxis of freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes was tested in a 48-well Boyden chamber and compared with chemotactic responses toward known human chemokines. Dose-response curves of these studies are given in Fig. 3. All chemokines gave the expected bell-shaped response curves with inhibition of chemotaxis at high chemokine concentrations due to receptor desensitization. MCP-4 was found to be a potent stimulator of monocyte chemotaxis (EC50 = 2.88 ± 0.15 nm), although less potent than MCP-1 (EC50 = 0.37 ± 0.05 nm), MCP-2 (0.62 ± 0.07 nm), MCP-3 (0.17 ± 0.02 nm), and MIP-1α (0.25 ± 0.06 nm). RANTES (2.74 ± 0.28 nm) had a similar potency. In similar studies with human neutrophils, MCP-4 (up to 330 nm) was found to be inactive (data not shown). The signal transduction pathway of most chemokines involves a transient rise in cytosolic calcium concentration. To investigate the effect of MCP-4 on cytosolic calcium concentration, monocytes were preloaded with Fura-2/AM, and [Ca2+] i concentrations in response to various chemokines were recorded. The dose-response relations between chemokine concentrations and the recorded maximal [Ca2+] i concentrations are given in Fig. 4. As shown previously (25Sozzani S. Luini W. Molino M. JiLek P. B"
https://openalex.org/W2118439704,"A genomic DNA fragment that complements a newly identified protein glycosylation-defective mutation, vig9, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned. Chromosomal integration of this fragment by homologous recombination indicated that it contains the wild type VIG9 gene. The nucleotide sequence was determined. A predicted gene product showed significant amino acid sequence homology with several bacterial enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of (deoxy)ribonucleotide diphosphate sugars from sugar phosphates and (deoxy)ribonucleotide triphosphate. We examined the enzyme activity to synthesize GDP-mannose in the cell extracts of the wild type, vig9–1 mutant, and VIG9transformant yeasts. Reduction of the activity in the mutant cell and its restoration by VIG9 suggested that the VIG9gene is the structural gene for GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase ofS. cerevisiae which catalyzes the production of GDP-mannose.

Most secretory and membrane proteins of eukaryotic cells are modified by glycosylation. Glycosylation endows protein with a wide variety of characteristics that are important in their cellular functions. Glycosylation occurs in the secretory pathway, and three types of modification are known: (i) attachment of N-linked saccharides to asparagine residues; (ii) attachment ofO-linked saccharides to serine or threonine residues; and (iii) attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors at the COOH termini. This is also the case with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although mannose is the main component ofN- and O-linked saccharides, and varieties of sugars are found in those of higher eukaryotes. In yeasts, the fourth type of protein-saccharide linkage was suggested for the covalent linkage between the cell wall proteins and glucans, although details are yet to be studied (1Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Several excellent reviews on glycosylation in yeasts have been published (2Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 3Herscovics H. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 4Kukuruzinska M.A. Bergh M.L.E. Jackson B.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 56: 915-944Google Scholar, 5Lehle L. Tanner W.

N-Linked saccharides are first transferred to proteins as a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 unit from the Dol 1The abbreviations used are: Dol, dolichol-GDP-Man, guanidine diphosphomannose; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; ORF, open reading frame. -PP-intermediate when proteins are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum. They are then trimmed to form the core N-linked saccharide, Man8GlcNAc2, which is common in eukaryotes. After proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus in S. cerevisiae, core N-linked saccharides receive various quantities of mannose, depending on the protein species, one by one from GDP-Man. O-Linked saccharides that are composed exclusively of mannose in S. cerevisiae are also transferred to proteins in the Golgi apparatus sequentially from GDP-Man except for the first mannose, which is transferred from Man-P-Dol in the endoplasmic reticulum. As mannose is the major component of both N- and O-linked saccharides in S. cerevisiae, formation of GDP-Man, the activated form of mannose, should be vitally important. In S. cerevisiae, genetic approaches have been utilized in many scientific studies. To study the mechanism and function of glycosylation, mutants defective in glycosylation have been obtained in various ways. The mnn mutants were selected based on changes in cell surface characteristics such as binding of dyes, ion exchange matrix, or antisera (2Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). [3H]Mannose suicide selection was used to obtain the alg mutants, which are defective in the formation of oligosaccharide-PP-Dol (6Huffaker T.C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3203-3210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the och1mutant (7Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Some of the sec mutants show the glycosylation-defective phenotype because glycosylation occurs during the process of secretion. Glycosylation mutants were also obtained as resistant or hypersensitive to chemicals or killer toxins; thevrg mutants were obtained by vanadate resistance (8Ballou L. Hitzeman R.A. Lewis M.S. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3209-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), thecwh mutants were obtained by Calcofluor White hypersensitivity (9Ram A.F.J. Wolters A. Hoopen R.T. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and the kre2 mutant was obtained by K1 killer toxin resistance (10Hill K. Boone C. Goebl M. Puccia R. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Genetics. 1992; 130: 273-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The erd1 mutant was obtained by a retention defect of the endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins (11Hardwick K.G. Lewis M.J. Semenza J. Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Studies of these mutants and the cloned wild type genes have been helpful in elucidating the biosynthetic enzymes and intermediate structures of oligosaccharides. To increase the collection of glycosylation-defective mutants, we screened for vanadate-resistant colonies as described previously but not screened exhaustively by Ballou et al. (8Ballou L. Hitzeman R.A. Lewis M.S. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3209-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This selection is excellent because mutants are positively selected, although the biochemical rationale of enrichment is not clear. We isolated glycosylation-defective mutants of nine complementation groups. 2A. Sakakibara, H. Hashimoto, M. Yamasaki, and K. Yoda, in preparation. One of them, vig9(vanadate-resistant and immatureglycosylation), was found to be a novel mutation defective in the formation of GDP-Man. We report here the cloning and analysis ofVIG9, the structural gene for GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase ofS. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae TM10 (MATa, leu2 his3 ura3 trp1), W303 (MATa/α, ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 trp1/trp1 his3/his3 ade2/ade2 can1/can1), M9–2D (MATα, mnn9 ade2 lys2 leu2 trp1 his3 ura3), H17–6C (MATα, vig9–1 leu2 ura3 trp1), J12 (MATa, vig9–2 lys1), and H17W (MATa/α, vig9–1/vig9–1 ADE2/ade2 HIS3/his3 leu2/leu2 ura3/ura3) were used. Escherichia coli DH5α (F−, supE44 ΔlacU169 φ80lacZΔM15 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) was used in plasmid propagation, andE. coli BL21/pT-groE (F−, ompT hsdS gal dcm, pT-groE) was used in preparation of GST fusion proteins (12Yasukawa T.

Yeast was usually grown at 30 °C in YEPD (1% Bacto yeast extract (Difco), 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% glucose) medium or in SD (0.67% Bacto yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose, and appropriate supplements) medium. Invertase-inducing medium, YEP2S, contained 2% sucrose instead of glucose in YEPD. Solid media were supplemented with 2% Bacto-agar (Difco). Standard methods were used (13Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 2nd ed. Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar, 14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Enzymes were purchased from either Boehringer Mannheim or Takara Shuzo Co. pRS series plasmids (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pYES2.0 (Invitrogen) were used as vectors. The secretory invertase was analyzed according to the method of Gabriel and Wang (16Gabriel O. Wang S.-F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in 1 ml of YEPD medium, centrifuged, washed with water, resuspended in 1 ml of YEP2S, and incubated further for 2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once, and incubated in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.9 m sorbitol, 0.1 m EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Kogyo) at 37 °C for 30 min. The released periplasmic fraction was separated from spheroplasts by centrifugation. To analyze the native enzyme, the periplasmic fraction was subjected to 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was bathed in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.1, containing 0.1 m sucrose at 37 °C for 1 h, washed with water, placed in 0.1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, 0.5m NaOH, and boiled to detect red bands. To analyze the denatured enzyme, the periplasmic proteins were labeled with biotin by adding d-biotinoyl-ε-aminocapronic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (100 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim), and the reaction was stopped by NH4Cl (50 mm). This solution was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h after adding anti-invertase antiserum and then 8 h after adding protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Beads were washed with TBSN (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) three times. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected with Streptoavidin-peroxidase. Endoglycosidase H (0.3 milliunits/μl, Seikagaku Kogyo) treatment was done in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.5 mm 4-amidophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 37 °C for 12 h. Native chitinase was isolated from the supernatant of the saturated cultures of S. cerevisiae grown in YEPD as described by Kuranda and Robbins (17Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19758-19767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant of the 10-ml culture was mixed with 30 mg of purified chitin (Sigma) to allow binding of chitinase. Chitin was then pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The washed pellet was suspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer, heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 6% resolving gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. H17–6C (vig9–1) was transformed with a yeast genomic library constructed on pRS314 (ARSH4 CEN6 TRP1; a kind gift of A. Yamamoto) by the lithium acetate method (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trp+ transformants were selected and maintained on SD medium and tested for complementation of the geneticin-sensitive phenotype. Plasmids were isolated from the candidate transformants and propagated in E. coli. All of the unique plasmids were retransformed into H17–6C to verify the ability to complement the glycosylation defect. Appropriate fragments were subcloned on plasmid pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene), and deletions were constructed by a double-stranded nested deletion kit (Pharmacia). These clones were sequenced by using the Sequenase modification of the dideoxy chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) with dye primers and Applied Biosystems Inc. DNA sequencer model 373A. Sequences were analyzed with computer programs (Genetyx CD, Software Development Co., Tokyo). The disruption plasmid pSV924 was constructed by cloning the HpaI/SalI fragment containing the LEU2 gene in theHpaI/SalI site of the VIG9 gene. A diploid yeast, W303, was transformed with the Δvig9::LEU2 fragment excised from pSV924 byHindIII and SacI. Leu+ transformants were selected, and disruption of one copy of VIG9 was confirmed by Southern blotting. Spores were developed and dissected to examine essentiality of the VIG9 gene. Yeast cells were collected, washed in cold washing solution (1.4 m sorbitol, 10 mm sodium azide), and converted to spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were pelleted and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.001 volume of protease inhibitor mixture (1 mg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and antipain)) and lysed osmotically. The lysate was immediately centrifuged at 750 × g for 3 min to remove debris and further centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h to produce a supernatant. The protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of the above cell extract was incubated in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm mannose 1-phosphate, 0.2 mm GTP, 50 mm GDP, 50 mm GMP, and 0.1 mCi/ml [α-32P]GTP (specific activity 3,000 Ci/mmol, ICN) at 25 °C. Samples were withdrawn, mixed with equal amounts of stop solution (100 mm GTP, 100 mm EDTA), and frozen in dry ice-ethanol to stop the reaction. Amounts of [32P]GDP-Man formed in samples were determined with an Image Analyzer (Fuji, BAS2000) after separating the GDP-Man by chromatography on a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer (Merck). The amounts of radioactive materials are expressed as photostimulated luminescence, calculated by the Image Analyzer. The DNA encoding Vig9 protein was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using primer oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCATGAAAGGTTTAATTTTAGTCGG and 5′-CGCTCGAGGGCGCAGAACAGATCATCA and inserted in pGEX-4T-3 (Pharmacia) after cleavage with BamHI and XhoI to construct pSV930, which has an inducible gene encoding GST-Vig9 fusion protein.E. coli BL21/pT-groE (12Yasukawa T.

Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.05 mm) was added, and incubation was continued at 26.5 °C for 2 h and 4 °C for 1 h before harvest. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication, and GST-Vig9 protein or GST was adsorbed to 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) at 4 °C for 1 h. After five washes with 1 ml of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mmglutathione. GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase assay was done in 50 μl of reaction mix containing 0.05 μg of GST-Vig9 protein or GST at 25 °C for 10 min. Yeast cells that were grown to A 600 nm = 1.0 in YEPD medium were transferred to YEP4G (containing 4% galactose instead of glucose in YEPD) medium containing 1 μg/ml [14C]mannose and incubated for 2 h (21Byrd J.C. Tarentino A.L. Maley F. Atkinson P.H. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14657-14666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then converted to spheroplasts and lyzed by suspending in lysis buffer (0.2 m sorbitol, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was analyzed by silica thin layer chromatography (n-butyl alcohol:acetic acid:water, 4:1:2). The amount of intracellular GDP-Man was determined as the radioactivity of the spot of GDP-Man by Image Analyzer. We obtained two independent vig9 mutants among 331 spontaneous vanadate-resistant isolates. H17 (vig9–1) and J12 (vig9–2) were able to grow on YEPD medium containing up to 5 mm vanadate and on SD medium containing up to 4 mm vanadate. Both mutants grow well at either 25 or 37 °C as the parent yeast. Sensitivity of the mutants to 5-fluorouracil, hygromycin B, and cycloheximide was not altered from the parent strain. However, vig9 mutants showed hypersensitivity to geneticin (G418). They could not grow on YEPD plates containing geneticin at 50 μg/ml, but the parent yeast grew well in the presence of geneticin at 100 μg/ml. The degree of glycosylation was determined by analyzing with secretory invertase for N-glycosylation and extracellular chitinase for O-glycosylation. As shown in Fig.1 A, invertase of the vig9–1mutant migrated faster than that of the wild type in native gel electrophoresis. The difference of mobility is due to the degree of glycosylation because the invertase polypeptides showed the same mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after removal of saccharides by endoglycosidase H treatment (Fig. 1 B).N-Glycosylation of the vig9–1 mutant was moderately defective as the rate of migration of invertase was between those of the wild type and the mnn9 mutant. EachN-linked saccharide in the mnn9 mutant is only 5 mannose residues larger than the core oligosaccharide (22Tsai P.-K. Frevert J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3805-3811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).O-Glycosylation was also affected in the vig9mutants (Fig. 1 B). Vanadate-resistant, geneticin-hypersensitive, and glycosylation-defective phenotypes were all recessive and cosegregated during three cycles of back-crossing. To clone the wild type VIG9 gene, we used geneticin hypersensitivity of the vig9 mutant as a selective marker. We transformed H17–6C with a genomic library of the wild type S. cerevisiae constructed on pRS314 and screened for Trp+transformants, which can grow on a YEPD plate containing geneticin at 100 μg/ml. Twenty-seven candidate transformants were tested further for vanadate sensitivity and N-glycosylation of invertase. Plasmid DNAs from four transformants that showed the wild type level of vanadate sensitivity and glycosylation of invertase were recovered inE. coli, and the restriction maps were constructed. These plasmids contained three kinds of overlapping inserts. Deletion and subcloning analysis of the fragment in pSV903 indicated that a 2.5-kilobase HindIII-Sau3A1/BamHI fragment was responsible for complementation. The 2.5-kilobase minimal fragment was cloned in a integration vector (pRS305) to make pSV921. This plasmid was integrated in the chromosome of a vig9–1/vig9–1 diploid yeast (H17W) by homologous recombination. Tetrad analysis of 26 asci of the transformant indicated that pSV921 was integrated at the vig9–1 locus. Thus, the insert contains the authentic VIG9 gene. We determined the nucleotide sequence of the 2498-base pair insert of pSV914 and found an open reading frame (ORF) of 1083 nucleotides which encodes a polypeptide of 361 amino acids. After submission of our manuscript, the complete nucleotide sequence of the S. cerevisiae genome was determined, and this ORF had a systematic name of YDL055C on the chromosome IV. The predicted molecular mass is 39,565 Da, and the pI is 5.93. There are three potential TATA sequences of the promoter elements at nucleotide −258 to −251 (TATATATA), −70 to −67 (TATA), and −14 to −8 (TATAAA) in the 5′ upstream of the ORF. If the last candidate is selected, the putative initiation methionine (nucleotides 1–3) is too close to it, and an alternate methionine at nucleotides 97–99 will be used in this case. However, this possibility is unlikely because the deduced NH2-terminal amino acid sequence is highly conserved with the NH2-terminal sequences of bacterial proteins of similar function as described below. Consensus poly(A)-polymerase recognition sequences (AATAAA) are found at nucleotides 1238–1243, 1256–1261, and 1308–1313 in the 3′ downstream of the ORF. No consensus splicing motif (5′-GTAPyGT … TACTAAC … PyAG-3′) was found in the insert of pSV914. This ORF should represent the VIG9 gene. To examine whetherVIG9 is essential for yeast cell growth, we constructed a diploid yeast in which one copy of VIG9 was disrupted. Disruption was achieved by replacing a HpaI-SalI fragment of one copy of VIG9 with LEU2 in W303 (Fig. 2 A). Disruption was confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig. 2 B). After sporulation, 31 asci were dissected on YEPD at 30 °C. Only two spores among each tetrad outgrew, and all viable colonies were auxotrophic for leucine (Fig.2 C). Another gene disruption with TRP1 also gave similar results. Thus, the VIG9 gene is essential for yeast cell growth. Fig. 3 shows the hydropathy profile of the predicted Vig9 protein. Vig9 is a hydrophilic protein without any hydrophobic stretch long enough to function as a secretory signal sequence or transmembrane domain. This suggests that Vig9 protein is a soluble cytoplasmic protein. Comparison of the predicted Vig9 protein sequence with a data base using the FASTA program (23Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) indicated the sequence was a novel one. However, significant homology between Vig9 protein and several bacterial proteins was found (Fig. 4). Those bacterial proteins have a common characteristic. RfbF protein of Salmonella typhimurium, which is 32.7% identical in 251 amino acids to Vig9 protein, catalyzes the synthesis of CDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and CTP in the biosynthetic pathway of O-antigen (24Jiang X.M. Neal Santiago B.F. Lee S.J. Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). RfbF protein of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is 31.1% identical in 257 amino acids to Vig9 protein (25Kessler A.J. Haase A. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RfbA protein ofYersinia enterocolitica is 27.6% identical in 254 amino acids and catalyzes the synthesis of dTDP-l-rhamnose. 3L. Zhang, A. Al-Hendy, P. Toivanen, and M. Skuruik, EMBL accession number S28577. StrD protein of Streptomyces griseus, which is 23.3% identical in 339 amino acids, catalyzes the synthesis of dTDP-streptose (26Distler J. Ebert A. Mansouri K. Pissowotzki K. Stockmann M. Piepersberg W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8041-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). So, all of these enzymes catalyze the synthesis of (deoxy)NDP-sugar from sugar phosphate and (deoxy)NTP. Homology with these enzymes having this common characteristic suggests that Vig9 protein may function as GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase, which catalyzes the formation of GDP-Man from mannose 1-phosphate and GTP. Cell extracts were prepared from yeast cells and assayed for GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase activity. Fig. 5 shows that the amount of radioactive GDP-Man formed from [α-32P]GTP and mannose 1-phosphate was linearly dependent on the amount of protein in the reaction mixture. The amount of the labeled GDP-Man increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 shows the effect of adding a 10-fold molar excess (2 mm) of cold NTPs on the formation of labeled GDP-Man. The authentic substrate, GTP, competitively reduced the amount of radioactive GDP-Man to 18% of that of the control reaction. The others also affected the formation of GDP-Man: ATP to 51%, UTP to 67%, and CTP to 87%. Although ATP showed relatively severe interference, we have not examined whether ADP-Man was formed or not. If the cell extract was omitted, the radioactivity in the region of the thin layer film corresponding to the spot of GDP-Man was 2.8% of the control reaction (the background count). When mannose 1-phosphate was omitted, the amount of labeled GDP-Man formed was 7.1% of the control reaction, which may indicate that only a small amount of mannose 1-phosphate is present in the cell extract. Stimulation of the reaction by the addition of pyrophosphatase to remove pyrophosphate, the other reaction product, was not significant in our assay condition (data not shown).Figure 6Activity of GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase in wild type, vig9–1 mutant, and their transformants. The enzyme activities were determined as described under “Materials and Methods” by the incorporation of [32P]GDP into GDP-Man. The protein concentration was 37 μg, and the reaction was performed at 25 °C. Samples were withdrawn from the reaction mixture at time intervals, and GDP-Man was separated by chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer. Cell extracts from TM10 (wild type, ○), H17–6C (vig9, □), H17–6C/pSV914 (vig9 carrying single copy VIG9, ▪) and TM10/pSV923 (wild type carrying multicopy VIG9, •) were used as enzymes sources. A mixture of extracts from TM10 and H17–6C was also examined (▵). The amount of [32P]GDP-Man formed was expressed as relative values to that obtained with the cell extract of TM10/pSV923 at 10 min (9.1 × 10−16mol).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Competitive effect of nucleoside triphosphates. A 10-fold excess of nucleoside triphosphate (2 mm) over GTP (0.2 mm) was added to the standard reaction to examine its competition with the authentic substrate. [32P]GDP-Man formed is shown as values relative to those in the standard reaction using the lysate of TM10 (2.3 × 10−16 mol of [32P]GDP-Man was formed with 37 μg of protein after incubation at 25 °C for 10 min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extract of the vig9–1 mutant cells had a practically negligible activity to form GDP-Man (Fig. 6, H17–6C). This result suggests that the vig9 mutation affects the GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase activity. A mixture of equal amounts of extracts from wild type and vig9–1 cells supported the formation of the same amount of GDP-Man as did the wild type extract (Fig. 6, TM10 + H17–6C). This result indicates that the vig9 mutation did not function to produce inhibitory products or catalyze a reaction that reduces the amount of GDP-Man; this is in agreement with the recessive nature of vig9 mutations. Upon introduction of a single-copyVIG9 plasmid, the vig9 mutant cells recovered the GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase activity to the wild type level (Fig. 6, H17–6C/pSV914). Furthermore, the extract of wild type cells carrying a multicopy VIG9 plasmid showed a 3–4-fold increased activity to form GDP-Man (Fig. 6, TM10/pSV923). These results further support that VIG9 is the structural gene for GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase in accordance with the prediction from the homology between VIG9 protein and the bacterial enzymes. To demonstrate that the Vig9 protein catalyzes the formation of GDP-Man, we constructed a plasmid that produces a GST-Vig9 fusion protein as described under “Materials and Methods.” The affinity-purified GST-Vig9 protein had activity to synthesize [32P]GDP-Man from [α-32P]GTP and mannose 1-phosphate, whereas the fusion partner GST did not (Fig.8). We further examined the effect of the reduced activity of GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase in the vig9 mutant. Cells of the wild type and vig9–1 mutant were grown in the presence of [14C]mannose, and the amount of GDP-Man in the cell extracts was determined. Five independent experiments demonstrated that the amount of GDP-Man in vig9–1 mutant cells was 70.6% of that of the wild type cells. This result indicates that the substrate of mannosylation is a limiting factor of glycosylation and the direct cause of the glycosylation defect in the vig9–1mutants. We have isolated a new glycosylation-defective mutation,vig9, among vanadate-resistant mutants. The biochemical rationale of this enrichment is not clear (8Ballou L. Hitzeman R.A. Lewis M.S.

However, its precise role and targets in normal and abnormal hematopoietic cells remain to be determined. We identified two novel tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins associated with SHP-2 in hematopoietic cells. The first, a 97-kDa cytosolic protein (p97), associates inducibly with SHP-2 upon cytokine stimulation and constitutively in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. In contrast, p135, a 135-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, forms a distinct complex with SHP-2, independent of cytokine stimulation or Bcr-Abl transformation. Far Western analysis reveals that SHP-2, via its Src homology 2 domains, can interact directly with either protein. In vitro dephosphorylation experiments, as well as transient transfection studies using wild type and mutant SHP-2 constructs, suggest that p97 and p135 also are SHP-2 substrates.

Via its SH2 domains, SHP-2 binds directly to several RTKs, as well as to accessory molecules such as IRS-1 and Gab-1 (4Tonks N.K. Neel B.G.

Commun. 1995; 214: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) of Ras in insulin signaling, and genetic analyses of Sevenless signaling in Drosophila suggest thatcsw either acts upstream and downstream of Ras and/or in a parallel pathway (15Allard J.D. Chang H.C. Herbst R. McNeill H. Simon M.A. Development. 1996; 122: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since numerous lines of evidence indicate that the PTP domain is required for SHP-2 function, identifying SHP-2 substrates should provide critical insights into its mechanism(s) of action. Recently, potential substrates for both csw and SHP-2 in RTK signaling have been identified. Genetic and biochemical evidence strongly suggest that Dos (for Daughter of Sevenless) is a substrate for csw in the Sevenless pathway (20Raabe T. Riesgo-Escovar J. Liu X. Bausenwein B.S. Deak P.

An EpoR mutant that abolishes interaction with SHP-2 exhibits decreased mitogenic potential (30Tauchi T. Damen J.E. Toyama K. Feng G.-S. Broxmeyer H.E. Krystal G. Blood. 1996; 87: 4495-4501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas cells expressing a mutant gp130 that results in elimination of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 fail to proliferate upon ligand stimulation (33Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). However, SHP-2 targets in these pathways remain to be identified. SHP-2 is constitutively tyrosyl-phosphorylated in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells and has been reported to bind to Bcr-Abl (34Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Song H.Y. Donner D. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15381-15387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role, if any, that SHP-2 plays in Bcr-Abl transformation as well as the identities of SHP-2 targets in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells remain unclear. To further our understanding of SHP-2's functions in hematopoietic cells, we searched for tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins that associate with SHP-2 in response to cytokine stimulation and upon Bcr-Abl transformation. We identified two novel SHP-2-associated tyrosyl phosphoproteins, p97 and p135, in cytokine-induced and Bcr-Abl-transformed BaF3 cells. p97, a cytosolic protein, is the major tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein associated with SHP-2 in response to IL3, GM-CSF, or Epo. Although consistent with previous results (34Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Song H.Y. Donner D. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15381-15387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we find SHP-2 associated with Bcr-Abl, p97 is the major SHP-2-binding phosphotyrosyl protein in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. p135, a membrane-associated glycoprotein, associates constitutively with SHP-2 in a distinct complex. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo data suggest that p97 and p135 may be SHP-2 substrates. Our results suggest that SHP-2 may regulate the phosphorylation of at least two proteins in hematopoietic cells, and suggest that Bcr-Abl transformation leads to constitutive phosphorylation of one of these proteins. BaF3 cells overexpressing the mouse EpoR (BaF3-EpoR) or the human GM-CSFR (BaF3-GM-CSFR) were provided by Dr. Alan D'Andrea (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). IL3-dependent cell lines were passaged routinely in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1000 μg/ml streptomycin, and 15% conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells (WEHI-CM). The generation and culturing of BaF3 and 32D cell lines stably transformed by p210 Bcr-Abl or p190 Bcr-Abl have been described (35Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M. Pistick E. Xu G.

Where indicated, cells were starved in RPMI plus 0.8% bovine serum albumin for 8–10 h and then simulated with 15% WEHI-CM, 20 ng/ml murine IL3 (Biosource, Camarillo, CA), 50 units/ml Epo (Dr. Alan D'Andrea), or 20 ng/ml human GM-CSF (Biosource) for the times indicated.

The resulting fragments were digested with EcoRI and ligated to pBSSKHA (kindly provided by Dr. K. Ravichandran, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), placing two tandem repeats of HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) followed by a stop codon at the respective C termini of the inserted cDNAs. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The SHP-2-HA and SHP-2(Cys → Ser)-HA inserts were released from the plasmid backbone byXbaI-HindIII digestion and subcloned into pRC/CMV (Invitrogen), which directs expression of inserted cDNAs under control of the CMV promoter, generating pRC/CMVSHP-2HA and pRC/CMVSHP-2CSHA. Anti-SHP-2 polyclonal antisera (no. 986) were generated against a full-length SHP-2-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein (36Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 309-311Google Scholar). Some experiments utilized affinity-purified anti-SHP-2 antibodies, which were prepared as described (38Lechleider R.J. Freeman Jr., R.M. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13434-13438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-peptide antibodies against the SHP-2 C terminus, polyclonal antibodies against the β common chain of the IL3/GM-CSF receptors and the murine IL3 receptor β subunit and monoclonal anti-GST antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-SHP-2 antibodies, used for immunoblotting, were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc (Lake Placid, NY). The 12CA5 hybridoma, which produces anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, was a gift of Dr. Raymond L. Erickson (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). Cell lysates (107 cells/0.35 ml of lysis buffer) were prepared using Nonidet P-40 buffer as described previously (39Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Immune complexes were collected, washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (39Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (0.5 μg/ml) or monoclonal anti-SHP-2 antibodies (1:1000 dilution) as indicated, incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:8500 dilution), and developed using ECL (Amersham). A GST fusion protein (GST-N+C-SH2) containing both SH2 domains of SHP-2 (8Hausdorff S.F. Bennett A.M. Neel B.G. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Protein blots on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/Tween, incubated with GST-N+C-SH2 (1.5 μg/ml), probed with monoclonal anti-GST antibodies (1:1000 dilution), and developed using appropriate secondary antibodies and ECL. BaF3 and BaF3 p210 Bcr-Abl cells were washed once with methionine-free (Met−) DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated in Met− DMEM at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were transferred to 300 μCi/ml Tran35S-Label (DuPont NEN) in Met− DMEM for 2.5 h at 37 °C. A portion of the radiolabeled BaF3 cells was stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL3 at 37 °C for 10 min; the remainder was left unstimulated. Metabolically labeled cells were lysed and subjected to anti-SHP-2 immunoprecipitations and SDS-PAGE. The gel was fluorographed by treatment (30 min) with 1m sodium salicylate and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Bands corresponding to the SHP-2-associated p97 protein from IL3-induced and p210 Bcr-Abl-transformed cells were excised. Gel slices were rehydrated in SDS-PAGE stacking gel buffer, subjected to partial V-8 protease analysis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, essentially as described previously (40Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.1) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (39Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and incubated on ice for 10 min. All other manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Swollen cells were broken in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer (50 strokes), and mixed with 0.2 volume of 1.5m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA. The crude nuclear (P1) fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 1000 × gfor 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to obtain crude microsomal (P100) and cytosolic (S100) fractions. All fractions were adjusted to Nonidet P-40 buffer conditions (39Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), clarified at 100,00 × g, and immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-2 antibodies as described above. BaF3 cells pretreated with 100 μm pervanadate (15 min) were lysed and incubated with anti-SHP-2 antibodies (986) cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, neutralized, and incubated with ConA or WGA beads (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mmNa3VO4. Lectin beads were washed, boiled in sample buffer, and the eluates subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. For endoglycosidase F analysis, SHP-2 immune complexes prepared from pervanadate-treated BaF3 cells were boiled for 2 min in 15 μl of 0.4% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, mixed with 40 μl of a solution containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mmNa3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture, and 60 units of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and boiling. GST fusion proteins containing full-length SHP-1 (41Plutzky J. Neel B. Rosenberg R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) or full-length SHP-2 were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads and eluted with neutralized glutathione. Enzymatic activities of the GST fusion proteins were determined usingpara-nitrophenol phosphate, as described previously (42Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). SHP-2 immune complexes prepared from pervanadate-treated BaF3 cells were washed twice with dephosphorylation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with equivalent amounts of GST-SHP-1 (1 μg) or GST-SHP-2 (4 μg) fusion protein in dephosphorylation assay buffer for 1 or 5 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by washing the immune complexes with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 2 mmNa3VO4. BaF3 and BaF3-p210 cells (107) were washed twice in RPMI (serum-free), incubated with 20 μg of plasmid DNA for 10 min at 37 °C, and subjected to electroporation using a Gene Pulser™ (Bio-Rad) at 340 V, 960 microfarads. Twenty-four hours post-electroporation, BaF3 cells were starved in RPMI containing 0.8% bovine serum albumin for 8 h, and then stimulated with 15% WEHI-CM for 10 min. Transfected BaF3 p210 cells were collected 36 h post-electroporation. Previous studies implicated SHP-2 in signaling via receptors (IL3, GM-CSF) that utilize the IL3 receptor β common (βc) chain (28Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the participation of SHP-2 in IL3-induced signaling in the IL3-dependent cell line, BaF3. As expected from the results of multiple previous studies, addition of 15% WEHI-CM (as a source of IL3) to factor-starved BaF3 cells induced rapid tyrosyl phosphorylation of multiple proteins (data not shown). We examined SHP-2 phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions in response to IL3 stimulation by anti-SHP-2 immunoprecipitations followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig.1 A). As expected from a previous report (28Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SHP-2 became tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to IL3 addition. Interestingly, however, upon IL3 stimulation, a major tyrosyl phosphoprotein, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 97 kDa (hereafter termed p97), was found associated with SHP-2. Comparable amounts of SHP-2 were recovered in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates from unstimulated and IL3-stimulated cells, as shown by reprobing the anti-phosphotyrosine blot with anti-SHP-2 antibodies (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained using recombinant IL3 (data not shown, but see Fig. 5 A). The increased intensity of the p97 band in SHP-2 immune complexes following IL3 stimulation indicates enhanced tyrosyl phosphorylation and/or enhanced association of p97 with SHP-2.Figure 5A, pervanadate treatment of BaF3 cells increases tyrosyl phosphorylation of p97 and p135. BaF3 cells were starved (−), and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL3 for 10 min (IL3) or 100 μm pervanadate for 15 min (PV), or were pervanadate-pretreated for 15 min and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL3 for 10 min (PV+IL3). Anti-SHP2 immune complexes were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. B, SHP-2 can dephosphorylate p97 and p135in vitro. Pervanadate-treated BaF3 cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-2 antibodies (986). Immune complexes were washed (control), incubated with dephosphorylation buffer alone (AB) or dephosphorylation buffer containing GST-SHP-2 (SHP-2) or GST-SHP-1 (SHP-1) fusion proteins for the indicated times at 37 °C, resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti-SHP-2 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also noted the presence of a weakly tyrosyl-phosphorylated band with an apparent molecular mass of 135 kDa (hereafter termed p135) in SHP-2 immune complexes (Fig. 1 A, but note that p135 is seen more easily in Fig. 1 B and later figures). Both p97 and p135 were found to co-immunoprecipitate with SHP-2 using several different SHP-2 antibodies, arguing that they form complexes with SHP-2 rather than sharing SHP-2 epitopes (see also additional experiments below). We next examined the kinetics of association between SHP-2 and tyrosyl-phosphorylated p97 and p135 in more detail (Fig. 1,B and D). A small amount of tyrosyl-phosphorylated, SHP-2-associated p97 can be detected within 1 min of IL3 addition to factor-starved cells. With time, the amount of tyrosyl-phosphorylated, SHP-2-associated p97 increases, reaching peak levels by about 10 min and remaining at this level for at least 30 min post-stimulation. Conversely, a low level of tyrosyl-phosphorylated p135 co-immunoprecipitated with SHP-2 in the absence or presence of IL3, and its phosphorylation (and/or extent of association) increased minimally, if at all, upon"
https://openalex.org/W2025233098,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a putative second messenger that has been demonstrated to mobilize Ca2+in many cell types. Its postulated role as the endogenous regulator of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels has been greatly supported by the advent and use of specific cADPR receptor antagonists such as 8-NH2-cADPR (Walseth, T. F., and Lee, H. C. (1993)Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1178, 235–242). However, investigations of the role of cADPR in physiological responses, such as fertilization, stimulus-secretion coupling, and excitation-contraction coupling, have been hindered by the susceptibility of cADPR receptor antagonists to hydrolysis and the need to introduce these molecules into cells by microinjection or patch clamp techniques. We have recently reported on the discovery of a poorly hydrolyzable analogue of cADPR, 7-deaza-cADPR (Bailey, V. C., Sethi, J. K., Fortt, S. M., Galione, A., and Potter, B. V. L. (1997) Chem. Biol. 4, 41–51) but this, like cADPR, is an agonist of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels. We therefore explored the possibility of combining antagonistic activity with that of hydrolytic resistance and now report on the biological properties of the first hydrolysis-resistant cADPR receptor antagonist, 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR. In addition this compound has the advantage of being membrane-permeable.

Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This finding has led to the postulation that cADPR may be the endogenous/physiological regulator of ryanodine receptors (5Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

As is the case for the more established intracellular messengers (i.e. IP3, cAMP, and cGMP), cADPR-metabolizing enzymes are also present that can modulate cADPR levels (11Rusinko N. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11725-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic activity of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and catabolic activity of cADPR hydrolase are often co-localized on the same polypeptide. In these cases, the hydrolase activity often exceeds that of cyclase (1Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. 48. Academic Press Ltd., London1994: 199-257Google Scholar). However, one notable exception is Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase, which is isolated and purified from soluble ovotestis extracts of the sea hare Aplysia californica. The exceptionally high level of cyclase activity exhibited by this enzyme (1Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. 48. Academic Press Ltd., London1994: 199-257Google Scholar) has been well exploited to synthesize large quantities of cADPR. In addition, the finding that this cyclase exhibits loose substrate specificity has allowed the development of a chemoenzymatic synthesis of a number of cADPR analogues (12Ashamu, G. A., Galione, A., and Potter, B. V. L. (1995) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1359 (abstr.).Google Scholar). The first series of pharmacologically useful cADPR analogues to be synthesized was the 8-substituted analogues (13Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These differ from cADPR by a substitution at the 8-position of the adenine ring. This single modification abolishes the agonistic activity of these compounds and produces instead specific competitive antagonists of cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ release (13Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).

However, like the parent compound, cADPR, the 8-substituted analogues are prone to hydrolysis by endogenous enzymes (13Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed this may explain the absence of an inhibitory effect on secretogogue-induced Ca2+ release in rat pancreatic beta cells (19Willmott N.J. Galione A. Smith P.A. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) during induction of long-term depression in Purkinje neurons (16Linden D.J. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5098-5105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where a role for cADPR-mediated Ca2+ signaling remains controversial. These observations underscore the need for a stable, hydrolysis-resistant cADPR antagonist. Recently, we reported on the synthesis of another analogue of cADPR, 7-deaza-cADPR, and demonstrated that it is more stable during heat-induced hydrolysis and is also a poor substrate for cADPR hydrolase (20Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Fortt S.M. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These changes in stability were also brought about by a single modification, a replacement of the 7-position nitrogen with carbon (Fig. 1 A). These findings then raised an intriguing question; what would be the biological activity of a compound modified at both the 7- and 8-positions of the adenosine ring? A “hybrid” analogue was successfully synthesized, namely 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR (Fig. 1 A). Its biological properties were examined and are reported herein. Our findings show that 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR retains useful pharmacological properties;i.e. it is a hydrolysis-resistant antagonist of cADPR-induced Ca2+ release. Furthermore, owing to the lipophilic nature of the bromo and CH moieties, we have explored its potential as a membrane-permeable analogue of cADPR, as has been established for 8-bromo-cGMP, cf. cGMP (21Butt E. Nolte C. Schulz S. Beltman J. Beavo J.A. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A single molecular species exhibiting all three properties would be a very powerful pharmacological tool for investigations of cADPR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in intact cells. We report here that 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR could be such a tool.Figure 1A, structural formulas of cADPR, 7-deaza-cADPR, 8-bromo-cADPR, and 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR. Modifications were made to cADPR at the 7- and 8-positions of the adenosine ring. The N7 nitrogen atom is replaced with a carbon (and associated proton) to form 7-deaza-cADPR whereas 8-bromo-cADPR is formed by substituting the hydrogen on the C-8 position with a bromine atom. 7-Deaza-8-bromo-cADPR has both of these modifications.

L. pictus egg homogenates (2.5%, v/v) containing the Ca2+-sensitive dye, fluo-3 (3 μm) was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots (500 μl) of these were challenged with 5 μl of cyclic compounds to give a final cuvette concentration of 2 μm. The Ca2+ release profiles observed are shown and are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The detailed synthesis and chemical analysis of 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR is discussed elsewhere (22Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1997; 7: 695-696Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7-deazaadenosine (tubercidin) was brominated (23Bergstrom D.E. Brattesani A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and selectively phosphorylated with phosphorus oxychloride to yield 7-deaza-8-bromo-AMP using a general method (24Yoshikawa M. Kato T. Takenishi T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1969; 42: 3505Crossref Google Scholar). This was then coupled to nicotinamide mononucleotide to form 7-deaza-8-bromo-β-NAD+ as has been described previously for 7-deaza-β-NAD+ (20Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Fortt S.M. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The enzymatic cyclization of 7-deaza-8-bromo-NAD+ to 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR was catalyzed by crude Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and the product was purified by ion-exchange chromatography (12Ashamu, G. A., Galione, A., and Potter, B. V. L. (1995) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1359 (abstr.).Google Scholar, 20Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Fortt S.M. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient for 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR was determined by total phosphate analysis to be λmax = 277 nm, 10.85 × 103m−1 cm−1, and this value was used to determine the concentrations of 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR used in the rest of the study. In vitro Ca2+ release assays were performed on sea urchin egg homogenates (2.5%, v/v) prepared from unfertilizedLytechinus pictus eggs according to the method of Clapperet al. (25Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications as described previously (26Sethi J.K. Empson R.M. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Extramicrosomal Ca2+ was thus measured by monitoring changes in fluo-3 (3 μm) fluorescence (excitation 490 nm and emission 530 nm) in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorimeter. All additions (not exceeding 5 μl) were made to cuvettes (containing 500 μl of homogenate) in intracellular medium containing potassium gluconate, 250 mm; N-methylglucamine, 250 mm; Hepes, 20 mm (pH 7.2); MgCl2, 1 mm; ATP, 0.5 mm; phosphocreatine, 10 mm; creatine phosphokinase, 10 units/ml; oligomycin, 1 μg/ml; antimycin, 1 μg/ml; sodium azide, 1 mm; EGTA, 10 μm. Ca2+ imaging of intact cells was performed using unfertilized L. pictus eggs microinjected with 2 μm fura-2 and 250 μg/ml heparin as described previously (26Sethi J.K. Empson R.M. Galione A. Biochem.

Fluo-3 and fura-2 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. All other chemicals were from Sigma (London). Cyclic ADP-ribose, 8-bromo-cADPR, and 7-deaza-cADPR were synthesized as described previously (12Ashamu, G. A., Galione, A., and Potter, B. V. L. (1995) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1359 (abstr.).Google Scholar, 20Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Fortt S.M. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since the elucidation of the structure of cADPR (28Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the development of a chemoenzymatic synthesis for cADPR and its analogues (12Ashamu, G. A., Galione, A., and Potter, B. V. L. (1995) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1359 (abstr.).Google Scholar), interest has mounted concerning the structure-function relationships between the ligand and its endogenous receptor(s). To further aid these diagnostic studies, we synthesized 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR, a novel analogue of cADPR. Fig.1 A shows the chemical structure of 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR as compared with that of cADPR and two previously reported analogues, 8-bromo-cADPR, a specific cADPR antagonist (13Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and 7-deaza-cADPR, a hydrolysis-resistant partial agonist (20Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Fortt S.M. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas the latter two compounds have a single modification made at either the 7- or 8-position of the adenosine ring, 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR possesses both of these modifications. The effect of each modification on the Ca2+-mobilizing (agonistic) ability was first tested using sea urchin egg homogenates (2.5%). Fig. 1 B shows the Ca2+-releasing action of 2 μm applications of 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR and related cyclic nucleotides. Unlike the agonists cADPR and 7-deaza-cADPR, 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR did not induce Ca2+ release from sea urchin egg microsomes even at concentrations up to 20 μm (a supra-maximal agonist concentration). In this respect 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR resembles the antagonist 8-bromo-cADPR. Whether 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR, like 8-bromo-cADPR, was also an antagonist of cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ release was investigated next. Fig. 2 shows that this was indeed the case. Sea urchin egg homogenates pretreated with either 8-bromo-cADPR or 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR were markedly less responsive to 100 nm cADPR (Fig. 2 A). These inhibitory actions were dependent on the antagonist concentration (Fig. 2 B). Both 8-bromo-cADPR and 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR exhibited similar inhibition potencies with comparable IC50 values (IC50 = 0.97 ± 0.04 μm (S.E.,n = 3) for 8-bromo-cADPR; IC50 = 0.73 ± 0.05 μm (S.E., n = 3) for 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR). Lower concentrations (31 nm) of either antagonist were also significant in preventing Ca2+ release by 100 nm cADPR that did not exceed 85% of control values. Whether this is due to the presence of more than one population of receptors that exhibit different binding affinities and/or sensitizing properties remains to be investigated. Nonetheless, both 8-substituted analogues appeared to behave similarly with respect to these actions on the cADPR-induced Ca2+ release channel in sea urchin egg homogenates. Since previous studies have shown that 8-substituted cADPR analogues (13Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 30Walseth T.F. Aarhus R. Kerr J.A. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26686-26691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 7-deaza-cADPR (20Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Fortt S.M. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar) are able to displace cADPR binding, it is likely that 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR also interacts at the cADPR receptor in the same specific manner. Since a modification on the 8-position does not alter the stability of the molecule (13Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) but a substitution of N7 with a carbon has been shown to render the cyclic compound more resistant to hydrolysis (20Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Fortt S.M. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we investigated whether 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR could differ from 8-bromo-cADPR but resemble 7-deaza-cADPR in this respect. We subjected standard solutions of both antagonists to heat-induced hydrolysis. This treatment has previously been shown to strip unstable cyclic compounds such as cADPR and 8-NH2-cADPR of their biological activity (13Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 18Rakovic S. Galione A. Ashamu G.A. Potter B.V.L. Terrar D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Bailey V.C. Sethi J.K. Fortt S.M. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the effect of heat treatment on the antagonistic actions of both 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR and 8-bromo-cADPR. Whereas 8-bromo-cADPR is stripped of its antagonistic activity, 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR remains an effective antagonist of cADPR-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 3,B compared with A). HPLC analysis of the same samples confirmed that this loss of activity was due to degradation of 8-bromo-cADPR while 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR remained intact (data not shown). These data are in line with the chemical stability of 7-deazaadenosine, cf. adenosine (31Pike J.E. Slechta L. Wiley P.F. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1964; 1: 159-161Crossref Google Scholar) and suggest that 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR is the first stable cADPR antagonist. This new compound therefore has potential for application in intact cells/tissues such as Jurkat T cells and neuronal tissue that express high hydrolase activities but may still have a functional cADPR-mediated Ca2+-signaling pathway (1Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. 48. Academic Press Ltd., London1994: 199-257Google Scholar). When these antagonists were tested for resistance to enzyme-mediated hydrolysis (by cADPR hydrolases) a similar resistance emerged. Egg homogenates (2.5% containing fluo-3), were incubated overnight (at 17 °C) with 20 μm 8-bromo-cADPR or 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR. Samples (50 μl) were then taken and tested for antagonistic activity on cADPR-induced Ca2+ release (as described for Fig. 2 but where the cuvette concentration of the antagonists was initially 2 μm). Whereas the antagonistic activity of 8-bromo-cADPR in response to cADPR (100 nm) had dramatically reduced following the prolonged incubation with L. pictus cADPR hydrolase (65.8 ± 8.3% of control cADPR-induced Ca2+ release (S.E., n = 3)), the levels of 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR remained high thereby producing a greater antagonistic effect on cADPR-induced Ca2+ release (28.5 ± 11.4% of control cADPR-induced Ca2+ release (S.E., n = 3)). This was also confirmed by HPLC analysis of the same samples (data not shown). It has been demonstrated that the presence of a lipophilic bromide moiety in cGMP affords greater membrane permeability to 8-bromo-cGMP (21Butt E. Nolte C. Schulz S. Beltman J. Beavo J.A. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the replacement of a nitrogen with a CH– group also offers greater hydrophobicity (32Ji, L. N., Corfu, N. A., and Sigel, H. (1991) J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1367–1375.Google Scholar). Therefore, the novel cADPR analogue, 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR, should have greater hydrophobic character than any that were previously synthesized. We investigated this by testing the effect of extracellular applications of 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR on fertilization-induced Ca2+ mobilization in intact sea urchin eggs. Eggs were co-injected with the IP3 receptor antagonist, heparin (250 μg/ml), and Ca2+-sensitive fluorochrome fura-2 (2 μm). Fig.4 A shows that upon sperm addition to control heparinized eggs, a propagating Ca2+ wave was produced (Fig. 4 A, open squares). This Ca2+wave had an average amplitude of 1705 ± 119 nmCa2+ (S.E., n = 11) and took 41.9 ± 5.8 s (S.E., n = 11) to reach this peak. These data are consistent with previously reported observations of sperm-induced Ca2+ mobilization from IP3-insensitive Ca2+ stores (14Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 33Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which suggests inhibition of the redundant cADPR-sensitive Ca2+release mechanism (14Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 33Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 50 μmin the bathing solution the 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR successfully reduced the fertilization-induced Ca2+ transient in heparinized eggs (Fig. 4, A and B). The amplitude of the Ca2+ transient was significantly reduced in the treated eggs compared with the heparinized controls (p < 0.01, Student's t test) as seen in Fig. 4 C, open squares versus closed circles (mean value, 988 ± 81 nm Ca2+ (S.E., n = 6)). As can also be observed in Fig. 4 B, the propagation of the Ca2+ wave across the egg was slowed significantly in the eggs treated with the 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR. The time to peak of the Ca2+ rise at fertilization was also reduced in eggs pretreated with the antagonist compared with the heparinized controls (p < 0.01, Student's t test; mean value, 98.8 ± 12.1 s; S.E., n = 6). This is also apparent in Fig. 4 C. At a higher concentration of 100 μm 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR in the bathing medium the sperm-induced intracellular Ca2+ transients were completely abolished (Fig. 4 C, crosses). The dose dependence of the effects of the 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR is shown in Fig.5 A, filled symbols,right-hand axis. Comparison with a preincubation with 8-bromo-cADPR showed that at 100 μm it also reduced the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient following sperm addition and to a similar extent as observed with 50 μm7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR (see Fig. 5 B cf. Fig. 5 A,closed symbols). This result indicates that 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR appears to be the more effective antagonist. Neither antagonist released Ca2+ in the eggs during a 5–15-min preincubation period (data not shown), which is consistent with the absence of agonistic activity observed in vitro (Fig. 1 B).Figure 5Dose-dependent action of 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR and 8-bromo-cADPR on peak fertilization-induced Ca2+ rise and egg activation. For each concentration of both antagonists, 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR (A) and 8-bromo-cADPR (B), 4–9 eggs in a single dish were co-injected with heparin (250 μg/ml) and fura-2 (2 μm). Sperm were added following incubation in artificial sea water that contained either antagonist for 5 min, and the maximum change in intracellular free Ca2+ (primary y axis,filled symbols) was monitored on 1 of the preinjected eggs. These data are taken from the experiments done in 1 day (1 egg at each concentration). Following recovery of the Ca2+ transient we scored the presence or absence of an activation envelope in all injected eggs (secondary y axis, open symbols). Egg activation results represent the mean ± S.E. for 3–4 separate determinations of 4–12 eggs when concurrent Ca2+measurements were not always made. In separate fields within the same dish we scored the percentage of fertilization in uninjected, non-heparinized eggs (dotted lines). All were consistently activated, which indicated that sperm activity was unaffected by increasing concentrations of either antagonist. Note that the reduction of the fertilization-induced Ca2+ transient with 100 μm 8-bromo-cADPR (panel B, filled triangles) was similar to that seen using 50 μm7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR (panel A, filled circle) supporting the greater effectiveness of the 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR compound. Further support for this comes from the far superior percent reduction in egg activation observed at 100 μm concentration of the 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR compared with the same concentration of 8-bromo-cADPR (p = 0.02, Student's ttest).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since intracellular Ca2+ mobilization is a prerequisite for the cortical reaction (34Sasaki H. Dev. Biol. 1984; 101: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Sardet C. Chang P. Cell Differ. 1987; 21: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we also monitored the formation of activation envelopes following fecundation and directly compared the actions of 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR and 8-bromo-cADPR in the bathing medium. Treatment of eggs with either antagonist prevented the cortical reaction (in heparinized eggs) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A and B, open symbols). This is in keeping with previous reports that demonstrate inhibition of the cortical reaction only when both redundant mechanisms have been blocked (14Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 33Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). As indicated by the fertilization-induced Ca2+ transients, we observed a greater effect of the 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR compared with the 8-bromo-cADPR at both 50 and 100 μm concentrations (p < 0.05, Student's t test in both cases). Eggs that were treated with antagonist only (i.e.not micro-injected with heparin) were also scored for activation envelopes in the same experiments. These consistently showed >95% activation as shown in Fig. 5, A and B, by thedotted lines and cross symbols. This suggested that neither 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR nor 8-bromo-cADPR acted as spermicides; rather they are able to permeate the sea urchin egg plasma membrane and specifically compete for endogenous cADPR-binding sites and inhibit agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Presumably, since the net charge on 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR is only 1 at physiological pH (Fig. 1 A), this compares well with 8-bromo-cGMP, which has the same net charge and where 8-substitution confers membrane permeability. This property now eliminates the need for potentially disruptive protocols such as cell permeabilization or micro-injection methods to introduce cADPR antagonists into whole cells. This advancement should greatly aid investigations of the role of cADPR in physiological responses to extracellular stimuli. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that, unlike 8-bromo-cADPR, 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR is a stable hydrolysis-resistant, cADPR antagonist. This is the first report of such a compound. In addition, we have exploited the lipophilic nature of the bromo moiety to produce a compound that is also sufficiently membrane-permeable. In all, this makes 7-deaza-8-bromo-cADPR a very powerful pharmacological tool for investigations of cADPR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in intact cells."

Recently, we purified a soluble HEK ligand which is also a ligand (AL1) for the HEK-related receptor EHK1. Promiscuity appears to be a characteristic feature of interactions between the EPH-like receptors and their ligands, termed ligands for EPH-related kinases (LERKs). This prompted us to analyze the interactions between the HEK exodomain and fusion proteins comprising candidate LERKs and the Fc portion of human IgG1 (Fc) or a FLAG™-peptide tag by surface plasmon resonance, size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, sedimentation equilibrium, and transphosphorylation. Our results indicate that AL1/LERK7 is the preferred high-affinity ligand for HEK, forming a stable 1:1 complex with a dissociation constant of 12 nm. As expected the apparent affinities of bivalent fusion proteins of LERKs and the Fc portion of human IgG1 had significantly reduced dissociation rates compared with their monovalent, FLAG™-tagged derivatives. High-avidity binding of monovalent ligands can be achieved by antibody-mediated cross-linking of monovalent ligands and with LERK7 results in specific phosphorylation of the receptor. By extrapolation, our findings indicate that some of the reported LERK-receptor interactions are a consequence of the use of bivalent ligand or receptor constructs and may be functionally irrelevant.

As expected the apparent affinities of bivalent fusion proteins of LERKs and the Fc portion of human IgG1 had significantly reduced dissociation rates compared with their monovalent, FLAG™-tagged derivatives. High-avidity binding of monovalent ligands can be achieved by antibody-mediated cross-linking of monovalent ligands and with LERK7 results in specific phosphorylation of the receptor. By extrapolation, our findings indicate that some of the reported LERK-receptor interactions are a consequence of the use of bivalent ligand or receptor constructs and may be functionally irrelevant.

We use BIAcore technology, SE-HPLC, sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, and functional assays which show that LERK 7 is the principal HEK ligand. Although most of the apparent affinity constants obtained from our analysis of LERK-Fc binding were well within the range reported in the literature, our experiments indicate that the use of bivalent Fc constructs gives misleading estimates of the likely affinities for the physiological LERK-HEK interactions.MATERIALS AND METHODSProduction of LERK 3 and LERK 7 (AL-1) Expression ConstructsThe 5′-LERK7 oligonucleotide (GTAGTCTAGACAGGACCCGGGCTCCAAGGC) was based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence (QDPGSKA) of the mature protein, with a 5′-tag sequence andXbaI site preceding the coding nucleotides. The 3′-LERK7 oligonucleotide (GTAGTCTAGATCAGTTCTCGCCGCGGGATGGC) was based on the predicted C terminus of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked form (PSRGEN), the coding bases were followed by a stop signal, anXbaI site, and a spacer sequence. The polymerase chain reaction was performed using an aliquot of a placental cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Tracy Wilson, Walter & Eliza Hall Institute) and Taq EXTEND (Boehringer Mannheim). A 490-base pair product was detected on a 1.4% TAE, agarose gel. This was excised and the DNA purified using GeneClean II (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). The polymerase chain reaction product and the IL-3 sig-FLAG-pEFBOS vector (29Nicola N.A. Viney E. Hilton D.J. Roberts B. Wilson T. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were digested with XbaI and the vector treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to prevent religation. After ligation correctly oriented clones were detected and verified by automated DNA sequencing (Model 373, Applied Biosystems, Inc., automated DNA sequencer). Fig. 1 B depicts the LERK7-FLAG construct by comparison with the native LERK 7 molecule.The LERK 3 cDNA was derived in a similar fashion and from the same source using a sense oligonucleotide based on the N-terminal sequence (NRHAVYW) preceded by an XbaI site and a spacer (GTAG) sequence (GTAGTCTAGAAACCGGCATGCGGTGTACTG) and the antisense oligonucleotide (GTAGTCTAGATGCTCTTCTCAAGCTTTGG) based on the C-terminal sequence (PKLEKSI) followed by a stop signal, an XbaI site, and a tag sequence.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Receptor and Ligand ProteinssHEKRecombinant soluble HEK protein (sHEK) was purified from culture supernatants generated from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectant and tested for conformational integrity using the BIAcore™ with the sensor chip-immobilized anti-HEK mAb IIIA4 as described previously (14Lackmann M.

Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were suspended in 500 μl of PBS and 10 μg of LERK-pEFBOS DNA and 1 μg of pSV2neo DNA added. After mixing and transfer to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), the cells were electroporated at 270 V and 960 microfarads and the cells centrifuged through an fetal calf serum underlayer. Transfectant clones were selected in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418. Individual clones were isolated and samples (5 μl) of CHO cell supernatants from confluent cultures were dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, air-dried, and re-hydrated in blocking buffer (5% skim milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) prior to incubation with M2 anti-FLAG antibody at 1:1000 dilution. After washing the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody (1:1000, Dako) in blocking buffer and following further washes developed with the ECL detection system (Amersham). Positives clones, indicated by signals above background, were retested by analysis on SDS-PAGE (12%) and Western blots prepared and probed as described above to confirm the presence of FLAG proteins of the expected molecular size.Purification of LERK 7 and LERK 3 from CHO Cell SupernatantsFLAG-tagged fusion proteins were purified from CHO cell supernatants by affinity extraction on anti-FLAG mAb-agarose according to the manufacturers' protocol (IBI Kodak, New Haven, CT) followed by Mono Q (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) ion exchange chromatography in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.02% Tween 20 at 1 ml/min using a linear 40-min gradient from 0 to 600 mm NaCl and SE-HPLC (Superose 12, 10/30, Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20 at 0.25 ml/min. The homogeneity, concentration, and identity of the purified proteins was confirmed by reverse phase-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, amino acid analysis, and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis as described (14Lackmann M.

Fig. 1 C depicts the LERK7-Fc construct as compared with native LERK 7 (Fig.1 A). The apparent protein concentration was estimated by BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad) and the purity of the fusion constructs assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Apparent molecular weights of the fusion proteins, determined by SDS-PAGE, were used to calculate apparent molar concentrations of the ligand-Fc protein stock solutions. Disulfide bond-mediated homodimerization of the fusion proteins was confirmed by analysis of the purified proteins by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE.Size Exclusion (SE)-HPLC Analysis of LERK·sHEK ComplexesThe interaction between sHEK and LERK3-FLAG or LERK7-FLAG was analyzed by fractionation on a μSuperose 12 column (3.2 × 300 mm, Pharmacia Biotech) at 50 μl/min in 20 mmphosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), in the presence or absence of 0.02%, Tween 20 (Pierce) using a Waters Model 600 Protein Purification system equipped with a Model 996 photo diode array detector (Waters, Box Hill, Australia).The flow path of the LC system was modified to minimize the pre- and post-column volume to 1.0 μl using 0.005 inch internal diameter PEEK™ tubing and a modified flow cell of the detector (generous gift from Dr. P. M. Young, Waters, MA) which allowed a direct connection of the column via a 80-mm length tubing. A zero dead-volume column holder to adapt the μSuperose 12 column was prepared from pre-moulded PEEK™ components in the workshop of the institute.Sedimentation Equilibrium AnalysisThe molecular weights of sHEK, LERK7-FLAG, and SE-HPLC-purified sHEK·LERK7-FLAG complexes were evaluated by sedimentation analysis of purified proteins or protein complexes which had been buffer-exchanged into PBS using a Fast Desalting column (3.2 × 100 mm, Pharmacia Biotech). Soluble receptor-ligand complexes were purified on a μSuperose column as described above. Protein solutions (approximately 0.1 mg/ml) were subjected to sedimentation equilibrium in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 20 °C and the protein concentration distribution recorded spectrophotometrically at 230 nm as described (31Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Hammacher A. Weinstock J. Yasukawa K. Simpson R.J. Winzor D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2901-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Analysis of the Interaction between sHEK and Its Proposed LigandsThe binding of various recombinant LERK fusion proteins to sHEK was analyzed on the BIAcore optical biosensor (Pharmacia Biosensor, Sweden) using purified sHEK or LERK7-FLAG derivatized CM 5 sensor chips. The immobilization of sHEK onto the sensor chip surface was performed essentially as described (14Lackmann M. Bucci T. Mann R.J. Kravets L.A. Viney E. Smith F. Moritz R.L. Carter W. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Mackwell K. Nice E.C. Wilks A.F. Boyd A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), LERK7-FLAG (47 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) was coupled at 5 μl/min ontoN-hydroxysuccinimide (0.05 m),N-hydroxysuccinimide-N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (0.2 m)-activated sensor chips (45 μl, 2 μl/min) to yield an increase in the response level of 2500–3000 response units. The affinity surface was regenerated between subsequent injections of samples with a 35-μl injection of 50 mm 1,2-diethylamine, 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by two washes with BIAcore running buffer (Hepes-buffered saline, 0.005% Tween 20).The interaction kinetics of LERK-binding to immobilized sHEK was analyzed from raw data of the BIAcore sensorgrams suitable for analysis using linear and nonlinear kinetic models included in the BIAevaluation software (32Biosensor, P. (1995) BIAtechnology Handbook, BIAevaluation 2.1 software handbook.Google Scholar). All results recorded in this report were within the typical dynamic ranges of BIAcore measurements (k a, 103-106m−1s−1; k d, 10−5-10−1 s−1, BIAcore catalogue 1996/97) and the BIAevaluation software. Single component kinetics was derived from the equations below. Dissociation:R=R0·e−kd(t−t0)Equation 1 Association:=R0/ks·(1−e−ks(t−t0)Equation 2 Or:=Req(1−e−ks(t−t0);ks=kaC+kdEquation 3 R 0 is the response (R) at timet 0, R eq the steady state response level (not necessarily reached in the sensorgram), andC the molar concentration of the analyte. The two component dissociation was derived from, R=R1e(−kd1·(t−t0)+(R0−R1)e−kd2·(t−t0).Equation 4 Apparent affinities of LERKs 3, 4, 5, and 7 were also derived from equilibrium responses according to, Req/C=KARmax−KAReqEquation 5 where R eq and R maxare the equilibrium and maximum response levels, respectively (32Biosensor, P. (1995) BIAtechnology Handbook, BIAevaluation 2.1 software handbook.Google Scholar). In addition to the analysis of ligand binding to sensor chip-immobilized sHEK, the interaction between LERK 3 and LERK 7 with sHEK was studied in solution. A constant ligand concentration was incubated with increasing concentrations of the soluble receptor. The free ligand concentration (F LERK), estimated from the BIAcore response of a known LERK sample (32Biosensor, P. (1995) BIAtechnology Handbook, BIAevaluation 2.1 software handbook.Google Scholar) was used to calculate the concentration of bound receptor ([B HEK]) or ligand ([B LERK]), and free sHEK (F HEK) using the initial receptor concentration (T HEK) and assuming in this case a single site interaction: [F HEK] = [T HEK] − [B HEK·B LERK], where [B HEK·B LERK] = [B HEK] = [B LERK].Thus the dissociation constant, K D, was estimated from, KD=[FHEK]·[FLERK][BHEK·BLERK]=[FHEK][FLERK][BLERK]Equation 6 according to Ward et al.

The cells were passaged into fresh medium 24 h before the experiments. Following three washes with PBS, 0.5-ml samples of 2 × 107 LK 63 cells/ml were incubated with 5 μg/ml LERK3-FLAG, LERK7-FLAG, or with preformed complexes (30 min at room temperature) of either LERK3-FLAG (2 μg) or LERK7-FLAG (2 μg) and anti-FLAG mAb (2 μg) for 1 h on ice. The cell suspension was warmed to 37 °C for 10 min, then washed (ice-cold PBS) and the cell pellet lysed in 750 μl of TBS, pH 7.5, containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm orthovanadate, 4 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 μm chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. HEK was immunoprecipitated fron the lysates using IIIA4-Trisacryl beads (Sepracor/IBF, Villeneuve la Garenne, France) as described previously (7Boyd A.W. Ward L.D. Wicks I.P. Simpson R.J. Salvaris E.

In our experiments we sought to (a) define the highest affinity ligand for the HEK RTK; (b) define the kinetics and stoichiometry of the receptor-ligand complex formation; (c) determine the biological response to ligands either in monomeric or dimeric forms.Most of the studies of EPH-like receptors and their ligands carried out to date have been performed with divalent (Fc fusion) constructs of either ligand or receptor (Refs. in 4 and 37).

We examined the activation of STAT proteins induced by interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or erythropoietin (EPO) using the human leukemia cell line, UT-7, which requires these cytokines for growth. IL-3, GM-CSF, and EPO induced DNA-binding activity to the oligonucleotides corresponding to the sis-inducible elements (SIE) of c-fos, in addition to the β-casein promoter (β-CAP), SIE- and β-CAP-binding proteins were identical to Stat1α and Stat3 complex and to Stat5 protein, respectively. This indicates that IL-3, GM-CSF, and EPO commonly activated Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins in UT-7. However, EPO hardly activated Stat1α and Stat3 in UT-7/GM, which is a subline of UT-7 that grows slightly in response to EPO. Transfection studies revealed that UT-7/GM cells constitutively expressing Stat1α, but not Stat3, can grow as well in response to EPO as GM-CSF, suggesting that Stat1α is involved in the EPO-induced proliferation of UT-7. Thus, although Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins are activated by GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO, our data suggest that each STAT protein has a distinctive role in the actions of cytokines.

Cytokines play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The binding of a cytokine to its specific receptor on the cell surface induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of several proteins, including the receptor itself, receptor-associated tyrosine kinase such as Janus kinases (JAKs), 1The abbreviations used are: JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor; EPO, erythropoietin; EPOR, erythropoietin receptor; β-CAP, β-casein promoter; SIE, sis-inducible elements; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; RT, room temperature; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (1Darnell Jr., J.E.

STATs were first identified in studies of interferon (IFN)-regulated gene expression (3Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell J.E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activated STATs then form homo- or heterodimers, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequences, leading to induction of the specific genes for IFN (5Shuai K. Horvath C.M.

Cytokines may induce the activation of specific STAT proteins and the formation of specific complexes, as do IFNs. If so, it would explain the specificity of action of each cytokine. Therefore, it is important to identify the STATs activated by each cytokine. So far six members of the STAT family have been identified (6Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M.

Although sis-inducible elements (SIE) of c-fos do not have this motif, SIE binding complexes are induced by GM-CSF in the human monocytic leukemia cell line, U937 (17Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P.

This suggested that GM-CSF induces the activation of Stat1α and Stat3 proteins, because the SIE consensus sequence is recognized by Stat1α and Stat3 complex. In addition, GM-CSF and IL-3 activate Stat1α protein in human eosinophils (18Bruggen T. Caldenhoven E. Kanters D. Coffer P. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J. Koenderman L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1442-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these cytokines also activate Stat3 or Stat1 proteins in COS cells reconstituted with the receptors for these cytokines (19Morella K.K.

Blood. 1995; 85: 1454-1462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, EPO reportedly activates a Stat5-related factor but not Stat1α, Stat2, Stat3, or Stat4 proteins in murine IL-3-dependent BAF-3 cells expressing exogenous EPO receptor or in UT-7 cells maintained in another laboratory (14Gouilleux F.

In addition, Stat1α and Stat5 activation is induced by EPO in immature erythroid cells (22Penta K. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol.

Thus several independent investigators have raised the question as to whether IL-3, GM-CSF, and EPO all actually activate Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins. To address this issue, we performed electromobility shift assays with oligonucleotides corresponding to the β-CAP and SIE consensus sequences and nuclear proteins extracted from IL-3-, GM-CSF-, or EPO-stimulated UT-7 cells, because the growth and survival of these cells absolutely required GM-CSF, IL-3, or EPO (23Komatsu N. Nakauchi H. Miwa A. Ishihara T. Eguchi M. Moroi M. Okada M. Sato Y. Wada H. Yawata Y. Suda T. Miura Y. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we examined the role of Stat1α and Stat3 in the EPO-induced cellular proliferation using UT-7 and its subline, UT-7/GM. The UT-7 cell line was derived from the bone marrow of a patient with megakaryoblastic leukemia (23Komatsu N. Nakauchi H. Miwa A. Ishihara T. Eguchi M. Moroi M. Okada M. Sato Y. Wada H. Yawata Y.

After stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 2 mm Na3VO4, resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mm/liter Na3VO4, with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and homogenized. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was separated from the nuclear pellet and then centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The debris was removed, and the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer with 300 mmNaCl; debris was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × gfor 20 min), and the supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts (5 μg proteins) were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 μg of poly[d(IC·AT)], 1 mm EDTA, 4% Ficoll type 400 with 2 ng of a32P-labeled oligonucleotide. Samples were loaded on a 5% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel, run for 1.5 h at 150 V, vacuum-dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For the supershift study, nuclear extracts were incubated with the antibodies at room temperature (RT) for 10 min before the above reaction. The probes were double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the sis-inducible element (SIE) (upper strand, 5′-GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC-3′) (28Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and the β-casein promoter region (β-CAP) (upper strand, 5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAATC-3′) (8Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). To study competition, extracts were incubated with a 150 molar excess of the unlabeled probe. Cell growth was also examined by a colorimetric assay according to Mosmann (29Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, cells were incubated at a density of 1 × 104/0.1 ml in 96-well plates in IMDM containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence of various concentrations of GM-CSF or EPO. After 72 h of culture at 37 °C, 20 μl of sterilized 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) was added to each well. Following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added to each well to dissolve the dark-blue crystal product. The optical density was measured at a wavelength of 595 nm using a microplate reader (model 3550, Bio-Rad). UT-7/GM cells were transfected with mammalian expression vector (pCAGGS) alone or pCAGGS containing human Stat1α cDNA, murine Stat3 cDNA (30Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukuda T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), or human EPOR cDNA by conventional electroporation (1,000V, 25 microfarads). We selected three independent clones resistant to neomycin (0.8 mg/ml). Total RNA was isolated from cells according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on agarose formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Zeta-probe, Bio-Rad) in 10 × standard sodium citrate (SSC), and hybridized to human cDNA fragments for EPOR. The fragment was labeled with [α-32P]CTP by random priming. After an overnight incubation at 43 °C in the presence of 50% formamide, blots were washed 3 times with 2 × SSC, 0.5 × SSC, or 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min each. The membranes were autoradiographed using Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. UT-7, UT-7/GM, and UT-7/GM cells transfected with Stat1α or Stat3 cDNA were lysed on ice in lysis buffer composed of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. After a 30-min incubation on ice, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS for 30 min at RT and then incubated with the appropriate concentration of primary antibodies including polyclonal antibodies against Stat1 or Stat3 overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS containing Tween 20 (1:2,000), the blots were probed with a 1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies for 90 min at RT. After a second wash, the blots were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and exposed to Hyperfilm enhanced chemiluminescence to visualize immunoreactive bands. In some experiments, UT-7/GM and UT-7/EPO cells were starved of growth factor for 24 h. After stimulation with cytokines at 37 °C for 10 min, cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat1, anti-Stat3, or anti-Stat5 antibody coated onto protein G-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C in an Eppendorf shaker. Immunoprecipitates were collected by a brief centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated with the appropriate concentration of primary antibodies including anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) monoclonal antibody 4G10 overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS containing Tween 20 (1:2,000), the blots were probed with a 1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies for 90 min at RT and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. The blots were then stripped with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min, washed, blocked, and reprobed. We initially analyzed the STAT signaling pathway activated by GM-CSF, IL-3, or EPO using UT-7. After 24 h of starvation, UT-7 cells were stimulated with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), IL-3 (100 ng/ml), EPO (10 units/ml), or IL-6 (100 ng/ml) for 15 min and then harvested and prepared for EMSA. As shown in Fig. 1, GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO induced the three distinct SIE binding complexes (A, B, and C). In addition, IL-6 induced the formation of DNA binding complex A and, to a much lesser degree, complexes B and C. Moreover, the formation of β-CAP binding complex was induced by GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO but not by IL-6 (Fig. 1). The formation of these complexes was completely inhibited by a 150-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe, indicating that the proteins specifically bound to the SIE or β-CAP consensus sequence. The density of SIE binding complex but not that of β-CAP binding complex paralleled the growth activity against UT-7 cells (see Ref. 24Komatsu, N., Kirito, K., Shimizu, R., Kunitama, M., Yamada, M., Uchida, M., Takatoku, M., Eguchi, M., and Miura Y. (1997) Blood, in press.Google Scholar and data not shown). To further characterize the DNA binding proteins activated by GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO, we performed a supershift assay with the available antibodies against Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins. Among the SIE binding complexes activated by GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO (Fig.2 A, lane 1; Fig. 2 B, lane 1; Fig. 2 C, lane 1), complex C was supershifted to the position at SS1 by the anti-Stat1α antibody (Fig. 2 A,lane 2; Fig. 2 B, lane 2; Fig. 2 C, lane 2), and complex A was supershifted to SS3 by the anti-Stat3 antibody (Fig. 2 A, lane 3; Fig. 2 B, lane 3; Fig.2 C, lane 3). Complex B was in part supershifted by anti-Stat1α and anti-Stat3 antibodies (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2and 3; Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3; Fig.2 C, lanes 2 and 3). These complexes were not supershifted by the anti-Stat5 antibody (Fig. 2 A, lane 4; Fig. 2 B, lane 4; Fig. 2 C, lane 4). In addition, the β-CAP binding complex activated by GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO was supershifted to SS5 by the anti-Stat5 antibody but not anti-Stat1α or anti-Stat3 antibodies (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8; Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–8; Fig. 2 C, lanes 5–8). Collectively, these results indicate that the SIE-binding proteins contain Stat1α and Stat3 and that the β-CAP-binding protein contains Stat5 or Stat5-related protein. Thus, GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO all induced the activation of Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins in UT-7. The activation of the STAT proteins by GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO may be involved in cell proliferation because these cytokines act on UT-7 cells as growth factors. If so, the induction of SIE and β-CAP binding complexes in response to these three cytokines would have similar kinetics. To examine this notion, we analyzed the time course of the activation of SIE and β-CAP binding complexes in UT-7 cells stimulated with GM-CSF, IL-3, or EPO. The SIE binding complexes A, B, and C were detectable after a 1-min exposure to GM-CSF. The binding activity peaked at 5 min and gradually diminished over 60 min (Fig.3 A). On the other hand, the β-CAP binding complex was detectable after 1 min. The binding activity peaked at 1–5 min and was sustained for up to 60 min (Fig. 3 A). IL-3 had similar kinetics as GM-CSF in SIE-binding activity (Fig.3 B). The β-CAP-binding activity was detectable after a 1-min exposure to IL-3, and it peaked at 5–10 min and thereafter declined (Fig. 3 B). EPO had similar kinetics as IL-3 in the β-CAP-binding activity (Fig. 3 C). SIE binding complexes were detectable after a 5-min exposure to EPO. The maximal level was reached after 20–30 min and sustained for up to 60 min (Fig.3 C). Thus, the time course of the induction of SIE- and β-CAP-binding activities significantly differed among GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO. We examined the concentration of each cytokine required for the induction of SIE- and β-CAP-binding activities. Both DNA-binding activities were elevated with increasing concentrations of GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO. Among the SIE binding complexes, complex C was detectable at 0.1 ng/ml GM-CSF, and plateau levels were obtained at 10 ng/ml GM-CSF. Complexes A and B were induced at 10 ng/ml GM-CSF (Fig.4 A). The β-CAP binding complex was detectable at 0.01 ng/ml GM-CSF, and a plateau was reached at 1 ng/ml (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, 10 ng/ml IL-3 was required to induce both SIE and β-CAP binding complexes (Fig. 4 B). Complex C was detectable at 0.1 unit of EPO/ml, whereas complexes A and B were detectable at 1 unit of EPO/ml. The formation of these complexes reached the maximum at 10 units/ml EPO (Fig. 4 C). On the other hand, the β-CAP binding complex was induced at 0.1 unit/ml EPO, and the level was maximal at 1 unit/ml EPO (Fig. 4 C). Other reports have indicated that only Stat5 is activated by EPO in cell lines exogenously expressing EPOR (16Pallard C. Gouilleux F. Charon M. Groner B. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Fourt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15942-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1622-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the activation of Stat1α and Stat3 by EPO is restricted to UT-7, we examined whether or not EPO induced SIE-binding activity in the EPO-responsive cell lines, UT-7/GM, UT-7/EPO, F-36E, and TF-1, which have endogenously functional EPORs. Fig.5 A shows the dose-response curves of these cell lines to EPO. As reported, UT-7/EPO and F-36E cells proliferated very well in response to EPO (25Komatsu N. Yamamoto M. Fujita H. Miwa A. Hatake K. Endo T. Okano H. Katsube T. Fukumaki Y. Sassa S. Miura Y. Blood. 1993; 82: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chiba S. Takaku F. Tange T. Shibuya K. Misawa C. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1991; 78: 2261-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas UT-7/GM and TF-1 cells slightly proliferated with EPO (24Komatsu, N., Kirito, K., Shimizu, R., Kunitama, M., Yamada, M., Uchida, M., Takatoku, M., Eguchi, M., and Miura Y. (1997) Blood, in press.Google Scholar, 27Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.-F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Using these cell lines, we performed EMSA with SIE and β-CAP probes. As shown in Fig.5 B, EPO induced SIE-binding activity in UT-7/EPO and F-36E but not in UT-7/GM and TF-1. In contrast, β-CAP-binding activity was detected in all four cell lines. To further confirm that EPO actually activates Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat5, we examined whether or not EPO induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins in UT-7/EPO and UT-7/GM. As shown in Fig. 6, EPO induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat5 in UT-7/EPO. However, none of them were tyrosine-phosphorylated by GM-CSF, because this cell line cannot respond to GM-CSF (25Komatsu N. Yamamoto M. Fujita H. Miwa A. Hatake K. Endo T. Okano H. Katsube T. Fukumaki Y. Sassa S. Miura Y. Blood. 1993; 82: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Stat5 alone was tyrosine-phosphorylated by EPO in UT-7/GM (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the data from the EMSA. Thus, Stat1α and Stat3 are activated by EPO in EPO-hypersensitive cell lines but not in EPO-hyposensitive cell lines. By analogy, Stat1α and/or Stat3 activation may be closely involved in EPO-induced cellular proliferation. To clarify this notion, we transfected Stat1α or Stat3 cDNA into UT-7/GM cells by electroporation and obtained three independent clones for each transfectant. We confirmed that each clone indeed abundantly expressed exogenous Stat1α or Stat3 protein by Western blotting (Fig. 7 A). Moreover, EMSA revealed that Stat1α and Stat3 are constitutively activated without EPO in each transfectant (Fig. 7 B). Using these transfectants, we examined the effect of EPO on their growth in liquid culture. As shown in Fig. 7 C, all three clones expressing exogenous Stat1α proliferated in response to EPO better than the parent UT-7/GM. In contrast, all three clones expressing Stat3 responded slightly to EPO like parent UT-7/GM and cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 7 C and data not shown). Similar results were obtained by MTT reduction assay (data not shown). These results suggest that the activation of Stat1α, but not Stat3, is required for the EPO-induced proliferation of UT-7. As we reported, UT-7/GM expressed a small amount of EPOR at the mRNA level (33Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably resulting in low sensitivity to EPO. The increased sensitivity of Stat1α transfectants may be due to the up-regulation of EPOR. To verify this notion, we examined the EPOR mRNA level of Stat1α transfectants by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 8, EPOR mRNA was faintly detectable in each clone like the parent UT-7/GM. This result suggests that exogenous Stat1α induced the increase of the sensitivity to EPO without affecting expression of the EPOR gene. To examine whether or not loss of the activation of Stat1α and Stat3 by EPO is due to the down-regulation of EPOR, we generated a UT-7/GM transfectant expressing a large amount of exogenous EPOR (Fig. 9 A). As shown in Fig.9 B, the proliferative response to EPO is restored in the transfectant cells. In addition, EPO induced the activation of Stat1α and Stat3 in these cells but not in parent UT-7/GM cells (Fig.9 C). These findings suggest that the activation of Stat1α and Stat3 depends on the expression of EPOR. Thus, our data indicate that Stat1α and Stat3 lie downstream of the EPO receptor in EPO signaling pathway. In this study we demonstrated by means of EMSA using oligonucleotides corresponding to the SIE consensus sequence that GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO all activate the three distinct SIE binding complexes in UT-7 cells. A supershift study with specific antibodies against Stat1α and Stat3 revealed that the three SIE binding complexes A, B, and C were identical to the Stat3-Stat3 homodimers, Stat1α-Stat3 heterodimers, and Stat1α-Stat1α homodimers, respectively. In addition, we found that GM-CSF, EPO, and IL-3 all activate β-CAP binding complex. This complex was supershifted by anti-Stat5 antibody, suggesting that the β-CAP-binding protein is identical to Stat5 or Stat5-related protein. Collectively, these results indicate that GM-CSF, IL-3, and EPO commonly induced the activation of Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat5 in UT-7. It is notable that in addition to Stat5, the activation of Stat1α and Stat3 is induced by EPO in UT-7. This is in contrast to previous reports indicating that only Stat5 is activated by EPO in cell lines exogenously expressing EPOR (16Pallard C. Gouilleux F. Charon M. Groner B. Gisselbrecht S.

Affinity-purified anti-β1, anti-β2, and anti-β3 antibodies recognized in immunoblots protein bands of 57, 55, and 57 kDa, respectively. Quantitative immunoprecipitation of solubilized GABAA receptors from various rat brain regions showed that the β2 subunit was the most abundant isoform in cerebellum (in 96% of the GABAA receptors) and cerebral cortex (64%) but that it was the least abundant isoform in hippocampus (44%). The β3subunit was found most abundant in hippocampus (64%) followed by cerebral cortex (48%) and cerebellum (33%). The β1subunit was present in a very small proportion of the cerebellar GABAA receptors (3%), but it was present in a high proportion of the GABAA receptors from the hippocampus (49%) and cerebral cortex (32%). Quantitative receptor immunoprecipitation or immunopurification followed by immunoblotting experiments have revealed the existence of colocalization of two different β subunit isoforms in a significant proportion of the brain GABAA receptors. Thus, in the rat cerebral cortex 33% of the GABAA receptors have both β2 and β3 subunits, and 19% of the receptors have both β1 and β3 subunits. The extent of colocalization of β subunit isoforms varied among brain regions, being highest in hippocampus and lowest in cerebellum.

https://openalex.org/W2081745366,"It has been demonstrated that the promiscuous chemokine binding profile of the Duffyantigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) is given by its extracellular NH2-terminal region. However, the relationship among the Fy6, Fya/b, and Fy3 epitopes, localized in the first and fourth extracellular domains of DARC, respectively, and the chemokine binding sites remained a matter of controversy. Here, we performed cross-displacement and cross-inhibition experiments indicating that all anti-Fy6, anti-Fya, and anti-Fy3 monoclonal antibodies and interleukin 8 are antagonists for binding to red cells. Biopanning of phage peptide libraries with an anti-Fy6 monoclonal antibody led to the identification of the motif Phe22-Glu23, the mutation of which altered the binding of both anti-Fy6 and chemokines (interleukin 8, MGSA, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed)) to DARC transfectants. These results characterized the core of the Fy6 epitope and provided definitive proof of the tight relationship between Fy6 and the chemokine receptor site. Analysis of red cells treated by sulfhydryl group-modifying reagents suggested that the chemokine receptor function of DARC required the integrity of disulfide bond(s) but not that of free sulfhydryl group(s). Accordingly, mutation of cysteines 51 and 276 abolished chemokine binding to DARC transfectants. Altogether, our results suggested that the chemokine binding pocket of DARC included sequences located in the first and fourth extracellular domains which are brought into close vicinity by a disulfide bridge. It has been demonstrated that the promiscuous chemokine binding profile of the Duffyantigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) is given by its extracellular NH2-terminal region. However, the relationship among the Fy6, Fya/b, and Fy3 epitopes, localized in the first and fourth extracellular domains of DARC, respectively, and the chemokine binding sites remained a matter of controversy. Here, we performed cross-displacement and cross-inhibition experiments indicating that all anti-Fy6, anti-Fya, and anti-Fy3 monoclonal antibodies and interleukin 8 are antagonists for binding to red cells. Biopanning of phage peptide libraries with an anti-Fy6 monoclonal antibody led to the identification of the motif Phe22-Glu23, the mutation of which altered the binding of both anti-Fy6 and chemokines (interleukin 8, MGSA, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed)) to DARC transfectants. These results characterized the core of the Fy6 epitope and provided definitive proof of the tight relationship between Fy6 and the chemokine receptor site. Analysis of red cells treated by sulfhydryl group-modifying reagents suggested that the chemokine receptor function of DARC required the integrity of disulfide bond(s) but not that of free sulfhydryl group(s). Accordingly, mutation of cysteines 51 and 276 abolished chemokine binding to DARC transfectants. Altogether, our results suggested that the chemokine binding pocket of DARC included sequences located in the first and fourth extracellular domains which are brought into close vicinity by a disulfide bridge. The Duffy blood group antigens were first recognized as the erythrocyte receptor for malaria parasites and for chemokines because Duffy-positive but not Duffy-negative erythrocytes can be invaded byPlasmodium vivax (1Miller L.H.

Mak J.Y. Kolakowski L.F. Schall T.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 44-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of human cell line transfectants indicated that gpD is sufficient for Fy3, Fy6 (7Neote K. Mak J.Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7835-7838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, gpD is now referred as the promiscuous chemokine receptor (8Chaudhuri A. Zbrzezna V. Polyakova J. Pogo A.O. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7835-7838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or as the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) (10Horuk R. Wang X. Peiper S.C. Hesselgesser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17730-17733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since chemokines constitute a family of proinflammatory cytokines that mainly activate leukocytes and cause cell recruitment, it has been postulated that the red cell promiscuous chemokine receptor could act only as a sink or scavenger to bind and inactivate excess chemokines released into circulation (3Darbonne W.C. Rice G.C. Mohler M.A. Apple T. Hebert C.A. Valente A.J. Baker J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In Duffy-negative black individuals (Fy(a−b−)), theDARC gene is not expressed in erythroid cells (6Chaudhuri A. Polyakova J. Zbrzezna V. Williams K. Gulati S. Pogo A.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10793-10797Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) because of a mutation in a binding site for the h-GATA-1 erythroid-specific transcription factor (11Tournamille C. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Nature Genet. 1995; 10: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 12Iwamoto S. Li J. Sugimoto N. Okuda H. Kajii E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, it is normally active in non-erythroid tissues, which should explain that Duffy-negative donors are apparently healthy (13Chaudhuri A. Polyakova J. Zbrzezna V. Pogo A. Blood. 1995; 85: 615-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous immunohistochemical studies indicated that the non-erythroid expression of DARC is restricted to the endothelial cells lining post-capillary venules and sinusoids, at least in kidney, breast, and spleen, respectively (14Hadley T.J. Lu Z. Wasniowska K. Martin A.W. Peiper S.C. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 88: 985-991Crossref Google Scholar, 15Peiper S.C. Wang Z. Neote K. Martin A.W. Showel H.J. Conklyn M.J. Ogborne K. Hadley T.J. Lu Z.H. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), but present studies showed that DARC is also present in the epithelial cells of the kidney collecting ducts and lung alveoli (16Chaudhuri A. Nielsen S. Elkjaer M. Zbrzezna V. Fang F. Pogo A.O. Blood. 1997; 89: 701-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cDNA sequence analysis indicated that the renal and placental chemokine receptor is identical to the erythroid isoform (7Neote K. Mak J.Y. Kolakowski L.F. Schall T.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 44-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tournamille C. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Nature Genet. 1995; 10: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 14Hadley T.J.

Blood. 1997; 89: 701-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemokines bound to cell line transfectants expressing this DARC isoform are internalized rapidly (15Peiper S.C. Wang Z. Neote K. Martin A.W. Showel H.J. Conklyn M.J. Ogborne K. Hadley T.J. Lu Z.H. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), but there was no evidence for signal transduction through the recombinant DARC challenged by various chemokines (7Neote K. Mak J.Y. Kolakowski L.F. Schall T.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 44-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the function of the Duffy antigen as a chemokine receptor expressed on endothelial cells of post-capillary venules, an important site for chemokine-induced leukocyte trafficking, remains to be determined. Expression of the Fy6 antigen and chemokine binding to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (17Horuk R. Martin J. Hesselgesser J. Hadley T.J. Zhao-hai L. Zi-xuang W. Peiper C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) also raised the question of the biological role of DARC in brain, since the different size of the DARC-related mRNA in brain compared with other tissues, 8.5versus 1.35 kilobases (6Chaudhuri A. Polyakova J. Zbrzezna V. Williams K. Gulati S. Pogo A.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10793-10797Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggests that a specific DARC isoform with a peculiar function might be expressed in this tissue. Even though the precise function of DARC in various cell types and tissues is not yet understood, its receptor properties for ligands of so great a biological significance as malaria parasites and chemokines have prompted several groups to perform receptor/ligand interaction analysis. The binding site for the P. vivax and P. knowlesi ligands (the cysteine-rich domain or region II) has been mapped between amino acids 9 and 42 of DARC (18Chitnis C.E. Chaudhuri A. Horuk R. Pogo A.O. Miller H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Analysis of DARC/IL-8RB chimeric receptors localized the promiscuous chemokine binding profile of DARC to the NH2-terminal extracellular domain (19Zhao-hai L. Zi-xuang W. Horuk R. Hesselgesser J. Yan-chun L. Hadley T.J. Peiper C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26239-26245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Preincubation of red cells or DARC transfectant cells with anti-Fy6 mAb was shown to inhibit subsequent binding of chemokines, establishing an association between the Fy6 epitope, localized on the NH2-terminal domain, and the chemokine binding site (4Horuk R. Chetan C.E. Darbonne W.C. Colby T.J. Rybicki A. Hadley T.J. Miller L. Science. 1993; 261: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 8Chaudhuri A. Zbrzezna V. Polyakova J. Pogo A.O.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26239-26245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, one report suggested that the binding sites for anti-Fy6 and for chemokines might be distinct, since in a converse experiment preincubation of red cells with IL-8 failed to interfere with Duffy antigen expression (20Hausman E. Dzick W. Blanchard D. Transfusion. 1996; 36: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, contradicting results regarding the participation or nonparticipation of the Fy3 epitope (localized on the third extracellular loop) to the chemokine binding site have been proposed in two recent reports (18Chitnis C.E. Chaudhuri A. Horuk R. Pogo A.O. Miller H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Szabo M.C. Soo K.S. Zlotnick A. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25348-25351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To clarify these issues, we performed a detailed analysis of the receptor/ligand interaction between DARC and chemokines by using three anti-Fy mAbs in the same set of competition experiments and by analyzing the effect of mutations in the core of the Fy6 epitope, mapped by biopanning of a phage display peptide library. By inference with the model of the IL-8 receptors (22Samanta A.K. Dutta S. Ali E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6147-6153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hebert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also analyzed the role of extracellularly exposed cysteine residues in the chemokine binding properties of DARC, through their potential participation to free reactive sulfhydryl groups and/or to a disulfide bridge that brings the first and fourth extracellular domains of DARC into close proximity. 125I-IL-8, 125I-RANTES, and 125I-MGSA (specific activity, 2,200 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Unlabeled recombinant IL-8 was prepared as described previously (24Alouani S. Gaertner H.F. Mermod J.J. Power C.A. Bacon K.B. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unlabeled RANTES and MGSA were from R&D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom). The anti-Fy6 (i3A) mAb was described elsewhere (25Riwom S. Janvier D. Navenot J.M. Benbunan M. Muller J.Y. Blanchard D. Vox Sang. 1994; 66: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The anti-Fy3 (CRC-512) and anti-Fya mAbs were kindly provided by Dr. Makato Uchikawa (Japanese Red Cross, Tokyo, Japan) and Dr. F. Buffiere (ETS, Bordeaux, France), respectively. Anti-Fya and anti-Fyb human polyclonal antibodies were from Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, NJ). Whole blood from healthy donors was collected on EDTA, and the Fy phenotypes were determined by agglutination studies using the antiglobulin gel test (Diamed SA, Morat, Switzerland). Erythrocytes were isolated by standard techniques. Modification of free sulfhydryl groups by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was performed as described (21Szabo M.C. Soo K.S. Zlotnick A. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25348-25351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Reduction of disulfide bonds was performed by incubating red blood cells in presence of 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 22 °C for 30 min followed by three washes in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. COS-7 and K562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in Iscove and RPMI 1640 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells (3 × 106/assay) were transfected with 10 μg of recombinant plasmid using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed after 36 h. Stably transfected K562 cells were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 0.4 g/liter neomycin (G418), and DARC-positive cells bound by the anti-Fy6 mAb were amplified by two rounds of selection using magnetic beads coated with anti-mouse IgG (Dynabeads-M-450, Dynal) as recommended by the manufacturer. cDNA sequences corresponding to the main isoform (spliced) of the DARC transcripts in erythroid and non-erythroid tissues (26Iwamoto S. Li J. Omi T. Ikemoto S. Kajii E. Blood. 1996; 87: 378-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using human bone marrow cDNA (Quick clone cDNA,CLONTECH) as template. Primers used in the polymerase chain reaction were: Fy1, 5′-TAGTCCTTGGCTCTTATCTTGGAAGCACA-3′ and Fy2, 5′-CACAAAGGCAGTGTAGACTTTA-3′. cDNAs corresponding to the minor isoform (unspliced) of the FY*A and FY*B alleles were as described previously (10Horuk R. Wang X. Peiper S.C. Hesselgesser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17730-17733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pcDNA-3 expression vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using an ALFexpress automatic DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Mutagenesis was subsequently performed on the recombinant plasmids by the use of polymerase chain reaction primers carrying appropriate nucleotide substitutions and the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Inserts of the mutated plasmids were sequenced as above. Expression of Duffy antigens on red cells or transfectant cell lines was measured on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using anti-Fy6, anti-Fya, and anti-Fy3 mAbs. 3 × 105 cells were incubated for 60 min at 22 °C with appropriate dilution of antibody in 0.15m phosphate-buffered saline. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, the cell suspension was incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-human IgG (H+L) (Immunotech, Marseille, France). After another washing step, 0.1 ng of propidium iodide was finally added to 1 ml of cell suspension. Propidium iodide-positive cells (dead cells) were excluded from analysis. Fy(a−b−) red cells and irrelevant mouse and human mAbs were used as negative control. For inhibition and displacement experiments, red cells were incubated with anti-Fy mAbs prior to or after incubation with various concentrations of unlabeled IL-8 at 4 °C for 1 h. COS-7 and K562 cell expressing recombinant wild type and mutant DARC and red cells were analyzed (triplicate) for the ability to bind 125I-IL-8,125I-RANTES, and 125I-MGSA. 108 red cells and 106 transfected cells were incubated with 0.5 nm radiolabeled chemokines in the presence or absence of 200 nm unlabeled chemokines. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by separating cells from buffer by centrifugation through a silicone/paraffin oil mixture as described (27Robb R.J. Greene W.C. Rusk C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1126-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). For inhibition and displacement experiments, cells were incubated with 125I-IL-8 prior to or after incubation with various concentrations of anti-Fy antibodies. Specific chemokine binding was determined by subtracting the cpm values obtained with Fy(a−b−) red cells and the mock cell line transfectant or when an excess of unlabeled ligand was added to the binding reaction. An anti-RhD mAb was used as negative control of chemokine/antibody binding inhibition. 6-residue and 15-residue phage display libraries were generously provided by Dr. George P. Smith (University of Missouri, Columbia) and screened as recommended (28Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) with the biotinylated anti-Fy6 mAb. After three rounds of biopanning, 60 positive phage clones were selected from the two libraries and characterized by insert sequencing. Displacement experiments were performed by preincubation of Fy(a+b−) red cells with 125I-IL-8 followed by the addition of various concentrations of anti-Fya, anti-Fy6, and anti-Fy3 mAbs. The amount of remaining radiolabeled ligand bound to red cells was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1 A, 125I-IL-8 could be removed from its binding site by all three anti-Fy mAbs in a dose-dependent fashion, but not by a control mAb specific for RhD. However, IL-8 was more efficiently displaced by anti-Fy6 than by anti-Fya or anti-Fy3, since when mAbs were used at half their saturating concentration, displacements of 80% and 25% were observed with anti-Fy6 and anti-Fya or anti-Fy3, respectively. In a converse experiment, the red cells were preincubated with saturating concentrations of the anti-Fy mAbs prior to the addition of increasing amounts of cold IL-8. The cells were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 1 B shows that, in a dose-dependent fashion, IL-8 could displace the three bound anti-Fy mAbs and that a plateau corresponding to 30% and 40% displacement was reached when 200 nm IL-8 was added after incubation with anti-Fy6 and anti-Fya or anti-Fy3, respectively. Inhibition analyses were performed by incubating Fy(a+b−) red blood cells with increasing amounts of anti-Fy or control anti-RhD mAbs prior to the addition of 0.5 nm125I-IL-8. As shown in Fig. 2 A, all anti-Fy mAbs dose-responsively inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-8, whereas the control anti-RhD did not. A 90–100% inhibition was obtained with all anti-Fy at their saturating concentrations, but anti-Fy6 completely prevented IL-8 binding when used at 0.2 × its saturating concentration. Similar IL-8 binding inhibition of the anti-Fy6 and anti-Fy3 mAbs was also observed when these experiments were performed with Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the Fya or Fyb allelic form of DARC and when an anti-Fyb human antiserum and Fy(a−b+) red cells were used (not shown). These results confirmed that the Fya/Fyb polymorphism, associated with a G42D substitution (9Tournamille C. Le Van Kim C. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Hum. Genet. 1995; 95: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Chaudhuri A. Polyakova J. Zbrzezna V. Pogo A. Blood. 1995; 85: 615-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Iwamoto S. Li J. Omi T.

Haematol. 1995; 90: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) has no effect on the chemokine receptor properties of DARC (20Hausman E. Dzick W. Blanchard D. Transfusion. 1996; 36: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 29Mallisson G. Soo K.S. Schall T.J. Pisacka M. Anstee D.J. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the converse experiment, red cells were preincubated with various amounts of unlabeled IL-8 before anti-Fy mAbs were added. After a further incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody, red cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.2 B, IL-8 inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the binding of all anti-Fy mAbs but had no effect on the binding of the irrelevant anti-RhD mAb. A maximum of 60% inhibition of anti-Fy6 binding was reached with 500 nm IL-8, whereas 90–95% inhibition of anti-Fy3 and anti-Fya binding was seen with IL-8 1.5 μm. Similar inhibition curves were obtained when the binding of anti-Fy mAbs was inhibited by preincubation of IL-8 at a constant concentration of 200 mm (data not shown). Our results indicated that not only saturation of red cells with anti-Fya, anti-Fy6, and anti-Fy3 antibodies, which represent large steric molecules, prevents IL-8 binding (4Horuk R. Chetan C.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25348-25351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but also that preincubation of red cells with IL-8, a small polypeptide, interferes with anti-Fy mAb binding. This latter observation is in contradiction with the results of Hausman et al. (20Hausman E. Dzick W. Blanchard D. Transfusion. 1996; 36: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this discrepancy might be that the IL-8 concentration used by this group (15–30 nm, calculated from the published data with a 10% red cell suspension) was not saturating. Alternatively, the flow cytometry analysis carried out here is probably less sensitive, but more quantitative, that the agglutination study performed by others (20Hausman E. Dzick W. Blanchard D. Transfusion. 1996; 36: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our data indicating a cross-competition of IL-8 and anti-Fy3 for red cell binding, however, are consistent with the results of Szabo et al. (21Szabo M.C. Soo K.S. Zlotnick A. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25348-25351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) carried out with MGSA (CXC class) as well as RANTES and MCP-1 (CC class) chemokines. Our results and those of Szabo et al.(21Szabo M.C. Soo K.S. Zlotnick A. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25348-25351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), however, did not support the results of Zhao-hai et al. (19Zhao-hai L. Zi-xuang W. Horuk R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26239-26245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that MGSA binding to DARC transfectants was unaltered by anti-Fy3. This discrepancy remains unexplained. Altogether, displacement and inhibition experiments indicate that anti-Fya, anti-Fy6, and anti-Fy3 mAbs are all antagonists for IL-8 binding to red cells. To obtain information on amino acid residues involved in anti-Fy6 mAb binding, 6-residue and 15-residue phage display libraries were screened with the biotinylated anti-Fy6 mAb (clone i3A). Insert sequences were determined from 60 phage clones selected by three rounds of biopanning and compared with the sequence of the NH2-terminal domain of DARC and more precisely with residues 12–25, which should encompass the Fy6 epitope, as deduced from sequence comparison of the Duffy gene from various primates that do or do not express the Fy6 antigen (13Chaudhuri A.

To determine whether the dipeptide FE was part of the Fy6 epitope, F22V,E23A substitutions were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in a recombinant vector carrying the cDNA encoding the major DARC isoform. The major and minor DARC isoforms encoded by the spliced and unspliced RNAs, respectively (26Iwamoto S. Li J. Omi T. Ikemoto S. Kajii E. Blood. 1996; 87: 378-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), differ only by the sequence of the six and eight NH2-terminal amino acids, respectively, and when expressed in K562 transfectants they bound the anti-Fy6 mAb (26Iwamoto S. Li J. Omi T. Ikemoto S. Kajii E. Blood. 1996; 87: 378-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and IL-8, RANTES, and MGSA 3C. Tournamille, C. Le Van Kim, J. P. Cartron, and Y. Colin, unpublished results. equally well. FACScan analysis of Fy6 expression was performed on transfected K562 cells stably expressing the wild type or mutant DARC protein. To ascertain a correct membrane expression of these polypeptides, K562 transfectants were stained with the anti-Fy3 mAb, which recognizes an epitope located in the third extracellular loop of DARC (19Zhao-hai L. Zi-xuang W. Horuk R. Hesselgesser J. Yan-chun L. Hadley T.J. Peiper C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26239-26245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both transfectants were strongly stained by the anti-Fy3 mAb, although binding to the Phe22-Glu23 DARC mutant was only half that of the wild type protein (Fig. 3 A). This supports the hypothesis that, as discussed below, the regions of DARC carrying the Fy6 and Fy3 epitopes most likely lie in very close proximity to each other. Examination of Fy6 reactivity indicated that the Phe22-Glu23 transfectant stained very poorly with the anti-Fy6 mAb (90% reduction) compared with the wild type transfectant (Fig. 3 A), thus indicating that the Phe22-Glu23 motif should be involved in Fy6 expression. These results are in agreement with those reported by Wasniowska et al. (32Wasniowska D. Blanchard D. Janvier D. Zi-xuang W. Peiper S.C. Hadley T.J. Lisowska E. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) during the preparation of this manuscript and which demonstrated by the use of synthetic peptides/pins technology and deletion mutant analysis that the DFE residues, as central positions of the QLDFEDV heptapeptide comprising amino acid residues 19–25, are essential for the Fy6 epitope. Furthermore, Wasiniowska et al. (32Wasniowska D. Blanchard D. Janvier D. Zi-xuang W. Peiper S.C. Hadley T.J. Lisowska E. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) also showed that all residues of the Fy6 epitope, except Phe22 and Asp24, could be replaced by one or two other amino acids without a significant decrease of antibody binding and that replacement of Glu23 by 10 other amino acid residues gave a 2–3-fold increase of the mAb binding on synthetic peptides. This observation should account for the high frequency of the FS motif in the phage inserts that we have isolated with the anti-Fy6 mAb (Table I). In parallel to Fy6 and Fy3 expression analysis, the wild type and Phe22-Glu23 mutant DARC transfectants were analyzed for binding of 125I-labeled chemokines. Nonspecific binding values were obtained with mock transfectants or when 200 nm unlabeled chemokines was added to the reaction mixture. Whereas radiolabeled IL-8, MGSA, and RANTES all bound to wild type transfectant cells, values corresponding to nonspecific background were obtained with the Phe22-Glu23 mutant (Fig.3 B). These results indicated that alteration of the Fy6 epitope abolished the binding of CC and CXC chemokines to DARC. Together with the anti-Fy6/IL-8 competition experiments, these results provided the definitive proof of the tight relationship between the Fy6 epitope and the chemokine binding site on the NH2-terminal region of DARC. Inhibition of IL-8 binding to neutrophils pretreated by NEM, an alkylating reagent that primarily blocks sulfhydryl groups, suggested that free reactive sulfhydryl groups are present in the binding domain of the specific IL-8 type A receptor (22Samanta A.K. Dutta S. Ali E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6147-6153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the effect of the treatment of red cells by NEM on the binding of the anti-Fy mAbs and IL-8 to DARC. Although 0.8 mm NEM inhibited IL-8 binding to neutrophils by 60% (22Samanta A.K. Dutta S. Ali E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6147-6153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubation of red cells with increasing amount of NEM (0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C inhibited neither the binding of the anti-Fy mAbs (Fig. 4 A) nor the binding of IL-8 (Fig. 4 B). These results suggested that there is no free reactive sulfhydryl group on DARC participating in the binding site of chemokines or anti-Duffy mAbs. It is known that on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the DARC protein migrated as a 37- or 42-kDa species under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively, suggesting that cysteine residues of DARC may be involved in intrachain disulfide bond formation (29Mallisson G. Soo K.S. Schall T.J. Pisacka M. Anstee D.J. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 33Hadley T.J. David P.H. McGinniss M.H. Miller L.H. Science. 1984; 223: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By analogy with the IL-8 receptors (23Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hebert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hebert C.A. Chuntharapai A. Smith M. Colby T. Kim J. Horuk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 1: 593-633Crossref Scopus (1125) Google Scholar), it is assumed that the extracellular cysteines 51 (or 54) and 276 and cysteines 129 and 197 (numbered on the major DARC polypeptide, see above) might be involved in disulfide bonds between the NH2-terminal domain and the third extracellular loop and between the first and second extracellular loops, respectively. To determine whether the presence of disulfide bond(s) is critical for the antigenic and chemokine receptor properties of DARC, we analyzed the effect of DTT (100 mm) treatment of red cells and of cysteine substitutions on the binding of anti-Fy mAbs and chemokines (IL-8, RANTES, and MGSA). The efficiency of DTT treatment was monitored with an anti-Kell mAb (F18–7D6) 4D. Blanchard, unpublished results. which detects an epitope accessible only when intrachain disulfide bonds within the Kell glycoprotein are disrupted (30Russo D.C.W. Russo S. Lee S. Reid M. Redman C.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3518-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although DTT-treated cells reacted slightly less strongly with the three anti-Fy mAbs (predominantly with anti-Fy3), it is clear that intact disulfide bonds were not required for Fya, Fy3, and Fy6 antigen expression (Fig. 4 A). However, DTT treatment of red cells has a drastic negative effect on 125I-chemokine binding, especially for IL-8, the binding of which to DTT-treated red cells was reduced by 60% compared with untreated red cells (Fig. 4 B). Analysis of DARC mutants in which cysteines 51 and 54 or cysteine 276 was replaced by serine residues was in full agreement with the above results. Indeed, K562 cells stably transfected by the Cys → Ser mutants stained positively by the three anti-Fy mAbs, albeit less than cells expressing the wild type DARC (Fig.5 A). However, despite the significant membrane expression of the mutant polypeptides, the binding of125I-chemokines to all mutants was abolished (Fig.5 B). Similar results were obtained by analysis of COS-7 cells transiently expressing a mutant of DARC in which only cysteine 51 was mutated, whereas individual substitution of cysteine 54 did not alter Fy antigen expression and resulted in 50% reduction of chemokine binding compared with wild type transfectant cells (data not shown). From these findings, it is assumed that chemokine binding alteration to DTT-treated red cells resulted from the disruption of at least an intrachain disulfide bridge between cysteines 51 and 276 which holds the NH2-terminal domain and the third extracellular loop of DARC together. Further experiments will be necessary to determine how the mutation of cysteine 54, which is not involved in this disulfide bridge, should alter the chemokine receptor function of DARC which does not require free reactive sulfhydryl group. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the Fy6, Fya/b, and Fy3 epitopes are all involved in the chemokine binding properties of DARC and that the first and third extracellular domains of DARC which carry these Duffy antigens are most likely brought into close proximity by an intrachain disulfide bond. It is assumed that the integrity of this disulfide bond is critical for the receptor function of DARC because it may create a pocket for chemokine binding which includes some of the amino acid residues that define the Fy6, Fya/b, and Fy3 epitopes (Fig. 6). It is expected that, together with the recent characterization of the Fy6 epitope (32, and our present results), the mapping of the Fya and Fy3 epitopes will provide important clues for the characterization of the chemokine binding site on DARC. We are indebted to Dr. Makato Uchikawa and Dr. F. Buffiere for supplying the anti-Fy3 and anti-FyamAbs, respectively. We thank Dr. G. P. Smith (University of Missouri, Columbia) for the generous gift of the peptide phage libraries."

These IRS (insulin receptor substrate) proteins provide an interface between the activated insulin receptor and various signaling proteins.

At the extreme NH2 terminus, the IRS proteins contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (IH1PH). The IH1PH is essential in IRS-1 for the interaction with a physiological level of insulin receptor (8Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.-M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H.

However, since it interacts with the phosphorylated regulatory loop of the insulin receptor β-subunit, we propose to designate it as the kinase regulatory loop binding (KRLB) domain. The binding of the KRLB domain of IRS-2 to the insulin receptor is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the COOH terminus and the NPEY motif in the juxtamembrane region (13Sawka-Verhelle D.

All IRS-1 and IRS-2 point mutants were generated by either site-directed mutagenesis of double-stranded DNA using the TransformerTMkit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) or the QuickchangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Plasmid DNA transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method of Gietz et al. (24Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H.

Bacteria were lysed in presence of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Lysates were frozen twice in liquid nitrogen and sonicated twice for 30 s. After 20 min of centrifugation at 17,000 × g, clarified lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then the glutathione-Sepharose pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer and concentrated using a column. The fusion proteins were eluted with elution buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 8, 50 mm glutathione). Insulin receptors were partially purified by chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (26Van Obberghen E. Kasuga M. Le Cam A. Hedo J.A. Itin A. Harrison L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, RHIR (Rat 1 fibroblasts expressing 106human insulin receptors/cell) were washed twice with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and solubilized for 90 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.6. The supernatant from an ultracentrifugation step (60 min, 100,000 × g, 4 °C) was applied to a WGA column, and insulin receptors were eluted with 0.3 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine in 50 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.6. Protease inhibitors were present throughout the procedure (20 μm leupeptin, 1.25 mm bacitracin, 100 IU/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insulin receptors were quantified by Scatchard analysis of125I-insulin binding. This peptide has been previously characterized (27Ponzio G. Contreres J.-O. Debant A. Baron V. Gautier N. Dolais-Kitabgi J. Rossi B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4111-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and corresponds to the sequence 1142–1156 (TRDIYETDYYRKGGK) of the human insulin proreceptor (28Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). 300 fmol of WGA-purified insulin receptors were incubated on WGA and were activated with insulin (10−7m) for 45 min. The peptide 1142–1156 was added at a final concentration of 500 μm with a phosphorylation mixture containing 4 mm MnCl2, 8 mm MgCl2, 30 μm ATP. The reaction was stopped after 1 h by spotting the total volume onto phosphocellulose papers that were dipped into 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid. Then the peptide was eluted in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), pH 8, for 2 h. The eluate was dried using a speed vacuum system overnight, washed twice in water, and resuspended in 200 μl of water. This peptide contains Tyr624 and Tyr628 and corresponds to the sequence 623–633 (PYPEDYGDIEI) of IRS-2. Four different concentrations of peptide (50, 100, 250, and 500 μm) were incubated with 300 fmol of WGA-purified insulin receptors activated or not activated with insulin (10−7m) and a phosphorylation mixture containing 30 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1.2 mCi/mmol, ICN, Irvine, CA), 4 mm MnCl2, 8 mmMgCl2. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped after 30 min by spotting 40 μl onto phosphocellulose papers that were dipped into 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid. The papers were extensively washed, and the radioactivity incorporated into the peptide was estimated by Cerenkov counting. 0.2 μg of GST-IRS-2-KRLB, mutated or not, was incubated with 300 fmol of WGA-purified insulin receptors that were activated by insulin at 10−7m for 45 min in a volume of 45 μl. To this was added 5 μl of phosphorylation solution containing 300 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1.2 mCi/mmol), 40 mm MnCl2, 80 mmMgCl2. After 10 min, the phosphorylation reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. 1 μg of GST-IRS-2-KRLB, wild type or mutated on both Tyr624 and Tyr628, was incubated with 300 fmol of WGA-purified insulin receptors that were activated by 10−7minsulin for 20 min in 45 μl. 5 μl of phosphorylation mixture (300 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol), 40 mm MnCl2, 80 mm MgCl2) was added. After 30 min, the phosphorylation reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%), and the gel was washed several times with H2O to remove SDS. Then phosphorylated GST-IRS-2-KRLB, wild type and mutated, detected after 15 h of autoradiography, were excised from the gel. The gel slices were minced, washed twice with 1 ml of H2CO3NH4, pH 8, and incubated overnight with the same buffer. The next day, the gel slices were subjected to tryptic digestion for a total of 24 h at 37 °C in a solution containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 50 μg/ml trypsin. During the digestion procedure, trypsin (50 μg/ml) was added twice after an 8-h interval. Then the buffer containing the tryptic peptides was recovered, and peptides were washed four times with 100 μl of H2O and dried in a speed vacuum concentrator. Finally, the tryptic peptides were resuspended in NH3 N/1000. The peptides were spotted onto silica thin layer chromatography plates. The first dimension was electrophoresis for 3 h at 900 V in acidic buffer containing 30% (v/v) formic acid. After drying, the plates were placed in a chromatography tank containing a buffer of 37.5% isobutyl alcohol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid (v/v) for 10 h. Plates were dried and subjected to autoradiography. 0.5 μg of GST-IRS-2-KRLB, mutated or not, was incubated with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. GST-IRS-2-KRLB was used either phosphorylated or not. When phosphorylated GST-IRS-2 was used, the fusion protein-containing pellets were incubated for 30 min with insulin (10−7m) and a phosphorylation mixture (30 μm ATP, 4 mm MnCl2, 8 mm MgCl2) in the presence of WGA-purified insulin receptors. Then the phosphorylated GST-IRS-2 pellets were washed five times with 0.5m NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 to remove the IR, while the unphosphorylated GST-IRS-2-KRLB pellets were washed twice with 30 mm Hepes, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.5. Concurrently, 2 pmol of WGA-purified insulin receptors were activated with insulin at 10−7m for 20 min in a final volume of 45 μl. Thereafter, 5 μl of phosphorylation mixture (300 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 mCi/mmol), 40 mm MnCl2, 80 mmMgCl2) were added. The reaction was stopped after 30 min by the addition of 500 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Na4P2O7), pH 7.5. Then 500 μl of the activated receptors were added to the pellets of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated GST-IRS-2 and incubated for 4 h. The pellets were washed three times with 30 mmHepes, 30 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.5, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Some experiments were performed in the presence of a peptide corresponding to the IRS-2 sequence 623–633. To do this, 10 μl of IRS-2 peptide 623–633 to yield final concentrations of 10 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm, 500 μm, 750 μm, and 1 mm were added to the IR for 1 h before mixing with the GST-IRS-2 pellets. The experiment was then performed as described above. In the yeast two-hybrid analysis, IRS-2 interacts with the insulin receptor through the IH2PTB and a region between residues 591 and 786 that we call the KRLB domain (13Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The KRLB domain contains seven potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites at positions 594, 624, 628, 649, 671, 734, and 758. Alignment of IRS-1 and IRS-2 reveals that five of these residues are common to IRS-1, whereas Tyr628 and Tyr734 are unique to IRS-2 (3Sun X.J. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G.J. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). To determine whether the unique tyrosine residues contribute to the interaction between the insulin receptor and the KRLB domain of IRS-2, each residue was replaced with phenylalanine, and the interaction of the mutant proteins with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor was tested in a yeast two-hybrid analysis. The KRLB domain of IRS-2 was fused to the Gal4 activation domain, whereas the catalytically active cytoplasmic portion of the insulin receptor (including the juxtamembrane region) was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain (LDBD); a IRS-2-IH2PTB fusion protein was included as a positive control. The IH2PTB and the KRLB domain interact with the insulin receptor independently during the yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr624 or Tyr628 significantly reduced this interaction, whereas mutations at the other tyrosine residues had no effect (Fig. 1 C). All of the mutant constructs interacted with a LDBD fused to N- and C-terminal Src homology 2 domains of p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, confirming that each one was expressed in the yeast cells (data not shown). Alignment of IRS-1 and IRS-2 reveals that the KRLB domain of IRS-2 (IRS-2-(591–786)) is homologous to residues 544–751 in IRS-1; Tyr624 and Tyr628 in IRS-2 reside in a PY624PEDY628 motif that corresponds to a SY578PEEG582 motif in IRS-1 (Fig.2). To determine the important features for insulin receptor binding, several point mutations were prepared in this motif of the IRS1-(494–741) region and the KRLB domain of IRS-2 and tested for binding to the insulin receptor in a yeast two-hybrid analysis. Substitution of Pro623 in the KRLB domain with Ser623 to create an IRS-1-like SYP motif significantly increased the binding to the insulin receptor (Fig.3 A); however, substitution of Ser577 with proline to create an IRS-2-like PYP motif in IRS1-(494–741) did not reconstitute insulin receptor binding (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, substitution of Gly582 with Tyr582 in IRS1-(494–741) did not create an insulin receptor binding site (Fig. 3 B). Thus, two tyrosine residues separated by three amino acids are essential for interaction of the KRLB domain with the insulin receptor, but this binding domain cannot be reconstituted in IRS-1 by various point mutations. Thus, other determinants outside of the local sequence motif are also required.Figure 3Quantitative analysis of the interaction between the insulin receptor and the PY624PEDY628 motif of IRS-2-KRLB or the corresponding motif in IRS-1. Sequence containing Tyr624 and Tyr628 of IRS-2 (A) and the corresponding sequence of IRS-1 (B) is shown. The yeast reporter strain L40 was cotransformed with a plasmid encoding the LDBD-IRβ in combination with a plasmid encoding GAD-IRS-2-KRLB mutants (A) or GAD-IRS-1-(494–741) mutants (B). Transformants were isolated on selective plates. Activation of theLexA-LacZ reporter gene was monitored by measuring β-galactosidase activity in cell lysates using ONPG as substrate. The activities are expressed in Miller's units (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and are the average ± S.E. of values obtained with samples prepared from three independent transformants. IRS-2-KRLB and IRS-1-(494–741) correspond to GAD fused to the 591–786 region of IRS-2 and its corresponding region on IRS-1, respectively. All IRS mutants have the indicated amino acids mutated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding properties of the KRLB domain were studiedin vitro, using GST fusion proteins containing the wild-type sequence, or mutated at position 624, position 628, or both. Unphosphorylated GST fusion proteins containing the wild-type or the mutant KRLB domain were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with 32P-labeled WGA-purified insulin receptors. After extensive washing, the phosphorylated insulin receptor associated with the wild-type GST-KRLB domain but not with GST alone (Fig.4). By comparison, insulin receptor binding to the GST-KRLB domain with a mutation at position 624 was reduced by 60% mutations at Tyr628 or at both Tyr624 and Tyr628 decreased the association to 10 and 5%, respectively. To evaluate the contribution of Tyr624 and Tyr628 in the interaction of the KRLB domain with the insulin receptor, we measured the coprecipitation of the32P-labeled insulin receptor by the GST-KRLB domain in the presence of the IRS-2 peptide comprising amino acids 623–633. Within a peptide concentration range of 10–100 μm, coprecipitation of IR was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). At 100 μm peptide, the amount of bound insulin receptor was reduced by 55%. A concurrent experiment carried out with a nonrelevant peptide at the same concentrations did not affect coprecipitation of IR (data not shown). Note that total inhibition of 32P-labeled insulin receptor coprecipitation by GST-KRLB domain was not obtained, suggesting that additional determinants located outside of this amino acid sequence are required. This may be explained by the fact that the peptide does not adopt the same conformation as the intact domain. To determine whether Tyr624 or Tyr628 is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor, the IRS-2 peptide 623–633 was used as a substrate. This peptide was not phosphorylated by the activated insulin receptor regardless of the concentrations tested (Fig.6). However, a peptide based on the amino acid sequence of the insulin receptor kinase regulatory loop (IR 1142–1156) used commonly as an in vitro substrate was phosphorylated normally (Fig. 6). These results suggest that Tyr624 and Tyr628 in the IRS-2 peptide 623–633 are not phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. Alternatively, it is possible that these residues are not phosphorylated in a small peptide but are phosphorylated in the intact domain, especially if conformational determinants are crucial for the interaction with the receptor. Therefore, we performed phosphopeptide maps of GST-IRS-2-KRLB, wild type or mutated on both Tyr624 and Tyr628. The two fusion proteins, mutated or not, were phosphorylated by the insulin receptor in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. After digestion with trypsin, they were separated by two-dimensional chromatography. A negative control experiment performed with GST alone showed that GST is not phosphorylated by the insulin receptor (data not shown). Therefore, the phosphopeptides obtained by tryptic digestion of the fusion proteins can be considered to be generated from the KRLB domain. Analysis of autoradiograms revealed several separated phosphopeptides; a set of major peptides and a set of minor peptides localized on the two autoradiographs. This indicates that trypsin had not totally digested the proteins and that the KRLB domain of IRS-2 contains several tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. As shown in Fig. 7, four peptides were present only in the IRS-2-KRLB wild type autoradiogram, whereas they were absent in the Tyr624 and Tyr628 mutated protein. This suggests that Tyr624 and/or Tyr628 in the KRLB domain of IRS-2 may be phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. To determine the role of Tyr624 and Tyr628 for phosphorylation of the KRLB domain, the wild-type or mutated GST fusion proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and WGA-purified insulin receptors. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit and the GST-KRLB domain fusion proteins was monitored by autoradiography. The wild-type KRLB domain was phosphorylated by the insulin receptor, whereas its phosphorylation was reduced to 50, 20, and 10% by mutations at Tyr624, Tyr628, and both positions, respectively (Fig. 8). Thus, Tyr624 and Tyr628 are involved in the interaction between the IR and the KRLB domain of IRS-2, including tyrosine phosphorylation, and Tyr628 seems to be more important than Tyr624 in this process. Next we examined whether phosphorylation of the KRLB domain modifies the in vitro binding to the insulin receptor. Immobilized GST-KRLB domain was phosphorylated or not phosphorylated by activated WGA-purified IR and then extensively washed to remove the receptor; no 32P-labeled insulin receptor was retained after stringent washes (Fig. 9 A,lane 3). Thereafter, the immobilized KRLB domain was incubated with fresh samples of WGA-purified insulin receptor autophosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP in separate incubations. GST alone did not coprecipitate the32P-labeled insulin receptor (lanes 1 and2). However, the unphosphorylated GST-KRLB domain bound strongly to the 32P-labeled insulin receptor (lane 4). In contrast, the binding of the phosphorylated GST-KRLB domain to the insulin receptor was reduced by 80% (p< 5 × 10−4) (lane 5 and Fig.9 B). To ascertain that this result is not due to contamination of the WGA preparation by proteases and/or by kinases different from the insulin receptor, we performed experiments using immunopurified insulin receptors. We obtained similar results, indicating that the difference between the phosphorylated and the nonphosphorylated forms of GST-KRLB is likely to be due to insulin receptor-induced phosphorylation (data not shown). We have previously shown (13Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that the autophosphorylation sites in the regulatory loop of the IR kinase (Tyr1146, Tyr1150, and Tyr1151) are required for the interaction between the IR and KRLB domain. To address this issue in more depth, we measured the coprecipitation of the IR by the GST-KRLB domain in the presence of a peptide containing Tyr1146, Tyr1150, and Tyr1151. Different concentrations of peptide corresponding to the sequence 1142–1156, phosphorylated or not, were incubated with the GST-KRLB domain immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. At all concentrations tested, the nonphosphorylated peptide had no effect on receptor binding to the GST-KRLB domain (Fig. 10). In contrast, when the peptide was phosphorylated, competition between the insulin receptor and the peptide was observed, and the amount of insulin receptor bound to the GST-KRLB domain was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 10 B). These results suggest that the KRLB domain binds to the phosphorylated regulatory loop of the insulin receptor. In addition to the IH2PTB in IRS-1 and IRS-2 that engages the phosphorylated NPEY motif in the insulin receptor juxtamembrane region, we identified a second region in IRS-2 between residues 591 and 786 that binds to the insulin receptor (13Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, He et al. (16He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11641-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) reported similar results. Since this novel region interacts with the regulatory loop of the insulin receptor, we call it the kinase regulatory loop binding, or KRLB, domain. The KRLB domain in IRS-2 provides a unique mechanism of interaction between IRS-2 and the insulin receptor, which is absent from IRS-1. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the regulatory loop plays an important role in activation of the insulin receptor kinase (30Wilden P.A. Kahn C.R. Siddle K. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16660-16668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in this region decrease the kinase activity of the receptorin vitro and in vivo and reduce the strength of the insulin biological responses (31Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 32Wilden P.A. Siddle K. Haring E. Backer J.M. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13719-13727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the regulatory loop may also play an important role for IRS-2 binding functionally couples the activation step to substrate selection. The absence of the KRLB domain from IRS-1 may facilitate the formation of the flexible complex, which is more easily phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. In contrast, by engaging IRS-2 through both the IH2PTB domain and the KRLB domain, the degrees of freedom in the complex may be reduced and restrict access to certain tyrosine phosphorylation sites. This difference between IRS-1 and IRS-2 is likely to generate differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of these substrates. Hence, this mechanism could result in different signaling potentials for IRS-1 and IRS-2. Our experiments suggest that Tyr624 and Tyr628in the KRLB domain are essential for binding to the insulin receptor. Substitution of these residues individually or together with phenylalanine inhibited insulin receptor binding, whereas mutations at the other tyrosine residues in this domain did not affect the interaction. Since the unphosphorylated peptide inhibits the interaction between the KRLB domain and the insulin receptor, we conclude that Tyr624 and Tyr628 function in an unphosphorylated state to promote the interaction. The yeast two-hybrid analysis reveals that the interaction between the KRLB domain and the insulin receptor requires a functional kinase domain and all three phosphorylation sites (Tyr1146, Tyr1150, and Tyr1151) in the regulatory loop of the insulin receptor (13Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this case, a phosphopeptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence in the regulatory loop inhibits the binding of the KRLB domain to the insulin receptor, whereas the unphosphorylated peptide does not interfere. Together with the yeast two-hybrid analysis, these results suggest that the Tris-phosphorylated regulatory loop constitutes an interaction site for the KRLB domain of IRS-2. Although the peptide competition experiments favor this hypothesis, it is possible that the phosphorylation of the regulatory loop exposes another region that is masked in the unstimulated receptor. From our results, we propose the following model. The IRS-2PTB domain would be the primary anchor of IRS-2 to the insulin receptor; the KRLB domain of IRS-2, including the PY624PEDY628 motif, would stabilize this binding to the insulin receptor, which then phosphorylates tyrosines of this domain. When we compared the amount of insulin receptor coprecipitated by the GST-KRLB phosphorylated or not phosphorylated, we found that phosphorylation of IRS-2-KRLB decreased the interaction with the insulin receptor. Hence, it would appear that the binding between the insulin receptor and the KRLB domain of IRS-2 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the KRLB domain, and this leads to decreased binding of IRS-2 to the insulin receptor. It is tempting to think that such a mechanism might be involved in releasing IRS-2 from the receptor. Although IRS-1 contains significant amino acid sequence homology to the KRLB domain of IRS-2, it does not bind to the regulatory loop of the insulin receptor (13Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The PY624PEDY628 motif in IRS-2 that contains these residues is similar but not completely conserved in IRS-1 (SY578PEEG582). Comparison of the two sequences shows that they contain three different residues, two of which (proline 623 and tyrosine 628) are differently charged. However, mutations converting this motif in IRS-1 to resemble the motif in IRS-2 did not create a KRLB domain in IRS-1. In particular, substitutions of Gly582 with Tyr did not create the binding site, although in vitro binding experiments suggest that Tyr628 is the predominant functional residue in the KRLB domain. Moreover, mutation of Pro623 to Ser623in IRS-2 enhances rather than diminishes the binding of the KRLB domain to the insulin receptor. This result indicates that the particular structure induced by the prolines surrounding Tyr624 is not a major determinant for the IRS-2 interaction with the insulin receptor. This suggests that the Tyr624 and Tyr628 in the KRLB domain mediate the insulin receptor binding, but other regions of the KRLB domain that are absent from IRS-1 must create the binding pocket. In conclusion, in addition to the pleckstrin homology domain and the phosphotyrosine binding domain in IRS-1 and IRS-2, IRS-2 has the region called the KRLB domain comprising amino acids 591–786 for interacting with the insulin receptor. Knowing that this region is absent in IRS-1 and that the IRS-molecules are substrates for the kinases associated to receptors for cytokines and GH (33Argetsinger L.S. Hsu J.W. Myers M.G.

https://openalex.org/W2044313783,"The function of cell surface-associated insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) is controversial. Both inhibition and facilitation of IGF action as well as IGF-independent effects have been reported. We examined the influence of endogenous cell surface-associated IGFBPs on IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) function in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells by comparing the effects of IGF-I and its truncated analog des-(1–3)-IGF-I on several components of the IGF-IR signal transduction pathway in the absence of significant amounts of soluble IGFBPs. IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I are known to have similar affinities for IGF-IR, although the affinity of des-(1–3)-IGF-I for IGFBPs is greatly reduced. Here we show that the two ligands were equipotent not only in IGF-IR binding but also in receptor activation in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing IGF-IR and possessing a relatively small number of cell surface-associated IGFBPs. In contrast, des-(1–3)-IGF-I manifested a remarkably higher potency as compared with IGF-I in inducing short and middle term cellular responses in IGF-IR-transfected Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells possessing a high number of both the receptor and the cell membrane-bound IGFBP-3. Thus, this difference in the effects of IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I can be attributed to the attenuation of IGF-I-mediated IGF-IR signaling by membrane-bound IGFBP-3. The function of cell surface-associated insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) is controversial. Both inhibition and facilitation of IGF action as well as IGF-independent effects have been reported. We examined the influence of endogenous cell surface-associated IGFBPs on IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) function in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells by comparing the effects of IGF-I and its truncated analog des-(1–3)-IGF-I on several components of the IGF-IR signal transduction pathway in the absence of significant amounts of soluble IGFBPs. IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I are known to have similar affinities for IGF-IR, although the affinity of des-(1–3)-IGF-I for IGFBPs is greatly reduced. Here we show that the two ligands were equipotent not only in IGF-IR binding but also in receptor activation in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing IGF-IR and possessing a relatively small number of cell surface-associated IGFBPs. In contrast, des-(1–3)-IGF-I manifested a remarkably higher potency as compared with IGF-I in inducing short and middle term cellular responses in IGF-IR-transfected Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells possessing a high number of both the receptor and the cell membrane-bound IGFBP-3. Thus, this difference in the effects of IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I can be attributed to the attenuation of IGF-I-mediated IGF-IR signaling by membrane-bound IGFBP-3. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, IGF-binding protein; IGF-IR, IGF-I receptor; hIGF, human IGF; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; IGFBP-3, IGF-binding protein-3. I and II are closely related polypeptides that have significant homology to insulin. IGFs appear to be important regulators of normal and malignant cell growth (1Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar, 2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Most of the cellular effects of IGF-I and IGF-II are mediated by the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). The receptor is a heterotetrameric complex composed of two α-subunits that bind the ligand and two β-subunits possessing tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of the ligand to IGF-IR leads to autophosphorylation of the β-subunit and tyrosine phosphorylation of the major receptor substrate (IRS-1) followed by activation of certain downstream signaling cascades (2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). This results in expression of immediate early gene products such as c-Fos (3Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Benito M. J.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). c-Fos as well as other Fos family proteins can dimerize with Jun family proteins forming the AP-1 transcription regulatory complex. AP-1 modulates gene expression by binding to the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element (TRE) present in promoter regions of numerous target genes, which ultimately brings about various cellular effects. The biological actions of IGFs are modulated by a family of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). At least six IGFBPs have been cloned and characterized. These proteins are found both in extracellular fluid and on the cell surface. The function of soluble IGFBPs is well defined. Their affinity for IGFs is higher than that of IGF receptors. Therefore, IGFBPs can inhibit the action of IGFs by sequestering these growth factors in the extracellular space (6Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of membrane-associated IGFBPs is less well understood. Both inhibition and activation of cellular functions by these proteins have been demonstrated depending on cell type (6Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kelley K.M. Oh Y. Gargosky S.E. Gucev Z. Matsumoto T. Hwa V. Ng L. Simpson D.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 619-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The situation is even more complex since the same IGFBP species being associated with the cell surface can display either an IGF receptor-dependent or -independent mode of action. It has been well documented that the inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3 often appear to be IGF-independent (8Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Oh Y. Muller H.L. Pham H. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas its stimulatory effects are associated with facilitation of the IGF action (11Elgin R.G. Busby W.J. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 12DeMellow J. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, we have recently shown that in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells tamoxifen treatment results in a marked decrease in the number of cell surface-associated IGFBP-3 that was accompanied by stimulation of cell proliferation (18Kleinman D. Karas M. Danilenko M. Arbeli A. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Levy J. Sharoni Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, this effect was associated with stimulation of IGF-I-induced IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation, one of the earliest events in the receptor activation. This correlation allows us to hypothesize that the cell surface-associated IGFBP-3 may attenuate the ligand-stimulated IGF-IR activity. The inhibition of IGF-I-induced functions by cell surface-associated IGFBP-3 was also suggested in recent publications (19Samaras S.E. Hammond J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E1057-E1064PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rogers J. Wiltrout L. Nanu L. Fant M.E. Regul. Pept. 1996; 61: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, the possibility of inhibition of IGF-IR signaling by these binding proteins has not been directly studied. In the present study we directly examined the above hypothesis by comparing the effects of IGF-I and its truncated analog des-(1–3)-IGF-I on several components of the IGF-IR signal transduction pathway in cells possessing a high amount of membrane-associated IGFBPs under conditions where the amount of soluble IGFBPs is insignificant. IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I are known to have a similar affinity for IGF-IR (21Ballard F.J. Francis G.L. Ross M. Bagley C.J. May B. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but in contrast to IGF-I, the affinity of des-(1–3)-IGF-I for IGFBPs is greatly reduced (22Lord A.P. Bastian S.E. Read L.C. Walton P.E. Ballard F.J. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 140: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Heding A. Gill R. Ogawa Y. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13948-13952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in the effects of IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I (both of which bind to IGF-IR, but only IGF-I also interacts with the cell surface-associated IGFBPs) would be attributed to the IGF-dependent function of these binding proteins. One of the advantages of such an experimental approach is that in this system the number of cell surface-associated IGFBPs remains constant during the assay; therefore, possible IGF-independent effects of the cell surface-associated IGFBP-3 do not interfere in the determination of its IGF-dependent modulation of IGF-IR function. Here we demonstrate that in IGF-IR-transfected Ishikawa cells possessing a high number of both the receptor and the cell membrane-bound IGFBP-3, des-(1–3)-IGF-I manifested a remarkably higher potency as compared with IGF-I in inducing short and middle term cellular responses. These data indicate that in Ishikawa cells the membrane-bound IGFBP-3 negatively controls IGF-IR function in an IGF-I-dependent manner. Human recombinant IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I were purchased from Gropep Pty. Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). Human recombinant IGFBP-3 was generously supplied by Dr. C. Maack (Celtrix Pharmaceutical Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Sodium chlorate was purchased from Aldrich. Heparinase I, heparinase III (heparitinase), and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus) were obtained from Sigma. Lipofectin reagent and G418 (Geneticin) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS were from Biological Industries (Beth Haemek, Israel). Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in DMEM containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), nystatin (12.5 μg/ml), and 15 or 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Transfections of NIH 3T3 and Ishikawa cells were performed essentially as described previously (3Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chen J.C. Shao Z.M. Sheikh M.S. Hussain A. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Fontana J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were co-transfected with pBPV-IGF-IR and pSVneo using Lipofectin reagent. Primary selection was done by growing transfected cells in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin). Screening of clones for IGF-IR expression was performed by flow cytometry (FACStar, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) using anti-IGF-IR antibody (IGF-IR (3B7), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The IGF-IR number was then determined as described below. IGF-I, IGF-II, des-(1–3)-IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 were iodinated by a mild chloramine-T procedure and were separated from free radioactive iodide on a Sephadex G-25M PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Specific radioactivity was about 9000 cpm/fmol for IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I and 1100 cpm/fmol for IGFBP-3. IGF-IR assay was performed using125I-des-(1–3)-IGF-I essentially as we described previously (24Kleinman D. Karas M. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Phillip M. Segev Y. Levy J. Sharoni Y. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2531-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface-associated IGFBPs were determined as a portion of 125I-IGF-I binding displaced by unlabeled IGF-I in the presence of 100 nm unlabeled des-(1–3)-IGF-I in every assay point to exclude 125I-IGF-I binding to IGF receptors (25Karas M. Kleinman D. Danilenko M. Roberts Jr., C.R. LeRoith D. Levy J. Sharoni Y. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 513-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding was measured in monolayers of wild-type or transfected Ishikawa cells (150,000 cells/well), wild-type NIH 3T3 cells (100,000 cells/well), and IGF-IR-transfected NIH 3T3 cells (25,000 cells/well) in 24-well plates. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C with 150,000 cpm of either 125I-IGF-I or 125I-des-(1–3)-IGF-I in 0.2 ml of PBS containing 1 mg/ml essentially globulin-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and dissolved in 0.5 m NaOH. Radioactivity was then measured in a γ-counter. The K d values and the number of binding sites were analyzed as described by Munson and Rodbard (26Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) using the LIGAND program for the final Scatchard analysis. Ishikawa cells were trypsinized and seeded in 24-well plates (100,000 cells/well) in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. The binding assay was carried out 8 h after plating to minimize the number of the naturally occurring cell surface-associated IGFBPs. Cells were washed with PBS followed by a 2.5-h incubation at room temperature with 100,000 cpm/well125I-IGFBP-3 in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled IGFBP-3 in 200 μl of PBS containing 1 mg/ml essentially globulin-free BSA. The cells were then washed, and radioactivity was measured as above. Ishikawa cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 300,000 cells/well. Two days later, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5 mm AEBSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and different test agents for 45 min at room temperature. Washouts from 3 wells were combined, desalted, and concentrated to a final volume of 40–50 μl in Centricon microconcentrators (10-kDa molecular mass cut-off). Cells were treated with sodium chlorate according to published procedures (27Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and incubated in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks in sulfate- and sodium chloride-free DMEM supplemented with 15% dialyzed fetal calf serum and containing either 30 mm sodium chlorate and 80 mm sodium chloride or 108 mm sodium chloride and 1 mm sodium sulfate for 48 h with medium replacement after 24 h. Cells were then plated in the same media into 24-well plates at a density of 80,000 cells/well. Two days later, the number of the cell surface-associated IGFBPs was determined as above. Ligand blotting was performed essentially as described earlier (18Kleinman D. Karas M. Danilenko M. Arbeli A. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Levy J. Sharoni Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions followed by electrophoretic transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Filters were incubated overnight with 1.5 × 106 cpm 125I-IGF-II, washed, dried, and then analyzed by a radioactive image analyzer (BAS 1000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). The Rainbow 14C-methylated protein molecular mass markers (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) were used. Polyethylene glycol-IgG precipitation assay was performed as described (24Kleinman D. Karas M. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Phillip M. Segev Y. Levy J. Sharoni Y. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2531-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for 2 days. Confluent cell monolayers were serum-starved overnight before the experiment. Cells were washed twice with PBS followed by incubation with 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 nmIGF-I or des-(1–3)-IGF-I in 2 ml of PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA (essentially globulin-free) at 37 °C for 3 min. Following stimulation, plates were placed on ice, and cells were washed rapidly with ice-cold PBS and frozen in liquid N2. Cells were then thawed on ice in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm sucrose, 80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mmAEBSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The protein content was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). 100-μg protein samples were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The Rainbow protein molecular mass markers (Amersham) were used. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and the tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates were detected using rabbit polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 1 μg/ml. Bands were detected by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's suggested procedures. Quantitation was done by the Image Analysis System (GDS 5000, UVP Inc.). IRS-1 and the β-subunit of IGF-IR were identified by protein stripping and reblotting of the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with anti-IRS-1 (IRS-1-CT, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-IGF-IR β-subunit (IGF-IRβ, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies, respectively. Confluent cells in 6-well plates were starved overnight in the serum-free medium, rinsed twice with PBS, and incubated with either IGF-I or des-(1–3)-IGF-I. Total cell lysates were then prepared according to the protocol recommended by Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Cells were washed with PBS, followed by addition of boiled buffer (1% SDS, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4). After a 5-min boiling, the lysates were homogenized by repetitive passing through a 26-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. Samples (100 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Fos antibody (c-Fos (4Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Benito M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 0.3 μg/ml. Bands were visualized by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham Corp.). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using an oligonucleotide representing the tetramer of the TRE consensus sequence (5′-TGACTCATGACTCATGACTCATGACTCA-3′) as described previously (29Tamir A. Isakov N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3391-3399PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin. The cells were lysed by passing through the 21-gauge needle, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.42m NaCl, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and was lysed by passing through the 21-gauge needle. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C and dialyzed against 50 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin for 6 h. The TRE consensus sequence oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4-polynucleotide kinase. Protein content of the sample was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford U. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and 10 μg of nuclear lysate were incubated at room temperature with the labeled TRE oligonucleotide for 30 min followed by separation of DNA-protein complexes from the unbound probe on 5% Tris borate/EDTA polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and analyzed by a radioactive image analyzer (BAS 1000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). To elucidate the role of cell surface-associated IGFBPs in modulating the IGF-IR signaling, we compared the effects of IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I on several components of the IGF-IR signal transduction pathway under conditions that do not favor significant accumulation of soluble IGFBPs. Since des-(1–3)-IGF-I binds to IGFBPs with extremely low affinities, the difference in effects of IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I on IGF-IR signaling in cells possessing a sufficiently high number of membrane IGFBPs could be attributed to modulation of the receptor function by these proteins. To validate this approach it should be examined whether both ligands are equipotent not only in IGF-IR binding but also in the receptor activation in cells where IGF-IRs substantially outnumber cell surface-associated IGFBPs. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were chosen for this purpose since we found these cells to have a very low number of membrane IGFBPs (6,200 molecules/cell) as compared with other cell lines tested in our laboratory (Table I). However, the IGF-IR number in the wild-type NIH 3T3 cells was also quite low (15,600 molecules/cell), thus reducing sensitivity of the receptor function assay. Therefore, the cells were stably transfected with hIGF-IR. The NR9 and NR15 transfectant clones used in the experiments showed a dramatic increase in IGF-IR number (971,900 and 968,000 molecules/cell, respectively) without a significant change in number of the cell surface-bound IGFBPs (6,700 and 7,100 molecules/cell, respectively), i.e. 99% of the total IGF-I binding sites in these clones were represented by IGF-IR. Fig. 1 demonstrates Scatchard plots of125I-IGF-I and 125I-des-(1–3)-IGF-I binding to NR9 cells. The data clearly indicate that both ligands have the same affinity to hIGF-IR (K d = 2 nm). As shown in Fig. 2, the IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I induced hIGF-IR tyrosine autophosphorylation in these cells with a similar dose response. Thus, the above results demonstrate equipotency of IGF-I and des-(1–3)-IGF-I in both IGF-IR binding and activation.Table INumber of IGF receptors and cell surface-associated IGFBPs in different cell linesCell typesIGF-IRsIGFBPsnumber/cell × 10 −3number/cell × 10 −3Ishikawa16.8 ± 4.3295.9 ± 42.3IGR14289.6 ± 34.5299.2 ± 37.4IGR21305.2 ± 32.9302.1 ± 29.9MCF-728.0 ± 5.693.4 ± 8.8NIH-3T315.6 ± 5.76.2 ± 2.1NR9971.9 ± 54.36.7 ± 2.9NR15968.1 ± 69.67.1 ± 3.4NIH 3T3 and Ishikawa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 or 15% fetal calf serum, respectively, in 24-well plates.

Effects of cell surface-associated IGFBPs on IGF-IR function were studied in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells naturally expressing a large number of cell surface-associated IGFBPs (mostly IGFBP-3), which is about 20-fold higher than that of IGF-IR (24Kleinman D.

Its mode of cell association in Ishikawa cells has not been characterized. To understand the nature of IGFBP association with the Ishikawa cell surface, we examined the ability of various agents to remove these proteins from cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, a 45-min incubation of cells with buffer alone or a divalent metal-ion chelator (EDTA (5 mm)) did not cause release of the IGFBPs into the incubation medium. Cell exposure to a high ionic strength solution (1 m NaCl) led to a dissociation of only a trace amount of IGFBPs. Essentially the same effect was observed after cell treatment with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase, the enzymes that specifically cleave heparan sulfates, thereby releasing heparan sulfate-associated proteins (28Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Also, in cells treated with sodium chlorate (the inhibitor of cell surface proteoglycan sulfation (28Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) the number of the cell surface-associated IGFBPs was about the same as in the non-treated cells (291,800 ± 41,600 versus 279,700 ± 52,200/cell). In addition, Fig. 3 A (lane 7) shows that almost no IGFBPs could be removed by cell treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Collectively, the above data indicate that divalent cations, electrostatic interactions, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchorage are not significantly involved in the association of IGFBP-3 or its putative acceptor with Ishikawa cells. In contrast to the above agents, the chaotropic compound NaSCN was capable of releasing substantial amounts of IGFBPs into the medium as shown in Fig.3 A (lane 6). The only IGFBP type revealed in the NaSCN washouts was IGFBP-3 (see Fig. 3 B). Chaotropic compounds are known to solubilize various membrane-bound proteins by disrupting hydrophobic interactions responsible for the stability of biological membranes (30Hatefi Y. Hanstein W.G. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 770-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have previously demonstrated that IGFBP-3 is a major IGFBP in membranes isolated from Ishikawa cells (18Kleinman D. Karas M. Danilenko M. Arbeli A. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Levy J. Sharoni Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the fact that NaSCN also released some IGFBP-3 from the extracellular matrix, even though NaCl, which is known to release IGFBPs from the extracellular matrix (31Jones J.I.

Recently, two organic cation transporters (rOCT1 and rOCT2) were cloned from rat kidney. In this study, we report the cloning and functional expression of an rOCT1 isoform, rOCT1A, from rat kidney. Genomic DNA cloning and sequencing demonstrated that rOCT1A is an alternatively spliced variant of rOCT1 with a deletion of 104 base pairs near the 5′-end. The uptake of [14C]tetraethylammonium (TEA) in oocytes injected with the cRNA-encoding rOCT1A was increased 16-fold over that in water-injected oocytes (29 ± 2.8 pmol/oocyte/h versus1.8 ± 0.13 pmol/oocyte/h, mean ± S.E., p< 0.05). [14C]TEA uptake in the cRNA-injected oocytes was saturable (K m = 42 ± 11 μm) and was inhibited significantly by organic cations, including cimetidine and N 1-methylnicotinamide. The amino acid sequence was deduced from the cDNA after examination of all three reading frames. Two overlapping open reading frames were found. Studies with synthetic constructs suggest that a functional organic cation transporter is encoded by the larger open reading frame. The larger open reading frame encodes a 430-amino acid protein (termed rOCT1A) that is 92% identical to rOCT1 and 57% identical to rOCT2. From hydropathy analysis, rOCT1A is predicted to have 10 transmembrane domains with both amino and carboxyl termini intracellular. RNase protection assays demonstrate the presence of rOCT1A mRNA transcripts in rat kidney cortex, medulla, and intestine.

The presence of polyspecific organic cation transporters asymmetrically distributed to the brush border and basolateral membrane of the renal epithelium promotes the vectorial movement of molecules in the secretory direction. The mechanisms of organic cation transport across each of these membranes have been studied in isolated renal plasma membrane vesicles from a number of species using the model compound, tetraethylammonium (TEA) 1The abbreviations used are: TEA, tetraethylammonium; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RPA, RNase protection assay; RF, reading frame; ORF, open reading frame; Pro, protein.

J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F1040-F1050PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the studies have shown that TEA is transported from the blood into the cell across the basolateral membrane via a facilitative, but passive, electrogenic carrier-mediated system (9Takano M. Inui K. Okano T. Saito H. Hori R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 773: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J.

The driving force is the inside negative membrane potential. Subsequently, TEA is transported into the tubule lumen across the brush border membrane via a secondarily active organic cation proton antiporter (2Sokol P.P. Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 233: 694-699PubMed Google Scholar, 8Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 216: 294-298PubMed Google Scholar, 9Takano M. Inui K. Okano T. Saito H. Hori R. Biochim.

The inwardly directed proton gradient, which serves as the major driving force, is generated mostly by the Na+-H+ exchanger on the brush border membrane (6Roch-Ramel F. Besseghir K. Murer H.

Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, little was known about the molecular characteristics of organic cation transporters at either the basolateral or brush border membrane of the renal proximal tubule. However, in 1994, Grundemannet al. (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), using expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes, cloned a polyspecific organic cation transport protein, rOCT1, from a cDNA library derived from rat kidney. rOCT1 is encoded by a 1.8-kb cDNA and has the properties of a basolateral membrane organic cation transporter, i.e. it is sensitive to membrane potential and insensitive to pH. Recently, a second organic cation transporter, rOCT2, from a rat kidney cDNA library was cloned using homology cloning with degenerate oligonucleotide probes to rOCT1 (18Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Isoforms of proteins may represent the translation products of mRNA transcripts from multiple genes or the products of alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts from a single gene. The process of alternative RNA splicing may result in increased genetic flexibility. For example, alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts may be translated into proteins with distinct functional characteristics. On the other hand, the protein products may have identical functional properties but differ in terms of regulation mechanisms that are critical in the tissue-specific role of the protein or in the course of cell differentiation. It is increasingly clear that alternative RNA splicing plays a critical role in increasing the diversity of membrane transporters such as the Ca2+ pump (19Strehler E.E. Strehler-Page M.A. Vogel G.

Chem. 1988; 263: 8646-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the biological role of organic cation transporters in renal and other epithelia, it is essential to identify relevant, functional organic cation transporter isoforms. Although isoforms of organic cation transporters encoded by different genes have been identified (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 18Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Pharmacol., in press.Google Scholar), it is not known whether there are isoforms of organic cation transporters resulting from alternative RNA splicing. By RT-PCR, we identified and cloned a novel isoform of rOCT1, rOCT1A, from the rat kidney. Sequence analysis, molecular modeling, and studies with synthetic constructs suggest that a functional organic cation transporter(s) is encoded by the mRNA of rOCT1A after initiation of protein synthesis at an internal start codon. This is the first evidence of a functional, alternatively spliced variant of a polyspecific organic cation transporter. Total RNA was isolated from male Harlan Sprague Dawley rat kidneys and other tissues using TriZOLRreagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA) was selected by affinity chromatography using oligo(dT)-cellulose spin columns (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Total RNA or mRNA was primed with oligo(dT) primer to synthesize the first strand cDNA using the SuperScriptTM preamplification system for first strand cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). The synthesized cDNA and primers (10 μm) (see Table I and Fig. 1) specific for the rat kidney organic cation transporter (rOCT1) cDNA (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) were used in the subsequent PCR under the following conditions: 94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles. The PCR products were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels, and size-selected DNA fragments were extracted and subcloned into the pCRTMII vector (original TA Cloning® kit, Invitrogen) or the pGEM-T vector (Promega) using T4 DNA ligase followed by transformation into INVαF′ One ShotTM (original TA Cloning® kit, Invitrogen) or DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) competent cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the WizardTM minipreps DNA purification system (Promega) and was analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis and/or sequencing.Table ISequences of primers and their positions in the rOCT1 cDNASequencePositionbpPrimer 1 (sense)5′-GCAGGCCTGGCTAAACTGGTGAG-3′1–23Primer 2 (antisense)5′-TTGCGGCCGCTCAGGTACTTGAGGACTT-3′1691 –1708Primer 3 (antisense)5′-AGTGCGGAACAGGTC-3′1046 –1060Primer 4 (sense)5′-CCAGAATCCCCCCGGTGG-3′887 –904Primer 5 (sense)5′-AGCGGTGTGGCTGGAGCCAGGCAGAG-3′216 –241Primer 6 (sense)5′-ATTGGGCCCCTGCGAGCATGGCTG-3′391 –414Primer 7 (antisense)5′-ACACCCAGCTGCCCTTGCTGACCAT-3′695 –671Primer 8 (antisense)5′-AACATGGATGTATAGTCTGGG-3′648 –628Primer 9 (sense)5′-ATCGTCACTGAGTTTGGCCGTAAGCTC-3′start at 440Primer 10 (antisense)5′-GAGCTTACGGCCAAACTCAGTGACGAT-3′start at 671Primer 11 (sense)5′-GCTCTAGAGCCTGAGTTTAACCTGGTGTGT-3′447 –466 XbaI sitePrimer 12 (antisense)5′-GGAATTCCTGGAATGGCATAGGCCA-3′801 –817 EcoRI siteSequences added that are not related to the rOCT1 cDNA, including restriction enzyme sites, are underlined, and mutation sites are indicated in italics.

To obtain the genomic DNA sequence flanking the spliced region (exon/intron junctions), we used a novel method for walking upstream or downstream in genomic DNA from the cDNA sequence (26Siebert P.D. Chenchik A. Kellogg D.E. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1087-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) with the Rat GenomeWalkerTM kit (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer instructions. Primers were designed from the cDNA sequence upstream or downstream of the splice site (primers 5–8) (see Table I). PCR reactions were performed with the AdvantageTM genomic PCR kit (CLONTECH) and used cycle parameters suggested by the manufacturer. The PCR products were subcloned as described above. To generate the in-frame deletion (105 bp) variant of rOCT1, the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to manufacturer protocol. Briefly, two primers (sense and antisense to each other) flanking the mutagenesis site (primers 9 and 10, see Table I) were used in PCR with plasmid DNA containing the rOCT1A inserts as the template and PfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was then digested withDpnI restriction enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by transformation and subcloning as described above. Subcloned cDNA inserts isolated from multiple reverse transcription and/or PCR reactions were sequenced using universal and gene-specific primers by the Biomedical Resource Center DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of California, San Francisco with an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 373A). Sequence alignments of rat rOCT1 and rOCT1A were produced using the Gap and Bestfit programs in the Genetics Computer Group (Wisconsin Package, version 8) software package. The Motifs program in the Genetics Computer Group package was used to determine potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and N-glycosylation sites. The transmembrane domains of rOCT1A were predicted based on hydropathy analysis using the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm (27Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17208) Google Scholar) in the Genetics Computer Group Pepplot program as well as the hydropathy analysis program in DNA Strider 1.2, a C program for DNA and protein analysis designed and written by Dr. C. Marck (Service de Biochimie et de Genetique Moleculaire, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). Healthy stage V and VI oocytes were defolliculated and then injected with 50 nl of water, mRNA, or capped cRNA (1 μg/μl in water) transcribed in vitro using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (mCAPTM RNA capping kit, Stratagene) from linearized plasmid DNA (28Giacomini K.M. Markovich D. Werner A. Biber J. Wu X. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 427: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The uptake of [14C]TEA (53 mCi/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) was measured in oocytes 3 days after injection using the methods previously described (28Giacomini K.M. Markovich D. Werner A. Biber J. Wu X. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 427: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, groups of 9–10 oocytes were incubated in the reaction mixture (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 500 μm[14C]TEA with or without 5 mm cimetidine for 60–120 min at 25 °C. For inhibition studies, 5 mmconcentrations of various unlabeled compounds were also included in the reaction mixture. For the Michaelis-Menten kinetic study, 30–100 μm [14C]TEA plus various amounts of unlabeled TEA were included in the reaction mixture. After incubation, oocytes were washed, and each oocyte was lysed individually with 100 μl of 10% SDS. The radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The TnT®-coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) andl-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, DuPont NEN) were used for eukaryotic in vitro translations following manufacturer protocol. Five microliters of translation product was denatured in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer plus 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol at 75 °C for 10 min and then loaded onto 4–20% gradient gels (Tris/glycine ready gels, Bio-Rad). To increase the sensitivity of detection of 35S-labeled protein, gels were soaked in AmplifyTM (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) after the fixing step. Gels were dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP film (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). A 370-nucleotideEcoRI-XbaI fragment of rat rOCT1 cDNA was amplified with primers 11 and 12 (see Table I and Fig.6 A) by PCR. After double digestion with EcoRI andXbaI, the PCR product was ligated into the pGEM®-11Zf(−) vector (Promega). A 416-nucleotide biotin-labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized from the linearized plasmid (cut by XbaI) by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (BrightStarTMBIOTINscriptTM T7 kit, Ambion). The RNase protection assay (RPA) was performed using a HybSpeedTM RPA kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer protocol. rOCT1 and rOCT1A cRNA (600 pg) were also included in the RPA as controls and size indicators. After RNase digestion, the protected RNA fragments were precipitated, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane (BrightStar®-PlusTM positively charged nylon membrane, Ambion), and then fixed by cross-linking. The protected fragments corresponding to rOCT1 and rOCT1A were detected using the BrightStarTM nonisotopic RNA detection system (Ambion) followed by membrane exposure to film. Uptake values are expressed as pmol/oocyte/h and presented as mean ± S.E. or as specified in the figure legends. A minimum of 6–9 oocytes was used in each experiment. Statistical analysis was carried out by the unpaired Student'st test. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Molecular biology supplies and radiolabeled compounds were purchased from the indicated manufacturers. Primers were synthesized by the Biochemical Resource Center at the University of California, San Francisco. Using first strand cDNA from mRNA isolated from several rat kidneys and primers 1 and 2 (TableI, Fig. 1 A) derived from the published cDNA sequence of rOCT1 (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), we obtained two PCR products of approximately 1.5 and 1.6 kb in size (Fig. 1 B,lane 2). The PCR product at 1.6 kb matched the predicted size of the rOCT1 cDNA, whereas the 1.5-kb PCR product was of unknown origin. These two products were also detected after PCR using plasmid DNA isolated from a rat kidney cDNA library and the same primers (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Furthermore, both bands were detected from RT-PCR starting with total RNA isolated from the kidney of a single rat (data not shown). To confirm that the 1.5-kb PCR product was not generated from the mRNA transcript of the 1.6-kb PCR product due to either a PCR error or an error in reverse transcription, cRNA transcribed from the subcloned 1.6-kb PCR product was used in RT-PCR. This reaction resulted in a single detectable band on the gel (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that there are two RNA species in the rat kidney that can be amplified by RT-PCR using rOCT1-specific primers derived from the beginning and the end of the open reading frame (ORF) of the rOCT1 cDNA sequence. Furthermore, the resulting PCR product of primers 1 and 3 produced double bands (Fig. 1 B, lane 5), whereas the product resulting from primers 2 and 4 produced a single band on the gel (Fig. 1 B, lane 7), suggesting that the difference in size is near the 5′-end of the cDNA. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the sequence of the 1.6-kb cDNA was identical to the published rOCT1 cDNA sequence (data not shown) (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 1.5-kb cDNA encodes a functional organic cation transporter, recombinant plasmids containing the cDNA insert oriented for sense transcription under the control of a T7 or SP6 promoter were used as templates for cRNA synthesis before injection into Xenopus laevis oocytes. A significant increase in the cimetidine-inhibitable [14C]TEA uptake was observed in cRNA-injected oocytes. [14C]TEA uptake in the cRNA-injected oocytes was increased 16-fold over that in the water-injected oocytes and 11-fold over that in the rat kidney total mRNA-injected oocytes (Fig. 2 A). However, the relative enhancement in [14C]TEA uptake varied depending on the batch of oocytes (range approximately 2–20-fold). To determine the specificity of transport, we studied the effect of various compounds on [14C]TEA uptake in the cRNA-injected oocytes. Consistent with the characteristics of polyspecific renal organic cation transporters, the organic cations (5 mm) TEA, guanidine, cimetidine, choline,N 1-methylnicotinamide, and procainamide all significantly inhibited the uptake of [14C]TEA (Fig. 2 B, p < 0.05). Similar functional characteristics of both rOCT1 and rOCT2 have been observed (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 18Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition,p-aminohippuric acid (5 mm), a model organic anion, weakly inhibited [14C]TEA uptake (Fig.2 B, p < 0.05). Organic anions at high concentrations (e.g. 5 mm) have been shown previously to inhibit renal organic cation transporters (1Gisclon L. Wong F.M. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F141-F150PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hsyu P.-H. Gisclon L.G. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F56-F61PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cacini W. Keller M.B. Grund V.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1982; 221: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that the 1.5-kb cDNA encodes a functional organic cation transporter having similar characteristics as rOCT1. Quantitative studies are under way to determine whether rOCT1 and rOCT1A differ in the potency of interaction with various substrates. To determine the kinetic characteristics of TEA transport in oocytes injected with the cRNA of the 1.5-kb PCR product, we measured TEA uptake over a range of concentrations (30–500 μm). Fig.2 C shows the data along with the computer-generated nonlinear regression fit curve for the Michaelis-Menten equation. TheV max and K m of TEA in this experiment were 5.4 ± 0.35 pmol/oocyte/h and 42 ± 11 μm, respectively. The K m of TEA uptake (42 μm, Fig. 2 C) is slightly lower than the value of 95 μm obtained previously for rOCT1 (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The V max is considerably lower (5.4versus 81 pmol/oocyte/h (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar)), suggesting that there may be fewer functional rOCT1A transporters present; however,V max values are difficult to compare due to differences in experimental conditions between laboratories. After ascertaining the function of the transporter, we carried out sequence analysis to deduce the primary sequence of the functional protein from the cDNA sequence. Because PCR may result in fidelity errors in amplification of DNA, we performed sequence analyses of cDNAs isolated from multiple reverse transcription and PCR reactions. A consistent sequence was obtained (Fig. 3 A). DNA sequence alignment between the 1.5- and 1.6-kb clone (rOCT1) demonstrates that the 1.5-kb cDNA sequence is identical to that of the 1.6-kb cDNA with a deletion between bp 451 and 556 of the rOCT1 cDNA. This is consistent with the PCR results (Fig.1 B). The deletion results in a stop codon at bp 460 in reading frame 2 (RF2, the same reading frame encoding the ORF of rOCT1), and a large ORF is present from the ATG at bp 312 to the stop codon at bp 1602 in RF3 (Fig. 3 A). This large open reading frame in RF3 encodes a protein (rOCT1A) of 430 amino acids that, after sequence alignment, is 92% identical to that of rOCT1 (the reading frame of rOCT1 is restored in the RF3 of rOCT1A cDNA after the deletion junction, and the only different region lies at the amino terminus) and 57% identical to that of rOCT2. (Alternative ATG sites at bp 408 or 540 of RF3 are other possible initiation sites and would encode truncated versions of rOCT1A.) Based upon hydropathy analysis using the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm and application of the positive inside rule (27Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17208) Google Scholar, 31von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), rOCT1A is predicted to have 10 transmembrane domains with both amino and carboxyl termini intracellular (Fig. 3 B). In comparison, both rOCT1 and rOCT2 are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 18Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). As a result of the deletion, rOCT1A lacks the first two transmembrane domains as well as the three potential glycosylation sites in the first extracellular loop of rOCT1. Nevertheless, rOCT1A exhibits similar functional characteristics to those of rOCT1, which implies that the first two transmembrane domains and these three putative glycosylation sites are not essential for the transport function. However, other properties of the transporter such as synthesis, targeting, and sorting may be different between the two isoforms. Five potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at serine residues 160, 166, and 202 and threonine residues 170 and 424 were identified in the intracellular loops of rOCT1A. (The positions correspond to the deduced amino acid sequence of rOCT1A beginning at the internal ATG at bp 312.) Additionally, one potential N-glycosylation site was identified in the extracellular loop between helices 7 and 8. These sites are conserved in both rOCT1 and rOCT1A (17Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To determine the genomic nature of rOCT1A, genomic DNA fragments of rOCT1 flanking the splice sites were cloned and sequenced. As shown in Fig.4, there is an intron of at least 6 kb in length between bp 451 and 452 of the rOCT1 cDNA followed by a short exon of 104 bp in length, which matches the deleted sequence. There is another intron of 439 bp in length between bp 555 and 556 of the rOCT1 cDNA. Based on the genomic sequence of rOCT1 in this region and the fact that rOCT1 and rOCT1A are 100% identical at the cDNA level (except for the 104-bp deletion in rOCT1A), rOCT1A represents an alternatively spliced isoform from a common precursor mRNA transcript. In addition, a recent chromosomal localization study of Roct1 excludes the possibility of multiple Roct1 genes or pseudogenes (32Koehler M.R. Gorboulev V. Koepsell H. Steinlein C. Schmid M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The 104 bp (exon B) in rOCT1 include part of the loop between transmembrane domain 1 and 2 and the whole transmembrane domain 2. This deletion interrupts a codon (AGG) between 555 and 556 that results in a frameshift and leads to an earlier stop codon in RF2. Frameshift in splice variants of membrane proteins in higher organisms (i.e. humans and other mammals) has been reported (19Strehler E.E. Strehler-Page M.A. Vogel G. Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6908-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Shire D. Carillon V. Kaghad M. Calandra B. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 799-807PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the large intron of at least 6 kb between exon A and B presents the possibility of further alternative splicing. It will be of interest to ascertain whether other subtypes or isoforms of rOCT1 exist and to determine their functional significance. In vitro translation experiments in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system were performed to synthesize proteins from the cRNAs of rOCT1A and rOCT1 (as a comparison). Translation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 5 shows that translation of the cRNA of rOCT1 produced a single band with an apparent molecular size of 47 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 2). In contrast, translation of the mRNA encoding rOCT1A resulted in several bands with one major band of about 16 kDa in size and a major band(s) of about 37 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 3). The multiple bands at 37 kDa may be a result of translation beginning at multiple internal ATG sites as discussed previously and suggested by the sequence. The 16-kDa band may be encoded by the short open reading frame in RF2 (bp 38–460, 141 amino acids). Alternatively, it can be a result of proteolysis. The protein products produced in the in vitro translation experiments have apparent molecular masses smaller than predicted based upon the deduced sequences. However, anomalous migration of membrane proteins is not unusual (35James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 36Hediger M. Coady M.J. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). To determine whether the smaller band of about 16 kDa was due to the early stop codon at 460 bp in RF2, a mutant of rOCT1A was generated. This mutant contained a 105-bp in-frame deletion in the rOCT1 cDNA, thus eliminating the early stop codon and restoring the RF2 as in rOCT1 of the spliced RNA. As shown in Fig. 5, in vitro translation of the cRNA of this mutant produced a single band (lane 4). These data provide the indirect evidence suggesting that the 16-kDa band observed afterin vitro translation of the cRNA of rOCT1A may be encoded by the short ORF in RF2 of rOCT1A. In addition, after in vitro translation, there is a notable size difference in the larger band from the cRNA of the mutant in comparison with the larger band(s) from the cRNA of rOCT1A. Such a size difference would not be expected with the difference in the length of the cDNA's encoding rOCT1A and the mutant,i.e. 1 bp. Many naturally occurring cellular and viral mRNAs are polycistronic, and multiple proteins are synthesized by re-initiation of translation at internal AUGs after meeting the terminator codon of the upstream ORF. Examples of polycistronic mRNA transcripts in eukaryotes are rare and have never been reported in mammalian mRNA (37Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 38Peabody D.S. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 39Merrick W. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine whether the multiple bands observed in in vitro translation studies are a result of a polycistronic mRNA transcript of rOCT1A or proteolysis. Future studies utilizing antibodies recognizing different ORFs will provide the definitive evidence to determine whether multiple proteins from different ORFs were encoded. Mutagenesis studies will be important in determining the internal initiation site(s) of translation for rOCT1A. Based upon comparative sequence analysis with rOCT1 and the general structure of membrane transporters that normally have multiple membrane spanning regions (40von Heijne G. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the larger protein is the functional transporter. Accordingly, we constructed a synthetic cDNA that would encode for the 16-kDa product (Pro 1) and two synthetic cDNAs that would encode for two possible functional transport proteins (Pro 2 and Pro 3) (Fig. 6 A). The function of the synthetic proteins was tested by injecting oocytes with cRNA transcribed from the cDNA encoding Pro 1, 2, and 3. [14C]TEA uptake was enhanced significantly in oocytes injected with the cRNA of Pro 2 or 3 in comparison to water-injected oocytes (Fig. 6 B,p < 0.05). In contrast, [14C]TEA uptake was not enhanced in oocytes injected with the cRNA of Pro 1 (2.35 ± 0.13 pmol/oocyte/h in cRNA-injected oocytes versus2.51 ± 0.31 pmol/oocyte/h in water-injected oocytes, mean ± S.E.). The reasons why Pro 3 had a higher expressed activity than either Pro 2, rOCT1, or rOCT1A are unknown. Differences in efficiency of the in vivo translation or protein processing may explain the data. Alternatively, Pro 3 may have a higher intrinsic activity. These data suggest that Pro 2 and 3, representing possible proteins encoded by the cRNA of rOCT1A, can mediate the transport of TEA, whereas Pro 1 cannot. In in vitrotranslation experiments, Pro 2 migrated at a similar rate as the 37-kDa translation product of the cRNA of rOCT1A (data not shown), suggesting that Pro 2 might be the functional organic cation transporter. These data have implications to the function of rOCT1, since rOCT1A is 92% identical in sequence to rOCT1. To characterize the rOCT1A RNA expression in the kidney, RPAs were performed. A 416-nucleotide biotin-labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized to specifically detect rOCT1 and rOCT1A RNA fragments differing by approximately 110 nucleotides (Fig. 7 A). As shown in Fig.7 B, two RNase-protected fragments of expected size for rOCT1 and rOCT1A (370 and 263 nucleotides, respectively) were detected in the RNA of total kidney, kidney cortex, and kidney medulla. In addition, from the intensities of the protected fragments, it appears that the rOCT1 RNA transcript is present at a higher level than that of rOCT1A in the kidney. Additional RPAs using this probe detected rOCT1 and rOCT1A RNA transcripts in the intestine but not in the heart or spleen (data not shown). Tissue distribution of rOCT1A transcript was also determined by RT-PCR using primers 1 and 3 (Table I). Fig. 7 C shows that, consistent with the RPA results, transcripts of rOCT1 and rOCT1A (double bands at about 1.0 kb) are present in the rat kidney (total), kidney cortex, kidney medulla, intestine, liver, and colon but not in the stomach, brain, spleen, lung, and heart. These data suggest that the tissue distribution of the mRNA transcripts of rOCT1A and rOCT1 is similar but differs from that of rOCT2, which is confined to the kidney (18Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We also noticed that although the mRNA transcript of rOCT1A and rOCT1 coexpress in the same tissues, their relative levels appear different in results from both RPA and RT-PCR. Whether the expression level of the RNA of rOCT1A and rOCT1 reflects the protein expression level and relates to their physiological roles in different tissues or whether the alternative splicing represents a regulatory mechanism will be further investigated. In summary, a polyspecific organic cation transporter, rOCT1A, from rat kidney has been cloned and expressed. rOCT1A is an alternatively spliced variant of rOCT1 and is similar in function to rOCT1 and rOCT2. RT-PCR indicates that rOCT1A mRNA transcripts are also present in the intestine and liver, and RNase protection assays indicate that the RNA transcript of rOCT1A is present in detectable quantities in the rat kidney. Future studies will be performed to determine the underlying structural requirements for the function of organic cation transporters, the physiologic role of rOCT1A in the intact tissue, and the mechanisms involved in the translation of the rOCT1A mRNA transcript.

Haemophilus influenzae is a non-enteric pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium found in the human respiratory tract. Certain strains of H. influenzae are known to cause diseases such as bacterial meningitis, otitis media, and upper respiratory infections. One critical factor modulating the pathogenicity of H. influenzae is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; LSIMS, liquid secondary ion mass spectra. of its outer membrane (1Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H. Martin A. Brisson J.R. Fleischmann R. Venter J.C. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). LPS is a major outer membrane glycolipid found in almost all Gram-negative bacteria (2Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 3Raetz C.R.H. J.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar), and portions of the LPS molecule are required for viability and virulence. LPS is anchored into the outer membrane by the lipid A moiety, a unique acylated disaccharide of glucosamine (Fig. 1). The eight-carbon sugar 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo), another conserved component of LPS, is linked to the 6′ position of lipid A (Fig. 1). The 5-OH of the inner Kdo is the point of attachment of additional core sugars (data not shown) in wild-type cells. InEscherichia coli and most other Gram-negative bacteria, Kdo and lipid A are both required for growth under laboratory conditions (Fig. 1) (3Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5745-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed.

The key roles of Kdo and lipid A for bacterial viability are supported by the observation that inhibitors of Kdo and lipid A biosynthesis possess anti-bacterial activity (7Goldman R. Kohlbrenner W. Lartey P. Pernet A. Nature. 1987; 329: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Hammond S.M. Claesson A. Jansson A.M. Larsson L.G. Pring B.G. Town C.M. Ekström B.

Raetz C.R.H. Science. 1996; 274: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutants defective in Kdo and lipid A formation must be isolated as conditional lethal mutants (10Rick P.D. Fung L.W.-M. Ho C. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4904-4912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4895-4903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for Kdo transfer in E. coli is an unusual bi-functional glycosyl transferase capable of adding two Kdo residues with distinct glycosidic linkages to lipid IVA, a key precursor of lipid A (Fig. 2). The gene encoding the Kdo transferase (kdtA) of E. coli has been cloned (13Clementz T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9687-9696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KdtA protein has been purified to homogeneity and utilized to confirm that the addition of the two Kdo moieties is catalyzed by a single polypeptide of 425 amino acids (14Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chlamydia trachomatis possesses a more complex Kdo transferase, encoded by the gseA gene (15Belunis C.J. Mdluli K.E. Raetz C.R.H. Nano F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18702-18707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chlamydial transferase is capable of catalyzing at least three Kdo additions (15Belunis C.J. Mdluli K.E. Raetz C.R.H. Nano F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18702-18707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GseA consists of 401 amino acids. Sequence comparisons of E. coli and C. trachomatis demonstrate that the C. trachomatis enzyme is 23% identical and 66% similar to the E. coli enzyme (15Belunis C.J. Mdluli K.E. Raetz C.R.H. Nano F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18702-18707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the lengths of the polypeptides, the presence of additional catalytic domains cannot account for the multiple glycosylations catalyzed by the C. trachomatis Kdo transferase. Interestingly, the gseA gene can support the growth of anE. coli mutant in which kdtA is disrupted (16Belunis C.J. Clementz T. Carty S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27646-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Kdo region of H. influenzae LPS is distinct from that of most other characterized Gram-negative bacteria. Structural studies by several laboratories have established that the LPS of H. influenzae contains only a single Kdo (17Zamze S.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Moxon E.R. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Gibson B.W.

Biochem. 1988; 177: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, the sole Kdo of H. influenzae is phosphorylated at the 4-OH position that is occupied by the second Kdo in E. coli LPS (Fig. 1) (18Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4515-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These observations raise the interesting question of whether a minimal LPS, consisting of lipid A and a single Kdo, would be sufficient to support the growth of all Gram-negative bacteria. Alternatively, a single Kdo substituted with a phosphate might be necessary, given that the negative charge of the phosphate would be in approximately the same place as that of the carboxylate of the outer Kdo normally present in E. coli LPS. The implication of the structural analysis of H. influenzaeLPS is that this bacterium should contain a mono-functional Kdo transferase. In addition, the presence of phosphate on the 4-OH position of the Kdo in H. influenzae LPS suggests the presence of a novel Kdo kinase (Fig. 2). The enzymatic transfer of Kdo to lipid A precursors and the possibility of Kdo phosphorylation have not been investigated previously in H. influenzae. The structural characterizations of H. influenzae LPS, although convincing, have been performed using degradation products of isolated LPS, not with intact natural products or enzymatically synthesized precursors. In the present work, we have used extracts of non-typeable strain 722 of H. influenzae (20Ruan M. Akkoyunlu M. Grubb A. Forsgren A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3379-3384PubMed Google Scholar) to demonstrate the existence of a mono-functional Kdo transferase, distinct from the multi-functional Kdo transferases of E. coli or C. trachomatis. When Kdo-lipid IVA was incubated with H. influenzaemembranes and ATP, an additional novel mono-phosphorylated derivative was generated. Mass spectrometry of both Kdo-lipid IVA and its mono-phosphorylated derivative support the proposed reaction scheme shown in Fig. 2. Our studies provide the first direct evidence for the unique enzymes that participate in the assembly of the Kdo region of H. influenzae LPS. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Kdo, Hepes, ATP, CTP, EDTA, EGTA, NAD+, and heme were obtained from Sigma. Triton X-100 was Surfact-Amps grade from Pierce. Yeast extract, Tryptone, and brain-heart infusion were from Difco. HPLC-grade pyridine was purchased from Aldrich. All other chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade. The 0.25-mm glass-backed Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates were from E. Merck. Davisil™ (100–200 mesh, 60 Å) silica gel was purchased from Aldrich. Prior to use, the silica was washed with acid to ensure the removal of trace metals. Approximately 250 g (1 g = ∼3 ml) of resin was washed with deionized water, and the fines were decanted. The slurry was poured into a glass column and washed with 3 mHCl (3–4 times the resin volume). The column was then washed with deionized water until the effluent pH was greater than 5.0. Excess water was removed by washing the column with 3–4 bed volumes of methanol. The resin was dried under positive air flow for 20–30 min until it was loose and relatively dry. Finally, the resin was dried for at least 16 h in an oven at 120 °C. H. influenzae strain 722, which has been characterized previously (20Ruan M. Akkoyunlu M. Grubb A. Forsgren A. J.

Cells of H. influenzaewere grown at 37 °C on a brain-heart infusion medium (37 g/liter), supplemented with heme (10 μg/ml) and NAD+ (10 μg/ml) (21Barcak G.J. Chandler M.S. Redfield R.J. Tomb J.-F.

E. coli strain BR7, which lacks the coupling factor ATPase and is defective in diacylglycerol kinase, was described previously (22Brozek K.A. Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Cells of E. coli were grown at 37 °C on Luria broth, consisting of 10 g of NaCl, 10 g of tryptone, and 5 g of yeast extract/liter (23Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Cultures of H. influenzae (4 × 1 liter portions) were grown to late log phase (A 600 ∼ 1.0–1.5) and harvested by centrifugation at 1,900 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then washed with 300 ml of 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA. The washed cell pellet was resuspended in ∼50 ml of 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA. The cells were ruptured by two passages through an ice-cold French pressure cell (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 18,000 p.s.i. Next, the cellular extract was briefly subjected to sonic irradiation (two 5-s bursts at maximal power) on an ice bath to decrease the viscosity of the solution. The unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell-free extract was further fractionated into cytosolic and membrane components by centrifugation at 150,000 × gfor 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) was centrifuged again to remove any remaining membrane contaminants. The membrane pellet was resuspended in ∼25 ml of 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA, and also centrifuged again to produce a washed membrane fraction. E. colimembranes were prepared in the same manner. All membrane suspensions were stored frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Large scale preparations of lipid IVA (10–100 mg quantities) were performed as described previously (25Raetz C.R.H. Purcell S. Meyer M.V. Qureshi N. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16080-16088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to use in the large scale product isolations, the lipid IVA was subjected to reverse phase chromatography as described by Hampton et al. (26Hampton R.Y. Golenbock D.T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14802-14807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [4′-32P]Lipid IVA was prepared enzymatically using E. coli BR7 membranes as the source of 4′-kinase, [γ-32P]ATP, and tetra-acyl disaccharide 1-phosphate as the substrate, as described by Brozek et al. (22Brozek K.A. Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5170-5179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All lipid substrates were dispersed by sonic irradiation for approximately 1 min in a bath prior to use. Recombinant E. coli CMP-Kdo synthetase was partially purified as described by Brozek et al. (27Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from JM103/pTJB201.2, kindly provided by Dr. R. Goldman of Abbott Laboratories. Recombinant E. coli Kdo transferase was purified as described previously (14Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfer of Kdo to the acceptor, [4′-32P]lipid IVA, was assayed by the method of Brozek et al. (27Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reaction mixtures (10–20 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm Kdo, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μm [4′-32P]lipid IVA (3,000–6,000 cpm/nmol), 5 mm CTP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 milliunits of partially purified CMP-Kdo synthase. Standard assays were initiated by addition of enzyme, usually H. influenzae extracts or membranes, as indicated, and incubated at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by spotting 5 μl of the mixtures onto a thin layer silica plate. The plate was then air-dried and developed in chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/H2O (30:70:16:10, v/v). The solvent was evaporated with a hot air stream, and the plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 12–16 h. The extent of conversion of [4′-32P]lipid IVA to the products of interest was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager equipped with the ImageQuant program. The transfer of phosphate to Kdo-lipid IVA in H. influenzae extracts was monitored under conditions similar to those used for detecting Kdo transfer to [4′-32P]lipid IVA. Each reaction mixture (10–20 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, unless otherwise noted, and either 10 μmKdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (∼20,000 cpm/nmol), or varying amounts of Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA(3,000–4,000 cpm/nmol) (see below). The assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme and were incubated at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated, and the products were separated by thin layer chromatography, as described for the Kdo transferase assays. Initial purification of Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (also designated metabolite A) was accomplished by utilizing the preparative thin layer chromatography methodology developed earlier for the isolation of [4′-32P]lipid IVA. A 200-μl standard Kdo transferase reaction mixture containing 100 μm[4′-32P]lipid IVA (20,000 cpm/nmol) was initiated with solubilized H. influenzae membranes (∼4 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was spotted in a line onto a thin layer chromatography plate and developed, as described above for the Kdo transferase assay. The plate was then subjected to autoradiography for 15 min, and the band corresponding to Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was scraped and eluted from the silica chips, as described previously for [4′-32P]lipid IVA (22Brozek K.A. Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5170-5179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H. influenzaemembranes (typically 2 ml of a 15 mg/ml suspension) were thawed and solubilized by mixing the membranes with an equal volume of solubilization buffer, consisting of 4% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl. The solubilization mixture was held on ice for 30 min with intermittent gentle mixing. The material was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing solubilized enzymes was removed and used immediately as the enzyme source for the large scale product preparations (see below). To facilitate the preparation of milligram quantities of the reaction products for analysis by mass spectrometry and for further use as substrates, the reaction conditions were optimized and altered slightly to obtain nearly complete conversion of lipid IVA to the desired product. For the preparation of Kdo-lipid IVA(metabolite A), reaction mixtures contained the following components (final concentrations): 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Kdo, 100 μm lipid IVA(purified through the reverse phase chromatography step as described above), 5 mm CTP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.9 units of partially purified CMP-Kdo synthetase. The reaction was initiated with ∼8 mg of solubilized H. influenzaemembranes, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in a shaking water bath. Typically, two 10-ml reaction mixtures were prepared in 16 × 125-mm borosilicate glass tubes closed with Teflon-lined lids. At the end of the incubation period, the mixture was distributed to four 25-ml Corex tubes, and 1.25 ml of CHCl3, 2.5 ml of methanol, and 0.04 ml of concentrated HCl were added/ml of reaction mixture. The tubes were thoroughly mixed and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature to remove precipitated proteins. The supernatant was transferred to one or more fresh Corex tubes. Next, 0.263 ml of CHCl3 and 0.263 ml of H2O were added per ml to convert the sample to a two-phase system. The phases were separated by centrifugation, as described above. The CHCl3 lower phase was removed, and the upper phase was washed twice with 10 ml of a fresh, pre-equilibrated neutral lower phase (i.e. a lower phase generated by mixing chloroform/methanol/H2O, 2:2:1.8, v/v) (28Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7837-7844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower phases containing the lipid product (∼170 ml) were pooled, 0.5 ml pyridine was added, and the solvents were removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was redissolved in ∼20 ml of the solvent mixture chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/H20/methanol (50:60:15:3:2.5, v/v), and loaded onto a 9-ml silicic acid column equilibrated in the same solvent. The column was washed with 25 ml of the same solvent mixture used to load the column, followed by 60 ml of chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v). The desired compound was eluted with ∼30 ml of neutral Bligh-Dyer single phase (chloroform/methanol/H2O; 1:2:0.8, v/v) (28Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7837-7844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions (∼19 ml) containing Kdo-lipid IVA were identified by spotting 5 μl of each fraction onto a silicic acid thin layer chromatography plate, which was developed using the same solvent system as described above for the Kdo transferase assay. The presence of the Kdo-lipid IVA was detected by charring following spraying of the plate with 20% sulfuric acid in ethanol. The desired fractions were pooled and converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system by the addition of 0.263 ml of CHCl3 and 0.263 ml of H2O/ml of pool. The mixture was agitated vigorously and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The CHCl3-rich lower phase was removed, and the upper phase was washed two times with pre-equilibrated neutral lower phase (prepared in Bligh-Dyer proportions with H20). The lower phases were pooled and 5–10 μl of HPLC-grade pyridine was added. The solvents were removed by rotary evaporation, and the Kdo-lipid IVA was further dried by lyophilization. The reaction mixture for generating phosphorylated Kdo-lipid IVA (metabolite B) contained the same components as that for making Kdo-lipid IVA with the addition of 5 mm ATP. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Metabolite B was isolated exactly as described above for the Kdo-lipid IVA. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were acquired on a Kompact III time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK) in a linear mode. Gentisic acid (Aldrich) was used as a matrix. Analyte anions were desorbed from the matrix by irradiation with a 337-nm pulsed nitrogen laser. Each spectrum was an average of 50 scans. Liquid secondary ion mass spectra (LSIMS) were acquired on a Concept IH (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK) two-sector (EB geometry) mass spectrometer at a resolution of 1000. A 1-μl aliquot of sample solution in methanol/chloroform (1:2) was mixed with the mono-thioglycerol or triethanolamine (Aldrich) on the tip of the probe. Analyte ions were desorbed from the matrix by an 8-keV Cs+primary ion beam. Mass spectra were acquired by scanning the magnet in the 100–2500-atomic mass unit range at a scan rate of 10 s/decade. Normally 10–20 scans were signal-averaged for each spectrum. The presence of a Kdo transferase activity in H. influenzae was determined by assaying extracts under conditions utilized previously to identify the E. coli Kdo transferase (13Clementz T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9687-9696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, CMP-Kdo is generated in situ, and the transfer of Kdo to [4′-32P]lipid IVA is detected by thin layer chromatography and PhosphorImager analysis. As shown in Fig.3, the H. influenzae extracts are capable of converting [4′-32P]lipid IVA to two new, more slowly migrating metabolites. Metabolite A is the predominant product (5.3% conversion after 20 min in Fig. 3), and, as shown below, it corresponds to the addition of a single Kdo residue to lipid IVA. Metabolite A, which not is generated in significant amounts in E. coli extracts, migrates faster than the Kdo2-lipid IVA formed by the E. coliKdo transferase under the same conditions (Fig. 3, lane 4), supporting the view that the Kdo transferase of H. influenzae may be mono-functional, or at least displays significantly different kinetics for each Kdo transfer than does theE. coli enzyme. A small amount of a second hydrophilic derivative of [4′-32P]lipid IVA, designated metabolite B, was also formed (Fig. 3) in H. influenzae extracts. Metabolite B migrates with Kdo2-lipid IVA, anda priori, it could correspond to the formation of a doubly glycosylated [4′-32P]lipid IVA. Given previous characterizations of the structure of the Kdo region ofH. influenzae LPS (17Zamze S.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Moxon E.R. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Gibson B.W.

Biochem. 1988; 177: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), however, a more plausible explanation for metabolite B would be the incorporation of a phosphate moiety, which might have a similar effect on the Rf as the addition of a second Kdo residue. When ATP was included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3, lane 3), a significant increase in the formation of metabolite B was observed. The formation of a some metabolite B without the addition of exogenous ATP could be attributed to residual ATP present in the crude extracts employed as the source of enzyme or to the CTP-dependent conversion of ADP to ATP by nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The subcellular localization of the putative Kdo transferase of H. influenzae was determined. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 1–3), the activity responsible for the formation of metabolite A is localized predominantly in the membrane. About 75–85% of the total activity found in extracts is recovered in the resuspended membrane fraction. Very little metabolite B was formed with washed membranes in the absence of added ATP. All subsequent characterizations of the H. influenzae Kdo transferase were therefore carried out with washed membranes as the enzyme source. Like the bi-functional E. coli Kdo transferase, the H. influenzae Kdo transferase was dependent upon the presence of Triton X-100 (0.1%, w/v) for activity, and it displayed a pH optimum of 7.5 in Hepes buffer (data not shown). Using these conditions, the formation of the putative Kdo-lipid IVA (metabolite A) by membranes was linearly dependent upon protein concentration (Fig.5, panel A) and time (Fig. 5, panel B). Furthermore, the conversion of the substrate (100 μm [4′-32P]lipid IVA) to metabolite A was very efficient (>85%) with the addition of excess enzyme (data not shown). The specific activity of the Kdo transferase in washed membranes under these assay condition is 0.5–1.0 nmol/min/mg. Crucial to the identification of metabolite A as the product of a Kdo transferase was the determination of the dependence of the reaction on various assay components. The effect of removing the substrates necessary for the generation of CMP-Kdo (Kdo and CTP) was examined by determining the amount of Kdo-lipid IVA (metabolite A) formed from [4′-32P]lipid IVA. As shown in Fig. 6, when individual components of the CMP-Kdo-generating system were missing, no detectable Kdo-lipid IVA was formed by H. influenzae membranes. It is also apparent that the product formed by H. influenzaemembranes is distinct from the Kdo2-lipid IVAformed by purified E. coli Kdo transferase (Fig. 6,lane 6). The isolation of metabolite A (presumably Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA) by thin layer chromatography facilitated its further characterization (see “Experimental Procedures”). If metabolite A did indeed correspond to Kdo-lipid IVA, it should be chemically competent as substrate for the purified E. coliKdo transferase (14Belunis C.J. Raet"

During the last decade, many studies have shown that non-DNA binding viral transactivators achieve their task by direct interaction with different cellular sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors.

Similarly, E1A interacts with a number of cellular proteins including ATF-2 (18Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein is a promiscuous transcriptional transactivator (reviewed in Ref. 19Rossner M.T. J. Med. Virol. 1992; 36: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This conclusion is derived from a large number of studies using mostly transient cotransfection of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under control of a potential target promoter/enhancer and the X gene under the control of a heterologous promoter in mammalian cells. Induction of transcription by X usually ranges from 2- to 20-fold depending on the target promoter and cell type; whether this transactivation activity contributes to viral function, however, remains to be determined. Fusion of the X protein to the DNA-binding domain of the bacterial LexA repressor resulted in a protein that can activate transcription from a reporter plasmid bearing lexA operator sequences fused to a minimal promoter (20Seto E. Mitchell P.J. Yen T.S.B. Nature. 1990; 344: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Similarly, fusion of the X protein to the DNA-binding domain of transcription factor C/EBP increased the ability of X to activate a reporter containing C/EBP binding sites (21Unger T. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1889-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Attempts to demonstrate sequence-specific DNA binding by the X protein so far have not been successful, and, therefore, it is believed that the X protein belongs to the non-DNA binding viral transactivator family, which is brought into a transcription complex by association with cellular DNA-binding factors. So far, a number of transcription factors, including ATF-2 (22Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), CREB (22Maguire H.F.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to interact with the X protein. However, unlike most viral activators, X appears to operate through additional mechanisms. For example, X appears to function as a serine protease inhibitor and regulates the turnover of different cellular transcription factors (27Takada S. Kido H. Fukutomi A. Mori T. Koike K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, increasing evidence suggests that X may use signal transduction pathways to activate transcription. In this regard, both the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway and mitogen-activated kinases have been shown to be involved in X-mediated transactivation (28Cross J.C. Wen P. Rutter W.J. Proc.

Elledge S.J. Butel J.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a cellular inhibitor of X (XAP2) (36Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.-S. Inouye C. Yang W.-M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have now sequenced and characterized an additional clone from our two-hybrid screen for encoded proteins capable of binding X. One protein, term XAP3, appears to have strong homology to a rat PKC-binding protein. PKC is a large family of phospholipid-dependent kinases involved in cell growth, differentiation, and carcinogenesis (37Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.L.W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P.

Protein Kinase C. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 171-198Google Scholar). The mammalian PKC enzyme family consists of at least 10 members that are divided into three groups based on enzymatic properties and common structural features (reviewed in Refs. 42Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar and 43Parker P.J. Kuo J.F. Protein Kinase C. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 3-15Google Scholar). The group A (cPKC) (α, βI, βII, and γ) are calcium-dependent kinases whose activities are stimulated by diacylglycerol (DAG) or phorbol esters. The group B (nPKC) (δ, ε, η, and θ) and group C (aPKC) (ζ and λ) are different from those of group A in their regulatory domains in that a putative Ca2+-binding region is absent. The group C PKCs are different from groups A and B in that they possess a single cysteine-rich Zn2+ finger motif in the conserved C1 region. The group B PKCs are calcium-independent but can be stimulated by DAG, whereas the group C PKCs are neither calcium- nor DAG-dependent. A number of proteins have previously been identified that associate with PKC (44Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Fowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol.

Some of these PKC-binding proteins serve as substrates for PKC, while interaction of the various PKC isozymes with other cellular proteins may confer the unique localization of each of the PKC enzymes. Recently, it was demonstrated that the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transactivator Tax stimulates PKC translocation to the particulate cellular membrane fraction, suggesting that Tax activates PKC in vivo(49Lindholm P.F. Tamami M. Makowski J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2525-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, Tax bound specifically to the α, δ, and η PKC isoenzymes, and the addition of Tax to in vitro kinase reaction mixtures led to the phosphorylation of Tax and an increase in the autophosphorylation of PKC. In this report, we demonstrate that X binds XAP3 in vivo and in vitro. Second, we found that X and XAP3 can both interact with PKCη. Finally, we show that an overexpression of XAP3 enhances X transactivation. These results strongly suggest the involvement of PKC as one of the mechanisms in X transactivation. The following plasmids have been described previously. pGST-X (36Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.-S. Inouye C. Yang W.-M. Seto E.

Plasmids pGEM-XAP3 was constructed by subcloning an XhoI fragment from the X4 clone into the XhoI site of a modified pGEM7Zf plasmid (pGEM7Zf-3X; Ref. 57Yang W.-M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) such that XAP3 mRNA is expressed from a T7 promoter. Different XAP3 mutants were generated by restriction enzyme digestion and religation of the pGEM-XAP3 plasmid. pGEM-TBP1 was constructed by inserting the TAT-binding protein 1 cDNA (58Nelbock P. Dillon P.J. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1990; 248: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) into the pGEM7Zf vector (Promega). Different X deletion mutants in pAS1 vector were constructed by first subcloning the X coding sequence (a BglII fragment from pECE-X) into theBamHI site of pGEM7Zf-3X, then using different restriction enzymes to subdivide the X coding region, and finally subcloning each individual X mutant into the NcoI/BamHI site of pAS1. pGST-XAP3 was constructed by subcloning an XAP3 cDNA fragment from pGEM-XAP3 into pGSTag. pCMV-XAP3 was constructed by cloning anXhoI fragment from clone X4 into the SalI site of pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen). All plasmid constructions were verified by dideoxy sequencing (59Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar). To generate 35S-labeled XAP3, TBP-1, PKCα, PKCη, or PKCδ proteins; pGEM-XAP3, pGEM-TBP1, pSP72PKCα, pSP72PKCη, or pSP72PKCδ were transcribed and translated with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase and [35S]methionine in a transcription/translation coupled system (Promega). Bacterially expressed GST, GST-X, or GST-XAP3 fusion proteins were purified according to Frangioni et al. (60Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210 (2nd Ed.): 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Briefly, DH5α cells harboring either the pGSTag, pGST-X, or pGST-XAP3 plasmids were grown to log phase and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. After sonication in STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmdithiothreitol) containing 1% sarcosyl (w/v, final concentration), solubilized proteins were recovered by centrifugation and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads in the presence of 3% Triton X-100 (final concentration) for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed several times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For binding assays, beads were mixed with in vitrotranslated, 35S-labeled proteins for 1 h at room temperature. Unbounded proteins were washed extensively with STE buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Final products were analyzed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. To determine XAP3 interacting domains within X, library-derived X4 plasmid was transformed into Y153 alone or Y153 containing either pAS-X or pAS-X mutants. Transformants were assayed for the presence of β-galactosidase activity. X4, a positive clone from a two-hybrid screen that showed specific interaction with X but not to other unrelated proteins were subcloned into pGEM7Zf-3X, and nucleotide sequences of the subcloned cDNA were obtained using dideoxy sequencing. To obtain a full-length XAP3 cDNA, a HeLa λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened with a32P-labeled, random-primed 368-base pair probe (XhoI/BglII fragment from clone X4) using standard protocols (61Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Inserts from positive clones were subcloned into pGEM7Zf-3X, and sequences were determined. The final sequence of the XAP3 cDNA was determined from both DNA strands. Homology searches for DNA and deduced amino acid sequences were performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information with the BLAST network service. Filter lift assays were performed essentially as described (62Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformants were allowed to grow at 30 °C for 2–4 days, transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Filters were then placed on Whatman no. 3MM paper presoaked with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside solution, incubated at 30 °C, and checked periodically for production of blue color. For quantitation of β-galactosidase activity in yeast, liquid culture assays were done usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG) as described (63Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Individual transformants were inoculated into the appropriate medium and incubated at 30 °C until the cultures reached mid-log phase (A 600 of 1.0). For each culture, 0.1 ml of culture was mixed with 0.9 ml of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The cells were permeabilized with 0.05 ml of CHCl3 and 0.05 ml of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After addition of 0.2 ml of ONPG solution (4 mg/ml ONPG in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and quenched by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1m Na2CO3. β-Galactosidase activities were determined by measuring absorbances at 420 nm. Standard protocols were followed (64Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For each sample, yeast transformants were grown at 30 °C in 1 ml of selective SC medium containing 2% dextrose to anA 600 of 1–2. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and lysates were prepared according to a standard protocol (61Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in ice-cold 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% SDS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After addition of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma), samples were vortexed and cell extract recovered. One-tenth of each sample was resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with nonfat dried milk, the membrane was treated with 1:1000 diluted Gal4-DNA-binding domain polyclonal antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by 1:7500 diluted alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Subsequently, the blot was developed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Total RNA was purified using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (65Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63228) Google Scholar), separated on a formaldehyde agarose gel, and transferred onto a Hybond membrane (Amersham). Multiple human tissue Northern blot was obtained from CLONTECH. Prehybridization, hybridization, and high stringency washes were performed as described (61Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To control for the relative amount of RNA in each lane, after hybridization with XAP3, the blots were stripped by incubation in 0.5% SDS at 95 °C, and reprobed with the human β-actin cDNA. HepG2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were done using the calcium phosphate method (66Graham F. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), which included a 1-min glycerol shock 4 h after the addition of DNA precipitate. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were harvested and CAT activity was determined (56Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) in 30-min reactions. All transfections were normalized to equal amounts of DNA with pECE or pcDNAI/Amp plasmids. Previously, we have used the yeast two-hybrid screen to detect human cDNAs coding for products that interact with the X protein (36Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.-S. Inouye C. Yang W.-M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Of 5.6 × 106 colonies screened, 12 of the clones were active only when cotransformed with plasmid encoding Gal4DBD fused to X, but not to Rb, SNF1, or several unrelated transcription factors (36Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.-S. Inouye C. Yang W.-M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Preliminary DNA sequence analysis revealed seven novel sequences and five that were highly homologous to known sequences. Of the seven novel sequences, six of them were overlapping clones of cDNA encoding XAP2 (36Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.-S. Inouye C. Yang W.-M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Of the five known sequences, we have now completely sequenced one cDNA insert designated X4 (we will refer to the product encoded by X4 as X-associated protein-3 (XAP3)). To determine whether XAP3 binds X in vitro, we expressed the X protein as a fusion to GST and used it to test for its ability to bind specifically toin vitro 35S-labeled XAP3. As shown in Fig.1, XAP3 binds to GST-X but not GST (lanes 4and 6). An unrelated protein, TBP-1, was used as an additional negative control; and, as expected, TBP-1 did not bind GST-X in this assay (lane 7). Taken together, this suggests that X and XAP3 interact both in vivo and in vitro and the interaction is specific. The X protein sequences required for binding XAP3 were examined to determine whether they coincided with previously defined activation or regulatory domains. A series of carboxyl-terminal X deletion mutants, as well as internal deletion mutants previously generated and subcloned into pAS1 were tested for their abilities to interact with XAP3 in the two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 2 A, deletion of the X protein carboxyl-terminal from amino acids 122–154 had no effect on β-galactosidase activities, as measured by filter lift or liquid assays. However, deletion of amino acids 109–154 eliminated β-galactosidase activities. Further amino-terminal and internal deletions revealed that amino acids 90–122 of X were important for binding XAP3. Western blot analysis indicated that mutants which did not bind XAP3 were expressed efficiently in yeast cells (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the loss of binding property of these mutants is not a reflection of loss in protein expressions. The predicted amino acid sequence of XAP3 was determined by theoretical translation of the cDNA clone open reading frame. Since the predicted open reading frame of the X4 cDNA clone isolated from the two-hybrid screen remains open at the 5′ side (beginning at nucleotide 559, Fig. 3 A), we initially suspected that this clone represented only a partial XAP3 coding sequence. To obtain a full-length XAP3 cDNA, a λgt11 HeLa cDNA library was screened with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to the 5′ end of clone X4. The complete DNA sequence of the newly isolated clone is illustrated in Fig. 3 A. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of XAP3 revealed an open reading frame of 468 amino acids (1.4 kilobases) with an in-frame stop codon upstream of the first methionine at nucleotide 540 (Fig. 3 A). This indicated that the original X4 clone did, in fact, contain a full-length XAP3 coding region. Sequence motif searches indicate that XAP3 contains a C3HC4 zinc finger (amino acids 240–284) and three PKC substrate recognition sites (amino acids 32–34, amino acids 41–43, and amino acids 116–119). As shown in Fig. 3 B, sequence homology searches revealed that XAP3 shares 76% identity and 85% similarity to a rat PKC-binding protein. 2S. Kuroda, C. Tokunaga, Y. Kiyohara, H. Konishi, and U. Kikkawa, unpublished results (NCBI accession numberU48248). In attempt to uncover the functional significance of X and XAP3 interaction, Northern blot analysis was performed to determine the expression pattern of XAP3. We found that a message of approximately 2.5–3.0 kilobases was present in high levels in human brain, placenta, and pancreas; intermediate levels in the heart and skeletal muscle; and low levels in the lung, liver, and kidney (Fig. 4). To localize a domain within XAP3 that binds the X protein, we in vitro synthesized different35S-labeled XAP3 mutants and used them to test for binding to GST-X. As shown in Fig. 5, carboxyl-terminal deletion of amino acids 212–468 or internal deletions of amino acids 97–262 or 123–347 had little or no effect on the binding of XAP3 to the X protein (lanes 3–10, 12, and 13). However, deletion of amino acids 13–74 completely eliminated XAP3's ability to bind X (lane 11). Taken together, these data suggest that the amino-terminal part of the XAP3 protein (amino acids 13–74 in particular) is essential for binding to the X protein. This finding is consistent with the observation that amino acids 13 to 74 is included in the original X4 clone derived from the initial two-hybrid screen. GST binding assays were performed to analyze X protein binding to 35S-labeled PKC isoenzymes translated in vitro with rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Equal quantities of bacterial expressed GST or GST-X fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with PKCα, PKCη, or PKCδ. Interestingly, PKCη but not PKCα or PKCδ bound specifically to GST-X but not to GST (Fig.6, lanes 4–9). To determine which PKC isoenzyme XAP3 binds, similar experiments were performed using GST-XAP3 fusion protein. Intriguingly, like the X protein, XAP3 also"
https://openalex.org/W1966328375,"Sp1 nuclear levels have been shown todirectly correlate with the proliferative state of the cell. We therefore studied changes in the abundance of Sp1 in a rat pituitary cell line GH4 whose growth rate is regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF). Nuclear extracts from GH4cells treated with 10 nm EGF for at least 16 h showed a 50% decrease in Sp1 binding to a GC-rich element present in the gastrin promoter. The decrease in binding correlated with a decrease in cell proliferation, a loss of nuclear Sp1 protein and a 50–60% decrease in Sp1-mediated transactivation through an Sp1 enhancer element in transfection assays. Okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, was synergistic with the effect of EGF on Sp1 protein levels suggesting that the loss of Sp1 was mediated by phosphorylation events. This result was confirmed by showing a 2-fold increase in orthophosphate-labeled Sp1 with EGF and okadaic acid. Cycloheximide prevented the expected loss of Sp1 mediated by EGF and okadaic acid suggesting that the synthesis of a protease may mediate these events. This hypothesis was tested directly by showing that the cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin prevented Sp1 degradation. Using the PEST-FIND computer program, the computed PEST score for human and rat Sp1 is 10.4 and 13.7, respectively, indicating that Sp1 has a domain with a high concentration of proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine residues as reported for a number of proteins with inducible rates of degradation. Collectively, these results indicate that sustained stimulation of GH4 cells by EGF initiates a cascade of phosphorylation events that promotes Sp1 proteolysis, decreased Sp1 nuclear levels and decreased cellular proliferation.

While Sp1 is generally considered to be a constitutively active housekeeping gene, cellular Sp1 levels have been correlated with tumor cell mitotic rates, cellular proliferation, and cell cycle regulators (1Kitadai Y.

Sp1 mRNA levels increase in response to SV40 viral infection in CV-1 cells and in response to phorbol ester induction of T-lymphocytes (3Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Thurston S.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sp1 protein expression in normal tissue varies markedly during development being highest in the thymus, lung, spleen, and variably expressed in the stomach (2Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Post-translational modification of Sp1 by phosphorylation and glycosylation has been correlated with Sp1 transcriptional activation in vitro (4Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar,5Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Thus, Sp1 nuclear levels appear to be closely related to increased cellular proliferation. Transcription factor Sp1 binds to GC-rich elements in the promoters of both cellular and viral genes and stimulates basal promoter activation through TATA-binding protein-associated factors (6Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-789Google Scholar, 7Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Sp1 transactivates genes suggesting that regulating the abundance of cellular Sp1 is one mechanism through which Sp1 regulates transcription. Changes in the abundance of Sp1 may occur by regulating Sp1 gene expression, mRNA stability, or post-translational events that result in altered DNA affinity or protein turnover. However, the relationship of these processes to gene activation has not been well characterized. We have previously studied Sp1 binding to a GC-rich element (GGGGCGGGGTGGGGGG) designated gastrin EGFResponse Element (gERE) 1The abbreviations used are: gERE, gastrin EGF response element; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; gERP, gastrin EGF response protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: gERE, gastrin EGF response element; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; gERP, gastrin EGF response protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. in the gastrin promoter (8Merchant J.L. Demediuk B. Brand S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2686-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This element confers both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and phorbol ester responsiveness and consists of two overlapping domains. The 5′ domain binds Sp1 and the 3′ domain binds two additional complexes provisionally designated as the gastrin EGF responsive proteins 1 and 2 (gERP 1 and gERP 2) (9Merchant J.L. Shiotani A. Mortensen E.R. Shumaker D.K. Abraczinskas D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). EGF induction of the gastrin promoter occurs within the first 12 h and requires both the 5′ and 3′ half-sites. Although EGF induction of the gastrin promoter in GH4 cells appear to require Sp1, there is no significant increase in the binding of this protein with EGF (9Merchant J.L. Shiotani A. Mortensen E.R. Shumaker D.K. Abraczinskas D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Instead after 16 h of EGF treatment, Sp1 binding decreases. EGF treatment of GH4 cells slows cellular proliferation which correlates inversely with cellular differentiation (10Schonbrunn A. Krasnoff M. Westendorf J.M. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 85: 786-797Google Scholar, 11Osborne R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that Sp1 nuclear levels correlate directly with cellular proliferation. To study the effect of EGF on Sp1 in greater detail, changes in Sp1 binding and abundance were studied by EMSAs, immunoblots, and metabolically labeling endogenous Sp1. We found that Sp1 protein levels decreased in response to prolonged treatment with EGF. Since EGF receptor activation results in a cascade of phosphorylation events and Sp1 is known to be a phosphoprotein (4Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 12Fantl W. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), we reasoned that EGF stimulation of Sp1 proteolysis may be related to its phosphorylation state. We therefore examined the effect of combining EGF with a phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid to sustain Sp1 phosphorylation. In addition, since the decrease in cellular Sp1 levels indicated that Sp1 may undergo proteolysis, we investigated whether this process required protein synthesis and was inhibited by protease inhibitors. The results indicate that EGF and okadaic acid increase Sp1 phosphorylation and an increase in Sp1 turnover mediated by a cysteine protease. Cell Culture—GH4 cells (derived from a rat pituitary adenoma) (14Tashjian Jr., A.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Complete medium contained 8% horse serum, 6% newborn calf serum, penicillin at 100 μg/ml, and streptomycin at 100 μg/ml. Where indicated, the cells were stimulated with 10 nm EGF with or without 50 nm okadaic acid in the above medium for 16 h prior to the preparation of nuclear extracts by detergent extraction using a final concentration of 1% Nonidet P-40 (15Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). All buffers contained phosphatase inhibitors, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm sodium phosphate and protease inhibitors, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml chymostatin. Leupeptin, a tripeptide aldehyde with an amino-terminal acetyl group (Ac-Leu-Leu-Arginal), was purchased from Sigma and okadaic acid was purchased from LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA. MG-132 was a gift from Proscript, Cambridge, MA. MG-132 is a tripeptide aldehyde benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-Leu-Leu-Leucinal (16Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar, 17Tsubuki S. Kawasaki H. Saito Y. Miyashita N. Inomata M. Kawashima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Where indicated, leupeptin was used at 2 μm final concentration and MG-132 at 1 μm. Oligonucleotide probes were Klenow end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP after hybridizing complementary strands. All gel shift reactions were carried out in a final volume of 20 μl that contained 2.0 μg of nuclear extract, radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe at a final concentration of (∼30,000 cpm/0.1 ng): 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 300 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 1 mm ZnCl2. After binding for 20 min at 25 °C, DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The sense strands of the double stranded oligonucleotide probes are WT-gERE (GGGGCGGGGTGGGGGG) and a consensus Oct-1 sequence (TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGA). GH4 cells (106 cells) were incubated in 3 ml of phosphate-deficient DMEM with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h prior to the addition of labeling medium. The cells were incubated for 4 h with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (2500–3500 Ci/mmol) in phosphate-deficient medium (labeling medium) that also contained EGF, okadaic acid, or both. The incubations were terminated by removing the labeling medium, rinsing the cells with PBS and preparing nuclear extracts by detergent lysis according to the method of Schreiber (15Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). Twenty-five micrograms of nuclear protein was then used to immunoprecipitate Sp1. Nonspecific protein was precleared using magnetized Dynabeads (Dynal Inc., Oslo, Norway) coated with rabbit IgG. The beads were washed twice in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and the supernatants combined. Sp1 was immunoprecipitated from the combined precleared supernatants at 4 °C for 2 h using Dynabeads precoated with anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation assay was demonstrated by competing with Sp1 peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After collecting the pellet, the beads were washed three times in 0.1% bovine serum albumin dissolved in PBS and the labeled protein eluted by heating the sample to 65 °C for 5 min in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and resolving on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. GH4 cells were cultured to a density of 70% confluency on 75-cm2 flasks (107 cells) in control DMEM with a total of 14% serum and 10 nm EGF, 50 nm okadaic acid, 2 μm leupeptin, or combinations of these agents as indicated for 10 h. After culturing, the media was removed and the cells were rinsed once in DMEM minus methionine and cysteine with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated for 1 h in the deficient medium then replaced with labeling medium. The cells were labeled in 10 ml of cysteine and methionine-deficient DMEM with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum that contained ∼30 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham). After 1 h, the cells were switched to complete medium containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine and 10 nm EGF, 50 nm okadaic acid, 10 nm EGF plus 50 nm okadaic acid, 2 μm leupeptin or leupeptin plus EGF and okadaic acid. After time intervals up to 8 h in the complete medium, the cells were washed three times in PBS alone then lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. The whole cell lysates were immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. Thawed lysates were clarified by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein was determined on the supernatant using the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215535) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed on 200 μg of protein by incubating with 1.5 μg of rabbit anti-Sp1 antibody and 30 μl of protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The labeled antigen-antibody complexes were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, heated to 65 °C for 2 min, then resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The amount of labeled Sp1 protein immunoprecipitated was quantified on a PhosphorImager. Fifty micrograms of GH4cell nuclear extracts were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked for 1 h in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk then probed for 1 h at 25 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Sp1 antibody in the blocking solution. The membrane was rinsed in TTBS then probed for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase in blocking solution. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL assay kit, Amersham). GH4 cells were grown to 50% confluence on 150-mm culture dishes then treated with complete medium containing 10 nm EGF, 50 nm okadaic acid, or both. At the indicated times, total cellular RNA was prepared using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing 5.9% formaldehyde, 18 mmNa2HPO4, and 2 mmNaH2PO4 and electrophoresed in the same buffer. RNA was transferred using a Vacuum-Blotter (Bio-Rad) to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham). The rat Sp1 cDNA subcloned into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) was a kind gift from Guntram Suske (Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology, University of Marburg, Germany). An antisense rat Sp1 riboprobe was created by linearizing the plasmid with BamHI and priming from the Sp6 promoter. Blots were probed with a radiolabeled cyclophillin cDNA probe at 55 °C then reprobed at 65 °C in 50% formamide with a 600-base pair Sp1 riboprobe complementary to the terminal 600 base pairs of rat Sp1 (the zinc finger domain). Cellular proliferation studies were performed on GH4 cells in the presence or absence of 10 nm EGF using the CellTiter 96™ AQ non-radioactive assay (Promega). GH4 cells were plated in quadruplicates at a density of 5000 cells per microtiter well in serum-free DMEM without phenol red in the presence or absence of 10 nm EGF. At the time points indicated, cellular proliferation was measured by adding the tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) and measuring the formation of formazan after 2.5 h at an absorbance of 490 nm. The absorbance minus background was plotted as a function of time. A minimal gastrin promoter construct was created by inserting into the BglII site of a promoterless luciferase vector (pGL2-basic, Promega) a 43-base pair oligonucleotide cassette that contained sequences −28 to +9 of the human gastrin promoter and flanking 5′ BglII and 3′BamHI restriction sites. Other constructs were created by inserting oligonucleotide cassettes corresponding to the wild type gERE (WT: GGGGCGGGGTGGGGGG), a gERE mutant (M6: GGGGCGGGGCGGGGCG), or the human metallothionein IIa Sp1 element (Sp1: CCCGGCCGGGGCGGGG) upstream of the gastrin promoter at a regenerated BglII site as described previously (9Merchant J.L. Shiotani A. Mortensen E.R. Shumaker D.K. Abraczinskas D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All inserts were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) employing β-cyanoethyl phosphoramide chemistry. Plasmids for transfection were prepared by a modified alkaline lysis procedure (Qiagen plasmid kit). Cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA for 15 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 400 μg/ml DEAE-dextran, 50 mm Tris-HCl followed by glycerol shock for 2 min. Luciferase assays were performed on an automated Luminometer Auto Lumat LB953 (Berthold) and normalized to nuclear protein. Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215535) Google Scholar). To assess whether EGF induces changes in Sp1 binding, GH4cells were treated with 10 nm EGF for 2, 4, or 16 h (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of 1 mm ZnCl2, there was an increase in Sp1 and gERP 2 complex binding as described previously (9Merchant J.L. Shiotani A. Mortensen E.R. Shumaker D.K. Abraczinskas D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). No change in Sp1 or gERP binding was observed within 4 h. However, after at least 16 h of EGF treatment, Sp1 binding decreased without a significant change in the gERP 1 and 2 complexes. To assess whether the decrease in Sp1 binding was due to a change in Sp1 binding activity or a change in the level of nuclear Sp1, immunoblot analysis was performed using Sp1 antibody. Nuclear extracts prepared from GH4 cells were treated for 16 h with EGF and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The results shown in Fig. 1 B indicate that there was a decrease in the nuclear levels of Sp1. In addition, no Sp1 was detected by immunoblot analysis of cytosolic extracts after 16 h of EGF treatment indicating that the decrease in Sp1 was not due to retention of Sp1 in the cytoplasm (data not shown). To demonstrate that the lower levels of Sp1 generated by chronic EGF treatment also correlate with a decrease in Sp1 transactivation, several gastrin-reporter constructs were tested in GH4 cells. GH4 cells were pretreated with 10 nm EGF 24 h prior to transfection with gastrin-reporter constructs and compared with cells not pretreated with EGF prior to transfection. Three reporter constructs containing elements ligated upstream of a minimal gastrin promoter were transfected: the WT gERE element, a mutation of the gERE element that only binds Sp1 (M6) and an Sp1 consensus element from the human metallothionein promoter (Sp1). The binding specificity and activity of these constructs has been reported previously (9Merchant J.L. Shiotani A. Mortensen E.R. Shumaker D.K. Abraczinskas D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The results shown in Table I demonstrate that pretreatment with EGF had little effect on the basal activity of the gastrin promoter in the presence of the WT element. However, those elements capable of binding only Sp1 were significantly affected by EGF pretreatment. In particular, both the mutated gERE element (M6) and the Sp1 element which normally confer higher basal activity than the WT element showed a 50–60% decrease in basal promoter activity. Since these elements have a higher affinity for Sp1 compared with the gERP complexes (9Merchant J.L. Shiotani A. Mortensen E.R. Shumaker D.K. Abraczinskas D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the observed decrease in basal activation was consistent with a decrease in the abundance of Sp1.Table ILuciferase specific activity of gastrin reporter constructs before and after pretreatment with EGFEGF pretreatmentWTALucM6ALucSp1ALuc−+−+−+Experiment 11,9141,49513,5404,11411,3925,536Experiment 21,7842,037ND1-aND, not determined.ND9,9651,4531-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Tashjian and co-workers (10Schonbrunn A. Krasnoff M. Westendorf J.M. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 85: 786-797Google Scholar) showed previously that EGF inhibits GH4proliferation and DNA content within 72 h. Thus the decrease in Sp1 binding and abundance parallels a decrease in cellular proliferation. To confirm that EGF has a negative effect on GH4 proliferation, the proliferative rate of GH4 cells over 72 h was studied. Five thousand cells were plated per microtiter well with or without 10 nm EGF. Cellular proliferation was quantified at the times indicated and clearly showed that EGF negatively affected cellular proliferation (Fig. 2). To determine whether the effect of EGF was related to the level of cellular phosphorylation, immunoblot analysis was performed on nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid or with both EGF and okadaic acid. The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that treatment of the cells with okadaic acid alone resulted in a similar or greater decrease in Sp1 nuclear levels compared with EGF alone. Treatment of the cells with both EGF and okadaic acid had a synergistic effect, further depressing nuclear levels of Sp1. These results are consistent with studies showing that okadaic acid treatment of GH4 cells inhibits proliferation in response to decreased phosphatase activity (19Van Dolah F.M. Ramsdell J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since okadaic acid alone and in concert enhanced the effect of EGF on the abundance of Sp1, these results suggested that the decrease in Sp1 is related to its phosphorylation state. Since okadaic acid alone stimulated an increase in Sp1 degradation and okadaic acid and EGF had a synergistic effect on the decrease in Sp1 abundance, we investigated whether these treatments affected Sp1 phosphorylation. GH4 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, then stimulated with EGF or okadaic acid alone or EGF and okadaic acid together. After 4 h of stimulation, the cells were lysed, nuclear extracts were prepared and Sp1 was precipitated with Sp1 antibody. The results shown in Fig.4 indicate that all three treatments increase the phosphorylation state of endogenous Sp1. EGF, okadaic acid, and okadaic acid plus EGF resulted in 1.3-, 2.7-, and 2.2-fold increase in phosphorylation over control levels, respectively. Thus, okadaic acid and EGF plus okadaic acid had the greatest effect on phosphorylation levels due to the inhibition of endogenous phosphatases 2A and 1 (20Schönthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this result was consistent with prior reports that okadaic acid prevents Sp1 dephosphorylation (21Jackson S. Gottlieb T. Hartley K. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 28: 279-286PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the decrease in Sp1 protein was related to a decrease in Sp1 gene expression, Northern blot analysis was performed. The results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that treatment of cells with EGF and okadaic acid, which significantly decrease Sp1 protein levels, did not decrease Sp1 gene expression. Instead, okadaic acid alone and the combination of EGF and okadaic acid treatment stimulated Sp1 gene expression possibly due to a feedback regulatory loop that mediates activation of the Sp1 gene as a result of a significant decrease in Sp1 protein in the cell. The effect of EGF and okadaic acid on Sp1 levels was reversible upon removal of these agents from the culture medium (Fig.6). In complete medium, Sp1 binding activity increased with time (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the addition of EGF and okadaic acid for 16 h resulted in a >60% decrease in Sp1 binding activity that was detectable by 24 h. There were minimal changes in binding of the gERP factor complex and the ubiquitous transcription factor Oct-1 (Fig. 6 B). The decreased ratio of Sp1 to Oct-1 binding was lowest at 24 h and returned to control levels after the removal of EGF and okadaic acid (Fig. 6 C). To assess whether the decrease in Sp1 protein levels required protein synthesis, GH4 cells were incubated with cycloheximide for 1 h prior to treatment with EGF and okadaic acid. Cycloheximide showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the expected decrease in cellular Sp1 levels (Fig. 7 A). In addition to an inhibition of Sp1 degradation, cycloheximide treatment also decreased the appearance of several lower molecular weight species detected by Sp1 antibody (Fig. 7 B). These presumably were proteolytic fragments of Sp1 since their appearance increased with EGF (see also Fig. 1 B) or EGF and okadaic acid treatment and decreased with the inhibition of protein synthesis. The dependence of Sp1 degradation upon protein synthesis suggested that Sp1 turnover may be related to increased protease activity. Therefore, to determine whether the decrease in Sp1 levels was reversed by specific protease inhibitors, GH4 cells were pretreated with two membrane-permeable protease inhibitors MG-132 and leupeptin. MG-132 is a proteosome-restricted protease inhibitor; whereas leupeptin is a cysteine protease that inhibits lysosomal and calcium-activated proteases. In addition, it has been shown that leupeptin inhibits a nuclear differentiation-associated cysteine protease that is unrelated to calpains (22Scholtz B. Lamb K. Rosfjord E. Kingsley M. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows that MG-132 at 1 μm did not prevent the expected decrease in Sp1. This concentration was 10–40-fold lower than concentrations used to inhibit NFκB processing by the proteosome (16Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin at 2 μm was an effective inhibitor of Sp1 degradation, suggesting that the protease system targeting Sp1 turnover may not be related to the proteasome. Both the binding assays and immunoblots showed that EGF and okadaic acid decrease the abundance of Sp1 in the cell. Moreover, EGF and okadaic acid together stimulate an increase in Sp1 phosphorylation. To correlate these findings with an increase in the rate of Sp1 degradation, the fate of metabolically labeled Sp1 was followed over time during each treatment. GH4 cells were pretreated with EGF, okadaic acid, leupeptin, or various combinations for 10 h then labeled with [35S]methionine in methionine-deficient medium. The label was chased for intervals up to 8 h in the presence of the agonists and 2 mm unlabeled methionine in DMEM. The half-life of Sp1 was 6 h under control conditions. The results shown in Fig. 9 Areveal that EGF and okadaic acid alone or in combination increased the loss of radiolabeled Sp1. However, the most significant loss was observed with okadaic acid. The maximum effect of each treatment on Sp1 degradation rates was detected 6 h after exposure to the pulse of label and indicated that a minimum of 16 h with EGF and okadaic acid was necessary to observe changes (Fig. 9 B).

Basal enzyme activity was only increased in AC II transfectants (6-fold). Maximum stimulation of enzyme activity was increased in each of the AC transfectants to varying extents. α2A/D-AR activation elicited enzyme type-specific responses. α2-AR activation inhibited the effect of isoproterenol in control transfectants, and this action was magnified in AC III transfectants. In AC II and AC IV transfectants, α2-AR activation initiated both positive (Gβγ) and negative signals (Giα) to the Gsα-stimulated enzyme, and both types of signals were blocked by cell pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The negative input to AC II from the α2-AR was blocked by protein kinase C activation in AC II transfectants, but it was the positive input to AC IV that was compromised by protein kinase C activation.

Nature has evolved several clever mechanisms for cells to process external stimuli. Such systems incorporate a receptor at the cell surface that is activated by the stimulus and initiates signal propagation to the cell interior, recruiting several additional proteins in the process. Many of the groups of proteins involved in signal propagation exist as isoforms or closely related subtypes, as is the case for signals initiated by G-protein-coupled membrane receptors. These receptors are coupled to a variety of effectors including adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, and protein kinases. Each of these effectors exists as isoforms with different regulatory properties allowing complex signal integration, and this capability presents opportunities for the cell to engineer highly specific responses to an external stimulus. Such appears to be the case for signals involving the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. There are nine types of adenylyl cyclase (AC) 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pairs. 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pairs. that differ in their regulatory mechanisms and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (1Sunahara R.K.

AC I, III, and VIII are positively regulated by calcium/calmodulin, whereas types V and VI are directly inhibited by calcium. AC II and IV are stimulated by Gβγ in the presence of activated Gsα. The activities of types I–III and V–VII are also influenced by phosphorylation with protein kinase C and/or A (2Jacobowitz O. Chen J. Premont R.T. Iyengar R. J. Biol.

The ability of various AC types to respond to activated Gsα and Giα, Gβγ, calcium, and/or phosphorylation places the enzyme at a central point for cross-talk between different signaling systems. The Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated enzymes (types I, III, and VIII) are suggested to serve as coincidence detectors for signal processing in the hippocampus (types I and VIII) and in vascular smooth muscle cells (type III) (10Xia Z.G.

Similarly, the multiple regulatory inputs to the type II and IV enzymes would also allow the cell to process signals from diverse receptor systems. Many regulatory properties of the enzymes were determined following purification of the enzyme expressed in Sf9 insect cells, and it is not clear how the regulatory properties observed with the purified enzyme are integrated in the intact cell to produce a defined response to external stimuli. As an initial approach to this issue, we examined the integration of multiple signals to AC (Gsα, Giα, Gβγ, and phosphorylation) following stable expression of enzyme types II, III, and IV in DDT1-MF2 cells derived from hamster vas deferens smooth muscle. [3H]cAMP (33.5 Ci/mmol) and [32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Tissue culture supplies were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). Hygromycin B, isoproterenol, and forskolin were from Sigma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and UK14304 were provided by Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). GTPγS was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Dowex 50W-X4 (100–200 mesh, hydrogen form) was from Bio-Rad, and aluminiumoxid (90 active neutral) was purchased from EM Science (Cherry Hill, NJ). The cDNAs encoding for AC types II and III were kindly provided by Dr. Randall Reed (Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD), and the AC IV cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Alfred Gilman (Department of Pharmacology, Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, TX).

Cells were grown as monolayers on Falcon Primeria dishes at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (4.5 g/liter), supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (NIH-3T3), 2.5% horse serum plus 2.5% bovine calf serum (DDT1-MF2) or 5% horse serum plus 10% fetal bovine serum (PC-12), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 18 h (37 °C) prior to membrane preparation or initiation of experiments in intact cells. DDT1-MF2 cells were stably transfected with the α2A/D-AR (RG-20) as described previously (16Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and clones expressing receptors at a density of ∼3–4 pmol/mg of membrane protein were then used for manipulation of the population of adenylyl cyclases in the cell. The coding sequences of rat AC isoforms II and IV were inserted into the pMSV expression vector (17Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the gene coding for the rat AC type III was subcloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) expression plasmid. AC II (nucleotides 1–4008, coding sequence 70–3342) in pBS.KS was digested with EcoRI and blunt-ended, and HindIII linkers were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the purified AC II insert. The modified insert was then cloned into the HindIII site of the pMSV expression vector downstream of the viral long terminal repeat promoter. AC III (nucleotides 1–4533, coding sequence 367–3801) in pBS.KS was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into theEcoRI site in pcDNA3 downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter element. AC IV (nucleotides 1–3358, coding sequence 110–3304) in pBS.SK was digested with XhoI/BamHI and cloned into the pMSV vector at the HindIII site by blunt end ligation. DDT1-MF2 cells expressing the α2A/D-AR were cotransfected with the AC II, AC III, or AC IV cDNA expression vector (16 μg) and the drug resistance cassette pHyg (4 μg) by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (17Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected by their resistance to hygromycin B (750 μg/ml), and hygromycin B-resistant clones were screened for expression of the AC isoforms by RNA blot analysis and functional evaluation of enzyme activity. Subsequent to isolation of AC transfectants, we performed a series of preliminary experiments to characterize the enzyme activity in different clonal cell lines. These studies used three AC II, two AC III, and two AC IV clonal cell lines. The results of these experiments indicated that the cell lines for a particular AC transfectant behaved similarly relative to the interaction between the various signaling interventions, and one cell line was then used for detailed experimental analysis. Polyadenylated RNA from control and AC transfectants was isolated using an oligo(dT) cellulose matrix (FastTrack mRNA Isolation Kit, Invitrogen). Five to ten μg of mRNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose, 3% formaldehyde gels followed by transfer to nylon membranes. The membrane was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 2 h, processed, and hybridized with radiolabeled probes as described previously (15Hamamdzic D. Duzic E. Sherlock J.D. Lanier S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E162-E171PubMed Google Scholar, 16Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E.

The population of AC expressed by DDT1-MF2, NIH-3T3, and PC12 cells was also determined by DNA amplification following reverse transcription of cellular mRNA. For amplification of AC mRNA, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of mRNA using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamer (50-ng) primers. The reaction mixture was incubated with RNase H and used for DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. To allow detection of multiple types of AC transcripts, the amplification utilized degenerate oligonucleotide primers (5 μmol/liter) as described by Yoshimura and Cooper (19Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The primers corresponded to amino acid sequences in the C2a domain of AC that are highly conserved in the different enzyme isoforms (sense primer: KIKTIGS-5′-CAGAAGCTTAA(A/G)AT(T/C/A)AA(A/G)AC(T/C/ A/G)AT(T/C/A)GG(T/C/A/G)(T/A)(C/G)(T/C/A/G)AC(T/C/A/G)TA(T/C)ATGGC-3′ antisense primer: YDIWGNTVNV-3′-GAGGATCCAC(A/G)TT(T/C/A/G)AC(T/C/A/G)GT(A/G)TT(T/C/A/G)CCCCA(T/A/G)AT(A/G)TC(A/G)TA-5′). Each primer contained a unique restriction site at its 5′-end to facilitate subcloning. The reaction mixture was treated with proteinase K, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and digested with BamHI andHindIII. The restricted amplified DNA of appropriate size was purified on a 2% agarose gel, subcloned into pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega), and characterized by DNA sequencing with dideoxy chain terminators and modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Intact cell assays utilized confluent cells in six-well Falcon Primeria plates. One hour before the assay, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 2 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle‘s medium containing 20 mmNaHEPES-HCl, pH 7.5. Cells were preincubated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (350 μm) isobutyl-l-methylxanthine at 37 °C for 30 min before the addition of forskolin, isoproterenol, and/or UK14304. Reactions were terminated following a 10-min incubation by aspiration of medium and the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1n HCl/well. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 100 nm PMA in the presence of isobutyl-l-methylxanthine for 10 min at 37 °C before adding isoproterenol and/or UK14304. cAMP was acetylated and assayed by radioimmunoassay as described by Brooker et al. (20Brooker G. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at confluence (∼2 × 107 cells/dish) were washed twice with cell washing solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4), harvested with a rubber policeman, and pelleted at 4 °C at 200 × g in a Sorvall RT6000 centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (5 ml/dish) at 4 °C (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A), and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g (Sorvall RC5B, SS34 rotor) for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in membrane buffer (50 mm NaHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin A), and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured as described previously (16Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay buffer contained 50 mm NaHEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.24 mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.2 mm cAMP, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmisobutyl-l-methylxanthine, [α-32P]ATP (3 × 106 cpm/tube), and an ATP-regenerating system (60 mm creatinine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatinine kinase) in a final volume of 100 μl. Cyclic AMP was isolated by sequential chromatography on columns containing Dowex AG-50W-X4 resin and alumina. The 4-ml eluate from each column was equilibrated with 10 ml of Ecoscint A, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with PMA (100 nm, 10 min), and membranes were prepared as above, using lysis and assay buffer containing the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (1 μm), sodium orthovanadate (100 μm), and β-glycerophosphate (100 mm). In experiments with the α-subunit of transducin, membranes were preincubated with transducin (200 nm) for 5 min prior to initiation of the assay. We previously reported the coupling of rat α2-AR subtypes to adenylyl cyclase following stable expression of the receptor in three cell types: DDT1-MF2, NIH3T3, and PC-12 (16Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

These model systems were further characterized in terms of the type of adenylyl cyclase transcripts expressed by each cell line. Poly(A)-RNA from each cell line was evaluated by RNA blot analysis using probes for enzyme types I–IX and also by RT-PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to regions of conserved amino acid sequence in the nine enzyme types. RNA blot analysis indicated differential expression of enzyme types by the three cell lines (DDT1-MF2, types VI, VII, VIII, and IX; NIH-3T3, type VI; 4A. Marjamaki and S. M. Lanier, a hybridizing species of lower size (∼1.5–2 kb) than expected based on the size of AC type mRNA was observed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts when the RNA blot was hybridized to probes for AC I and AC VII. The identity of this hybridizing species is not known, but cDNAs encoding a truncated adenylyl cyclase were previously reported (38Katsushika S. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2273-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). and PC-12, types III, VI, VII, and IX) (Fig. 1). Brain RNA was used as a positive control for hybridization, since this tissue expressed each enzyme type. None of the cell lines expressed AC types I, II, IV, or V, whereas each cell line expressed the type VI enzyme. A similar profile of enzyme types was also observed by cDNA amplification following reverse transcriptase of mRNA (RT-PCR) from DDT1-MF2 and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (Table I, Fig. 1). RT-PCR using PC-12 mRNA failed to identify the AC VII and AC IX transcript visualized by RNA blot analysis (Table I, Fig.1). 5M. Sato and S. M. Lanier, AC III, VI, VII, and IX were identified by RNA blot analysis of PC-12 mRNA, whereas only AC III and VI were identified by RT-PCR.

Open table in a new tab DDT1-MF2 cells were selected to evaluate signal integration by AC before and after altering the population of enzymes expressed in the cell. AC types II, III, and IV were introduced into the cell by gene transfection. Stimulation of AC by Gsα was achieved by activation of the β-AR expressed in DDT1-MF2 cells (23Port J.D. Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8468-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate the inhibitory input to the enzyme, we stably expressed the AC cDNA in subclones previously transfected with the α2A/D-AR (16Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of Gs- and Gi-protein coupled systems on AC function for each enzyme type was determined before and after activation of protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. AC types II, III, and IV were stably expressed in DDT1-MF2 cells as indicated by analysis of transfectant RNA and functional properties of the transfected cells (Fig. 2). RNA blot analysis indicated that mRNA of expected size was detected in the AC transfectants but not in control cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 2 A). Basal and maximally stimulated enzyme activity in the DDT1-MF2 AC transfectants was compared with that of control vector-transfected cells. Relative to control cells, basal enzyme activity was not altered in AC III or AC IV transfectants, but it was increased 6-fold in AC II transfectants (Fig. 2 B). Enzyme activity determined in the presence of forskolin, Mn2+, and GTPγS was increased ∼2-fold in AC III and AC IV transfectants and ∼6-fold in AC II transfectants relative to the stimulation observed in control transfectants (Fig. 2 B). These data indicated that each of the transfected genes was expressed in the DDT1-MF2 cell lines. The AC transfectants were further characterized for their responses to the diterpene forskolin and the β-AR agonist isoproterenol. Basal enzyme activity in the intact cell was similar in control, AC III, and AC IV transfectants but was slightly increased in AC II transfectants (Table II). In the intact cell, the effect of forskolin on cellular cAMP levels was not altered in AC IV transfectants but was increased in AC II (1.5-fold) and AC III (1.8-fold) transfectants relative to its actions in control transfectants (Fig. 3 A). The EC50of forskolin in the AC transfectants was similar to the control value. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase via Gsα in DDT1-MF2 transfectants was achieved with the β-AR agonist isoproterenol. The maximal effect of isoproterenol in the intact cell was only increased in AC II transfectants (229 ± 0.3versus 168 ± 0.6 ng of cAMP/mg of protein) (Fig.3 B). The EC50 of isoproterenol for enzyme stimulation in control, AC II, AC III, and AC IV transfectants was 99 ± 6, 146 ± 1, 24 ± 1, and 90 ± 2 nm, respectively.Table IIEffect of protein kinase C activation on cellular cAMP in DDT 1 -MF2 cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding AC II, AC III, or AC IVDDT1-MF2 transfectantBasal2-aData (ng of cAMP/mg of protein) are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations from three experiments.

Open table in a new tab The Gsα-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in the AC transfectants was also investigated after the activation of protein kinase C. Protein kinase C activation by PMA did not alter basal cellular cAMP levels in control transfectants and produced small but consistent increases in cAMP in each AC transfectant (Table II). In membrane preparations, only the AC II transfectant exhibited an elevation in basal enzyme activity (relative to control values) following PMA treatment of the cells (Table III). Protein kinase C activation also enhanced the increase in cellular cAMP elicited by the β-AR agonist isoproterenol in each of the AC transfectants (Table II). Similar results were observed in enzyme activity assays using membrane preparations (Table III). These data indicate that the receptor has access to the transfected enzymes and that the sensitivity of the enzymes to Gsα is increased following enzyme phosphorylation by protein kinase C. To gain insight as to how the different enzyme types process multiple stimulatory and inhibitory inputs, we determined the interaction between the Gs-coupled β-AR and the Gi/Go-coupled α2A/D-AR in the regulation of AC activity.Table IIIEffect of protein kinase C activation on adenylyl cyclase in membranes prepared from DDT 1 -MF2 cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding AC II, AC III, or AC IVDDT1-MF2 transfectantBasal3-aData (pmol of cAMP/min/mg of protein) are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations from three experiments.

Open table in a new tab Receptors coupled to Gi- or Go-proteins are capable of sending both positive and negative signals to adenylyl cyclases, as is the case with the α2A/D-AR. Negative input is relayed through Giα or perhaps Goα and is commonly observed following activation of the α2A/D-AR. Positive input to adenylyl cyclases following α2A/D-AR activation is cell type-specific and may be achieved by 1) increased intracellular calcium concentration and subsequent stimulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (16Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2) receptor coupling to Gsα (24Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol.

The results of experiments in the AC transfectants indicated that the effects of α2A/D-AR receptor activation on cellular cAMP levels were dependent upon the enzyme type expressed in the cell. Basal enzyme activity in control and AC III was either not altered (intact cell) or inhibited (membranes) by the selective α2-AR agonist UK14304 (TableIV). In AC II and AC IV transfectants, AC activity was either not altered (AC IV) or increased (AC II) by α2A/D-AR activation (Table IV). α2A/D-AR activation inhibited forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity in control and each of the AC transfectants (Fig. 4 A). The effects of α2A/D-AR activation on basal and forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity in control and each AC transfectant were blocked by prior treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin 6A.

https://openalex.org/W1979282739,"Since a basic surface on the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is important for binding to the regulatory (R) subunit, acidic residues in R were sought that might contribute to R-C interaction. Using differential labeling by a water-soluble carbodiimide (Buechler, T. A., and Taylor, S. S. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 1937–1943), seven specific carboxylates in RIα were identified that were protected from chemical modification in the holoenzyme; each was then replaced with Ala. Of these, rRI(E15A/E106A/D107A)), rRI(E105A), rRI(D140A), rRI(E143A), and rRI(D258A) all were defective in holoenzyme formation and define negative electrostatic surfaces on RIα. An additional conserved carboxylate, Glu101 in RIα and the equivalent, Glu99 in RIIα were mutated to Ala. Replacement of Glu101 had no effect while rRII(E99A) was very defective. RIα and RIIα thus differ in the molecular details of how they recognize C. Unlike wild-type RI, two additional mutants, rRI(D170A) and rRI(K242A), inhibited C-subunit stoichiometrically in the presence of cAMP and show increases in both on- and off-rates. Asp170, which contributes directly to the hydrogen bonding network in cAMP-binding site A, thus contributes also to holoenzyme stability. Since a basic surface on the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is important for binding to the regulatory (R) subunit, acidic residues in R were sought that might contribute to R-C interaction. Using differential labeling by a water-soluble carbodiimide (Buechler, T. A., and Taylor, S. S. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 1937–1943), seven specific carboxylates in RIα were identified that were protected from chemical modification in the holoenzyme; each was then replaced with Ala. Of these, rRI(E15A/E106A/D107A)), rRI(E105A), rRI(D140A), rRI(E143A), and rRI(D258A) all were defective in holoenzyme formation and define negative electrostatic surfaces on RIα. An additional conserved carboxylate, Glu101 in RIα and the equivalent, Glu99 in RIIα were mutated to Ala. Replacement of Glu101 had no effect while rRII(E99A) was very defective. RIα and RIIα thus differ in the molecular details of how they recognize C. Unlike wild-type RI, two additional mutants, rRI(D170A) and rRI(K242A), inhibited C-subunit stoichiometrically in the presence of cAMP and show increases in both on- and off-rates. Asp170, which contributes directly to the hydrogen bonding network in cAMP-binding site A, thus contributes also to holoenzyme stability.

The two classes of cAPK, type I and type II, differ primarily in their regulatory subunits (1Hofmann F. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7795-7801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two known families of physiological inhibitors of cAPK, the regulatory subunits (RI and RII) and the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) employ a common mechanism for the inhibition of C. Each inhibitor has an autoinhibitory domain that resembles the substrate consensus sequence, “RRXS/TΨ,” where X is any amino acid, and the P+1 site is a hydrophobic group (Ψ). In RII the P-site is a Ser, while in RI and PKI, this site is an Ala (2Scott J.D. Fischer E.H. Takio K. Demaille J.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The R-subunits, as well as PKI, bind to C with K d values that lie in the subnanomolar range (5Hofmann F. J. Biol.

Furthermore, mutant forms of RI and RII with Ala substitutions at the P-2 and P-3 arginines can still form stable holoenzyme complexes in the absence of cAMP (10Buechler Y.J. Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S.

These sites are referred to here as peripheral sites.As shown in Fig. 1, the R-subunit has a well defined domain structure consisting of an N-terminal dimerization domain, followed by the autoinhibitory region and two tandem cAMP-binding domains, A and B. Proteolytic cleavage of the RII-subunit at a site just prior to the P-3 Arg yielded a monomeric R-subunit fragment that still bound C with high affinity (12Weldon S.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4203-4209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that the sites of interaction that contribute to high affinity binding lie C-terminal to the autoinhibitor consensus sequence. This is in striking contrast to PKI, whose high-affinity binding determinants lie mostly N-terminal to the consensus site (7Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. CRC Reviews. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar, 9Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion mutations that removed the N terminus (Δ1–91) or the B-domain (Δ260–379) or combined mutations that removed both the N terminus and the B-domain, also did not prevent high affinity binding to C (13Saraswat L.D.

The high affinity binding sites are thus localized between the consensus site and the end of the A-domain (Fig. 1).Figure 1Location of mutation sites on the type I regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

The peripheral PKI site, referred to here as peripheral recognition site 1 (PRS1), was originally mapped with peptide analogs (9Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol.

An additional surface on the C-subunit, referred to here as peripheral recognition site 2 (PRS2), was predicted based on genetic mapping, to be important for R-subunit binding (18Gibbs C.S.

In contrast to the acidic surface on C where the consensus site peptide and PKI bind, the PRS2 surface importance for binding to R is very basic. This led us to search for acidic residues in R that might complement C. The deletion analysis described above limited the search for acidic residues to the region between the inhibition site and the beginning of domain B.To chemically identify potential sites on the RI-subunit involved in R-C interaction, type I holoenzyme was treated with the water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethyl-amino-propyl)-carbodiimide·HCl (EDC), and [14C]glycine ethyl ester in the absence and presence of cAMP (22Buechler J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Five carboxyl groups in C were identified, Glu170, Asp328, Asp329, Glu332, and Glu333, that were protected in the holoenzyme complex. The amino acids that were labeled in the free RI-subunit were: Glu77, Glu105, Glu106, Asp107, Asp140, Glu143, Glu255, Asp258, and Glu275. The reactivity of seven of these residues (Glu105, Glu106, Asp107, Asp140, Glu143, Glu255, and Asp258) was significantly reduced in the holoenzyme complex. 2J. A. Buechler, unpublished results. 2J. A. Buechler, unpublished results. To clarify the potential importance of these residues for R-C interaction, each was replaced with Ala. The mutant R-subunits were then purified and tested for their ability to inhibit C.Several additional sites were tested. The highly conserved glutamic acid residue 150 (Glu101 in RI), when mutated to Ala in BCY1, the yeast regulatory subunit, led to defective recognition of C (TPK1). 3C. Gibbs, personal communication. 3C. Gibbs, personal communication. This site was therefore mutated to Ala in RI and RII to establish whether this residue was also important for R-C interaction in the mammalian holoenzymes.Two additional charge-to-Ala mutations, D170A and K242A, were made in the RI subunit based on their location in the crystal structure of (Δ1–91)RI (16Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-h. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Asp170, a highly conserved residue, lies on β-strand 3 of the A-domain where it forms a hydrogen bond with Arg209, a key residue in the cAMP-binding site (16Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9668-9673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall charge of the A-domain is acidic, however, there is a basic patch on the C-helix associated with Lys242. Lys242 was therefore targeted as a potential electrostatic interaction site in the holoenzyme complex.RESULTSTo characterize the importance of various charged residues in the R-subunit for recognition of C and formation of holoenzyme, the following charge to Ala mutations were engineered: E101A, E105A/E106A/D107A, E105A, E106A, D107A, D140A, E143A, E255A, D258A, D170A, K242A in RI and E99A in RII (Table I). Each mutant RI-subunit was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteins were typically at least 80% pure following DE52 anion exchange chromatography and eluted as a sharp peak from the Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Typical yields were 40–50 mg of RI-subunit per 4 liters of cells. All of the purified RI-subunits were greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE.Table IR-subunit mutationsR-subunitMutationReason for mutationRIE105A/E106A/D107ASites protected from chemical modification in type I holoenzymeE105AE106AD107AD140AE143AE255AD258ARIE101AConserved residue.

H6RII(E99A) was greater than 95% pure following FPLC Mono Q chromatography; however, degradation occurred upon long-term storage (>6 months) at −20 °C.Importance of the Acidic Patch Glu105-Glu106-Asp107An acidic patch just after the autoinhibitor site and conserved in all R-subunits was protected against modification by EDC when the RI subunit was associated with C.2 To test whether specific contacts involving Glu105-Glu106-Asp107 were important for interactions between the R- and C-subunits, each carboxylate was replaced with Ala, generating the following mutants: rRI(E105A), rRI(E106A), and rRI(D107A). In addition, the triple mutant, rRI(E105A/E106A/D107A), was made.The purified RI-subunits were combined with purified recombinant murine C-subunit, rC(WT), in a multiwelled microdialysis chamber and the relative rates of holoenzyme formation of the mutant RI-subunits were compared with that of wild-type RI as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dialysis curves in Fig. 2 indicated that the triple mutant, rRI(EED/AAA), formed 40% holoenzyme after 10 h of dialysis at room temperature, while, after the same length of time, 90% of the wild-type control had formed holoenzyme. The single mutant, rRI(E105A), exhibited a slight defect in holoenzyme formation while the other two single-site mutations, rRI(E106A) and rRI(D107A), were indistinguishable from the wild-type control.Holoenzyme Formation of rRI(D140A), rRI(E143A), rRI(E255A), and rRI(D258A) with Wild-type CIn addition to the acidic patch Glu105-Glu106-Asp107, four other acidic residues in the RI-subunit were protected from chemical modification in the presence of C.2 These sites included two residues at the beginning of the A-domain (Asp140 and Glu143) and two at the end of the A-domain (Glu255 and Asp258). To test whether any of these sites were involved in a direct interaction with C, each was mutated to Ala, and the purified mutant proteins were paired with wild-type C in the holoenzyme dialysis assay. As shown in Fig.3 (A and B), three of the mutants, rRI(D140A), rRI(E143A), and rRI(D258A), showed similar defects in their rates of holoenzyme formation. After 10 h of dialysis at room temperature, these mutant RI-subunits inhibited only 60% of the C-subunit activity, while the wild-type control was more than 90% inhibited, indicating that Asp140, Glu143, and Asp258 contribute to holoenzyme formation. Mutation of Glu255 to Ala had no affect on holoenzyme formation.Figure 3Holoenzyme formation of mutant RI-subunits with the catalytic subunit of cAPK.

Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Role of Glu101 in Holoenzyme FormationAlthough Glu101 was not modified by EDC in either the cAMP-bound form of RI or in the type I holoenzyme, it is highly conserved in all regulatory subunits. Furthermore, mutation of this site to Ala in BCY1, the yeast regulatory subunit, abolished the ability of BCY1 to inhibit the yeast C-subunit, TPK1.3 As shown in Fig. 3 C, however, mutation of this site to Ala in the RI-subunit had no affect on the rate of holoenzyme formation compared with RI-WT.Since BCY1 is a type II R-subunit, the equivalent mutation was also made in the mammalian RII-subunit, RII(E99A), to determine if this site was important for R-C interaction in the type II holoenzyme. Activity assays of the holoenzyme mixtures following 17 h of dialysis indicated that, unlike the wild-type control, which was 95% inhibited, H6RII(E99A) only showed 20% inhibition (Fig.3 D). Following dialysis, SDS-PAGE of the holoenzyme mixtures verified that the lack of holoenzyme formation observed for H6RII(E99A) was not due to proteolysis of the RII-subunit. The fact that Glu101 is important for holoenzyme formation with RII and BCY1 but not for RI, even though this residue is conserved, indicates that the interaction sites between R and C in the type I and type II holoenzymes that lie beyond the autoinhibitor region differ in their molecular details.The Effect of Mutating Asp170 in the A-Domain of RIAsp170 is another acidic residue that is conserved among the regulatory subunits of the cAPK family (34Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M.J. Scott J.D. McMullen B. Hurwitz M. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It lies in cAMP-binding domain A where it forms a hydrogen bond with Arg209, a residue that is absolutely conserved among the cAMP-binding domains of the regulatory subunits and the catabolite gene activator protein (16Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-h. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23Bubis J. Neitzel J.J. Saraswat L.D. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9668-9673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Asp170 lies on the surface of the A-domain, it also reaches through the domain to make contact with Arg209 in the cAMP-binding site. This hydrogen bonding between Asp170 and Arg209 which potentially helps to neutralize the charge on Asp170, would have prevented the identification of Asp-170 in the holoenzyme protection study that identified Glu105-Glu106-Asp107, Asp140, Glu143, Glu255, and Asp258 as potential R-C interaction sites by chemical modification. Asp170 was mutated to Ala to test whether it played a role in holoenzyme formation or cAMP binding.The wild-type RIα-subunit binds cAMP very tightly, so that the purified R-subunit is always fully saturated with cAMP. Thus, under the conditions used for holoenzyme formation where C, R, and cAMP are present at relative concentrations of 1:1:2, wild-type RI does not linearly titrate the activity of the C-subunit. Linear and stoichiometric titration is achieved only when cAMP is stripped from R prior to reassociation with C. Otherwise, dialysis is required to remove the cAMP. In contrast to wild-type RI, when rRI(D170A) was added to the C-subunit, inactivation was immediate; rRI(D170A) behaved similarly to R-subunit that had been stripped of cAMP with urea.rRI(D170A) was then tested for its ability to titrate the catalytic activity directly in the spectrophotometric assay. The inhibition assay measured the following reaction, R2(cAMP) 4+2C↔R2C2+4cAMPEquation 2 where loss of activity correlates with the formation of the R2C2 complex. As shown in Fig.4, when rRI(D170A) was added directly to the assay mixture where the C-subunit concentration was 20 nm, inhibition of catalytic activity was linear and stoichiometric. This was in striking contrast to the inhibition of C with wild-type RI which must be stripped of cAMP before stoichiometric inhibition can be achieved under these conditions. The linear and stoichiometric inhibition of C with rRI(D170A) indicated not only that theK d for this mutant R and rC(WT) was well below 20 nm, but also, under these conditions, rRI(D170A) had a higher affinity for C than for cAMP, causing the equilibrium of reaction (2Scott J.D. Fischer E.H. Takio K. Demaille J.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5732-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to lie to the right. Several factors could account for this. The affinity for cAMP could be reduced so that the purified rRI(D170A) was not saturated with cAMP. Alternatively, the affinity for C could be increased. To resolve these possibilities, the cAMP binding properties of rRI(D170A) were characterized more fully.Figure 4Inhibition of 20 nm wild-type C-subunit with unstripped RI-WT and rRI(D170A). 20 nmC-subunit was incubated with varying amounts of either rRI(WT) (•) or rRI(D170A) (▴) in 1 ml of assay mixture for 2 min prior to the addition of Kemptide. Similar results were obtained on multiple occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)cAMP Binding Properties of rRI(D170A) and rRI(D170A)2C2One explanation for the above observations would be that mutation of Asp-170 interferes with the high affinity binding of cAMP. Other mutations in the R-subunit that specifically disrupt cAMP binding in either the A- or B-domain such as rRI(R209K) or rRI(R333K) also inhibit C linearly and stoichiometrically without having to first remove cAMP (6Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 2934-2942Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). When purified, only one cAMP-binding site is occupied in these mutant R-subunits and these proteins behave like stripped rRI(WT). Unlike rRI(WT), rRI(R209K) and rRI(R333K) form stable holoenzyme complexes even when cAMP levels are high.The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the RI-subunit is quenched by cAMP (29León D.A. Dostmann W.R.G. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3035-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Builder S.E. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2350-2354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the B-domain of RI does not have any tryptophans, the change in tryptophan fluorescence in response to cAMP is a sensitive method for measuring cAMP binding to the A-domain. For example, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of wild-type RI is quenched compared with that of RI(R209K) because no cAMP is bound to site A in RI(R209K).4 The fluorescence spectrum of rRI(D170A) compared with rRI(WT) and rRI(R209K) is shown in Fig.5. The spectrum of rRI(D170A) was similar to that of the wild-type RI-subunit and showed significant quenching compared with rRI(R209K). Thus cAMP was bound to the A-domain of rRI(D170A), similar to RI(WT) and in contrast to the rRI(R209K) where the A site is not occupied by cAMP. To confirm this, an apparent K d for cAMP binding was obtained by titrating the tryptophan fluorescence of the urea stripped proteins with increasing amounts of cAMP. As seen in Fig. 5 (inset), the apparent K d for cAMP binding to rRI(D170A) (K d = 62 nm) was similar to that of rRI(WT) (K d = 45 nm) and was comparable to the K d measured by equilibrium dialysis (36Ogreid D. Ekanger R. Suka R.H. Miller J.P. Doskeland S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Figure 5Tryptophan fluorescence of rRI(D170A), rRI(R209K), and rRI(WT). RI-subunit (0.2 μm) was dialyzed against (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmβ-ME) to remove free cAMP. Fluorescence measurements were made as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The excitation wavelength was 290 nm with a bandpass of 10 nm. The excited samples were scanned for tryptophan fluorescence from 300 to 450 nm using an emission bandpass of 5 nm. Spectra were analyzed using Spectra-Calc software. Inset, the tryptophan fluorescence of urea stripped rRI(WT) (•) and rRI(D170A) (▪) was titrated by the addition of increasing amounts of cAMP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The % quench was plotted against the log[cAMP] to obtain apparent K d values for cAMP binding. The fluorescence titration of rRI(WT) is carried out routinely and is highly reproducible. The mutant was characterized on two separate occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the cAMP binding properties of rRI(D170A), the apparent K a for cAMP activation of the mutant holoenzyme was measured. The K a for cAMP activation of rRI(D170A) was 127 nm which correlates well with 88 nm for wild-type holoenzyme. This is also similar to the previously reported K a for wild-type holoenzyme (6Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 2934-2942Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, the K a for cAMP activation of RI(R209K) was 1700 nm (6Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 2934-2942Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Stokes RadiusThe Stokes radius of rRI(D170A) was measured to determine whether the mutation had altered the global structure of RI. The native form of rRI(D170A) had a Stokes radius of 46.1 Å, similar to that of native RI (32Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the urea-stripped cAMP-free form of rRI(D170A) had a Stokes radius that was 1.3 Å smaller than the native, cAMP-bound form. This is also similar to the wild-type protein which exhibited a 2-Å decrease in Stokes radius upon removal of cAMP (32Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, RI(R209K), which is defective in binding cAMP to the A-domain, has a Stokes radius that is similar to the cAMP-free form of RI(WT) (32Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The Effect of Mutating Lys242To establish whether Lys242 in RI contributed to the high affinity binding between R and C, the mutant protein, rRI(K242A), was tested for its ability to inhibit wild-type C. Surprisingly, like the D170A mutant, inhibition of rC(WT) with rRI(K242A) did not require dialysis. rRI(K242A) also inhibited 20 nm rC(WT) in the spectrophotometric assay in a linear and stoichiometric fashion without being stripped of cAMP. This mutation also did not appear to affect cAMP binding, since the apparent K a of cAMP activation of the rRI(K242A) mutant holoenzyme was similar to that of wild-type holoenzyme.Surface Plasmon ResonanceOne explanation for the abili"

We investigate whether lipids that are membrane components and involved in cell signaling could modify the Ca2+-dependent activation of tTG. We found that sphingosylphosphocholine (lyso-SM) was the only lipid to activate transglutaminase at low Ca2+ concentrations. In the presence of lyso-SM (125 μm), transglutaminase was detectable at 10 μm Ca2+, whereas in the absence of lyso-SM, similar activity was obtained at 160 μm Ca2+. Furthermore, in the presence of lipid vesicles lyso-SM retained the ability to enhance the Ca2+-dependent activation of tTG. Lyso-SM did not significantly change the K m for the glutamyl and primary amine substrates. However, the K actfor Ca2+ was reduced from 300 μm to 90 μm. Structure-function studies of lyso-SM analogs indicate that phosphocholine group on C1, the free amino group at C2 and a C4–C5 double bond are critical for the activation of transglutaminase activity. This is the first demonstration that a specific sphingolipid could enhance the activity of tTG and could play a role in vivo in activation of the tTG at physiologic Ca2+ levels.

Calcium ions are required for the enzyme to adopt the proper conformation to bind glutamine and lysine residues within proteins or peptides (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H.

The intracellular levels of calcium are much lower than the reported calcium levels required to obtain measurable transglutaminase (TGase) activity in vitro. This raises the question of whether there are intracellular cofactor(s) that can modify the sensitivity of tTG to Ca2+. The tTG first forms a calcium-dependent thioester bond with select protein bound glutamines and releases ammonia (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H.

The binding of calcium ions reduces the affinity of tTG for GTP (5Bergamini C.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). GTP binding to tTG causes a conformational change in the protein which leads to a reduction in TGase activity (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H.

Based upon the affinity of the tTG for both calcium ions and GTP as well as the intracellular concentrations of these cofactors, the majority of the tTG in vivo is predicted to remain latent (1Greenberg C.S.

Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The recent discovery that a portion of the intracellular tTG is associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the cell membrane and can function as a G-protein coupled to the α1-adrenergic receptor suggests a role of membrane lipids in regulating tTG function (10Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 8-amino acid residues (Leu665–Lys672) of tTG are involved in the interaction and activation of phospholipase C, which is critical for the completion of the α1-adrenergic receptor signaling event (11Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). More recently, it is reported that the association of tTG with membrane is stimulated by retinoic acid treatment (12Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, the formation of the apoptotic envelope by tTG prevents the release of intracellular constituents, and recent studies demonstrate that apoptotic envelopes contain an increased content of isopeptide bonds and the tTG antigen (13Nemes Z. Friis R.R. Aeschlimann D. Saurer S. Paulsson M. Fesus L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 125-133PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fesus L. Zsuzsa S. Uray I. J. Cell. Biochem.

The ability of tissue transglutaminases to bind phospholipids and the localization of tTG to the cell surface membrane compartment may play a role in cell receptor signaling and apoptosis. This led us to examine whether lipid cofactors could modulate the calcium-dependent cross-linking activity of tTG. We focused our attention on molecules of cell membrane components and molecules that are considered potential regulators of cell receptor function and calcium-dependent signaling events. In this report, we demonstrate that sphingosylphosphocholine (lyso-SM) can serve as specific cofactor that reduces the calcium ion requirement for expression of intracellular tissue transglutaminase activity in the presence or absence of phospholipid vesicles. Lyso-SM is specific in its interaction with the tTG and induces a conformational change in the protein that selectively influences calcium binding, but does not influence the enzyme for its substrates. Lipid cofactors could play a major role in regulating tissue transglutaminase associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the cells surface. The specificity, biochemistry, and functional biologic role of the interaction of lyso-SM will be discussed. Sodium salts of GTP were purchased from Sigma.

Dihydrosphingosine stereoisomers were prepared by hydrogenation over Pd/C (palladium on activated charcoal) of an adequate sphingosines. Ceramide stereoisomers were prepared by acylation of sphingosines with an adequate acid chlorides or anhydrides (18Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Lyso-SM was purchased from Sigma or Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA or was prepared by acid hydrolysis of bovine brain sphingomyelin, a procedure that has been established to yield ∼7:3d-erythro/l-threo mixture (20Van Veldhoven P.P.

Lyso-dihydrosphingomyelin (lyso-dihydro-SM) was prepared by hydrogenation of bovine brain lyso-SM and structure of the synthesized compounds was verified by mass spectroscopy and 1H NMR analysis. All the lipids were dissolved in 95% ethanol except sphingosine 1-phosphate (in 80% methanol) and phosphatidylethanolamine (in chloroform). The conditions for growing Escherichia coli and the purification of the GST-tTG protein were performed as described previously (22Lai T.-S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford's method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standards (Bio-Rad). TGase activity was determined by quantitating the incorporation of 5-biotin (amido) pentylamine (BP) into N,N′-dimethylcasein-coated microtiter plate as described previously (24Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The K m forN,N′-dimethylcasein was determined using the [3H]putrescine incorporation assay (25Miraglia C.C. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the BP incorporation assay, lipids were added directly to the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and GST-tTG (2 μg/ml) to the desired concentration and applied to theN,N′-dimethylcasein coated microtiter plate, and the remaining procedures were the same as described previously (24Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of lyso-SM on the activation of factor XIIIa, recombinant GST-factor XIII A-chains (4 μg/ml) were treated with 20 units/ml of thrombin at 37 °C for 15 min in a final volume of 50 μl to generate factor XIIIa as described previously (22Lai T.-S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the reaction, 10 μm thromstop (American Diagnostic, New York) was added and factor XIIIa generated was used immediately to test the effect of lyso-SM on TGase activity as described earlier. PC:PE (80:20) vesicles were generated immediately before use by mixing 8 mm PC and 2 mm PE and probe sonication on ice for 5 s for five times with a 20-s break in between. To determine the K m for the glutamine substrate, the concentration of N,N′-dimethylcasein was varied from 1.1 to 24.4 μm. To determine theK m for primary amine substrate, the concentration of BP was varied from 16 to 1000 μm. TheK act for Ca2+ was determined using Ca2+ concentrations that varied from 40 to 5000 μm. The K m, andK act values were obtained using the Eadie-Hofstee plot (26Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Enzyme Assays. Oxford University Press, Walton Street, Oxford1993Google Scholar). The cleaved tTG was obtained by incubating GST-tTG with factor Xa (Hematologic Tech. Inc., Essex Jct., VT) (1% w/w) overnight at 4 °C and applied to glutathione resins to remove the GST protein. The trypsin digestion experiment was performed by incubating 1 μg of cleaved tTG, 50 ng of trypsin (Calbiochem, high performance liquid chromatography-purified), and different concentrations of lyso-SM at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and products were separated on 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose paper. The tTG antigen was probed using a monoclonal antibody against tTG (CUB 7401) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG and was visualized using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The intensity of full-length tTG was quantified using a scanning densitometer (model GS300, Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA). Control experiments using chromogenic substrate of trypsin,N-α-benzoyl-d-l-argininep-nitroanilide (Sigma), that measured an increase in OD405 reading in the presence of trypsin indicated that lyso-SM did not affect the trypsin activity at concentrations tested. A wide variety of lipids, which are components of the cell membrane and are involved in all signaling, were examined to determine whether they altered the TGase activity of tTG at low calcium ion concentrations (Table I). In the initial screening, we tested the lipid's ability to activate latent tTG at suboptimum concentration of calcium ions (100 μm) with 1 mm lipids. The tTG showed <5% of maximum TGase activity at 100 μm calcium ions. We found that only lyso-SM produced a major increase in the activation of latent tTG. Therefore, we investigated the minimum concentration of lyso-SM required to activate the TGase activity of tTG (Fig. 1). We found that optimum TGase activity occurred at ∼125 μm lyso-SM and then plateaued (Fig. 1). In the absence of lyso-SM, the maximum TGase activity was ∼85% lower than that achieved with the addition of 125 μm lyso-SM to the reaction (Fig. 1). Table Isummarizes the effects of the various lipids on calcium-dependent activation of the TGase activity. The results summarized in Table I at 125 μm lipids were similar to that obtained in the initial screening reaction with 1 mm amounts of the lipids.Table IEffects of lipids on the activation of transglutaminase activity at low calcium ion concentrationsTransglutaminase activity1-aTGase activity of tTG at 100 μmCa2+ was 5 mOD/min.

Open table in a new tab We then examined the effect of varying the calcium ion concentration on TGase activity in the presence of these lipids. All lipids listed in Table I were tested and Fig. 2 shows representative of these results. We found that at 125 μm lyso-SM, measurable TGase activity occurred at 10 μm of Ca2+, whereas in the absence of lyso-SM there was no measurable TGase activity until Ca2+ was increased to 160 μm (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the TGase activity obtained at 160 μm of Ca2+ was ∼16-fold lower than the activity measured in the presence of lyso-SM (Fig. 2). The TGase activity obtained at 160 μm of Ca2+ was similar to the activity measured at 10 μm of Ca2+ in the presence of lyso-SM (Fig. 2).d-e-C2 ceramide,d-e-C6-ceramide and other lipids did not have effect on activation of TGase activity (Fig. 2). To examine the specificity of the lyso-SM effect further, other lyso-SM analogs, including lyso-PAF, lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), lyso-dihydro-SM, sphingosine 1-phosphate and lyso-SM stereoisomers (d-erythro- and l-threo-) were also tested (Table II and Fig.3 A). The results demonstrated that none of the lyso-SM analogs displayed any activation of tTG and the lyso-PAF had a slightly inhibitory effect on TGase activity (Fig.3 B). The ability of lyso-SM to serve as an activator of the tTG was lost when lyso-SM was replaced with sphingosine 1-phosphate in the calcium-dependent reaction, demonstrating that the choline group of lyso-SM was necessary in regulating the calcium dependent activation of the tissue TG. The free amino group was also necessary for the activation, since SM was not able to enhance the TGase activity (see Fig. 3 A and Table II). Lyso-PC and lyso-PAF do not have free amino group at C2 and have different side chain at C3 and were not able to produce a calcium-dependent activation of the TGase activity. The double bond at C4–C5 was important for the reaction, since dihydrolyso-SM was not able to activate the TGase activity (Fig.3 B and Table II). Two stereoisomers of lyso-SM showed similar activation curve demonstrated that stereospecificity at C2, but not at C3, was important for the specificity (Table II). Glycerol 1-phosphate and phosphorylcholine were not able to activate the TGase activity, further demonstrating the specificity of lyso-SM in inducing the calcium-dependent activation of tTG (Table II).Table IISpecificity of lyso-SM on activation of tTG activityTransglutaminase2-aTGase activity of tTG at 100 μmCa2+ was 5 mOD/min.

Open table in a new tab To examine whether lyso-SM retain an effect in activating the TGase activity in the presence of membrane lipids, TGase activity was measured in the presence of 100 μm of PC:PE (80:20) vesicles and 0–160 μm of lyso-SM (Fig.4, A and B). We found that the TGase activity of tTG increased in the presence of increasing concentrations of lyso-SM. The activity was increased 310% by 160 μm lyso-SM (Fig. 4 A). In addition, the calcium requirement to achieve half-maximal TGase activity was decreased in the presence of increasing concentrations of lyso-SM (Fig.4 B). The ability of lyso-SM to stimulate the calcium-dependent activation of the plasma transglutaminase, factor XIIIa, was also studied by the same assay as used for tTG. We found no enhancement in the calcium-dependent activation of plasma factor XIIIa using 125 μm of lyso-SM and Ca2+ concentration up to 1 mm. GTP is an important negative regulator of TGase activity and functions by binding to tTG (27Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of lyso-SM, the IC50for GTP was found to be 4 μm (Fig.5 A). We found that lyso-SM could completely reverse GTP-dependent inhibition of TGase activity (Fig.5 B). When GTP was present (50 μm), the lyso-SM concentration required to achieve maximum calcium-dependent TGase activity was increased from 125 to 500 μm. Kinetic analysis of the effect of lyso-SM on TGase function revealed that there was no significant effect of lyso-SM on the K m forN,N′-dimethylcasein and BP. The K actfor calcium ions was reduced by ∼3-fold (from 300 to 95 μm) in the presence of 125 μm of lyso-SM. To demonstrate the binding of lyso-SM to tTG, the trypsin digestion pattern was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody against tTG. There was a concentration-dependent protection of tTG from trypsin proteolysis when 31.5–500 μm lyso-SM was present in the reaction (Fig. 6). Control experiments using the chromogenic substrate of trypsin demonstrated that 31.5–500 μm lyso-SM did not inhibit the trypsin activity. The TGase activity of tTG is considered to be an important intracellular and extracellular reaction during apoptosis, bone ossification, tissue repair, and tumor growth (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb.

The major proportion of tTG is found inside the cells, although it is also reported to exist in extracellular environment (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 3Ichinose A. Bottenus R.E. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13411-13414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, tTG is also found to associate with the cell membrane and functions in intracellular signaling pathways (10Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 28Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The association of tTG with membrane suggests that lipid molecules could modulate enzymatic activities of tTG. In this study, we investigated the effect of membrane lipids that are involved in cell signaling on TGase activity. Calcium ions are essential for tTG to serve as glutamine donor and lysyl acceptor in the transglutaminase reaction (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 3Ichinose A. Bottenus R.E. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13411-13414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). The calcium ions promote the assembly of the active site pocket with cysteine 277 to form a thioester bond with the glutamyl-containing substrate (4Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). The second step of the reaction requires that the lysine residue fit into the active site pocket and align with the catalytic triad to catalyze the isopeptide bond (4Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). Since lyso-SM could potentiate the ability of calcium ions to trigger TGase activity, we propose that lyso-SM binds specifically to the tTG and enhances the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+. This allows the enzyme to recognize glutamine substrates at lower calcium ion concentrations and increase in the reactivity of the thioester intermediate with the lysyl substrates. The binding of lyso-SM to tTG was demonstrated by changing the tTG from a protease sensitive to protease resistant conformation and the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ was increased by ∼3-fold. Human plasma factor XIII A-chains share 39% amino acid identity with human tTG with the greatest identity regions in the active site and calcium binding site(s) regions (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 3Ichinose A. Bottenus R.E. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13411-13414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite similar, but not identical, structure homology, tTG and factor XIIIa are regulated by a unique set of cofactors. In the case of plasma factor XIII, fibrinogen plays an important role in the activation of factor XIIIa by reducing the Ca2+ concentration required for B-chain dissociation (29Credo R.B. Curtis C.G. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4234-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For tTG, GTP, and Ca2+ are important regulators of TGase activity (27Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of lyso-SM for the tTG and not plasma factor XIII A-chains relates to their overall differences in protein structure and the fact that fibrin(ogen) functions as the extracellular cofactor that modifies the calcium-dependent activation of plasma factor XIII (29Credo R.B. Curtis C.G. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4234-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since plasma factor XIII functions as an extracellular enzyme, there is no need for it to react with lyso-SM, since it can function at existing concentrations of extracellular calcium ions in the presence of fibrinogen and fibrin. The specificity of lyso-SM binding to the tTG is documented by the unique ability of lyso-SM to promote calcium-dependent activation of the tTG. The lack of ability of dihydro lyso-SM and SM to activate TGase activity demonstrates the importance of the double bond (at C4–C5) and the free amino group (at C2), respectively. The stereospecificity at C2, but not at C3, of lyso-SM indicates that the nature occurring erythro-lyso-SM is equipotent asl-threo- diastereoisomer in the activation of TGase activity. The structure-activity studies demonstrated the requirement of phosphocholine group at C1, the free amino group at C2, and a C4–C5 double bond. There is no preference ford-erythro-(2S,3R) overl-threo-(2S,3S) stereoisomer, suggesting that stereospecificity at C3 is not important for activating TGase activity. The lyso-SM could also interfere with GTP-dependent inhibition of TGase activity of tTG. Calcium ions reverse GTP inhibition by reducing the affinity of tTG to GTP (5Bergamini C.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is possible that lyso-SM binding allows the protein to adopt a conformation that has reduced affinity for GTP. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the binding of lyso-SM increases the enzyme affinity for Ca2+. The distribution and physiological concentration of lyso-SM inside the cells are not well established. Although we find that lyso-SM is very soluble in water (up to 0.5 m), its partitioning into membranes has not been determined. Importantly, in the presence of PC:PE vesicles, lyso-SM retained its effects in activating TGase activity of tTG. These results suggest that lyso-SM is capable of activating tTG in the context of membrane lipids. In preliminary studies, we found lyso-SM level was increased in cells undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that the intracellular lyso-SM concentration is also dependent on different physiological state of the cells. 2T.-S. Lai, A. Bielawska, Y. A. Hannun, and C. S. Greenberg, unpublished observations. The tTG is found in the membrane compartment as well as cytoplasm of mammalian cells (9Korner G. Schneider D.E.

When the local concentration of lyso-SM reaches a critical concentration, it could promote the local activation of this latent intracellular enzyme. The metabolic pathways that produce lyso-SM in mammalian cells are poorly defined (30Bell, R. M., Hannun, Y. A., and Merril, A. H., Jr. (eds) (1993) Sphingolipids Part B: Regulation and Function of Metabolism, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar). It is believed that lyso-SM is a metabolite of SM, possibly by the enzymatic activity of a sphingomyelin acylase, which is highly expressed in the stratum corneum from patients with atopic dermatitis (31Murata Y. Ogata J. Higaki Y. Kawashima M. Yada Y. Higuchi K. Tsuchiya T. Kawaminami S. Imokawa G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1242-1249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The same enzymatic activity was also found inPseudomonas sp. TK4 and is called sphingolipid ceramideN-deacylase (32Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SM is a ubiquitous constituent of plasma membrane and several metabolites derived from SM serve as intracellular second messengers are reported (33Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Wolff R.A. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 43-64PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Lyso-SM can induce an increase of Ca2+ concentration due to mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores (36Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24343-24351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 37Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Recent studies by NMR spectroscopy indicate the existence of lyso-SM in normal and tumor tissues (38Seijo L. Merchant T.E. van der Ven L.T.M. Minsky B.D. Glonek T. Lipids. 1994; 29: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is proposed that lysosphingolipids play a pathogenic role in inborn metabolic disorders known as sphingolipidoses (39Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Lyso-SM level was increased by 40-fold in spleen, liver, and brain of patients with Niemann-Pick type A disease who have sphingomyelinase deficiency, hepatosplenomegaly, and brain dysfunction (40Berger A. Rosenthal D. Spiegal S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5885-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, with the recognition of the spingomyelin cycle (35Hannun Y.A.

Trends Biochem.

DNase I footprinting and mobility shift assays with nuclear proteins from the human T cell clone, SP-B21, demonstrated protein interactions with each of these response elements (REs), located between positions −79 and −45 (RE-I), −123 and −92 (RE-II), and −170 and −130 (RE-III). Two of these regions, RE-II and RE-III, have not previously been described to regulate IL-5 expression in T cells. The RE-II site was shown to be critical for inducible IL-5 promoter activity in transient transfection assays in D10.G4.1 T cells, while the RE-III site functions as a negative regulatory element. The activity of the RE-II site was specifically inhibited by cyclosporin A, and transfection assays with IL-5 constructs containing mutations in the RE-II site showed greatly reduced reporter gene activity. We have defined the sequence involved in stimulation-dependent transcription and have identified constitutive as well as inducible DNA-binding protein complexes that bind to RE-II. Antibodies against at least two members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors are capable of binding to the IL-5 RE-II complexes, although they can be distinguished from previously identified NFAT-specific complexes by several characteristics.

IL-5 has been strongly implicated as a major factor controlling the local infiltration and activation of eosinophils in this disease (5Gulbenkian A.R. Egan R.W. Fernandez X. Jones H. Kreutner W.

T lymphocyte clones can be classified into two major subtypes, Th1 and Th2, based on the cytokines produced by the cells in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation (8Mosmann T.R. Coffmann R.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 145-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar). Th1 cells produce IL-2, interferon γ, and lymphotoxin and promote delayed type hypersensitivity responses. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 and participate in allergic or anti-inflammatory responses as well as provide help for some B cell responses. Both types of cells are capable of producing IL-3 and GM-CSF. Helper T cell subsets producing cytokines typical of both Th1 and Th2 clones have also been described for human T cells (9Mosmann T.R. Sad S. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 138-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 10Romagnani S. J. Clin. Immunol. 1995; 15: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). A third class of T cell clones that can express various combinations of these cytokines has been designated Th0 cells (11Kamogawa Y. Minasi L.E. Carding S.R. Bottomly K. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 985-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The expression of IL-5 is tightly regulated and highly tissue-specific, being expressed primarily in the Th2 subtype of T cells (4Corrigan C.J. Kay A.B. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 501-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), mast cells (12Plaut M. Pierce J.H. Watson C.J. Hanley-Hyde J. Nordan R.P. Paul W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), and eosinophils (13Nagai H. Yamaguchi S. Inagaki N. Tsuruoka N. Hitoshi Y. Takatsu K. Life Sci. 1993; 53: PL 243-PL 247Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The expression of IL-5 in Th2 cells is dependent on activation of the cells. Activation of T cells requires the interaction of the TCR complex with antigen in the context of major histocompatibility complex antigens (14Weiss A. Imboden J.B. Adv. Immunol. 1987; 41: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This activation can be mimicked in vitro by activating T cells with bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (Ab) (15Wolff C.H.J. Hong S.-C. von Grafenstein H. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar) and is sufficient for efficient induction of IL-5 synthesis in Th2 cells (16Naora H. Altin J.G. Young I.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5691-5702PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of IL-5 message in T cells is inhibited when the cells are activated in the presence of protein translation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide (CHX), indicating that nascent protein(s) synthesized in response to the activation signals delivered through the TCR are required for expression of IL-5 (16Naora H. Altin J.G. Young I.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5691-5702PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bohjanen P.R. Okajima M. Hodes R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5283-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The requirement for de novo protein synthesis for IL-5 gene expression is not shared by other cytokines produced by the same subset of Th2 cells in response to cell activation. This distinction suggests that more than one induction pathway may be responsible for the apparently coordinate expression of multiple cytokine genes in Th2 cells (16Naora H. Altin J.G. Young I.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5691-5702PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bohjanen P.R. Okajima M. Hodes R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5283-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Like most cytokine genes, the regulation of IL-5 message is primarily at the level of transcription and is likely to be controlled to a large extent by regulatory elements in the promoter region that can influence the transcriptional activity of the gene (18Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 243: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have examined the sequences and associated transcription factors that regulate the expression of a number of cytokine genes produced by T cells, including IL-2 (19Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), IL-3 (20Park J-H. Kaushansky K. Levitt L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6299-6308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IL-4 (21Todd M.D. Grusby M.J. Lederer J.A. Lacy E. Lichtman A.H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp.

In contrast, although the IL-5 gene has been cloned for several years (23Campbell H.D. Tucker W.Q.J. Hort Y. Martinson M.E. Mayo G. Clutterbuck E.J. Sanderson C.J. Young I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

None of these studies investigated the transcriptional control of human IL-5 gene expression in untransformed T cells in which the production of IL-5 was induced by TCR-mediated activation signals. In the current study, sequences located in the 5′-flanking region of the human IL-5 gene were examined for the ability to respond to T cell activation signals mediated through the TCR and to regulate transcription of this gene. DNase I footprinting and mobility shift assays with nuclear protein extracts from a human IL-5-producing T cell clone demonstrate that the human IL-5 gene promoter contains multiple response elements that act as protein binding sites. One of these elements was shown to be critical for stimulus-dependent inducible IL-5 expression in T cells in transient transfection experiments. The inducible activity of this regulatory region is specifically inhibited in the presence of cyclosporin A. A 20-bp sequence within this region was shown to be critical for stable protein binding, and the protein complex that binds to this site includes at least one member that is related to the NFAT family of transcription factors. The human CD3+, CD4+, CD8− Th0 T cell clone, SP-B21, was obtained from Dr. Hans Yssel (DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA) and has been described previously (28Roncarolo M.G. Yssel H.

This cell line expressed significant levels of IL-5 mRNA and protein after TCR-mediated stimulation, but no IL-5 message or protein was detectable in the absence of stimulation (data not shown).

The SP-B21 cells were maintained in culture by bimonthly stimulation with a feeder cell mixture consisting of irradiated (4000 rads) allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells, an irradiated (5000 rads) Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell clone (JY), and phytohemagglutin (0.1 μg/ml; Murex, Norcross, GA) in Yssel's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 1% human AB+ serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA) as described (30Yssel H. De Vries J.E. Koken M. Van Blitterswijk W. Spits H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Three days after each restimulation, the cells were expanded in medium containing 20 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 (Biosource, Camarillo, CA). The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing IL-2 every 3 days until the cells were restimulated at the end of the 14-day period. The cells were used for experiments 7–9 days after the last restimulation with feeder cells. For preparation of activated nuclear protein extracts, the cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb (clone UCHT1, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) -coated plates (coated at 1 μg/ml in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C and then washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline). Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 10 min with 10 μg/ml CHX (Sigma) or 2 μg/ml CsA (Sandoz Corp., E. Hanover, NJ) prior to antibody stimulation. Antibody stimulation during this period of the feeder cell stimulation cycle is sufficient to induce significant levels of IL-5 message detectable by Northern blots and IL-5 protein detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (31Watanabe S.

Concanavalin A-stimulated rat growth factor supernatant treated with α-methylmannoside (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA) was added at a concentration of 5% (v/v) during the expansion of the cells.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 0.5-kb double-stranded DNA fragment containing the region between positions −505 and +42 of the human IL-5 gene was used as a probe for screening. A 3.26-kbPstI fragment containing the human IL-5 gene was subcloned from this P1 clone into the PstI site of pGEM3zf(−) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A 1.5-kbPstI-Psp1406I fragment was excised from the pGEM subclone and the overhanging ends were made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. This fragment was inserted into theSmaI site of the luciferase expression vector, pGL2basic, in the 5′ to 3′ orientation to create the reporter construct HuIL5(−1547)luc. The insert was sequenced by standard dideoxy sequencing methods (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and was verified to contain the 5′-flanking region of the human IL-5 gene to position −1547 upstream of the previously identified transcription start site (see Fig. 4). The 5′-flanking region sequence of the human IL-5 gene reported here is contained within the unpublished sequence deposited in GenBankTM (accession number L48477) from subclone 6-b10 from P1 H21.Figure 1Three regions in the human IL-5 proximal promoter are protected in DNase I footprinting assays. A, three 5′ regions of the IL-5 promoter (IL-5 RE-I, positions −79 to −45; IL-5 RE-II, positions −123 to −92; and IL-5 RE-III, positions −170 to −130) are protected from digestion by DNase I in the presence of nuclear extracts from anti-CD3-stimulated human SP-B21 T cells prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The template had been end-labeled either at the −308 terminus (coding strand, lanes 1–5) or the +39 terminus (noncoding strand, lanes 6–10). The positions of the protected regions are indicated at the sides of thegels. Two of the protected regions, IL-5 RE-II and IL-5 RE-III, contained sites at their boundaries that were hypersensitive to DNase I digestion. These sites are indicated by theasterisks. Lanes 1 and 5, coding strand template digested in the absence of nuclear proteins;lanes 2–4, coding strand template digested in the presence of 10, 30, and 60 μg of nuclear protein, respectively; lanes 6 and 10, noncoding strand template digested in the absence of nuclear protein; lanes 7–9, noncoding strand template digested in the presence of 2, 10, and 20 μg of nuclear protein, respectively.

The sequences of these oligonucleotides are shown in Table I. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting PCR fragments were digested with BglII and HindIII and cloned into the multiple cloning site of the pGL2basic reporter plasmid (Promega Corp.) in the 5′ to 3′ orientation. The 5′ position at which each reporter construct was truncated is indicated by the number in the name of each construct (see Fig. 5 A) and is relative to the transcription start site in the IL-5 gene. All constructions were verified by DNA sequencing (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All constructs contain the IL-5 transcription initiation site (+1) but not the IL-5 translation initiation codon to ensure that translation of the luciferase reporter gene will initiate at the AUG of the luciferase mRNA.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides synthesized for IL-5 reporter construct cloningOligonucleotide nameSequenceIL-5(−505)ggagatctATCCTAATCAAGACCCCAGTIL-5(−384)ggagatctGTCATAGTAGAACATAGCCGIL-5(−316)ggagatctGTTTAGTGGTCTACCTTATAIL-5(−236)ggagatctGTGGGGCAATGATGTATTAAIL-5(−172)ggagatctCAGGGATTTTTATTATTAAAIL-5(−127)ggagatctGATATAAGGCATTGGAAACAIL-5(−80)ggagatctGCATTCTCTATCTGATTGTTIL-5(−38)ggagatctGACAGACAATAAATTGACTGIL-5(+42)ggagatctCTCTGAAACGTTCTGCGTTTAS1ggagatctAGATATAAGGacggaaccctATTTAGTTTCACGATATGCCSDM1GTAAATTTATTTTTTAAGATATAgtaacggaaccctacggaaccctagatttgaCCATTATTAGGCATTCThe nucleotides that differ from the human IL-5 gene are shown in lowercase.

Two synthetic oligonucleotides were designed to mutate the IL-5 RE-II region of the human IL-5 promoter. The SDM1 oligonucleotide (Table I) was synthesized by standard β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry (Oligos, Etc., Wilsonville, OR) and contained altered sequence in the region corresponding to IL-5 RE-II as indicated. The altered sequence was randomly chosen and confirmed to contain no consensus sites for previously characterized DNA-binding proteins by searching against the Transcription Factor Database TFDSITES.SUBSEQ.7.0.aa (MacVector, version 5.0, Oxford Molecular Group, Inc., Campbell, CA). This oligonucleotide was used to generate the mutant construct (designated mutant (−1547)luc) by site-directed mutagenesis with the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). For selection of mutant plasmids, the ScaI/StuI selection primer (CLONTECH) was used to eliminate the uniqueScaI site in the pGL2basic vector portion of the wild-type HuIL5(−1547)luc construct template. The AS1 oligonucleotide (Table I) was designed to generate a mutant plasmid (mutant (−127)luc) in the context of the HuIL5(−127)luc construct. This oligonucleotide was used as the 5′-primer in a PCR reaction according to standard techniques (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar) with HuIL5(−127)luc as the template and oligonucleotide IL-5 (+42) (Table I) as the 3′-primer. The PCR product was subcloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of the pGL2basic vector. The mutated sequence in both mutant constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated SP-B21 cells, cells stimulated by plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml CHX, or 2 μg/ml CsA by a modification of the procedure described by Dignamet al. (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The modifications were as follows: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was omitted from all of the buffers and was replaced by the protease inhibitor, Pefabloc SC (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) (Boehringer Mannheim) in the concentrations indicated below. The total volume of Buffer C used to resuspend the nuclear pellet did not exceed the volume of the nuclear pellet. The nuclear extracts were dialyzed for a maximum period of 1 h at 4 °C. The modified Dignam buffers had the following compositions: Buffer A, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm Pefabloc, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; Buffer C, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1.2m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; low salt Buffer C, the same as Buffer C except for a reduction in the KCl concentration to 0.02 m; Buffer D, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmPefabloc, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The protein content of the nuclear extracts was determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNase I footprinting was performed as described by Galas and Schmitz (37Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). The double-stranded DNA template was created by sequential digestion of the HuIL5(−384)luc construct with AccI and HindIII. The DNA was dephosphorylated between the two digestions. The resulting 347-bp template was therefore dephosphorylated on the 5′-end of either the coding or the noncoding strand, depending on which restriction enzyme was used first. The digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose, 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA gel, and the template band was excised and purified using the Wizard DNA purification system (Promega). The DNA template was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Unincorporated nucleotide was removed from the sample by centrifugation through a Microcon 100 filter (Amicon, Inc., Keasbey, NJ). The 50-μl digests for the footprinting experiments contained nuclear protein amounts as indicated in Figs. 1 and 3 in a reaction mixture that consisted of 8% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled template. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before digestion with 0.15 units of DNase I (Promega) for 60–120 s in the presence of Ca2+/Mg2+. The digestion was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of a stop solution containing 200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 50 μg/ml tRNA. Following organic extraction and precipitation in the presence of ethanol, the reactions were resuspended in 4 μl of a loading dye solution, loaded onto a prewarmed 6% acrylamide-urea sequencing gel, and electrophoresed for 90 min at 75 watts. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 1–3 days at room temperature. Cycle sequencing reactions for the coding and noncoding strands were used to orient the DNase I footprint regions within the template sequence. All cycle sequencing reactions were carried out with the dsDNA Cycle Sequencing System (Life Technologies). The template used was the same as that used for the DNase I footprinting reactions. Twenty-bp oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′-end of each template strand were synthesized with phosphoramidite chemistry according to standard protocols and used as primers in the cycle sequencing reactions.

Its major function in vivo is the removal of negative supercoils from DNA (3Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 4Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In vitro, such relaxation activity requires that Mg(II) be present in the reaction mixture (3Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 5Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 42: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When other divalent ions were tested (5Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 42: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Ca(II) could partly replace the Mg(II) in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA while the presence of other divalent ions, such as Mn(II), did not support the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by the enzyme. Moreover, the presence of 2 mm Mn(II) had an inhibitory effect when co-incubated with the enzyme and 2 mm Mg(II) (5Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 42: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggested that there are specific interactions between Mg(II) and the enzyme or enzyme·DNA complex.The three-dimensional structure of the 67-kDa N-terminal fragment ofE. coli DNA topoisomerase I has been determined by x-ray crystallography (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It was noted (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) that near the active site nucleophile Tyr-319, there are three acidic residues, Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 arranged similarly to the three acidic residues known to coordinate two divalent ions in Klenow fragment (7Beese L.S. Steiz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). According to the models proposed for DNA polymerase mechanism, these coordinated divalent ions are essential for the nucleotidyl transfer catalytic activity (8Joyce C.M. Steiz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 9Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut T. Science. 1994; 246: 1930-1935Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar) of DNA polymerases. However, divalent ions were not present in the topoisomerase I crystal structure (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is also known that Mg(II) is not required for DNA cleavage by topoisomerase and formation of the covalent protein-DNA intermediate (10Depew R.E. Liu L.F. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 511-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although Mg(II) is required for intermolecular religation to be observed (11Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10931-10935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear if Mg(II) interacts directly with the enzyme.The basis for the requirement of Mg(II) for relaxation activity needs to be elucidated to fully understand the enzyme mechanism. There are several possible roles for Mg(II) in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. For a direct role in catalysis, one or more Mg(II) bound at the active site may activate the Tyr-319 hydroxyl nucleophile and stabilize the DNA 3′OH-leaving group during the DNA strand cleavage step, and/or they may activate the DNA 3′OH as the attacking nucleophile and stabilze the Tyr-319 hydroxyl-leaving group during the DNA religation step. More indirectly, Mg(II) coordination may place the DNA phosphates and enzyme catalytic groups in the positions required for catalysis. In addition, binding of Mg(II) may allow the enzyme to undergo the conformational changes postulated to be required for the strand passage, DNA religation and substrate release steps in the proposed mechanism of reaction (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).The fluorescence of tryptophan residues is highly dependent on their local environment and enzyme conformation. We demonstrated here that significant changes in enzyme structure could be observed in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, affecting the tryptophan emission intensity. This suggests that Mg(II) binding may allow the enzyme to assume a conformation necessary for DNA relaxation to be catalyzed.We have previously shown that purified E. coli DNA topoisomerase I that has been dialyzed against buffer containing 0.2 mm EDTA did not contain any bound Mg(II) when analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) 1The abbreviation used is: ICP, inductively coupled plasma. 1The abbreviation used is: ICP, inductively coupled plasma. (12Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By removing or reducing the amount of EDTA in the dialysis buffer, we have now found that the enzyme could form a complex with 1–2 Mg(II) bound to each enzyme molecule in addition to the 3 Zn(II) bound to the tetracysteine motifs in the Zn(II) binding domain (12Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Mg(II) bound enzyme is active in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA without the presence of additional Mg(II) in the reaction mixture. We have also determined the amount of Mg(II) bound to each enzyme molecule at different Mg(II) concentrations in the solution after equilibrium dialysis. Correlation of enzyme activity and stoichiometry of bound Mg(II) indicated that two Mg(II) binding sites have to be occupied for the enzyme to catalyze the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA.DISCUSSIONThe type IA subfamily of type I DNA topoisomerases to whichE. coli DNA topoisomerase I belongs shares an important catalytic property with type II DNA topoisomerases in their common requirement for Mg(II) in catalysis. In contrast, the type IB subfamily enzymes (represented by human topoisomerase I and vaccinia virus topoisomerase I) do not require divalent ions in their catalytic mechanism. The results presented here showed that E. coliDNA topoisomerase I with stoichiometric amounts of bound Mg(II) could be prepared. Such enzyme preparations had the ability to catalyze the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA without additional Mg(II) present in the solution. The oligonucleotide cleavage activity was also stimulated by the bound Mg(II). This shows that Mg(II) ions could bind to sites on the enzyme in the absence of any DNA substrate. This Mg(II) coordination was sufficient for subsequent DNA relaxation to be catalyzed. While it is possible that one or more DNA phosphates may replace at least one of the original Mg(II) coordination sites, Mg(II) did not have to interact extensively with the DNA substrate for catalysis to take place in the experiment shown in Fig. 3 since the concentration of Mg(II) present in the system was orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations of DNA phosphates. As indicated by the flourescence measurements, Mg(II) binding altered the enzyme conformation.From the crystal structure of the 67-kDa domain (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), it is clear that after the single-strand of DNA bound to the active site is cleaved, the subdomains of the enzyme bound to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cleaved DNA have to physically separate from each other to allow strand passage to take place. Subsequently, another enzyme conformational change has to take place to allow the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cleaved DNA to be rejoined. The requirement of Mg(II) for at least one of these conformational changes would account for the requirement of Mg(II) in the relaxation of supercoiled DNA. Unlike the type II DNA topoisomerase mechanism, ATP hydrolysis is not required for the type IA class of enzyme to bring about the enzyme conformational changes needed (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). A second possible role for Mg(II) is for one or more of the divalent ions to position the DNA 3′OH for DNA religation after DNA strand passage has taken place. Mg(II) has been reported to be required for intermolecular rejoining of DNA molecules (11Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10931-10935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).After Mg(II) incubation and dialysis, enzyme Preparation 1 that has 1.2 Mg(II)/molecule was found to have <10% of the maximal activity if no additional Mg(II) was added to the reaction mixture. This stoichiometry of Mg(II) binding was also obtained with 200 μm Mg(II) after equilibrium dialysis. Relaxation activity assay again showed only partial activity. At 50 μm Mg(II), around 75% of the enzyme molecules should have 1 Mg(II) bound as indicated by ICP analysis after equilibrium dialysis (Table II). However, no relaxation activity was detected with 60 ng of the enzyme (Fig. 4). Therefore, it appeared that a stoichiometry of 2 Mg(II) bound to each enzyme molecule was needed for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA to take place. This conclusion was supported by the activity of Preparation 2 in the absence of additional Mg(II) (Fig. 3) as well as the stoichiometry of Mg(II) binding at 200 and 400 μm Mg(II).There are a number of conserved acidic residues in the type IA family of topoisomerases that are potential candidates for coordination sites of Mg(II) They are represented by Glu-9, Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 in the E. coli DNA topoisomerase I sequence. In the crystal structure of the 67-kDa domain of the enzyme (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), these residues are engaged in a network of hydrogen bonding interactions responsible for stabilizing the enzyme conformation observed there. In order for these acidic residues in the active site to bind 1 or more Mg(II), the enzyme has to undergo significant conformational changes. The original hydrogen bonding interactions would be replaced by interactions with Mg(II) and possibly new hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Further analysis by site-directed mutagenesis of these acidic residues would test if they do play such a role and provide further information on the enzyme mechanism. Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I is the best characterized bacterial type I DNA topoisomerases (for review, see Refs. 1Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Its major function in vivo is the removal of negative supercoils from DNA (3Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 4Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In vitro, such relaxation activity requires that Mg(II) be present in the reaction mixture (3Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 5Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 42: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When other divalent ions were tested (5Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 42: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Ca(II) could partly replace the Mg(II) in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA while the presence of other divalent ions, such as Mn(II), did not support the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by the enzyme. Moreover, the presence of 2 mm Mn(II) had an inhibitory effect when co-incubated with the enzyme and 2 mm Mg(II) (5Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 42: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggested that there are specific interactions between Mg(II) and the enzyme or enzyme·DNA complex. The three-dimensional structure of the 67-kDa N-terminal fragment ofE. coli DNA topoisomerase I has been determined by x-ray crystallography (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It was noted (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) that near the active site nucleophile Tyr-319, there are three acidic residues, Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 arranged similarly to the three acidic residues known to coordinate two divalent ions in Klenow fragment (7Beese L.S. Steiz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). According to the models proposed for DNA polymerase mechanism, these coordinated divalent ions are essential for the nucleotidyl transfer catalytic activity (8Joyce C.M. Steiz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 9Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut T. Science. 1994; 246: 1930-1935Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar) of DNA polymerases. However, divalent ions were not present in the topoisomerase I crystal structure (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is also known that Mg(II) is not required for DNA cleavage by topoisomerase and formation of the covalent protein-DNA intermediate (10Depew R.E. Liu L.F. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 511-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although Mg(II) is required for intermolecular religation to be observed (11Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10931-10935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear if Mg(II) interacts directly with the enzyme. The basis for the requirement of Mg(II) for relaxation activity needs to be elucidated to fully understand the enzyme mechanism. There are several possible roles for Mg(II) in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. For a direct role in catalysis, one or more Mg(II) bound at the active site may activate the Tyr-319 hydroxyl nucleophile and stabilize the DNA 3′OH-leaving group during the DNA strand cleavage step, and/or they may activate the DNA 3′OH as the attacking nucleophile and stabilze the Tyr-319 hydroxyl-leaving group during the DNA religation step. More indirectly, Mg(II) coordination may place the DNA phosphates and enzyme catalytic groups in the positions required for catalysis. In addition, binding of Mg(II) may allow the enzyme to undergo the conformational changes postulated to be required for the strand passage, DNA religation and substrate release steps in the proposed mechanism of reaction (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of tryptophan residues is highly dependent on their local environment and enzyme conformation. We demonstrated here that significant changes in enzyme structure could be observed in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, affecting the tryptophan emission intensity. This suggests that Mg(II) binding may allow the enzyme to assume a conformation necessary for DNA relaxation to be catalyzed. We have previously shown that purified E. coli DNA topoisomerase I that has been dialyzed against buffer containing 0.2 mm EDTA did not contain any bound Mg(II) when analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) 1The abbreviation used is: ICP, inductively coupled plasma. 1The abbreviation used is: ICP, inductively coupled plasma. (12Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By removing or reducing the amount of EDTA in the dialysis buffer, we have now found that the enzyme could form a complex with 1–2 Mg(II) bound to each enzyme molecule in addition to the 3 Zn(II) bound to the tetracysteine motifs in the Zn(II) binding domain (12Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Mg(II) bound enzyme is active in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA without the presence of additional Mg(II) in the reaction mixture. We have also determined the amount of Mg(II) bound to each enzyme molecule at different Mg(II) concentrations in the solution after equilibrium dialysis. Correlation of enzyme activity and stoichiometry of bound Mg(II) indicated that two Mg(II) binding sites have to be occupied for the enzyme to catalyze the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA. DISCUSSIONThe type IA subfamily of type I DNA topoisomerases to whichE. coli DNA topoisomerase I belongs shares an important catalytic property with type II DNA topoisomerases in their common requirement for Mg(II) in catalysis. In contrast, the type IB subfamily enzymes (represented by human topoisomerase I and vaccinia virus topoisomerase I) do not require divalent ions in their catalytic mechanism. The results presented here showed that E. coliDNA topoisomerase I with stoichiometric amounts of bound Mg(II) could be prepared. Such enzyme preparations had the ability to catalyze the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA without additional Mg(II) present in the solution. The oligonucleotide cleavage activity was also stimulated by the bound Mg(II). This shows that Mg(II) ions could bind to sites on the enzyme in the absence of any DNA substrate. This Mg(II) coordination was sufficient for subsequent DNA relaxation to be catalyzed. While it is possible that one or more DNA phosphates may replace at least one of the original Mg(II) coordination sites, Mg(II) did not have to interact extensively with the DNA substrate for catalysis to take place in the experiment shown in Fig. 3 since the concentration of Mg(II) present in the system was orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations of DNA phosphates. As indicated by the flourescence measurements, Mg(II) binding altered the enzyme conformation.From the crystal structure of the 67-kDa domain (6Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), it is clear that after the single-strand of DNA bound to the active site is cleaved, the subdomains of the enzyme bound to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cleaved DNA have to physically separate from each other to allow strand passage to take place. Subsequently, another enzyme conformational change has to take place to allow the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cleaved DNA to be rejoined. The requirement of Mg(II) for at least one of these conformational changes would account for the requirement of Mg(II) in the relaxation of supercoiled DNA. Unlike the type II DNA topoisomerase mechanism, ATP hydrolysis is not required for the type IA class of enzyme to bring about the enzyme conformational changes needed (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar).

Specificity originates in part from the sequence of this loop and also from secondary binding sites that contribute to the inhibitor function. To clarify the intrinsic contribution of the reactive-site loop, α1-antichymotrypsin has been utilized as a scaffold to construct chimeras carrying the loop of antithrombin III, protease nexin 1, or α1-antitrypsin. Reactive-site loops not only vary in sequence but also in length; therefore, the length of the reactive-site loop was also varied in the chimeras. The efficacy of the specificity transfer was evaluated by measuring the stoichiometry of the reaction, the ability to form an SDS-stable complex, and the association rate constant with a number of potential targets (chymotrypsin, neutrophil elastase, trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa, activated protein C, and urokinase). Overall, substitution of a reactive-site loop was not sufficient to transfer the specificity of a given serpin to α1-antichymotrypsin. Specificity of the chimera partly matched that of the loop donor and partly that of the acceptor, whereas the behavior as an inhibitor or a substrate depended upon the targeted protease. Results suggest that, aside from the contributions of the loop sequence and the framework-specific secondary binding sites, an intramolecular control may be essential for productive interaction.

To document further the role of the reactive site loop in controlling the specificity, we have prepared and characterized various chimeras, using ACT as a framework to carry the loop of other serpins with overlapping specificities. Results suggest that, in addition to the sequence of the reactive site loop, the specificity of serpins originates from secondary binding sites and conformational constraints. Human activated protein C was a generous gift from Drs. J. Stenflo and A. Öhlin (University of Lund, Malmö, Sweden). Human leukocyte elastase (elastase) was from Athens Inc. (Athens, GA). Bovine pancreatic trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) and bovine chymotrypsin (1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated) were purchased from Worthington (Lorne Laboratories, Twyford, UK), and human urokinase (low molecular weight) was from Calbiochem (Novobiochem, Nottingham, UK). Human thrombin and bovine factor Xa were prepared as described previously (26Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 27Le Bonniec B.F.

Reactive-site loops were exchanged by cassette mutagenesis using the expression vector pACT generously given by Dr. H. Rubin (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), in which two restriction sites (KpnI and MluI) had been engineered within the ACT coding sequence. The engineered KpnI site, between the codon for the P9 and P10 residues, results in the replacement of the alanines of wild-type ACT with glycine and threonine; the MluI site, between the codons for the P10′ and P11′ residues, exchanges the P10′ valine to threonine (28Rubin H.

To express chimeras ACT/ATIII, ACT/αAT, ACT/αAT(P1=Arg) and ACT/PN1 (TableI), oligonucleotides flanked by the appropriate restriction sites and encoding the reactive-site loops of antithrombin III (5′-C-ACT-GCT-GTT-GTA-ATC-GCT-GGT-CGT-TCT-CTG-AAC-CCG-AAC-CGT-GTT-ACC-A-3′ and 3′-CA-TGG-TGA-CGA-CAA-CAT-TAG-CGA-CCA-GCA-AGA-GAC-TTG-GGC-TTG-GCA-CAA-TGG-TGC-GC-5′), of α1-antitrypsin (5′-C-ATG-TTC-CTG-GAA-GCT-ATC-CCG-ATG-AGC-ATC-CCG-CCA-GAA-A-3′ and 3′-CA-TGG-TAC-AAG-GAC-CTT-CGA-TAG-GGC-TAC-TCG-TAG-GGC-GGT-CTT-TGC-GC-5′), of α1-antitrypsin(P1=Arg) (same as above with the second ATG codon replaced by CGT), or of protease nexin 1 (5′-C-ACA-ACT-GCA-ATT-CTC-ATT-GCA-AGA-TCA-TCG-CCT-CCC-TGG-A-3′ and 3′-CA-TGG-TGT-TGA-CGT-TAA-GAG-TAA-CGT-TCT-AGT-AGC-GGA-GGG-ACC-TGC-GC-5′) were ligated in pACT by standard techniques (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chimera ACT(des-TIVR), in which the reactive-site loop of ACT was shortened by four residues (Thr366, Ile367, Val368, and Arg369), was prepared by removing the corresponding codons from pACT and reconstruction of anMluI site between the codons for the P6′ and P7′ residues. Briefly, pACT was used as a template, with oligonucleotides 5′-GAC-CCC-CAA-GAT-ACT-CAT-CAG-3′ and 3′-A-AAC-CAA-CTT-TGC-GCA-TGG-TAG-CAT-GC-5′ as forward/reverse primers in a first polymerase chain reaction, and oligonucleotides 5′-T-TTG-GTT-GAA-ACG-CGT-ACC-ATC-GTA-CG-3′ and 3′-CGG-AAG-TTG-GGT-CAG-TCG-AGG-AAG-5′ as forward/reverse primers in a second polymerase chain reaction. The resulting fragments (517 and 624 base pairs) were digested with MluI, ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and utilized as template for a third amplification, using as primers the forward of the first and the reverse of the second polymerase chain reactions. The resulting 1124-base pair fragment was cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Abingdon, UK), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The pACT(des-TIVR) expression vector with a “short” reactive-site loop was prepared by exchanging the KpnI/SphI fragment of pACT for the corresponding 618-base pair KpnI/SphI fragment of pCRII. The resulting expression vector pACT(des-TIVR) was used for preparation of ACT(des-TIVR) and to construct, by cassette mutagenesis, the expression vectors for ACT/αAT(des-TIVR), ACT/αAT(P1=Arg; des-TIVR), and ACT/PN1(des-TIVR). Recombinants ACT variants were purified in mg quantities by a combination of anion-exchange and DNA-cellulose chromatography, as described previously (30Djie M.Z. Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C.R.

Kinetics were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2% poly(ethylene glycol) M r 6000, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (protease-free, Sigma). Assays with activated protein C contained in addition 5 mm CaCl2. The chromogenic substrates S-2222 (benzyl-CO-Ile-Glu-(γ-OR)-Gly-Arg-pNA, where R is H or CH3, and pNA indicatesp-nitroanilide) was used with factor Xa (K m = 547 μm). S-2238 (H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA) (Pip indicatesl-pipecolyl) was used with thrombin and activated protein C (K m = 3.6 and 315 μm, respectively), as well as S-2266 (H-d-Val-Leu-Arg-pNA;K m = 486 and 221 μm, respectively). S-2288 (H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA) and S-2302 (H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA) were used with trypsin (K m = 19 and 134 μm, respectively). S-2444 (<Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA) was used with urokinase (K m = 90 μm). The above peptidyl-pNA substrates were purchased from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA was used with chymotrypsin (K m = 53 μm), and N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA was used with elastase (K m = 121 μm); both were purchased from Sigma. Substrate concentrations were determined from their absorbance at 342 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 8270 cm−1 (32Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Blinder M. Binder E.P. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Choice of the pNA substrate depended whether competition between hydrolysis and inhibition was desired; substrates with low K m values were used to increase the apparent half-life of complex formation, and those with high K m values were used to minimize competition. Stoichiometry of inhibition (SI, i.e. the number of moles of serpin required to inhibit 1 mol of protease) was determined as described previously (30Djie M.Z. Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C.R. Hipler K. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (2nd Ed.): 11461-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), using chymotrypsin and elastase for the chimeras having a P1 leucine or methionine and using trypsin and thrombin for the chimeras having a P1 arginine. The ability of the chimeras to form SDS-stable complexes was examined by incubating the variant (2 μm) with the protease (1 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol)M r 6000 for 30 min at room temperature. The sample was denatured at 65 °C for 10 min in 0.37 mTris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 1% SDS (w/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (gradient 10–20% acrylamide). The overall association rate constant for the formation of a protease-serpin complex (k on) was estimated by analysis of data from progress curve kinetics completed with a large excess of serpin (6 concentrations, between 0.32 and 10 μm) over the enzyme (a single concentration between 0.01 and 1 nm, depending upon the protease). Inhibition reactions were followed for up to 3 h using a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer, but only data corresponding to less than 10% substrate hydrolysis were analyzed. Reactions were initiated by addition of the enzyme at a concentration such that the velocity in the absence of inhibitor was about 0.2 μm min−1 with the appropriate peptidyl-substrate (100 μm). Data were analyzed according to the equation for slow binding inhibition to yield estimates fork on as described previously (30Djie M.Z. Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C.R. Hipler K. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (2nd Ed.): 11461-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have constructed ACT chimeras in which the length of the reactive-site loop corresponds to that of either the donor or acceptor (ACT/αAT and ACT/PN1 carrying long reactive-site loop, as well as ACT/αAT(des-TIVR) and ACT/PN1(des-TIVR)carrying shorter loop); because the reactive-site loop of antithrombin III is only one amino acid shorter than that of ACT, only the ACT/ATIII chimera was constructed (Table I). The selectivity and effectiveness of each chimera toward a number of possible targets were evaluated using three criteria: SI value, ability to form an SDS-stable complex, and k on value. Chimeras with proline in P2 and arginine in P1exhibited SI values higher than 150 with trypsin and lower than 10 with thrombin (Table I). This is consistent with our observation (30Djie M.Z. Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C.R. Hipler K. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (2nd Ed.): 11461-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that replacement of the P2 leucine of ACT(P1=Arg)with proline causes a dramatic increase of the SI value with trypsin but not with thrombin. When P1 was either methionine or leucine, SI values were higher than 60 with elastase and lower than 3 with chymotrypsin (regardless of the P2 residue). When the loop of the ACT/αAT chimeras was shorter, SI values were higher for chymotrypsin, trypsin, and thrombin inhibition; the opposite was true for elastase. In contrast, the length of loop did not change the SI value with the ACT/PN1 chimeras. Thus SI value depended upon the sequence and the length of the reactive-site loop, as well as upon the target considered. Attempts to detect SDS-stable complex formation followed incubation of a slight excess of serpin with μm quantities of the potential target (i.e. in conditions where cleavage reaction occurs substantially). Three patterns were observed (Fig.1) as follows: 1) the formation of SDS-stable complex, but the presence of intermediate size fragments attributable to their degradation by remaining (active) protease (38Stavridi E.S. O'Malley K. Lukacs C.M. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. Christianson D.W. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10608-10615Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); 2) absence of detectable complex, but accumulation of material migrating as ACT having the reactive-site loop cleaved; and 3) absence of detectable reaction (neither complex formation nor cleavage). Chimeras with leucine or methionine in P1 position all formed an SDS-stable complex with chymotrypsin (pattern 1), whereas consistent with the high SI value, chimeras were mainly cleaved following incubation with elastase (pattern 2). Chimeras having arginine in P1 position exhibited pattern 1 with thrombin, whereas the pattern was either 1 or 2 following incubation with trypsin (again, consistent with the high SI value, pattern was 2 with proline in P2, and pattern 1 was otherwise). Regardless of the chimera, there was no clear evidence of SDS-stable complex formation nor of cleavage reaction with factor Xa, activated protein C, and urokinase; the predominant bands were those of the intact proteins (pattern 3). Finally, ACT/ATIII exhibited a mixed pattern. Thus, with the exception of trypsin, the pattern was specific for the target rather than for the chimera. Under the conditions of the slow binding assays (low enzyme concentration and very large excess of serpin), depletion of the inhibitor by the cleavage reaction becomes negligible, as the total amount of cleaved inhibitor depends on the absolute amount of enzyme (30Djie M.Z. Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C.R. Hipler K. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (2nd Ed.): 11461-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 35Stone S.R. Hermans J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The k on values obtained (TableII) did not reveal a clear relationship between the nature of the reactive-site loop and the specificity or function of the chimera, but in two instances only, the k onvalues were higher when length of the reactive-site loop was shorter than that of ACT. Substitution of the reactive-site loop of ACT with that of antithrombin III transposed quite effectively the specificity of antithrombin III to ACT (TableII). ACT/ATIII exhibited k on values within 10-fold those of antithrombin III for trypsin, thrombin, and factor Xa inhibition, whereas k on values were lower than 10 m−1 s−1 with activated protein C and urokinase. Thus, ACT/ATIII exhibited a selectivity resembling that of antithrombin III. However, this apparent success must be tempered by the observation that simple substitution of the P1 leucine with arginine largely accounts for the inhibitory properties of ACT/ATIII with trypsin or thrombin, whereas further substitution of the P2 leucine with glycine is sufficient to mimic antithrombin III with every protease (30Djie M.Z. Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C.R. Hipler K. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (2nd Ed.): 11461-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of the whole reactive-site loop did not alter the selectivity of the ACT mutant having the P1 and P2 residues of antithrombin III. Except for factor Xa inhibition, introducing the reactive-site loop of protease nexin 1 into ACT did not result in an appropriate transfer of specificity (TableII). Failure was most evident with urokinase;k on values were at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than with protease nexin 1. In fact, regardless of the reactive-site loop, none of the ACT variants neutralized urokinase. The lack of urokinase inhibition was due to an absence of reaction rather than to the ACT variants acting as substrates; no cleavage reaction was detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thek on values for thrombin inhibition were also dramatically lower than with the loop donor (875- and 5000-fold with ACT/PN1 and ACT/PN1(des-TIVR), respectively), and activated protein C inhibition was hardly detectable. However, the reactive-site loop of protease nexin 1 was functional in the context of the ACT framework. Less than 5-fold separated the k onvalues of factor Xa inhibition by protease nexin 1 and ACT/PN1 and less than 27-fold separated those for trypsin inhibition. Factor Xa was also a remarkable exception, because shortening the loop increased the inhibitory act"
https://openalex.org/W2124271298,"Molecular cloning has identified two vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs), one expressed in non-neural cells of the periphery (VMAT1) and the other by multiple monoamine cell populations in the brain (VMAT2). Functional analysis has previously shown that VMAT2 has a higher affinity than VMAT1 for monoamine neurotransmitters as well as the inhibitor tetrabenazine. The analysis of chimeric transporters has also identified two major regions required for the high affinity interactions of VMAT2 with these ligands. We have now used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the individual residues responsible for these differences. Focusing on the region that spans transmembrane domains 9 through 12, we have replaced VMAT2 residues with the corresponding residues from VMAT1. Many residues in this region had no effect on the recognition of these ligands, but substitution of Tyr-434 with Phe and Asp-461 with Asn reduced the affinity for tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin. Although the ability to affect recognition of multiple ligands suggests a general structural role for these residues, the mutations did not affect dopamine recognition, indicating a more specific role, possibly in recognition of the ring nitrogen that occurs in tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin but not dopamine. The mutation K446Q reduced the affinity of VMAT2 for tetrabenazine and serotonin but not histamine, whereas F464Y reduced serotonin affinity and perhaps histamine recognition but not tetrabenazine sensitivity, providing more evidence for specificity. Interestingly, theV max of both VMATs for dopamine exceeded that for serotonin by 3–5-fold, indicating a difference in the speed of packaging of these two neurotransmitters. We also found that VMAT1 has a higher affinity for tryptamine than VMAT2. This mutually exclusive interaction with serotonin and tryptamine also suggests a physiological rationale for the existence of two VMATs. Surprisingly, the residue responsible for this difference, Tyr-434, also accounts for the higher affinity interaction of VMAT2 with tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin. Interestingly, replacement of Tyr-434 with alanine increases the affinity of VMAT2 for both serotonin and dopamine and reduces the rate of dopamine transport.

Previous studies have identified several distinct vesicular transport activities that use a proton electrochemical gradient as the driving force for active transport (1Edwards R.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In the case of monoamines, the activity involves exchange of two lumenal protons for one cytoplasmic monoamine and generates large concentration gradients of 104–105 (3Knoth J. Zallakian M. Njus D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6625-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4Johnson R.G. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 232-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The inhibitors reserpine and tetrabenazine have helped to elucidate the mechanism of active transport as well as its biological role. Monoamines compete with reserpine for binding to the vesicular transporters, suggesting that reserpine binds at the site of substrate recognition (5Weaver J.H. Deupree J.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 80: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Schuldiner S. Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 29-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, monoamines inhibit tetrabenazine binding very poorly, suggesting that this drug binds elsewhere (7Darchen F. Scherman E. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The presence of the driving force, ΔpH, stimulates reserpine binding but not tetrabenazine binding, further suggesting that the two drugs interact at different sites (8Scherman D. Henry J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). However, tetrabenazine can inhibit reserpine binding, raising the possibility of interaction between the two sites (7Darchen F. Scherman E.

Plasma membrane transport involves cotransport of Na+ rather than proton exchange, and in the case of monoamines transport is inhibited by cocaine and antidepressants rather than reserpine and tetrabenazine (9Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 10Kanner B.I. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 237-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the plasma membrane transport of monoamines involves distinct transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (9Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). In contrast, a single activity appears to mediate vesicular monoamine transport by all monoamine populations in the brain (11Scherman D. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, vesicular monoamine transport has a broad substrate specificity. In addition, vesicular monoamine transport recognizes toxins as substrates.Selection of transfected cells using the neurotoxin MPP+has led to the identification of a novel gene family that includes two vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) 1The abbreviations used are: VMAT(s), vesicular monoamine transporter(s); TMD, transmembrane domain(s). 1The abbreviations used are: VMAT(s), vesicular monoamine transporter(s); TMD, transmembrane domain(s).(12Liu Y.

The VMATs apparently sequester the toxin inside secretory vesicles and hence protect against its toxicity to mitochondria, further implicating the VMATs in neural degeneration. In rat, VMAT1 occurs in the adrenal medulla, whereas VMAT2 occurs in multiple monoamine populations of the central nervous system and sympathetic ganglia as well as mast cells and other histamine-containing cells in the gut (15Peter D. Liu Y. Sternini C. de Giorgio R. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6179-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 16Weihe E. Schafer M.K. Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Functional analysis showed that the two VMATs also differ in substrate recognition and inhibition by drugs. VMAT2 has a higher apparent affinity for monoamine substrates than VMAT1 and transports histamine, whereas VMAT1 does not transport histamine (17Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Merickel A. Edwards R.H. Neuropharmacol. 1995; 34: 1543-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although reserpine inhibits both VMATs, tetrabenazine potently inhibits VMAT2 but not VMAT1, raising the possibility that histamine and tetrabenazine interact at the same site, distinct from the site for recognition of other substrates and reserpine (17Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Erickson J.D. Schafer M.K.H. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar).To determine the structural basis for recognition of monoamine substrates and sensitivity to drugs, we have previously taken advantage of the high sequence similarity between the two VMATs and constructed a series of chimeric proteins that retain transport function. The analysis of these chimeras identified multiple regions that confer differences between VMAT1 and VMAT2 in affinity for substrates and sensitivity to tetrabenazine (20Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the high affinity interactions with serotonin, histamine, and tetrabenazine characteristic of VMAT2 all appear to require the simultaneous presence of two major regions from VMAT2, one spanning transmembrane domains 5 through 8 (TMD5–8) and the other TMD9–12. This was surprising in light of previous work suggesting that histamine and tetrabenazine interact at a site distinct from serotonin. However, several other regions affect serotonin affinity but not histamine or tetrabenazine affinity, presumably accounting for the difference observed between serotonin recognition and recognition of both histamine and tetrabenazine.The identification of two major regions both required for the interactions with serotonin, histamine, and tetrabenazine suggested that individual residues may interact with multiple ligands. In the present study, we have focused on the region encompassing TMD9–12. Introducing mutations that convert the VMAT2 sequence to VMAT1, we have identified specific residues that influence the interaction with serotonin, histamine, and tetrabenazine. In combination, they account for essentially all of the functional differences between the two VMATs attributed to TMD9–12. Although several residues influence the interaction with multiple ligands, others affect only specific interactions. Three residues identified in this way account for the higher affinity of VMAT2 for serotonin than dopamine. We have also found that VMAT1 interacts at higher affinity with tryptamine than VMAT2, and the residue responsible for this difference contributes to the higher affinity of VMAT2 for serotonin. This mutually exclusive recognition of two ligands supports the direct nature of the interaction and suggests a physiological rationale for the existence of two VMATs.RESULTSAnalysis of chimeric transporters identified two major regions of VMAT2 responsible for its high affinity interactions with serotonin, histamine, and tetrabenazine (20Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One region extends from TMD5 to the beginning of TMD8 and the other from the end of TMD9 through TMD12. Inclusion of TMD5–8 from VMAT2 in a series of chimeras with VMAT1 at the NH2 terminus and VMAT2 at the COOH terminus (VMAT1-VMAT2 series) was required for the high affinity interactions characteristic of VMAT2. In the series of chimeras with VMAT2 at the NH2 terminus and VMAT1 at the COOH terminus (VMAT2-VMAT1 series), however, TMD5–8 of VMAT2 did not suffice to confer the high affinity interactions. In this series, inclusion of TMD9–12 of VMAT2 was required for these interactions. Thus, TMD5–8 of VMAT2 appears to require COOH-terminal VMAT2 sequences, presumably TMD9–12, for the high affinity interactions and TMD9–12 appears to require NH2-terminal VMAT2 sequences, presumably TMD5–8. To determine if specific residues account for the high affinity of VMAT2 relative to VMAT1, we have focused on TMD9–12 since this region contains the smallest number of divergent residues between VMAT1 and VMAT2. In addition, we have introduced the VMAT1 residues into VMAT2 rather than vice versa because the chimeric analysis indicates that a single change in TMD9–12 should suffice to reduce the affinity of VMAT2 interactions, whereas multiple replacements in both TMD5–8 and TMD9–12 would be required to increase the affinity of VMAT1. Of the 23 residues in TMD9–12 which differ between VMAT1 and VMAT2, we have focused on 10 of the most nonconservative differences (Fig. 1).Table IIndividual residues in TMD9–12 influence recognition of tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotoninTetrabenazine IC50Histamine IC50SerotoninK mμmμmμmVMAT14.17 ± 0.56**378 ± 30**0.59 ± 0.12*VMAT20.46 ± 0.0942 ± 150.29 ± 0.01Y383F0.60 ± 0.1952 ± 140.29 ± 0.05V416T0.64 ± 0.1953 ± 90.26 ± 0.04Y434F0.82 ± 0.11*122 ± 25**0.38 ± 0.02**A440T0.30 ± 0.0762 ± 120.17 ± 0.02**K446Q0.85 ± 0.09**48 ± 110.34 ± 0.04T455V0.38 ± 0.0645 ± 90.24 ± 0.04I459T0.39 ± 0.0355 ± 50.20 ± 0.01**D461N0.78 ± 0.2762 ± 240.37 ± 0.03*F464Y0.50 ± 0.0659 ± 150.45 ± 0.09*F469C0.40 ± 0.0352 ± 100.29 ± 0.03Y434F/K446Q0.87 ± 0.31145 ± 21**0.41 ± 0.15Y434F/D461N1.58 ± 0.32**193 ± 48**0.36 ± 0.08K446Q/D461N0.96 ± 0.09**70 ± 310.26 ± 0.06Y434F/K446Q/D461N2.39 ± 0.16**159 ± 9**0.67 ± 0.12**Y434A11.78 ± 0.40**238 ± 59**0.07 ± 0.02**S372C3.36 ± 0.97130 ± 511-aRef. 20.1.10 ± 0.401-aRef. 20.S468C0.41 ± 0.0126 ± 21-aRef. 20.0.17 ± 0.041-aRef. 20.Membranes were prepared from COS1 cells transfected with the cDNAs indicated and incubated at 29 °C for 1 min in [3H]serotonin.

Open table in a new tab Tetrabenazine SensitivityPrevious work has shown that the sensitivity of VMAT2 to tetrabenazine is 10-fold greater than VMAT1 (17Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Focusing on the contribution of TMD9–12 to the greater sensitivity of VMAT2, we have replaced residues in VMAT2 with the corresponding residues from VMAT1. Substitution of Tyr-383 with Phe (Y383F), Val-416 with Thr (V416T), Thr-455 with Val (T455V), Ile-459 with Thr (I459T), Phe 464 with Tyr (F464Y), and Phe 469 with Cys (F469C) did not significantly change tetrabenazine sensitivity as measured by the IC50 for inhibition of serotonin transport (Table I). However, replacement of Tyr-434 with Phe (Y434F) and Lys-446 with Gln (K446Q) significantly reduced tetrabenazine sensitivity and substitution of Asp-461 with Asn (D461N) appeared to reduce tetrabenazine sensitivity.Since the introduction of multiple VMAT1 residues into VMAT2 reduced tetrabenazine sensitivity and none of these alone accounted for all of the differences between VMAT1 and VMAT2 attributed to TMD9–12, double and triple mutants were constructed and analyzed, focusing on the three most influential residues. Table I shows that the combination of Y434F and K446Q (Y434F/K446Q) did not reduce the sensitivity more than the individual mutation of these residues. However, the combination of Y434F with D461N (Y434F/D461N) and K446Q with D461N (K446Q/D461N) significantly reduced tetrabenazine sensitivity to a greater extent than any single mutation (p < 0.05), supporting a role for Asp-461 suggested by analysis of D461N alone. Further, the combination of all three mutations reduced tetrabenazine sensitivity to an extent significantly greater than any of the double mutants (p < 0.05). Thus, these residues influence tetrabenazine sensitivity in an additive manner, suggesting that Tyr-434, Lys-446, and Asp-461 of VMAT2 interact independently with the inhibitor or, alternatively, help to stabilize a conformation that binds the inhibitor. In addition, these three residues together account for all of the increased tetrabenazine sensitivity of VMAT2 attributed to TMD9–12 by the analysis of VMAT2-VMAT1 chimeras (Table I) (20Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Histamine RecognitionThe potent ability of tetrabenazine but not reserpine to inhibit histamine transport suggests that tetrabenazine and histamine may interact with VMAT2 in a similar way, distinct from that of reserpine and other monoamine substrates (18Merickel A. Edwards R.H. Neuropharmacol. 1995; 34: 1543-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, VMAT2 has a higher affinity than VMAT1 for both tetrabenazine and histamine, suggesting that structural differences between the two transporters could allow for a common binding site for histamine and tetrabenazine (17Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of chimeric transporters indicated that the same regions of VMAT2 are responsible for the high affinity interactions of the transporter with both tetrabenazine and histamine (20Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similar to the analysis of tetrabenazine sensitivity, the Y383F, V416T, T455V, I459T, and F469C mutations had no effect on the ability of histamine to inhibit transport of serotonin by VMAT2 (Table I). Of the three mutations found to influence tetrabenazine sensitivity (Y434F, K446Q, and D461N), only the Y434F mutation significantly reduced histamine recognition. Mutations D461N, A440T, and F464Y appeared to reduce histamine recognition, although to a lesser extent than Y434F, and K446Q had no effect. Indeed, the combination of K446Q with either Y434F (Y434F/K446Q) or D461N (K446Q/D461N) caused no further reduction in histamine recognition from Y434F or D461N alone. Similarly, combination of K446Q with both Y434F and D461N (Y434F/K446Q/D461N) caused no further reduction in histamine recognition from Y434F/D461N alone. In contrast, the addition of Y434F to D461N in Y434F/D461N and to K446Q/D461N in the triple mutant reduced histamine recognition. The addition of D461N to K446Q in K446Q/D461N, to Y434F in Y434F/D461N and to Y434F/K446Q in the triple mutant tended to reduce sensitivity to histamine, but the results did not reach statistical significance. Thus, Tyr-434 and to a lesser extent Asp-461 but not Lys-446 appear to contribute to histamine recognition. Replacement of both Tyr-434 and Asp-461 of VMAT2 with the corresponding VMAT1 residues also accounts for all of the difference in histamine recognition attributed to TMD9–12 by the analysis of VMAT2-VMAT1 chimeras (Table I) (20Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).To confirm our results using histamine to inhibit [3H]serotonin transport, we have also measured the transport of [3H]histamine. Fig. 2 shows that VMAT2 but not VMAT1 transports histamine. The Y434F/K446Q/D461N triple mutant in VMAT2 remained able to transport histamine but at a level significantly reduced from VMAT2. Thus, the same residues involved in the inhibition of serotonin transport by histamine, Tyr-434 and Asp-461, also contribute to histamine transport.Figure 2Transport of [3H]histamine by VMAT1, VMAT2, and the triple VMAT2 mutant Y434F/K446Q/D461N.Membranes were prepared from COS1 cells transfected with the cDNAs indicated and incubated at 29 °C in [3H]histamine for the times indicated. The reaction was terminated by dilution followed by filtration, and the bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Uptake for zero time at 0 °C was subtracted as background. The amount of total protein used was measured using the Bradford assay. The results show increasing accumulation of [3H]histamine with time for VMAT2 and no accumulation for VMAT1. The triple mutant Y434F/K446Q/D461N accumulates [3H]histamine but substantially less than that of VMAT2. The 5-, 10-, and 30-min time points show a significant difference in the transport of [3H]histamine between VMAT2 and the triple mutant (p < 0.01). The values are derived from three separate experiments and expressed as means ± S.D. using the unpaired two-tailed t test to assess the significance of the comparisons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Affinity for SerotoninPrevious work had suggested that histamine and tetrabenazine might interact at a site distinct from serotonin and reserpine (7Darchen F.

However, the analysis of chimeric transporters indicated that the same region (TMD9–12) contributes to the high affinity interactions of VMAT2 with tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin (20Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine if the same residues that influence tetrabenazine and histamine recognition also influence serotonin affinity, we have measured the K m for serotonin. Similar to the results for tetrabenazine sensitivity and histamine recognition, the Y383F, V416T, T455V, and F469C mutations each had no effect on serotonin affinity (Table I). Of the two mutations that influence tetrabenazine and histamine recognition, Y434F and D461N, both significantly reduced serotonin affinity. The K446Q mutation, which influences tetrabenazine but not histamine recognition, tended to reduce serotonin affinity although to a lesser extent. However, analysis of Y434F/K446Q/D461N confirmed the role of Lys-446 in serotonin recognition because this triple mutant had a significantly lower affinity than the Y434F/D461N double mutant (p < 0.01). Therefore, the same three residues that influence tetrabenazine sensitivity, Tyr-434, Lys-446, and Asp-461, also influence serotonin affinity. Interestingly, the F464Y mutation, which had no effect on tetrabenazine sensitivity but may influence histamine recognition, significantly reduced serotonin affinity. In addition, the A440T and I459T mutations significantly increased serotonin affinity. Thus, serotonin appears to interact with more sites on VMAT2 than the lower affinity substrate histamine or the inhibitor tetrabenazine. To determine if Tyr-434, Lys-446, and Asp-461 contribute independently to the high affinity interaction of VMAT2 with serotonin, we also examined double and triple mutants. Although Y434F/K446Q, Y434F/D461N, and K446Q/D461N did not show a lower affinity than the single mutations, the triple mutant Y434F/K446Q/D461N did show significantly reduced affinity compared with these double mutants (p < 0.05), suggesting that each of the three residues interacts independently with serotonin.Structurally Related LigandsTo identify features of the ligands whose recognition is influenced by Tyr-434, Lys-446, and Asp-461, we have compared the interactions of VMAT2 mutants with structurally related compounds. Tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin all have a nitrogen within a ring structure (Fig. 3). Since Tyr-434 and Asp-461 both influence the interaction with all three of these ligands, we examined the effect of mutations at these sites on transport of dopamine that lacks a ring nitrogen. Indeed, Y434F and D461N did not affect the apparent affinity of VMAT2 for dopamine either individually or in combination (Table II), consistent with the influence of Tyr-434 and Asp-461 on recognition of the ring nitrogen in tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin.Figure 3Structure of substrates and inhibitors of vesicular monoamine transport.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIRecognition of dopamine and tryptamine by wild-type and mutant VMATsDopamine K mTryptamine IC50μmμmVMAT13.43 ± 1.34*0.40 ± 0.05*VMAT20.95 ± 0.562.19 ± 0.94Y434F0.86 ± 0.090.35 ± 0.09*K446Q0.94 ± 0.251.59 ± 0.42D461N1.15 ± 0.221.94 ± 0.63Y434F/K446Q/D461N0.99 ± 0.280.43 ± 0.02*Y434A0.16 ± 0.020.23 ± 0.10*Membranes were prepared from transfected COS1 cells, transport was assayed, and the results displayed as described in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Lys-446 influences tetrabenazine sensitivity and serotonin affinity but not recognition of histamine. Since tetrabenazine and serotonin both have oxygen-containing groups (a methoxy and a carbonyl group in tetrabenazine and an hydroxyl group in serotonin), we examined the effects of the K446Q mutation on the interaction with dopamine, which has two hydroxyl groups (Fig. 3). However, K446Q did not influence dopamine affinity (Table II), suggesting that Lys-446 does not influence the interaction with oxygen-containing groups.Since tryptamine has no oxygen-containing groups, we also examined the interaction of VMAT2 mutants with this ligand. Surprisingly, tryptamine inhibited serotonin transport by VMAT1 much more potently than by VMAT2 (Table II). As such, tryptamine is the first monoamine demonstrated to interact at substantially higher affinity with VMAT1 than with VMAT2. However, the K446Q mutation did not affect tryptamine recognition. Rather, the Y434F mutation significantly increased tryptamine recognition by VMAT2 to the level of wild-type VMAT1. Further, the Y434F/K446Q/D461N triple mutation increased tryptamine recognition to the same extent as Y434F alone, confirming that Y434F accounts for all of the difference observed between VMAT1 and VMAT2. Thus, the same residue responsible for the high affinity interactions of VMAT2 with tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin also accounts for its low affinity interaction with tryptamine.To determine whether VMAT2 specifically requires the hydroxyl group at the 5 position of serotonin for high affinity recognition, we have examined the inhibition of VMAT2 by 5-methyltryptamine (TableIII). 5-Methyltryptamine inhibits both VMAT1 and 2 with a potency similar to unsubstituted tryptamine, strongly suggesting that the simple presence of any substituent at the 5 position does not confer the properties of the native ligand serotonin. Rather, the higher affinity interaction of serotonin with VMAT2 appears to derive specifically from the presence of a hydroxyl group. Interestingly, methyl substitution at the 7 position increases the affinity of tryptamine for both VMAT1 and 2 (Table III), possibly by promoting hydrophobic interactions with the transport protein.Table IIIRecognition of tryptamine derivates by wild-type and mutant VMATsIC505-Methyltryptamine7-MethyltryptamineN-MethyltryptamineμmμmμmVMAT10.48 ± 0.13**0.14 ± 0.03**0.09 ± 0.04**VMAT23.75 ± 0.510.32 ± 0.020.50 ± 0.14Y434F0.61 ± 0.16**0.19 ± 0.03**0.18 ± 0.08*Y434A0.53 ± 0.09**0.08 ±"

Portner A. Virology. 1990; 174: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Ryan K.W. Morgan E.M. Portner A. Virology. 1991; 180: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the L-binding region of P (412–478) lies between the two NP-binding domains (7Smallwood S. Ryan K.W. Moyer S.A. Virology. 1994; 202: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of the P protein contains most of the sites phosphorylated by a cellular kinase (8Deshpande K.L. Portner A. Virology. 1985; 140: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Vidal S. Curran J. Orvell C. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2200-2203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and acidic domains therein seem to be required for RNA synthesis (10Curran J. Pepet T. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1994; 202: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since the P protein appears to have several functions in the life cycle of negative strand RNA viruses, numerous studies have investigated the role of phosphorylation by cellular kinase in the regulation of P protein activities and in the formation of active transcription and replication complexes. P protein phosphorylation by casein kinase II has been demonstrated in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (11Barik S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6570-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Barik S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respiratory syncytial virus (13Mazumder B.

Furthermore, mutational analysis and biochemical transcription reconstitution in vitro have led to the conclusion that transcriptional activity is dependent on casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation of P proteins for both VSV (11Barik S.

Dupuy L.C. Virology. 1995; 213: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, it seems that phosphorylation in VSV is essential for oligomerization of the P protein leading to its binding to the L protein and the NP-RNA template (20Das T. Gupta A.K. Sims P.W.

Recent data suggest that phosphorylation occurs within the N-terminal acidic domain of the P protein of VSV (New Jersey serotype) which causes a major structural change of the protein leading to its activation (20Das T. Gupta A.K. Sims P.W. Gelfond C.A. Jentoft J.E. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24100-24107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) P protein is phosphorylated by a different cellular kinase, protein kinase C (PKC) ζ isoform (24De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and PKC ζ activity is required for viral replication in vivo. Here we have investigated the cellular kinase activity responsible for phosphorylation of the P protein of Sendai virus, a prototypic mouse parainfluenzavirus belonging to the paramyxovirus family. UsingEscherichia coli-expressed Sendai virus P protein in an unphosphorylated (P0) form as substrate, we fractionated cellular protein kinase activities competent for phosphorylating P0 in vitro. The major activity was identified as PKC ζ by biochemical and immunological assay. We further observed that PKC ζ was packaged into Sendai virion and remains tightly associated with the viral RNP. By inhibiting PKC ζ activity in vivo by a specific inhibitory peptide, the production of progeny Sendai virions was dramatically reduced indicating a critical role for PKC ζ in the life cycle of the virus. Phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglycerol (DAG) were supplied by Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. Recombinant PKC α, η, and ζ were expressed in baculovirus and obtained from Walter Kolch. Peptides A (RKGALRQKN) and Z (RRGARRWRK) were from Quality Controlled Biochemicals. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig, proteinase K, and RNasin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Anti-PKC α, β, δ, ε, γ, and ζ antibodies were from Life Technologies, Inc. Reticulocyte lysate was from Promega. Sendai virus RNP was isolated from virion by treatment with an equal volume of 2 × buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.8m NaCl, 3.7% Triton X-100, 1.6 mm DTT) at room temperature for 10 min, then centrifuged through 30% glycerol onto a 100% glycerol cushion for 2 h at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. RNP from the 30/100% interface was treated with extraction buffer (0.5% SDS, 10 μg/ml proteinase K, 0.1m NaCl, and 2 units RNasin) for 20 min at 37 °C, and genomic RNA isolated by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. A cDNA clone of the P gene was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the primer 5′-TGGATCAAGATGCCTTCATTCTTA for first strand synthesis and the primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGATGGTTGGTCAGTGACTCTATGTC for second strand synthesis. The latter primer adds a heptahistidine tag at the C terminus of the Sendai P protein. The PCR product was cut by restriction endonucleases NdeI and BamHI, then ligated into the pET-17b vector (Novagen). The P gene sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Bacterially expressed P protein, which was present in the unphosphorylated form (P0), was purified using a Ni2+ affinity column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). CV-1 cells (∼2 × 108) were lysed by freezing and thawing in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mmNaCl. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant further clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h onto a cushion of 30% glycerol in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT. The supernatant (S100) was then dialyzed overnight against buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl), then loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (5 ml) equilibrated with buffer A, followed by washing with 5 bed volumes of buffer A. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A and fractions collected. Active fractions which phosphorylated the Sendai P0 were pooled and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (3 ml) which was then washed with 0.2 m NaCl buffer A. This column was developed with a linear gradient of 0.2–1.0 mNaCl buffer A and fractions collected. In an effort to further purify the active kinase fraction, P0 phosphorylating fractions eluted from the phosphocellulose column were refractionated on a DEAE-cellulose column and active fractions were then dialyzed overnight against buffer B (10 mm KPO4, 1 mmDTT, 5% glycerol), then loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (2 ml). This column was washed with buffer B, developed with a linear gradient of 0.01–0.4 m KPO4 buffer B, and fractions then tested for P0 phosphorylating activity. Throughout the chromatographic clarification of P0 phosphorylating activity, the fold purification was calculated in terms of unit activity per mg of protein, where 1 unit was defined as the amount of kinase that incorporated 1 pmol of phosphate in Sendai P protein in 15 min. The in vitro phosphorylation of Sendai P0 (2 μg) was done in 30-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN, 3000 Ci/mmol), 100 μg/ml PS, and column or gradient fractions as denoted in the individual experiments. Where indicated, staurosporine (400 nm) and heparin (5 μg/ml) were included in the kinase reactions. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, the radiolabeled proteins fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and then visualized by autoradiography. To assay cofactor stimulation of the cellular kinase present in the phosphocellulose unbound fraction, Sendai P0 was labeled in the presence or absence of PS (100 μg/ml), DAG (100 μg/ml), and CaCl2 (200 μm) as indicated. Labeling of P0 was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Recombinant PKC isoforms α, η, and ζ expressed in baculovirus were first used for the phosphorylation of peptide α ([Ser25]PKC(19–31)) (25Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), and the specific activity of equal aliquots (μl) was measured by filter binding assay. Equal activity of the recombinant PKC isoforms, based on phosphorylation of the α peptide, was then used to phosphorylate Sendai P0. Sendai virus RNP was isolated as described above and 5 μg used in a kinase reaction where the addition of cellular kinase was omitted. Proteins present in the phosphocellulose column unbound fraction were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to GeneScreen membrane (DuPont), blocked, and treated with PKC isoform-specific antibodies (α, β, δ, ε, γ, η, and ζ) and casein kinase II antibody. The blots were developed by treatment with secondary antibody followed by ECL reagent (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and exposed to x-ray film. To isolate gradient purified Sendai RNP, twice pelleted Sendai virus were treated with an equal volume of 2 × LSS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.8 mNaCl, 3.7% Triton X-100, 1.6 mm DTT), before centrifugation through a 15–30% (w/v) continuous glycerol gradient containing 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mmMgCl2, 66 mm NH4Cl, 14 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT, for 2 h at 45,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. Twenty fractions of equal volume were collected from top to bottom of the gradient. Aliquots of every second fraction were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blot using PKC ζ-specific antibody as described above. An in vitro transcription was done to detect RNA synthetic activity in sucrose gradient fractions of disrupted Sendai virion. A 50-μl reaction containing 0.1 m Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.1m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.01 mm UTP, 15 mCi of [α-32P]UTP, 0.5 μl of RNasin, 2 μl of reticulocyte lysate, and 5-μl gradient fraction was incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. At the end of the reaction, products were precipitated in ETOH, denatured with formamide, then fractionated on a 5% acrylamide-urea sequencing gel. Relative transcriptional activity was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The cPKC and PKC ζ-specific pseudosubstrate peptides, A and Z, respectively, were delivered into subconfluent (90%) monolayers of LLC-MK2 cells using the Transport reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells in a 24-well plate were treated with the peptides plus Transport reagent for 15 min in a volume of 200 μl, followed by the addition of 20 μl of stop solution. Cells were then allowed to recover by incubation with 400 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then infected with Sendai at 1 plaque-forming unit/cell in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 1 h. Unadsorbed virus was removed by washing once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, then 300 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum was added for incubation. Released progeny virus were harvested at 30 h post-inoculation. To monitor the accumulation of positive or negative sense Sendai viral RNAs, a cDNA clone of the Sendai NP gene coding region was constructed by the reverse transcription of purified genomic RNA followed by PCR amplification as was described above for the cloning of the viral P gene. The primer 5′-GCGCTAGGGCCCATGGCCGGGTTGTTGAG was used for first strand synthesis and the primer 5′-GCTGCATGCATCTAGATTCCTCCTATCCC for second strand synthesis. The PCR product was cut by restriction endonucleases APA 1 and NSI 1, then ligated into the pcDNA II vector (Invitrogen) to create pSNP. The NP gene sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. To generate32P-labeled riboprobes for the detection of genomic (negative sense) viral RNAs, pSNP was linearized by restriction withNSI 1 followed by T7 transcription. Conversely, linearization by APA 1 and Sp6 transcription were used to produce riboprobe for antigenome (positive sense) viral transcripts. Subconfluent LLC-MK2 cells in 6-well plates (35 mm) were transfected with peptides A or Z (4 mm) for 1 h then infected with Sendai virion as described above. At various time points (1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 h) total intracellular RNA/mRNA was extracted by treatment of the cells with RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal aliquots of the RNA samples were subsequently denatured with formamide/formaldehyde, applied to a dot blot apparatus (Life Technologies, Inc.), and probed separately for the presence of positive and negative sense transcripts. Relative accumulation of Sendai viral transcripts at each time point was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis and the signal from uninfected/peptide-treated control cells used to subtract background counts. Sendai virus harvested from peptide-treated and control cells were treated with trypsin (2.5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C before serial dilution. Confluent monolayers of LLC-MK2 cells (6-well plates) grown in medium 199 (5% fetal calf serum) were then infected with diluted virus in a volume of 0.4 ml for 90 min at 37 °C with occasional gentle agitation. Virus inoculum was removed and 2 ml of 0.5% agar (Difco Bacto Agar, in 1 × media 199, no serum, with trypsin 2.5 μg/ml) was overlaid. Cells were then incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. Agar was shaken off cell monolayers, and 2 ml of guinea pig red blood cells (0.1% in phosphate-buffered saline) was immediately added, then incubated for 30 min at room temp. Red blood cells were removed and cells washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Plaques were scored as well defined areas of red blood cells. To determine the cellular kinase phosphorylating the Sendai virus P protein, we prepared a cDNA clone of full-length P gene by reverse transcription of genomic Sendai viral RNA followed by PCR amplification. A C-terminal heptahistidine tag was added as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant P protein was expressed in E. coli in its unphosphorylated (P0) form and purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+ affinity column. A nearly homogeneous preparation of Sendai P protein was obtained as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained acrylamide gel (data not shown). The P0 protein was then used as a substrate for characterization of cellular kinases purified from CV-1 cell extract. The soluble (S-100) fraction of CV-1 cells was collected and further fractionated by passage through DEAE-cellulose where phosphorylation of Sendai P0 protein by those fractions was assayed. As shown in Fig. 1 A, cellular kinase phosphorylating P0 protein eluted in a broad peak at ∼0.25 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and further fractionated over a phosphocellulose column, where the major P0 phosphorylating activity eluted in the unbound (flow-through) fraction. Two minor activities at ∼0.3 mNaCl (fraction number 15) and ∼0.6 m NaCl (fraction number 30) were also observed (Fig. 1 B). To characterize the major cellular kinase(s) present in the flow-through fraction, we determined the effect of different inhibitors on the P0phosphorylating activity (Fig. 2 A). It can be seen that staurosporine (400 nm) completely inhibited P protein phosphorylation while heparin (5 μg/ml) had no apparent effect. These data demonstrated that a PKC-like activity is present in the unbound fraction which phosphorylates the P0 protein. The active fractions from the phosphocellulose column were subjected to an additional round of DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite column purification. Fold purification was monitored throughout the chromatographic steps and was approximately 1000-fold after the final hydroxylapatite column as shown in Table I. Due to the low yield of kinase activity following hydroxylapatite column fractionation, the phosphocellulose flow-through fraction was used for most purposes described herein. However, the enzymatic properties of both purified fractions were compared and found to be indistinguishable.Figure 2Characterization of cellular kinase(s) in phosphocellulose column flow-through fraction.

One unit is the amount of kinase that incorporated 1 pmol of phosphate in Sendai P protein in 15 min To directly confirm the presence of PKC in the phosphocellulose column flow-through fraction, it was subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against specific PKC isoforms (α, β, δ, ε, γ, and ζ). These PKC isoforms were chosen because of their wide distribution in a variety of tissue types (26Kochs G. Hummel R. Meyer D. Hug H. Marme D. Sarre T.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B and Fig. 4, only the antibody specific for PKC ζ isoform detected a band of approximately 68 kDa in the flow-through fraction. An antibody raised against the α subunit of casein kinase II did not cross-react with proteins present in the unbound fraction. All antibodies were tested for their reactivity with corresponding authentic kinases (data not shown). Similar Western blot analysis using antibodies against PKC isoform η were carried out and found to be negative (data not shown). The phosphorylation of P0 by PKC ζ was further confirmed using purified recombinant PKC ζ along with other isoforms including α and η in the in vitro kinase reactions (Fig.2 C). While all three isoforms were found to be capable of phosphorylating P0, PKC ζ had the greatest activity for P0 (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicating involvement of PKC ζ in P0 phosphorylation. Next, we examined the cofactor requirements of the cellular kinase to confirm that it is indeed a member of the novel PKC family (26Kochs G. Hummel R. Meyer D. Hug H. Marme D. Sarre T.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar, 28Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, phosphorylation of P0 by the cellular kinase was stimulated by about 3-fold in the presence of PS, whereas the addition of Ca2+ or DAG had no stimulatory effect. In fact, addition of Ca2+ and DAG was slightly inhibitory (lane 6). Furthermore, the addition of EGTA (500 nm) had no effect on P0 phosphorylation (data not shown). These data are consistent with the cofactor requirements of PKC ζ.Figure 3Identification of cellular kinase as PKC ζ by cofactor requirements. Bacterially expressed Sendai P0 was 32P-labeled in vitro by a cellular kinase in the phosphocellulose column unbound fraction in the presence or absence of PS (100 μg/ml), DAG (100 μg/ml), and CaCl2 (200 μm) as indicated. Where CaCl2 was not added, EGTA (500 nm) was included in the reaction mixture. Radiolabeled proteins were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer then fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography, and kinase activity quantified by PhosphorImager. Baseline activity (labeling of P0 without addition of cofactors, lane 1) was denoted as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether PKC ζ was specifically packaged into Sendai virion, we disrupted twice pelleted, purified virus in the presence 0.4 m NaCl and 1.85% Triton X-100, then purified the RNP complex by gradient centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Even numbered gradient fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis then stained by Coomassie Blue (Fig. 4 A). Viral nucleocapsid (NP) and phosphoproteins (P) appear almost exclusively in the bottom, pellet fraction. In contrast, the viral matrix protein (M) and envelope proteins, hemeagglutinin-neuraminidase, and fusion can be seen in fractions near the top of the gradient indicating that the viral envelope was disrupted by the detergent and salt treatment. Immunoblot analysis of gradient fractions with a PKC ζ-specific antibody strongly detected PKC ζ in the RNP pellet fraction and more weakly near the top of the gradient (Fig. 4 B). This data suggests that the majority of PKC ζ packaged into Sendai viral particles is tightly associated with the RNP. To further confirm the tight association of PKC ζ and the Sendai viral RNP, gradient fractions were tested for the ability to phosphorylate bacterially expressed Sendai P0 and to transcribe Sendai viral mRNAin vitro. As can be seen in Fig. 4 C, the great majority of the kinase activity and 100% of the transcriptional activity co-purified at the bottom of the gradient. As an additional characterization of the RNP-associated kinase, we examined the cofactor requirements of that activity in purified RNP. As shown in Fig.5, RNP-associated P protein was phosphorylated by the virion-associated kinase with a cofactor requirement identical to that observed for the cellular kinase phosphorylating P0, presumably PKC ζ (Fig. 3). It can be seen that the NP protein was also phosphorylated by the virion-associated kinase (Fig. 5). Moreover the cofactor requirement for stimulation of NP phosphorylation is also identical to PKC ζ. From these data we conclude that PKC ζ is specifically packaged into the virion during morphogenesis and may also play a role in the phosphorylation of NP. To investigate whether the observed phosphorylation of Sendai P protein is important in the life cycle of the virus, we used specific pseudosubstrate peptides to inhibit PKC activity during virus replication as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Pseudosubstrate peptides are derived from sequence motifs found near the N terminus of all PKC isoforms, and are similar to the phosphorylation site consensus sequence, except that serine or threonine residues are changed to alanine. This motif cannot be phosphorylated and represents an autoregulatory feature by blocking the catalytic (substrate binding) site (26Kochs G. Hummel R. Meyer D. Hug H. Marme D. Sarre T.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Pseudosubstrate peptides have been shown to be quite efficient inhibitors of PKC activity bothin vitro and in situ (29House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 30Shen S.S. Buck W.R. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We delivered PKC ζ-specific inhibitory peptide (peptide Z) into LLC-MK2cells prior to Sendai virus infection. In control cells, the pseudosubstrate peptide A, which inhibits conventional PKC activity (e.g. PKCs α, β, and γ) was used"
https://openalex.org/W2025406290,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is a pluripotent regulator of cell growth and differentiation. The growth factor is expressed as a latent complex that must be converted to an active form before interacting with its ubiquitous high affinity receptors. This conversion involves the release of the mature TGFβ through disruption of the noncovalent interactions with its propeptide or latency associated protein (LAP). Complex formation or dissociation between LAP and TGFβ plays a very important role in TGFβ biological activity at different steps. To further characterize the kinetic parameters of this interaction, we have employed surface plasmon resonance biosensor methodology. Using this technique, we observed real time association of LAP with mature TGFβ1. The complex formation showed an equilibrium K d around 3–7 nm. Furthermore, we observed dissociation of the complex in the presence of extreme pH, chaotropic agents, or plasmin, confirming their effects on TGFβ activation. The same approach was used to examine whether latent TGFβ1 could interact with thrombospondins, previously described as activators of latent TGFβ. Using this method, we could not detect any direct interaction of thrombospondins with either LAP alone, TGFβ1 alone, or the small latent TGFβ1 complex. This suggests that activation of latent TGFβ1 complex by thrombospondins is through an indirect mechanism.

Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar). Its roles in growth inhibition of many epithelial cells, potentiation of wound repair, angiogenesis, regulation of endocrine functions, and immunomodulation are among its many documented actions. TGFβ1 exerts its effects via binding to high affinity receptors that are expressed on virtually all cell types, and as TGFβ1 production is ubiquitous, there must be strict regulation of its activity. TGFβ1 is synthesized as a 390-amino acid precursor protein, termed prepro-TGFβ1, which undergoes several processing steps. These include proteolytic cleavage of the signal peptide (3Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), glycosylation and mannose-6-phosphorylation of the pro-domain (4Purchio A.F.

Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Completion of posttranslational processing results in a pro-domain (amino acid residues 30–278), called latency-associated peptide (LAP), and a mature TGFβ (amino acid residues 279–390). LAP exists as a homodimer, linked by disulfide bonds, and has been shown to noncovalently bind a mature covalent TGFβ1 homodimer with a 1:1 ratio (6Gentry L.E. Nash B.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6851-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This biologically inactive complex does not bind to TGFβ receptors. The resulting latent form may then be activated in different ways (for review, see Ref. 7Flaumenhaft R. Kojima S. Abe M. Rifkin D.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1993; 24: 51-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dissociation can be accomplishedin vitro by heat, extreme pH (above pH 9 or below pH 3), and selected chaotropic agents. In vivo, the mechanism may involve specific proteases such as plasmin (8Lyons R.M. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Thrombospondins (TSPs), extracellular matrix-associated proteins, have also been described as activators of latent TGFβ1 complex (9Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 10Souchelnitskiy S. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.-J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5118-5126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that TSP1 activates latent TGFβ via a protease- and cell-independent mechanism (9Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). It is now clear that LAP is implicated at different levels in TGFβ biological activity. Previous studies have indicated that LAP plays important roles in secretion and proper folding of the mature growth factor molecule (5Sha X. Brunner A.M. Purchio A.F. Gentry L.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, specific binding of LAP to TGFβ may be an important mechanism in regulating the biological functions of secreted TGFβ (6Gentry L.E. Nash B.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6851-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Broz S. Jackson M. Levinson A.D. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, several studies suggest that LAP is a potent inhibitor of bioactive TGFβ both in vitro and in vivo (6Gentry L.E. Nash B.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6851-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Böttinger E.P. Factor V.M. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Kopp J.B. Qian S.W. Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5877-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, formation of latent complexes increases plasma TGFβ1 half-life about 50-fold (15Wakefield L.M. Winokur T.S. Hollands R.S. Christopherson K. Levinson A.D. Sporn M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1976-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, LAP interacts with the mannose 6-phosphate receptor that has been shown to be required for cellular activation of latent TGFβ1 (16Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar); thus LAP could potentially contribute to enhanced and targeted TGFβ activity. The first purpose of the present work was to analyze the affinity parameters of the complex formation between LAP and TGFβ1. We thought that a method of choice for determining these parameters would be surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using the BIAcoreTMapparatus (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The principle is that one molecule involved in the interaction to be studied is covalently immobilized to a sensor chip, and the other interactant is then passed over the chip in solution. The detection system measures and records a signal proportional to the mass of the protein bound to the surface. In this way, the association phase can be visualized in real time as the ligand-containing solution flows over the surface, and the subsequent dissociation is similarly displayed after the flow switches back to buffer containing no ligand (17Fägerstam L.G. Frostell-Karlsson A. Karlsson R. Persson B. Ronnberg I. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Using this technique, we were able to show direct interaction between LAP and mature TGFβ1, that is, formation of the small latent complex with TGFβ1 immobilized and LAP injected as analyte or vice versa. We measured the affinity parameters of this interaction. The second goal was to use this technique to visualize the dissociation of the small latent TGFβ1 complex by known activators. We confirmed direct activation of the small latent recombinant TGFβ1 by extreme pH, chaotropic agents, or plasmin. However, we did not detect any direct interaction of thrombospondins with either LAP, TGFβ1, or the small latent TGFβ1 complex. The BIAcoreTMinstrument, sensor chips CM5 and SA5, surfactant P20, and the amine coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were acquired from Pharmacia Biosensor AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Ultrapure human TGFβ1 was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), recombinant human LAP (TGFβ1), and recombinant latent TGFβ1 were from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Bovine plasmin was from Boehringer Mannheim (Meylan, France). We purified murine recombinant thrombospondin 2 (TSP2) from the supernatant of Sf9 cells transfected with a recombinant baculovirus kindly provided to us by Drs. Chen and Mosher (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). TSP1 was purified from human platelets. Biotinylated heparin was a generous gift from Dr. Lortat-Jacob (Institut Pasteur, Lyon, France). The BIAcore running buffer was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 (HBS, Pharmacia), except where indicated. Equal volumes of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.1 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide were mixed, and 35 μl were injected over the surface of the sensor chip to activate the carboxymethylated dextran. TGFβ1 (6.66 μg/ml in 25 μl of 10 mm acetate, pH 4) or LAP (13.3 μg/ml in 10 μl of 10 mm acetate, pH 4) was injected over the activated surface, followed by 35 μl of ethanolamine to block remaining active carboxyl groups. The immobilization procedure was carried out at 25 °C and at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min. Control immobilization was performed under the same conditions in the absence of TGFβ1 or LAP. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C with a constant flow rate of 25 μl/min in HBS buffer. 50 μl of the analyte were injected for 2 min (association phase), followed by a 2-min period when HBS was passed (dissociation phase). Equal volumes of each protein dilution were also injected over a mock blocked surface to serve as blank sensorgrams for subtraction of bulk refractive index background and nonspecific binding of the analyte. All kinetic assays were followed by an injection of 25 μl of 6m guanidine chloride (GnCl) to dissociate remaining bound ligand, leaving only the immobilized interactant (regeneration phase). We worked at low immobilization level, high flow rate (25 μl/min), and concentrations of analyte suitable to limit mass transport. Further, the mass transport limitations were checked using the BIAsimulation program. All the steps described were fully automated and carried out by the BIAcore systems robotics. Association, dissociation, and regeneration phases were followed in real time as a change in signal expressed in resonance units (RU). Curves derived from these assays were used to generate kinetic contants. Sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using the BIAevaluation program (Pharmacia). Kinetic constants were generated from the association and dissociation curves from the BIAcore experiments by fitting to a single-site binding model (A + B = AB). This model gave a single exponential fit with a χ2 < 0.5. Comparison fitting with more complicated models did not give a better interpretation of the data. The equation R t =R 0 exp(−k d (t − t 0)) was used for the dissociation phase, whereR t was the amount of ligand remaining bound in RU at time t and t 0 was the beginning of dissociation phase. The final dissociation rate constant,k d, was calculated from the mean of the values obtained from a series of injections. To analyze the association phase, the equation R t = R eq (1 − exp(−k s (t − t 0))) was employed where R eq was the amount of bound ligand (in RU) at equilibrium, t 0 was the starting time of injection, and k s = k a C + k d, where C was the concentration of analyte injected over the sensor chip surface. The association rate constant, k a, was determined from the slope of a plot of k s versus C. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant K d was determined from the ratio of these two kinetic constants (k d /k a ). The first goal of our study was to determine whether the association between LAP and mature TGFβ1 could be visualized by SPR. Therefore, experiments were performed in two ways. Either TGFβ1 was immobilized on the chip and LAP injected as the analyte or vice versa, where LAP was immobilized and TGFβ1 was injected. Immobilization of TGFβ1 yielded approximately 600 RU, and the maximal binding capacity of the surface (R max) was 1296 RU for LAP binding. Association was started by injection of 50 μl of LAP followed by regeneration. Fig. 1 A shows the association and dissociation curves from a representative experiment performed with five different concentrations of LAP (50–200 nm). Corrected sensorgrams are shown after subtraction of a sensorgram performed with the same concentration of LAP on the control flow cell. The association phase (0–120 s) was analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting as described under “Materials and Methods” to yield k s values at each concentration. A plot of k s versus concentration of LAP produced a straight line (Fig. 1 B) with a slope equal to the association rate constant (k a ). The value ofk a for LAP binding to immobilized TGFβ1 (TableI) was determined to be 1.2 ± 0.4 × 104 s−1m−1. The dissociation phase (120–240 s) was also analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting. The dissociation rate constant,k d, was calculated from the curve representing 120 s of dissociation. The k d for LAP binding to immobilized TGFβ1 was calculated as 0.9 ± 0.4 10−4 s−1 (Table I). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant K d determined from the ratio of these two kinetic constants (k d /k a ) was 7.5 nm. This experiment was repeated on three different chips, producing a meanK d of 5.6 ± 1.4 nm (Table I).Figure 1LAP forms a complex with immobilized TGFβ1.

Open table in a new tab Similar experiments were performed with immobilized LAP (approximately 800 RU, yielding an R max of 370 RU for TGFβ1 binding). Association was started by injection of 50 μl of TGFβ1 followed by regeneration. Fig. 2 shows the association and dissociation curves from a representative experiment performed with three different concentrations of TGFβ1 (50, 80, and 100 nm). Constants were determined as described above. Thek a value for TGFβ1 binding to immobilized LAP (Table I) was determined to be 31.7 ± 26.6 × 104 s−1m−1. TheK d value for TGFβ1 dissociation from LAP surface was calculated as 8.5 ± 2.0 10−4 s−1(Table I). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constantK d was 2.7 nm. This experiment was repeated on three different chips, producing a meanK d of 3.2 ± 1.3 nm (Table I). Whether LAP or TGFβ1 was immobilized, we obtained a similar equilibrium constant (K d = 3.2 or 5.6 nm, respectively). However, the respectivek a and k d values obtained with each protocol differed by a log. LAP binding to immobilized TGFβ1 yielded smaller k a and k d values than TGFβ1 binding to immobilized LAP. This may reflect a different sensitivity of LAP and TGFβ1 to chemical cross-linking to the sensor chip. The immobilization procedure would appear to more faithfully preserve the binding sites of LAP than those of TGFβ1. ThisK d was in agreement with that previously published by Miller et al. (18Miller D.M. Ogawa Y. Iwata K.K. ten Dijke P. Purchio A.F. Soloff M.S. Gentry L.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (1.1–1.8 nm) using a covalent cross-linking method. The nanomolar range affinity between LAP and TGFβ1 could have major implications. Indeed, cellular receptors for TGFβ1 have been shown to have apparent K d values between 20–50 pm (19Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tucker R.F. Branum E.L. Shipley G.D. Ryan R.J. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6757-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Massagué J. Like B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2636-2645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), around 100-fold smaller than the apparent K d values for TGFβ1 binding to LAP. The greater affinity of TGFβ1 for cell receptors than for LAP suggests that TGFβ1 interaction with the cell is favored. This would be in agreement with the latent TGFβ1 complex representing a circulating form of TGFβ1. In support of this idea, it has been shown that the latent complex of TGFβ1 has a serum half-life of 2 h as opposed to a half-life of 3 min observed for the mature active growth factor (15Wakefield L.M. Winokur T.S. Hollands R.S. Christopherson K. Levinson A.D. Sporn M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1976-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Formation of latent complexes could thus switch TGFβ from an autocrine/paracrine mode of action to a more endocrine mode involving target organs distant from the site of synthesis. We then wondered whether SPR could permit us to visualize the dissociation of the small latent TGFβ1 complex during the activation process. As mentioned above, latent TGFβ1 can be activated by different means. Using SPR technology, we could monitor dissociation of the complex by injecting extreme pH buffers (above pH 9 or below pH 3, data not shown). Regeneration protocols confirmed that this complex can also be dissociated by chaotropic agents such as GnCl (Fig.3 A). This demonstrates that the interaction between these two peptides results at least in part from electrostatic interactions. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, a similar amount of LAP binds to TGFβ1 before and after GnCl treatment. This indicates that the binding capacity of TGFβ1 was preserved during the activation of the latent TGFβ1 complex by GnCl and validates its use of GnCl in surface regeneration for SPR analyses. A more physiological mode of activation of TGFβ1 is through proteolytic cleavage by plasmin, which results in the removal of the amino-terminal portion of the pro-domain (22Lyons R.M. Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). We checked whether we could visualize this activation in real time by SPR. To do this, small latent TGFβ1 complex was formed as described previously (TGFβ1 immobilized and LAP injected afterward), and then 50 μl of plasmin (dialyzed overnight against HBS, pH 8.6, 0.1 units/ml) was injected at a flow of 2 μl/min. As shown in Fig. 3 B, plasmin binds temporarily to the small latent TGFβ1 complex, dissociates from the complex, and displaces approximately 40% of the SPR signal (159 RU bound in the control versus 90 RU after injection of plasmin, Table II). This signal loss cannot be explained by the release of the proteolytic fragment of LAP alone, which constitute one-fifth of the molecule (22Lyons R.M. Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). It is more probable that the loss of 40% of the SPR signal corresponds to the release of 40% of LAP molecules bound to TGFβ1. This corresponds to the level of dissociation observed in vitro with plasmin (22Lyons R.M. Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). As a control, heat-inactivated plasmin (5 min at 100 °C) was added; in that case, inactivated plasmin still binds to the small latent TGFβ complex but does not trigger measurable dissociation of the complex. To confirm that the entire LAP molecule was released, we reinjected LAP. We were able to reconstitute an equivalent amount of complex as was present prior to plasmin treatment, as shown in Table II. This suggests that plasmin disrupted LAP binding to TGFβ1 but did not modify the immobilized TGFβ1. In the inverse experiment with the LAP·TGFβ1 complex (LAP immobilized and TGFβ1 as analyte), plasmin displaced approximately 70% (125 RU bound in the control versus 41 RU after injection of plasmin, Table II) of the complex. However, as shown in Table II, when TGFβ1 was reinjected, no LAP·TGFβ1 complex was reformed. This suggests that a fraction of LAP had been irreversibly proteolyzed by plasmin. Finally, a recombinant commercial source of preformed small latent TGFβ1 complex immobilized to the sensor chip could also be dissociated by addition of plasmin (data not shown). Altogether, our data indicate that plasmin can dissociate preformed recombinant latent TGFβ1 complex as well as small latent TGFβ1 complex formed on the sensor chip through a direct interaction.Table IIReversibility of the activation of small latent TGFβ1 complex by plasminAmount of small latent TGFβ complex (RU)First association2-aRU after analyte injection.Postplasmin injection2-bRU left after plasmin injection.Second association2-cRU after a second injection of analyte following plasmin injection and regeneration with 6 m GnCl.Immobilized TGFβ115990161LAP analyte(43%)2-dRU left after plasmin injection versus in the absence of plasmin.Immobilized LAP1254141TGFβ1 analyte(67%)2-dRU left after plasmin injection versus in the absence of plasmin.2-a RU after analyte injection.2-b RU left after plasmin injection.2-c RU after a second injection of analyte following plasmin injection and regeneration with 6 m GnCl.2-d RU left after plasmin injection versus in the absence of plasmin. Open table in a new tab Having validated this method through the determination of the kinetic parameters of LAP·TGFβ1 complex formation and through the observation of the dissociation of this complex by known activators, we used it to investigate the interaction of TSPs with the small latent TGFβ1 complex. TSPs are extracellular matrix-associated proteins that have also been described as activators of the latent TGFβ1 complex (9Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 10Souchelnitskiy S. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.-J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5118-5126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murphy-Ullrich and co-workers (23Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) have found that TSP1 activates latent TGFβ via a protease- and cell-independent mechanism, whereas TSP2 does not. Their work indicates that TSP1 activation of TGFβ could result from the binding of the tripeptide RFK, not present in TSP2, to the amino-terminal portion of LAP, inducing a conformational change of the complex and the liberation of mature TGFβ1 (23Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In contrast, our laboratory has reported previously that both TSP1 and TSP2 activate the large latent TGFβ1 complex (containing LTBP (latent TGFβ binding protein)) (10Souchelnitskiy S. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.-J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5118-5126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the possible association of TSP1 and TSP2 with LAP or the small latent TGFβ1 complex using SPR. TSP1 (Fig.4 A) or TSP 2 (Fig. 4 B) was injected over immobilized LAP or TGFβ1 or a control flow cell in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, which is essential to TSP structure and function (24Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pellerin S. Lafeuillade B. Wade R.H. Savona C. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18810-18817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No specific association of TSP1 or TSP2 (50 nm) with LAP or TGFβ1 could be detected as the SPR signal returned to the same level as before the injection. Similar results were obtained in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). The significant change in the signal after injection of TSP2 or TSP1 was due to the bulk refractive index of the buffer in which the TSPs are purified, which can also be observed on the control immobilization flow cell. We then tested if TSP1 or TSP2 could interact with the small latent TGFβ1 complex bound to the sensor chip through either LAP (Fig. 4 C) or TGFβ1 (Fig. 4 D). Again, there was no association between TSPs and the small latent TGFβ1 complexes. These experiments were performed with a wide range of TSP concentrations and gave similar results (data not shown). Nor did we detect any interaction in the inverse experiment (TSP immobilized and TGFβ1 or LAP as analytes, data not shown). To confirm that TSPs could bind to a known ligand in this system, we performed binding studies with a TSP-interacting molecule, namely heparin. When injected over biotinylated heparin immobilized onto a streptavidin chip, TSP1 and TSP2 (50 nm) bound to the surface and increased the SPR signal by 1000 RU (Fig.5 A) and 2000 RU (Fig. 5 B), respectively.Figure 5Association of TSP1 or TSP2 to heparin.Biotinylated heparin was immobilized onto a streptavidin chip (300 RU of fixed molecules). 35 μl of 50 nm of TSP1 (A) or TSP2 (B) was injected at a flow of 5 μl/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The absence of interaction between TSPs and either LAP or latent TGFβ1 complex suggests that TSPs cannot activate the small latent TGFβ1 complex through direct protein-protein interaction as has been suggested (23Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Activation by TSPs may be indirect and require other proteins, e.g. LTBP or the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. We have been unsuccessful so far in purifying the LTBP·LAP·TGFβ1 complex (large latent TGFβ1 complex) to homogeneity and, therefore, could not examine possible large latent TGFβ1 complex interactions by SPR. We have tried to reconstitute this large complex by passing LTBP-1 over immobilized small latent TGFβ1 complex. No association was seen, probably because the formation of the disulfide bond between cysteine 33 of LAP1 and the third 8-cysteine repeat of LTBP-1 (26Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) requires an oxidative environment and chaperone proteins. Taken together, our data show that SPR technology can be used successfully to determine the kinetic parameters of the formation of the latent complex between TGFβ1 and LAP. It also demonstrates that SPR can be used to monitor in real-time the dissociation of preformed latent TGFβ1 complex in the presence of activators. Furthermore, it allows to discriminate between direct activators (like plasmin) and indirect activators (like thrombospondins). This technique should be useful in studying the possible association of latent TGFβ with proteins such as cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor type II receptor or transglutaminase, which have been shown to be required for activation of latent TGFβ at the cell surface (16Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 27Kojima S. Nara K. Rifkin D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). SPR should also be a method of choice to characterize the interaction between mature TGFβ and some of its neutralizing molecules such as decorin, biglycan, α2-macroglobulin, or soluble beta-glycan.

https://openalex.org/W1971154486,"The proto-oncogene molecule c-Crk plays a role in growth factor-induced activation of Ras. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), a metabolite of cellular sphingolipids, has previously been shown to play a role in growth factor receptor signaling (Olivera, A., and Spiegel, S. (1993) Nature 365, 557–560). SPP was found to strongly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk, but not Shc, in NIH-3T3 parental, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor-overexpressing and Crk-overexpressing (3T3-Crk) fibroblasts. Sphingosine, a metabolic precursor of SPP, also produced a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk. In contrast, other sphingolipid metabolites including ceramide did not alter Crk tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, Crk enhanced SPP-induced mitogenesis, as measured by SPP-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in a manner proportional to the level of Crk expression in 3T3-Crk cells. This stimulation appears to be Ras-dependent, whereas SPP stimulation of MAP kinase activity is Ras-independent. These data indicate that SPP activates a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates Crk and that Crk is a positive effector of SPP-induced mitogenesis.

Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying sphingosine and SPP-induced mitogenesis, we investigated the effect of these sphingolipids on intracellular signaling molecules upstream of the MAP kinase cascade, and then we examined the role of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. It has previously been shown that activation of either Shc- or Crk-related pathways leads to activation of the MAP kinase cascade. Shc is an SH2 domain-containing protein that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with Grb2 in response to growth factor receptor stimulation (17Li W. Hu P. Skolnick E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Buday L. Downward J.

Signaling through Shc appears to be a common pathway by which both tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and certain G-protein-coupled receptors lead to activation of Ras (20van Blesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Portirl E. Sakane M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Crk is a noncatalytic SH2 and SH3 domain-containing adaptor molecule that shares structural homology with Grb2 and Nck (21Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 22Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshau S. Hanafusa H. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 451-460PubMed Google Scholar, 23Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Like Grb2, Crk associates with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor mSos and a related molecule called C3G (23Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Masabumi S. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, Crk provides an alternate pathway by which growth factor receptors can signal Ras. Crk has been specifically implicated in IGF-I receptor signaling (25Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the IGF-I receptor induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk (25Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the mitogenic effects of IGF-I are enhanced in Crk-overexpressing cells (26Beitner-Johnson D.

To explore possible interactions of the sphingolipid and Crk signaling pathways, we have investigated the effects of sphingolipid metabolites on Crk and Shc signaling. Sphingomyelinase (Streptomyces sp.) was obtained from Sigma. Sphingosine 1-phosphate, sphingosine,N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6-Cer),N-acetylsphingosine (C2-Cer), anddl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DHS) were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sphingolipids were added to cells as a complex with 0.4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in serum-free DMEM (6Zhang H. Desai N.N. Murphey J.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21309-21316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I was from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). The plasmid encoding the dominant negative Ras was a gift of Dr. Silvio Gutkind (NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Both parental and transfected NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). 3T3-Crk and 3T3-Neo cells were, respectively, stably transfected with either pCXN2-CRK II, a Crk expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter and carrying neor (kindly provided by Dr. M. Matsuda, Tokyo, Japan) or the pCXN2 vector from which the Crk cDNA had been excised, as described previously (26Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9287-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Before stimulation, subconfluent cultures of cells in 100-mm dishes were switched to serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% insulin-free bovine serum albumin (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY) and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) for 18 h. Cells were treated with IGF-I (100 nm), SPP (10 μm), sphingosine (20 μm), DHS (20 μm), C2-Cer (20 μm), C6-Cer (20 μm), sphingomyelinase (0.1 unit/ml), or sphingosylphosphorylcholine (20 μm) diluted in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for various time points and concentrations, as indicated. NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing approximately 10-fold levels of Shc with a c-Myc tag (Shc/Myc) and control cells transfected with selectable marker vector only (pLEN) were kindly provided by Dr. Ben Margolis (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). These cell lines were cultured similarly to Crk-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells. Transient transfection of NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing 10-fold Crk (3T3-Crk7 cells) with the plasmid-encoding dominant negative Ras or a neor vector alone was performed using the Dosper reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). Transfected cells were allowed to recover 24 h in complete medium before plating for thymidine incorporation assays or before serum starvation for measurement of MAP kinase activation. After treatment with growth factors, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove Triton-insoluble material. Protein content of the lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad method. 600 μg of protein from each dish was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with either a monoclonal antibody to Crk (3 μg, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), a polyclonal antibody to Shc (3 μg, Transduction Laboratories), or polyclonal antiserum to C3G (10 μl, kindly provided by Dr. Beatrice Knudsen, Rockefeller University, New York, NY) followed by adsorption to 50 μl of 10% Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 5 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The entire immunoprecipitated samples were then boiled for 2 min in sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue as a marker. Samples were then run on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard electrophoresis and electroblotting procedures. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with either 3% insulin-free bovine serum albumin (for phosphotyrosine immunoblotting) or 3% nonfat dry milk (for other immunoblotting) in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween containing 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were then immunolabeled overnight at 4 °C for either phosphotyrosine (in antibody RC2OH 1:2500), Crk (1:1000), or Grb2 (1:1000) (all from Transduction Laboratories). Immunolabeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Life Science, Inc.) according to manufacturer conditions. Some blots were stripped and re-probed with another antibody. Blots were stripped by incubation for 1 h at 50 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol. Blots were then washed for 1 h in several changes of phosphate-buffered saline with Tween at room temperature and probed with ECL to confirm that antibodies had been completely removed. Blots were then reblocked and immunolabeled as described above. Erk1 and Erk2 in cleared cell lysates derived from NIH-3T3 cells expressing IGF-I receptors and resolved by SDS-PAGE were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Erk1 antibody that recognizes both Erk1 and Erk2 (C16) (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Ras expression in 3T3-Crk7 cells transfected with the neor vector or the vector encoding dominant negative Ras was similarly detected by immunoblotting using an antibody to Ha-Ras (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories). Subconfluent cell monolayers in 24-well plates were rendered quiescent in DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum for 6 h. Cells were then incubated for 18 h in DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum containing various concentrations of SPP. [3H]Thymidine was added to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for an additional hour. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, twice with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and twice with ice-cold 95% ethanol. The precipitates were solubilized in 0.2 ml of 1 nNaOH and neutralized with 0.2 ml of 1 n HCl, and solubilized samples were counted by liquid scintillation. MAP kinase activity using myelin basic protein as a substrate was determined from 3T3-Crk7 cells and 3T3-Crk7 cells expressing dominant negative Ras following serum starvation for 18 h and subsequent treatment with either vehicle or SPP. The cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of polyclonal antibody to Erk2 (C14, Santa Cruz) followed by 20 μl of Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz). The beads were pelleted and washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase assay was begun by resuspending the beads in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP, 2 μg of myelin basic protein, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubating for 30 min at 37 °C. Laemmli sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Radioactive myelin basic protein was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by scintillation counting. The sphingolipid ceramide is known to activate the MAP kinase pathway by stimulating phosphorylation of Raf (27Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Another sphingolipid metabolite, SPP, is also known to play a role in growth factor signaling and leads to activation of the MAP kinase cascade (5Spiegel S. Milstein S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,16Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, the precise biochemical mechanisms involved remain unknown. To further our understanding of these intracellular pathways, we investigated the effect of various sphingolipid metabolites on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of two signaling proteins, Shc and Crk. Shc is an SH2 domain-containing protein that is involved in activation of Ras by both growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and Gi G-protein-linked receptors (20van Blesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Portirl E. Sakane M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc induces its association with the adaptor protein, Grb2. Grb2, in turn, associates with the guanine nucleotide exchange protein mSos, which leads to the activation of Ras (17Li W. Hu P. Skolnick E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 19Pawson A.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with the IGF-I receptor (clone NWTb3) (28Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were treated for 5 min with either IGF-I, sphingosine, SPP, or dihydrosphingosine, a mitogenically inactive analog of sphingosine. In this cell line, IGF-I strongly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and thus can be used as a positive control to test for SPP-induced Shc phosphorylation. Cleared whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for Shc, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted for either phosphotyrosine or Grb2. In Fig. 1, it can be seen that IGF-I induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and increased its association with Grb2. In contrast, neither sphingosine, SPP, nor DHS altered the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Shc or its association with Grb2. Identical results (i.e. no effect of sphingosine and SPP on Shc tyrosine phosphorylation) were obtained in parental NIH-3T3 cells and in a second fibroblast-derived cell line, Swiss 3T3 cells (data not shown). Thus, at least in mouse fibroblasts, these sphingolipid metabolites do not appear to mediate Ras activation via the Shc-Grb2-mSos pathway. The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein Crk also plays a role in growth factor-induced activation of Ras (23Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S.

SH3 domain-mediated interactions of the Crk protein with the Ras family guanine nucleotide exchange proteins mSos and C3G represent an alternative pathway to the Shc-Grb2-mSos mechanism of Ras activation (23Matsuda M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether Crk was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to sphingosine or SPP, NIH-3T3 cells were treated for 5 min with various sphingolipids. Cleared whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for Crk and immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine. Stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells with SPP strongly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk, as shown in Fig. 2 A. This suggests that SPP activates a tyrosine kinase that specifically phosphorylates Crk. It was of interest to compare the effects of SPP with those of other biologically active sphingolipid metabolites. Sphingosine, a metabolic precursor of SPP, slightly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk, whereas DHS, a mitogenically inactive analog of sphingosine, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine, a phosphocholine ester of sphingosine (itself a potent mitogen), had no effect on Crk tyrosine phosphorylation. C6-Cer and C2-Cer, cell-permeable analogs of ceramide, have been shown to induce differentiation, apoptosis, and cell arrest in several mammalian cell lines (3Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). However, other studies have indicated that ceramide exhibits a bimodal effect on cell growth, stimulating DNA synthesis and proliferation in confluent, quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (31Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26121-26127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hauser J.M. Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

In contrast to SPP and sphingosine, cell-permeable ceramide analogs (C2-Cer and C6-Cer) did not alter Crk phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, treatment with exogenous sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide, also did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk (Fig.2 A). Fig. 2 B shows a time course of the effect of SPP on tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk in NIH-3T3 cells. Cells were stimulated for various times with 10 μm SPP, the optimum concentration for mitogenesis (14Desai N.N. Zhang H. Olivera A. Mattie M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

The maximum SPP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation consistently occurred at 10 min. Crk immunoreactivity levels after 20–30 min were not different from control (data not shown). Thus it appears that after 10 min of exposure to SPP, one or more phosphotyrosine phosphatases act to dephosphorylate Crk. We also studied the effect of SPP on Crk phosphorylation in Crk-overexpressing cells. The 3T3-Crk7 clone has been shown to express 10-fold higher levels of Crk than NIH-3T3 parental cells (26Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.

Lysates were immunoprecipitated for Crk and immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 3 A, SPP, but not ceramide, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk in these cells. This Crk-overexpressing cell line also enabled us to study the effect of SPP on interactions of Crk with the guanine nucleotide exchange protein C3G, which is difficult to visualize in NIH-3T3 parental cells. 2V. A. Blakesley, D. Beitner-Johnson, S. Spiegel, and D. LeRoith, unpublished observations. In these experiments, cleared whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against C3G and immunoblotted for Crk. In Fig. 3 B, it can be seen that treatment of cells with SPP, DHS, or sphingosine for 5 min had no effect on the amount of Crk protein associated with C3G. Identical results were obtained in a second Crk-overexpressing clone, 3T3-Crk9 (data not shown). IGF-I and other growth factors have also been found not to alter Crk association with C3G (data not shown). 3B. Knudsen, personal communication. Thus, alterations in the amount of Crk associated with C3G do not appear to be involved in the mechanism by which SPP and other mitogens mediate signaling through Crk. We have previously shown that SPP, sphingosine, and ceramide induced mitogenic responses in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (6Zhang H. Desai N.N. Murphey J.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

We examined in detail the dose responses of different sphingolipid metabolites (6Zhang H. Desai N.N. Murphey J.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21309-21316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar,14Desai N.N. Zhang H. Olivera A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 26121-26127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are mitogenic for those cells and used optimal concentrations to ensure that the different responses are not caused by differences in uptake. We have shown in the present study that, whereas SPP induced Crk phosphorylation, treatment with ceramide did not. These results suggest that the mitogenic signaling pathways utilized by SPP and ceramide differ. We have previously shown that SPP stimulates the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells (16Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, in myeloid HL-60 cells, ceramide activated MAP kinase activity (34Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activated a protein kinase that phosphorylates Raf1 on Thr-269, enhancing its activity toward MEK and linking ceramide signaling to the MAP kinase pathway (27Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to examine the activation state of MAP kinases by various sphingolipid metabolites. Whereas IGF-I, SPP, and sphingosine induced a mobility shift in Erk1 and Erk2 consistent with phosphorylation and activation of these MAP kinases (Fig. 4), DHS and C6-Cer did not induce a mobility shift (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Thus, in mouse fibroblasts, SPP and ceramide appear to act through distinct signaling pathways leading to Erk phosphorylation. To further evaluate the functional effects of Crk overexpression on SPP signaling, the mitogenic effects of SPP were compared in two Crk-overexpressing (3T3-Crk) and two neomycin-resistant (3T3-Neo) control clones using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. In Fig. 5 A it can be seen that SPP produced a dose-dependent increase in thymidine incorporation in both the 3T3-Neo and 3T3-Crk cell types. However, SPP-induced mitogenesis was significantly enhanced in Crk-overexpressing cells compared with control 3T3-Neo cells. Furthermore, SPP-induced mitogenesis was dependent on the level of Crk expression in these cell lines. That is, the highest level of SPP-induced mitogenesis was exhibited by 3T3-Crk7, which expresses 10-fold higher Crk levels than parental cells. Intermediate levels were found in 3T3-Crk9, which expresses 3-fold higher Crk levels than parental, and 3T3-Neo cells were least responsive to SPP. Interestingly, in contrast to SPP and sphingosine, which stimulate DNA synthesis by 8- and 4-fold, respectively, C2-ceramide and sphingomyelinase were not potent mitogens in Crk-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether Shc also plays an important role in mitogenesis induced by SPP, we examined the effect of SPP on NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing Shc (Fig.6). The SPP response in the Shc-overexpressing cell line, Shc/Myc, was similar to that seen in parental NIH-3T3 cells. Thus overexpression of Shc did not enhance the mitogenic response to SPP as did overexpression of Crk.Figure 6Comparison of the mitogenic effect of sphingosine on Crk-overexpressing and Shc-overexpressing cells.Subconfluent serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing Crk (3T3-Crk7) or Shc (Shc/Myc) were incubated with various concentrations of SPP for 18 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured. Thymidine incorporation of parental NIH-3T3 cells and a control cell line transfected only with the empty vector was determined in the same experiment. The results are representative of three separate experiments. Cell lines: ▪, 3T3-Crk7; ▴, Shc/Myc; ○ NIH-3T3; and •, pLEN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if SPP-induced Erk1 and Erk2 activation in cells overexpressing Crk was mediated via the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, we measured MAP kinase activity and thymidine incorporation in 3T3-Crk7 cells transiently expressing dominant negative Ras and compared these results with those of 3T3-Crk7 cells transfected with vector alone. Overexpression of Crk by 10-fold (3T3-Crk7 cells) increased the basal levels of MAP kinase activity by 2.3-fold. Furthermore, in NIH-3T3 cells with neor vector alone, MAP kinase activity was increased 4.3-fold in response to SPP, whereas 3T3-Crk7 cells exhibited only a 1.4-fold increase in MAP kinase activity after SPP stimulation. Expression of dominant negative Ras in 3T3-Crk7 cells did not affect basal MAP kinase activity nor did it block the effect of SPP on MAP kinase activity. This lack of effect is likely due to the high basal activity. The presence of endogenous Ras in 3T3-Crk7 cells and dominant negative Ras in cells transfected with the construct encoding this protein is shown in Fig. 7. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Crk, at least in part, induces increased MAP kinase activity by a pathway other than the Ras pathway. We considered the possibility that the increased mitogenesis in response to SPP may not have been mediated entirely by Ras in the 3T3-Crk7 cells. As shown in Fig. 8, the basal level of thymidine incorporation in 3T3-Crk7 cells expressing dominant negative Ras was drastically reduced as compared with 3T3-Crk7 cells transfected with the neor vector. In addition, there was an attenuation of the SPP stimulation of thymidine incorporation when dominant negative Ras was expressed. Thus, although Crk mediation of SPP-induced MAP kinase activation was shown to be Ras-independent, functional Ras is essential for SPP-stimulated mitogenesis in cells expressing Crk. Results from other investigative groups indicate that Crk may function in Ras-independent as well as Ras-dependent signal transduction pathways, leading to increased mitogenesis. Early reports of downstream activators of Crk showed that Crk complexed with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors mSos and C3G, suggesting that Crk may activate the Ras pathway and, thus, MAP kinase, similar to Grb2 (24Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Masabumi S. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recently, it has become clear that stimulation of Crk phosphorylation and concomitant MAP kinase activation is not solely via the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. Expression of dominant negative Ras did not abrogate enhanced MAP kinase activity, and treatment with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 did not reduce the number of colonies in soft agar in NIH-3T3 cells expressing v-Crk (37Greulich H. Hanafusa H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1443-1451PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The finding that v-Crk, an oncogenic protein, could transform cells even in the presence of dominant negative Ras, however, may not predict the ability of c-Crk to be totally independent of the Ras pathway in mediating mitogenic or tumorigenic phenotypes. In fact, in the present report, the results indicate that c-Crk also mediates activation of MAP kinase by pathways other than the Ras pathway, but it further shows that mitogenesis is severely impaired if the Ras pathway is disrupted. In summary, we show that the sphingolipid metabolite SPP, and to a lesser extent, sphingosine induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the signaling molecule Crk. This occurred in both parental and Crk-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells as well as in Swiss 3T3 cells (data not shown). In contrast, ceramide, which has been implicated in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, did not induce phosphorylation of Crk. Interestingly, SPP did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the SH2 domain-containing signaling molecule Shc. Thus, SPP appears to activate an as yet unidentified tyrosine kinase that specifically phosphorylates Crk. One potential candidate for such a kinase is c-Abl, which is known to phosphorylate Crk (39Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, SPP-induced mitogenesis was significantly enhanced in Crk-overexpressing cells compared with the control, and SPP-induced mitogenesis was proportional to the level of Crk expression. SPP-induced mitogenesis occurred in parallel with activation of MAP kinase, but these SPP-stimulated events were variously affected by the expression of a dominant negative Ras. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Crk is a positive effector of SPP signaling, and furthermore, Crk sends multiple signals in response to upstream stimuli. We wish to thank Dr. Valerie Barr for her critical evaluation of the final manuscript."

According to this dual phospholipid binding model, a soluble enzyme must first associate with lipid (either specifically or nonspecifically) to anchor the enzyme to the lipid/water interface. Enzyme bound to the interface can then subsequently bind its substrate (within the interface) at the catalytic site where substrate hydrolysis occurs. For enzymes operating in the “scooting” or processive mode, multiple catalytic cycles can occur before the enzyme detaches from the interface (10Berg O.G. Yu B.Z. Rogers J. Jain M.K.

A mutant PLC δ1 (E54K) was constructed to generate a PH domain enhancement-of-function mutant. This single amino acid substitution at position 54 of PLC δ1 dramatically increases the activity of this enzyme. Using kinetic analyses we show that changes in both the equilibrium binding constant (K s ) andV max contribute to the increased rate of processive hydrolysis, whereas the interfacial binding constant (K m ) does not contribute. The position of this substitution within the PH domain of PLC δ1 uniquely demonstrates the functional importance of this domain. Further, the increase inV max for E54K suggests a new role for PH domains as allosteric regulatory sites. We show that this PH domain-mediated change in K s and V max is a mechanism for PLC δ1 activation and propose that this may be a general mechanism for mutant enzymes in which overactivation leads to human disease. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Radiolabeled phospholipids were purchased from DuPont NEN. PI(4,5)P2 was from Calbiochem.

All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C using prechilled buffers. The resulting powder was resuspended in 50 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween-20), and sonicated.

Final concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 were 1–325 μm, and the concentration of3[H]-PI(4,5)P2 was 0.033 μm in a final reaction volume of 30 μl. Final concentrations of PI were 10–150 μm, and 3[H]PI was 0.2 μm. Dried lipids were solubilized in a solution of dodecyl maltoside (ranging from at least 200 μm to 10 mm), 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The mixtures were sonicated, and the free Ca2+ was buffered using EGTA (stability constant for calcium/EGTA of 6.8 × 106m−1). Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme (0.888–566 ng) and carried out in a 30-μl volume containing mixed micelle substrate, enzyme, 10 μmor 1 mm free Ca2+, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% gelatin, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 250 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 25 μl of 20% Triton X-100. Samples were vortexed briefly and kept on ice for 10 min. Precipitates were sedimented at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min. Supernatants (280 μl each) were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and the aqueous phase (535 μl each), containing the 3[H]IP3 or3[H]IP product, was transferred to a scintillation vial and counted for 5 min. PLC δ1 activity was also determined using PI/deoxycholate mixed micelles. 50–90 ng of enzyme was added to a 50-μl assay buffer containing 300 μm PI, 25,000 cpm3[H]PI, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm Ca2+, and 1 mm EGTA. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 volumes of CHCl3/methanol/concentrated HCl (100:100:0.6 v/v/v) followed by 1 volume of 1 n HCl containing 5 mmEDTA. After vortexing and centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 5 min, the aqueous phase was removed and counted. 20 μg of PI(4,5)P2 and 400 μg of PE were mixed and dried down to a thin film under N2. PE at 400 μg/ml (520 μm) had previously shown no detectable protein binding. Lipid mixtures were lyophilized for >4 h and stored at −80 °C. Before use, 1 ml of 180 mm sucrose was added to the lipid mixtures and bubbled with N2 for 5 min. One ml of 2 × binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA) was added. The lipid mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 2,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was redissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. This 1 × PI(4,5)P2/PE lipid vesicle solution was serially diluted into solution concentrations of 0.07–18 μmPI(4,5)P2 and 2.0–260 μm PE (constant mol fractions). Enzyme was added to 190 μl of the PI(4,5)P2/PE mixture and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Enzyme/lipid mixtures were centrifuged at 4 °C, at 400,000 × g for 40 min. Supernatants were removed, and the pellet was redissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate-protein buffer and run in a 15% acrylamide gel. The proteins were then immunoblotted. The kinetics for the native and mutant enzyme were fit to the dual phospholipid binding model originally used to describe the kinetics of phospholipase A2 (1Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

E+S⇄k−1k1ES+S⇄k−2k2ESS→k3ES+P REACTION1According to this model, enzyme first associates (via interaction between a noncatalytic site and lipid moiety) with the lipid/detergent mixed micelle to form an enzyme-mixed micelle complex. This interfacial binding is a function of the bulk lipid concentration in the mixed micelle. Thus, to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant for interfacial binding (denoted here asK s ), we measured substrate hydrolysis as a function of bulk substrate concentration while keeping the mol fraction of substrate constant (case I). Once the enzyme-mixed micelle complex forms substrate hydrolysis can then proceed at the catalytic site. In contrast to interfacial binding, interfacial catalysis is not dependent on bulk concentration of substrate but rather is dependent on the mol fraction of substrate in the lipid/mixed micelle. Therefore, to assay substrate binding to the catalytic site as well as the maximum rate of interfacial catalysis, both the interfacial Michaelis constant (denoted here as K m ) and interfacialV max were determined by measuring substrate hydrolysis with increasing mol fractions of substrate while keeping the bulk concentration of substrate constant (case II). Covarying bulk lipid concentration and mol fraction yielded a sigmoidal rateversus [substrate] curve indicative of cooperativity (case III). Data from all cases were fit to the Hill equation (16James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Equation 1) using the program PRISM (Graphpad). ν=Vmax·[S] nK′+[S] nEquation 1 ν = rate, V max = maximum rate, [S] = initial substrate concentration, n = Hill coefficient, and K′ is a complex association factor. For case I data, Equation 1reduces to the Henri Michaelis-Menten equation or simple rectangular hyperbola with slope, n, equal to 1. Data were fit to Equation 2 from which values of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K s ) were obtained. ν=Vmax·[S]Ks+[S]Equation 2 For case II data, a sigmoidal curve fit better than a rectangular hyperbola with slope equal to 1. Therefore, data were fit to Equation 3 using the Hill coefficient derived from case III data (16James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) andK m as well as V maxdetermined. ν=Vmax·[X] case IIInKm+[X] case IIInEquation 3 K m is the interfacial Michaelis-Menten constant, V max is the interfacialV max at a constant PI(4,5)P2concentration of 100 μm, X is the mol fraction of substrate, and n case III is the Hill coefficient derived from case III. Data from case III were fit to a sigmoidal curve according to Equation 1 where K′ in this case is defined by the intrinsic association factors of different lipid binding sites with the Hill coefficient, n, equal to the total number of binding sites. The cDNA for human PLC δ1 was mutated to substitute a lysine for glutamic acid at residue position 54 (Fig. 1 A). This residue lies in the β3/β4 loop of the PH domain of PLC δ1 (17Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The backbone carbonyl of Glu-54 interacts with the 5 position of the inositol headgroup via a water-mediated hydrogen bond (17Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that lysine substitution at this position would enhance affinity for phosphoinositides. This might occur because lysine is a fully charged species at physiological pH, and this ionic interaction would lead not only to displacement of a water molecule but also to enhanced bonding of the positively charged lysine with the negatively charged oxygen at the 5 phosphate of the inositol head group (Fig. 1 B). Purified proteins were assayed for their ability to hydrolyze PI in a sodium deoxycholate/PI mixed micelle assay. Both native and mutant enzyme showed a very similar specific activity toward hydrolysis of PI, 0.95 μmol/min/mg for PLC δ1 and 1.2 μmol/min/mg for E54K, ensuring that the substitution E54K has not globally affected enzyme structure or activity. PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis was assayed according to case III conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Substrate hydrolysis was measured simultaneously varying the bulk concentration and mol fraction of PI(4,5)P2. This was accomplished using multiple assays where the concentration of dodecyl maltoside was kept constant at 200 μm (to ensure that [detergent] was greater than the critical micellar concentration) and the PI(4,5)P2 concentration increased from 1 to 75 μm. With dodecyl maltoside as diluent, rates of substrate hydrolysis are linear over 4 min, withr 2 values ranging from 0.95 to 0.99. When solid lines were fit to both sets of data using Equation 1 from “Experimental Procedures,” the Hill coefficient of PLC δ1 was calculated to be 2.2 ± 0.2 and for E54K was calculated to be 2.0 ± 0.1 (Table I). Further, Fig.2 shows that E54K has a dramatically enhanced rate of catalysis. Thus, the single substitution in the PH domain of this PLC δ1 dramatically enhances its rate of hydrolysis but does not change the inherent cooperativity in enzyme activity.Table IComparison of PLC δ1 and E54K kinetic constants derived from activity assays according to case I, II, and IIIHill coefficient n case IIIInterfacialK m case IIK s case IV max case IIμmμmol/min/mgPLCδ12.2 ± 0.20.012 ± 0.002210 ± 484.9 ± 0.3E54K2.0 ± 0.10.034 ± 0.0185 ± 3631 ± 3PLC δ1 and E54K catalytic hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2/dodecyl maltoside mixed micelles was carried out in 10 μmCa2+ (buffered with EGTA), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% gelatin, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.0.

Open table in a new tab PLC δ1 and E54K catalytic hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2/dodecyl maltoside mixed micelles was carried out in 10 μmCa2+ (buffered with EGTA), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% gelatin, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.0.

The effect of the mutation E54K on secondary binding within the interface (K m ) was determined by assaying native and mutant activity according to case II conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Multiple measurements of enzyme activity were made at a constant bulk concentration of PI(4,5)P2 (100 μm was chosen as this value is similar to the calculated K s for E54K (Table I)) and varying mol fractions of substrate (0.01–0.25 mol fraction PI(4,5)P2) using dodecyl maltoside as diluent (Fig. 3). The mol fraction of PI(4,5)P2 was not increased above 0.25 because the kinetics of PI(4,5)P2hydrolysis deviated from linearity above 0.25 (data not shown) as has been observed by other investigators (16James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Solid lines were fit to the data using Equation 3 (“Experimental Procedures”) which describes case II activity. The data fit a sigmoidal curve better than a hyperbolic one. This result has also been noted when measuring case II activity of PLC β (16James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and phospholipase A2 (1Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For PLC δ1, K m = 0.012 ± 0.002, and for E54KK m = 0.034 ± 0.01 (Table I).V max for PLC δ1 was 4.9 ± 0.3 μmol/min/mg and 31 ± 3 μmol/min/mg for E54K (Table I). The effect of E54K on initial binding to the interface was determined by assaying enzyme activity according to case I conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Multiple assays were performed with varying bulk concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 (10–325 μm) yet keeping the mol fraction of PI(4,5)P2 constant. This was achieved by increasing the bulk concentration of PI(4,5)P2(adding more lipid) while simultaneously increasing the concentration of dodecyl maltoside thus ensuring that the PI(4,5)P2 mol fraction was kept constant at 0.04. This value was chosen as it approximates the K m for E54K. Solid lines were fit to the data using Equation 2 which simply describes a rectangular hyperbola with slope equal to 1 from which values ofK s were determined. E54K was much more active than native enzyme even at relatively low substrate concentrations (Fig.4). The K s for PLC δ1 was calculated to be 210 ± 48 μm, whereas theK s for E54K was only 85 ± 36 μm(Table I). These values were within the range of constants determined previously for PLC β (16James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol.

In addition to the kinetic analysis, a thermodynamic equilibrium centrifugation binding assay was done to examine further initial binding to substrate. This assay was not used quantitatively since the kinetic data were more reliable, and the equilibrium association constant K a (or1Ks) has not always provided good agreement with affinity constants determined kinetically (13Cifuentes M.E.

However, it was used qualitatively as another independent measure of the relative affinities of native and mutant enzyme for PI(4,5)P2/PE LUVs. E.54K was associated with LUVs at much lower concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 than is the case for PLC δ1 (Fig. 5). At about 1.1 μm PI(4,5)P2 PLC δ1 was no longer associated with LUVs, suggesting that it no longer bound to PI(4,5)P2 at this concentration. However, even at concentrations as low as 0.07 μm PI(4,5)P2 E54K still associated with the LUVs. Neither enzyme bound to PE LUVs alone over the range of PE concentrations used in this assay (data not shown). PI hydrolysis was assayed according to case III conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of dodecyl maltoside was kept constant at 200 μm, and the PI concentration increased from 10 to 150 μm. When solid lines were fit to both sets of data using Equation 1 from “Experimental Procedures,” the Hill coefficient of PLC δ1 was calculated to be 1.9 ± 0.2 and for E54K was calculated to be 2.0 ± 0.4 (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 shows that both PLC δ1 and E54K have similar rates of catalysis for PI in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 (V max for PLC δ1 = 15 ± 2 nmol/min/mg andV max for E54K = 18 ± 2 nmol/min/mg). Assays were also performed in the presence of 50 μmPI(4,5)P2. Hydrolysis of substrate under these conditions was still cooperative with Hill coefficients of 1.5 ± 0.3 for PLC δ1 and 1.6 ± 0.6 for E54K. In the presence of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 6), PLC δ1 activity was enhanced 2-fold (V max = 27 ± 3 nmol/min/mg), but E54K activity was enhanced more than 5-fold (V max = 95 ± 10 nmol/min/mg). d-IP3 inhibited PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis for both native and mutant enzyme. Dodecyl maltoside/PI(4,5)P2 mixed micelles were assayed according to “Experimental Procedures” with constant PI(4,5)P2 (1 μm) and dodecyl maltoside (200 μm) concentrations. d-IP3 (0 to 25 μm) was added to each assay prior to addition of enzyme. Both enzymes were inhibited by d-IP3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). The shif"

We show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, unlike mammalian cells, the in vitro translational repressive effect of the mammalian iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) is independent of the site of its target in the 5′-UTR, the iron-responsive element (IRE). In vitro studies demonstrate that the binding affinity of IRP1 is also unaffected by the position of the IRE. Using IRE loop mutants, we observe an almost complete loss of IRP1-dependent repression in yeast concomitant with a 150-fold reduction in binding affinity for the IRE target. This mirrors the natural quantitative range of iron-induced adjustment of IRE/IRP1 affinity in mammalian cells. By enhancing the stability of the IRE stem-loop, we also show that its intrinsic folding energy acts together with the binding energy of IRP1 to give an additive capacity to restrict translational initiation. An IRE·IRP1 complex in a cap-distal position in yeast blocks scanning 40 S ribosomes on the 5′-UTR. It follows that the position effect of mammalian site-specific translational repression is dictated by the competence of the mammalian preinitiation complex to destabilize inhibitory structures at different steps of the initiation process.

RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions are dominant features of posttranscriptional gene expression. In eukaryotic translational initiation, ribosomes and a large number of initiation factors follow a complex series of steps leading to recognition of the first codon of a reading frame on the mRNA (1Merrick W. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mader S. Sonenberg N. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The primary pathway of eukaryotic translational initiation for the majority of cellular mRNAs is currently described by a working model which envisages that 40 S ribosomal subunits progressively scan the 5′-UTR 1The abbreviations used are: 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; IRP, iron regulatory protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; IRP, iron regulatory protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; wt, wild type. from the 5′ end in search of start codons (4Kozak M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Global regulation of translational initiation can be achieved via modifications of the initiation factors (5Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Control of initiation on individual mRNAs, on the other hand, is related to specific properties of the structure of mRNA and in particular the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). The most frequently observed form of control mediated by the 5′-UTR is attributed to intrinsic structural properties that impose restrictions on the movement of the ribosomal preinitiation complex along the mRNA (6Kozak M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 7Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). For example, sequence elements within the 5′-UTR that are internally complementary can form stem-loop structures that most likely have to be completely disrupted if an initiation complex is to scan through them. The ability of a given secondary structure in the 5′-UTR to act as a barrier to translational initiation is a function of this structure's free energy of formation; increased stability generally leads to stronger inhibition (7Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 8Baim S.B. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Cigan A.M.

Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the sensitivity of the host translational apparatus to this type of inhibition depends on the organism. Thus, mammalian ribosomes are not detectably impeded by structures that are strongly inhibitory to ribosomes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Kozak M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, a stem-loop structure with an estimated stability of approximately −18 kcal/mol−1 inhibits translation in S. cerevisiae by approximately 90% (8Baim S.B. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10Vega Laso M.R. Zhu D.

Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas an equivalent degree of inhibition in animal cells can only be achieved by a stem-loop with a stability exceeding −50 kcal/mol−1 provided this is not cap-proximal (6Kozak M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar).The impact of intramolecular folding within the 5′-UTR on translational initiation can be a function of the position of the resulting structures relative to other key elements of the mRNA. In higher eukaryotic cells, a given stem-loop structure is more inhibitory when it is cap-proximal than when it is positioned nearer the start codon (13Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A proposed explanation for this is that a structure close to the 5′ end of the mRNA interferes with the initial steps of ribosome mRNA binding, whereas a structure further away from the 5′ end interferes with the scanning process (13Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This implies that either the free energy changes of the early ribosome-mRNA interactions are smaller than the thermodynamic driving force intrinsic to the scanning process, or ribosomes can “skip” structural barriers more readily in a cap-distal position. However, neither of these principles seems to apply to S. cerevisiae, in which the position of a stem-loop structure within the 5′-UTR is of little significance in terms of the degree of translational inhibition observed (10Vega Laso M.R.

Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This discrepancy must reflect inherent differences in the pathways of translational initiation in the respective higher and lower eukaryotic systems.The above considerations are relevant to the function oftrans-acting regulators of translation that interact with the 5′-UTR. In particular, RNA-binding proteins are instrumental in the regulation of translational initiation in both prokaryotes (14McCarthy J.E.G. Gualerzi C. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 78-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and eukaryotes (15McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Standart N. Jackson R.J. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast to the constitutive limitation of translational initiation that can be imposed by intramolecular RNA-RNA interactions, the inducible synthesis or activation of an mRNA-binding repressor protein allows negative regulation within a defined period. The best characterized eukaryotic example of this type of regulation is based on the binding of the iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) to the iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5′-UTRs of the mRNAs encoding ferritin and erythroid 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase in vertebrate cells (17Harford J.B. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 239-266Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, both vertebrate and insect IRPs bind to an IRE in the 5′-UTR of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit b mRNA of Drosophila melanogaster (18Kohler S.A. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30781-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although most studies of the vertebrate system have focused on the role of IRP1, it was shown that both IRPs are expressed in all tissues and bind consensus IREs present in eukaryotic transcripts with equal affinity (19Butt J. Kim H.Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The affinity of IRP1 for IREs in these mRNAs is high (K d = 10−10–10−11m) at low iron concentrations and sufficient to block translation but is reduced 50- to 100-fold in the presence of iron levels in excess of the requirements of the cell. The expression of the IRP1 gene was also found to be sufficient for strong translational repression of an mRNA bearing an IRE-containing 5′-UTR in S. cerevisiae thus demonstrating that regulation requires no mammalian components other than IRP1 and IRE to function (20Oliveira C.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5316-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The influence of the binding of two other RNA-binding proteins to the 5′-UTR has also been investigated in yeast (21Stripecke R. Oliveira C.C. McCarthy J.E.G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5898-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). By inserting the appropriate recognition elements in the 5′-UTR of a reporter gene inS. cerevisiae, it was possible to demonstrate translational repression induced by the synthesis of either the human spliceosomal protein U1A or the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein in vivo. This confirmed that a translational regulatory system can in principle be created using the binding energy of any RNA-binding protein for its target.As with most other RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions involved in eukaryotic gene expression, the mechanistic basis of translational control is poorly understood. In this paper, we use the IRP-IRE interaction as a tool in experiments designed to address the principles governing the access of eukaryotic 40 S ribosomal subunits to the first initiation codon in an mRNA. Analogously to a stem-loop structure, the function of a protein acting as a repressor of initiation depends on its ability to regulate, directly or indirectly, this access. Translational regulation by IRP1 in higher cells is mediated by binding to an IRE that is proximal to the 5′ end of the mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 17Harford J.B. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 239-266Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, increasing the distance of the IRE beyond more than 50 nucleotides from the cap greatly reduces the repressive effect of IRP1 binding (22Goossen B. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro experiments have indicated that IRP1 binding to an IRE in a suitably cap-proximal position prevents the formation of stable 43 S complex-mRNA interactions at the 5′ end (23Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3882-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This seems to indicate that IRP1 can only function as a repressor if it acts directly on the initial 43 S-mRNA interaction, which raises the question of whether the impact of the binding of a trans-acting factor such as IRP1 is dictated by specific binding properties of the protein. Alternatively, the ability of 40 S ribosomal subunits to overcome structural resistance (which is a form of “thermodynamic competence”) at different steps of initiation has been suggested to play a key role (15McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is therefore evident that resolution of this issue will provide insight into the mechanism of translational regulation via the 5′-UTR. In the current study we have used the specific behavior of theS. cerevisiae translational apparatus to show how the significance of position and repressor binding affinity can only be understood in terms of the thermodynamic principles governing the interactions between the host translational apparatus and the mRNA. RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions are dominant features of posttranscriptional gene expression. In eukaryotic translational initiation, ribosomes and a large number of initiation factors follow a complex series of steps leading to recognition of the first codon of a reading frame on the mRNA (1Merrick W. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mader S. Sonenberg N. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The primary pathway of eukaryotic translational initiation for the majority of cellular mRNAs is currently described by a working model which envisages that 40 S ribosomal subunits progressively scan the 5′-UTR 1The abbreviations used are: 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; IRP, iron regulatory protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; IRP, iron regulatory protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; wt, wild type. from the 5′ end in search of start codons (4Kozak M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Global regulation of translational initiation can be achieved via modifications of the initiation factors (5Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Control of initiation on individual mRNAs, on the other hand, is related to specific properties of the structure of mRNA and in particular the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). The most frequently observed form of control mediated by the 5′-UTR is attributed to intrinsic structural properties that impose restrictions on the movement of the ribosomal preinitiation complex along the mRNA (6Kozak M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 7Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). For example, sequence elements within the 5′-UTR that are internally complementary can form stem-loop structures that most likely have to be completely disrupted if an initiation complex is to scan through them. The ability of a given secondary structure in the 5′-UTR to act as a barrier to translational initiation is a function of this structure's free energy of formation; increased stability generally leads to stronger inhibition (7Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 8Baim S.B. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10Vega Laso M.R. Zhu D. Sagliocco F. Brown A.J.P. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the sensitivity of the host translational apparatus to this type of inhibition depends on the organism. Thus, mammalian ribosomes are not detectably impeded by structures that are strongly inhibitory to ribosomes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Kozak M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, a stem-loop structure with an estimated stability of approximately −18 kcal/mol−1 inhibits translation in S. cerevisiae by approximately 90% (8Baim S.B. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10Vega Laso M.R. Zhu D.

Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas an equivalent degree of inhibition in animal cells can only be achieved by a stem-loop with a stability exceeding −50 kcal/mol−1 provided this is not cap-proximal (6Kozak M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The impact of intramolecular folding within the 5′-UTR on translational initiation can be a function of the position of the resulting structures relative to other key elements of the mRNA. In higher eukaryotic cells, a given stem-loop structure is more inhibitory when it is cap-proximal than when it is positioned nearer the start codon (13Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A proposed explanation for this is that a structure close to the 5′ end of the mRNA interferes with the initial steps of ribosome mRNA binding, whereas a structure further away from the 5′ end interferes with the scanning process (13Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This implies that either the free energy changes of the early ribosome-mRNA interactions are smaller than the thermodynamic driving force intrinsic to the scanning process, or ribosomes can “skip” structural barriers more readily in a cap-distal position. However, neither of these principles seems to apply to S. cerevisiae, in which the position of a stem-loop structure within the 5′-UTR is of little significance in terms of the degree of translational inhibition observed (10Vega Laso M.R. Zhu D. Sagliocco F. Brown A.J.P. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6453-6462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J.J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This discrepancy must reflect inherent differences in the pathways of translational initiation in the respective higher and lower eukaryotic systems. The above considerations are relevant to the function oftrans-acting regulators of translation that interact with the 5′-UTR. In particular, RNA-binding proteins are instrumental in the regulation of translational initiation in both prokaryotes (14McCarthy J.E.G. Gualerzi C. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 78-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and eukaryotes (15McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Standart N. Jackson R.J. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast to the constitutive limitation of translational initiation that can be imposed by intramolecular RNA-RNA interactions, the inducible synthesis or activation of an mRNA-binding repressor protein allows negative regulation within a defined period. The best characterized eukaryotic example of this type of regulation is based on the binding of the iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) to the iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5′-UTRs of the mRNAs encoding ferritin and erythroid 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase in vertebrate cells (17Harford J.B. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 239-266Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, both vertebrate and insect IRPs bind to an IRE in the 5′-UTR of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit b mRNA of Drosophila melanogaster (18Kohler S.A. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30781-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although most studies of the vertebrate system have focused on the role of IRP1, it was shown that both IRPs are expressed in all tissues and bind consensus IREs present in eukaryotic transcripts with equal affinity (19Butt J. Kim H.Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The affinity of IRP1 for IREs in these mRNAs is high (K d = 10−10–10−11m) at low iron concentrations and sufficient to block translation but is reduced 50- to 100-fold in the presence of iron levels in excess of the requirements of the cell. The expression of the IRP1 gene was also found to be sufficient for strong translational repression of an mRNA bearing an IRE-containing 5′-UTR in S. cerevisiae thus demonstrating that regulation requires no mammalian components other than IRP1 and IRE to function (20Oliveira C.C. Goossen B. Zanchin N.I.T. McCarthy J.E.G. Hentze M.W. Stripecke R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5316-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The influence of the binding of two other RNA-binding proteins to the 5′-UTR has also been investigated in yeast (21Stripecke R. Oliveira C.C. McCarthy J.E.G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5898-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). By inserting the appropriate recognition elements in the 5′-UTR of a reporter gene inS. cerevisiae, it was possible to demonstrate translational repression induced by the synthesis of either the human spliceosomal protein U1A or the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein in vivo. This confirmed that a translational regulatory system can in principle be created using the binding energy of any RNA-binding protein for its target.

In this paper, we use the IRP-IRE interaction as a tool in experiments designed to address the principles governing the access of eukaryotic 40 S ribosomal subunits to the first initiation codon in an mRNA. Analogously to a stem-loop structure, the function of a protein acting as a repressor of initiation depends on its ability to regulate, directly or indirectly, this access. Translational regulation by IRP1 in higher cells is mediated by binding to an IRE that is proximal to the 5′ end of the mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 17Harford J.B. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 239-266Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, increasing the distance of the IRE beyond more than 50 nucleotides from the cap greatly reduces the repressive effect of IRP1 binding (22Goossen B. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro experiments have indicated that IRP1 binding to an IRE in a suitably cap-proximal position prevents the formation of stable 43 S complex-mRNA interactions at the 5′ end (23Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3882-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This seems to indicate that IRP1 can only function as a repressor if it acts directly on the initial 43 S-mRNA interaction, which raises the question of whether the impact of the binding of a trans-acting factor such as IRP1 is dictated by specific binding properties of the protein.

It is therefore evident that resolution of this issue will provide insight into the mechanism of translational regulation via the 5′-UTR. In the current study we have used the specific behavior of theS. cerevisiae translational apparatus to show how the significance of position and repressor binding affinity can only be understood in terms of the thermodynamic principles governing the interactions between the host translational apparatus and the mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2013239918,"Although it is well established that the number of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors declines in cortical neurons exposed to GABAAreceptor agonists, the mechanisms responsible for this use-dependent down-regulation remain unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed: (i) agonist-evoked sequestration and degradation of surface GABAA receptors and (ii) repression of receptor subunit biosynthesis. We have addressed this problem using [35S]Met/Cys pulse-chase labeling of chick cortical neurons in culture and immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with an antibody (RP4) directed against a GABAA receptor α1-(331–381) fusion protein. Exposure of the cells to GABA or isoguvacine for 2 h to 4 days had no effect on the initial rate of35S incorporation into the GABAA receptor 51-kDa α1 polypeptide, but this rate declined by 33% after a 7-day treatment. This is consistent with a previous report (Baumgartner, B. J., Harvey, R. J., Darlison, M. G., and Barnes, E. M. (1994) Mol. Brain Res. 26, 9–17) that a 7-day GABA treatment of this preparation produced a 45% reduction in the α1 subunit mRNA level, while a 4-day exposure had no detectable effect. On the other hand, after a 4-day exposure to these agonists, a 30% reduction in the level of the α1 polypeptide was observed on immunoblots, similar to that found previously for down-regulation of GABAA receptor ligand-binding sites. Thus, the de novo synthesis of GABAA receptor α1 subunits is subject to a delayed use-dependent repression that was observed after, rather than before, the decline in neuronal levels of the polypeptide.Pulse-chase experiments showed a monophasic degradation of the GABAA receptor 35S-α1 subunit with at½ = 7.7 h, a process that was unaffected by the addition of GABA to neurons during the chase period. These nascent35S-labeled polypeptides are presumably diluted into the neuronal pool of unlabeled unassembled α1 subunits, which was found to exceed by a 4:1 molar ratio the amount assembled into [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites. Thus, the data reveal an alternative scheme for degradation of GABAA receptor polypeptides: a pathway that may participate in the agonist-independent degradation of unassembled receptor subunits. This differs from another pathway for the agonist-dependent degradation of mature GABAA receptors derived from the neuronal surface (Calkin, P. A., and Barnes, E. M., Jr. (1994) J. Biol. Chem.269, 1548–1553).

Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). There are four classes of GABAAR subunits (α, β, γ, and δ), and three of these have multiple members (α1–α6, β1–β4, γ1–γ4) (2Burt D.R. Curr. Top. Membr. 1994; 42: 215-263Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar,3Darlison M.G. Albrecht B.E. Semin. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 115-126Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the exact composition and stoichiometry of GABAARs is still uncertain, it is believed that the major form of the native protein is composed of α, β, and γ subunits (4Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 5Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 47: 181-234Google Scholar) arranged in a pentamer that encloses a central chloride channel (6Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Prolonged occupancy of GABAARs by agonists evokes a series of regulatory mechanisms that control the function, subcellular distribution, and number of receptors. Such use-dependent mechanisms can be partially distinguished by their temporal order, a paradigm used to describe down-regulation of G-protein-linked receptors (7Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 179: 171-188Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For GABAARs, the most rapid of these events is desensitization, which is characterized by a decline in the frequency of channel openings occurring within a few s after GABA application (8Celentano J.J. Wong R.K.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1039-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The kinetics of densensitization in isolated membrane patches show properties that are probably intrinsic to GABAARs rather than a result of extrinsic modification. Within 1–2 h of exposure of neurons to GABA or benzodiazepines, [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites (9Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and GABAAR 125I-polypeptides (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are sequestered from the cell surface. β-carboline-evoked internalization of GABAAR binding has also been described (11Katsura M. Ohkuma S. Jun X. Kuriyama K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 298: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The pathway for use-dependent GABAAR receptor sequestration is not yet defined, but clathrin-coated vesicles have been implicated as a vehicle (12Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Barnes Jr., E.M. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 39: 53-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following agonist-dependent internalization, GABAAR polypeptides appear to be rapidly degraded (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Much of the interest in these and related processes is due to a possible role in the development of tolerance and habituation to benzodiazepines and GABA mimetic drugs, a major problem in clinical applications (5Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 47: 181-234Google Scholar, 13Barnes Jr., E.M. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 39: 53-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that chronic (several days) exposure of primary neuronal cultures to GABA reduces the density of high affinity binding sites for GABAAR ligands (14Hablitz J.J. Tehrani M.H.J.

Brain Res. 1992; 16: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a process referred to as down-regulation. In this article we continue to use the term “down-regulation” to refer specifically to the agonist-evoked decline in the number of assembled plasma membrane receptors. Down-regulation is accompanied by reductions in GABAAR125I-polypeptides (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in α-subunit immunoreactivity (19Mhatre M.C. Ticku M.K. Mol.

Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed for this use-dependent GABAAR down-regulation: (i) repression of GABAAR subunit biosynthesis (21Montpied P. Ginns E.I. Martins B.M. Roca D. Farb D.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While there is general agreement that expression of GABAAR subunit mRNAs declines as a result of GABA exposure (19Mhatre M.C. Ticku M.K. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Montpied P. Ginns E.I. Martins B.M. Roca D. Farb D.H. Paul S.M. J. Biol.

(22Baumgartner B.J. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Barnes E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found that the decline in [3H]flunitrazepam binding preceded that for the α1 subunit mRNA. To examine these issues further, we have employed [35S]Met/Cys labeling to measure the synthesis and degradation of nascent GABAAR α1 subunit polypeptides in chick cortical neurons. The results are in accord with previous studies of the GABAA receptor α1 subunit transcript in these cells (22Baumgartner B.J. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Barnes E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), showing that repression of α1 subunit biosynthesis became detectable long after the GABA-evoked loss of the polypeptide. A fusion protein containing a region of the chick GABAA receptor α1 subunit, corresponding to amino acid residues 331–381 (24Bateson A.N. Harvey R.J. Wisden W. Glencourse T.A. Hick A.A. Hunt S.P. Barnard E.A. Darlison M.G. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was cloned in pRSET-B, expressed inEscherichia coli JM109, and purified by Ni2+affinity chromatography according to the general procedures of Krollet al. (25Kroll D.J. Abdel-Malek H. Marcell T. Simpson S. Chen C. Guitierrez A. Lustbader J.W. Hoeffler J.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This protein was used for rabbit immunizations, and the resulting RP4 antiserum was characterized by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Details of these procedures and the antibody characterization appear elsewhere (26Miranda J.D. Barnes Jr., E.M. Soc. Neurosci. Abs. 1995; 21: 1839Google Scholar, 27Miranda J.D. Liu S.-C. Diaz M.E. Barnes Jr., E.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A crude IgG fraction, prepared by elution of the antiserum from CM Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad), was absorbed on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) derivatized with the α1-(331–381) fusion protein. The antibody was eluted with 4 m MgCl2 (pH 6.4), dialyzed against TBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and concentrated. The procedures of Tehrani and Barnes (28Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were used for extraction and immunoprecipitation of central [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites from chick cortical neurons. Western blotting was performed according to Calkin and Barnes (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 1 μg/ml purified RP4 antibody or a 1:100 dilution of RP4 antiserum. Primary cultures of embryonic chick cortical neurons were prepared according to Thampyet al. (29Thampy K. Sauls C.D. Brinkley B.R. Barnes Jr., E.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1983; 8: 101-110Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Where indicated, GABA or other test compounds were added 3 h after plating the cells. Neurons cultured for 4–7 days in 60-mm Petri dishes were washed and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking Met and Cys. The cells were pulsed by the addition of fresh medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (Translabel, NEN Life Science Products) and GABAA receptor ligands (where indicated) and returned to the incubator for 2 h. For chase experiments, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml each of Met and Cys and then incubated in conditioned medium containing 1 mm Met, 1 mmCys, and 200 μm GABA (where indicated) for 3–48 h. Incubations were terminated by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmMet and 1 mm Cys. The cells were collected and homogenized in extraction buffer (2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Met, 1 mm Cys, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.1 mg/ml each of trypsin inhibitors II-O and II-S, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml phosphoramidon in TBS). The homogenates were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. After 30 min on ice, the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and precleared twice withStaphylococcus aureus cells, and aliquots were withdrawn for determination of total 35S incorporation by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid precipitates were washed with 70% ethanol and then washed with ether and counted. The remainder of the extract was used for double immunoprecipitation as described by Firestone and Winguth (30Firestone G.L. Winguth S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both immunoprecipitations utilized overnight incubations with 1 μg of affinity-purified RP4 antibody. The precipitates were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The gels were prepared for autoradiography as described by Skinner and Griswold (31Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Autoradiographic densities from the pulse-chase and immunoblotting experiments were determined by using a laser scanner and Scan Analysis software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) following the procedures described by Kendrick et al. (32Kendrick N.C. Johansen J.J. Lee P.R. Santek D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The linear range of analysis for both types of experiments was determined by application of a series of sample dilutions to the gel. Linear regression analysis of the resulting calibration curves gave correlation coefficients >0.990, and all densities were quantified within this linear range of analysis. Student's two-tailedt test was used for statistical evaluation of the data. For identification and quantitation of GABAA receptor α1 subunits from chick cortical neurons in culture, we utilized an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (RP4) directed against an α1-(331–381) fusion protein. On Western blots (Fig. 1), this antibody reacted with a single 51-kDa neuronal polypeptide, the mass expected for the GABAAR α1 subunit (33DeBlas A.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 12: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34McKernan R.M. Cox P. Gillard N.P. Whiting P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 44-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After preabsorption with the α1-(331–381) fusion protein, antibody RP4 did not give detectable labeling of the blots. Cross-reactivity with proteins in the 53–66-kDa range expected for GABAAR α2–α6 subunits (33DeBlas A.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 12: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was not observed. Treatment of the neuronal membranes with endoglycosidase H caused a shift in the apparent mass of the immunoreactive polypeptide from 51 to 48 kDa (not shown), the latter corresponding to the value found for the unglycosylated GABAAR α1 subunit (35Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Additional experiments (not shown) established that 58 ± 3% of the [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites extracted from 100 μg of neuronal membrane protein were precipitated at a saturating level (1 μg) of RP4 antibody. Similar values were obtained with membrane extracts from chick cerebral cortex. To estimate the molar quantities of the GABAAR α1 subunit produced by the neurons under these conditions, we utilized 10–50 fmol of the α1-(331–381) fusion protein as a standard for quantitative Western blotting (Fig. 2). These calibration curves were then used for the analysis of densities for the native α1 subunit obtained from immunoblots similar to those in Fig. 1. When applied to gels along with the standards, membrane proteins (10–50 μg) from 4-day cultures gave signals for the native 51-kDa α1 subunit (not shown) that were within the linear range of densitometric analysis as illustrated in Fig. 2. By this approach we obtained for the neuronal α1 subunit a value of 0.65 ± 0.11 pmol/mg of membrane protein (mean ± S.E., n = 3 culture preparations, each analyzed on a separate blot). Quantitative Western blotting was also used to examine the modulation of GABAAR α1 subunit polypeptides during the exposure of neuronal cultures to receptor agonists. GABA (200 μm) was added 3 h after plating neurons, and the cells were cultured for 4 days. With the chick cortical preparation, similar procedures were employed previously to examine the use-dependent decline of GABAAR ligand binding sites, 125I-polypeptides, and subunit mRNAs (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hablitz J.J. Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. Brain Res. 1989; 501: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Baumgartner B.J. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Barnes E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The concentration of GABA (200 μm) used in these experiments was also shown to be nearly saturating for down-regulation (14Hablitz J.J. Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. Brain Res. 1989; 501: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, chronic exposure to GABA or to isoguvacine, a GABAA-specific agonist, produced a decline in the level of the 51-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide (Fig. 3). Densitometric analysis of a series of such experiments revealed an attenuation of 27–32% in the presence of either ligand. These effects of GABA and isoguvacine were statistically significant (p < 0.02). Since isoguvacine is not a substrate for GABA transport or GABA transaminase, the data indicate that neuronal uptake or degradation does not limit the effectiveness of GABA in these experiments. The decline in α1 subunits produced by GABA was blocked by the addition of the GABAA-specific antagonist R5135 (3α-hydroxy-16-imino-5β-17-aza-androstan-11-one), indicating the necessity of receptor occupancy. R5135 was shown previously to block the GABA-evoked sequestration and down-regulation of GABAAreceptors (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the relative rates of GABAAR α1 subunit biosynthesis, the neurons were pulsed for 2 h in culture with 35S-Met/Cys, and extracts were prepared from 100,000 × g pellets of crude membranes. The extracts were analyzed by double immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified RP4 antibody and separation of the precipitates on SDS gels. As shown in Fig. 4, a major 51-kDa 35S-polypeptide and a minor labeled protein at 56 kDa was obtained. Preabsorption of the RP4 antibody with α1-(331–381) fusion protein eliminated the 51-kDa band, while the 56-kDa peptide remained. On the other hand, pretreatment of the antibody with a GABAAR α1-(2–202) fusion protein had little effect. The amount of the 56-kDa product in the immunoprecipitates was also much more variable than that of the 51-kDa polypeptide. This identifies the 51-kDa35S-polypeptide as the GABAAR α1 subunit and the 56-kDa band as contaminant. It is also worth noting that coprecipitation of other GABAAR 35S-subunits, which presumably could have assembled with α1 subunits, would not be favorable using the double immunoprecipitation technique. Additional studies (Fig. 5) demonstrated that the amount of35S incorporation into the α1 subunit during a 2-h pulse was in the linear time range for labeling and that pulses longer than 2 h departed from linearity. Using [3H]flunitrazepam binding, it was established that a saturating amount of antibody RP4 was present in all immunoprecipitations.Figure 3Quantitative immunoblotting of membranes from neurons chronically exposed to GABAAR ligands. Upper panel, neurons were cultured for 4 days without additions to the medium (C) or with 200 μm GABA (G), 200 μm GABA plus 1 μm R5135 (G + R), 1 μm R5135 (R), or 200 μm isoguvacine (I).

The GABA-evoked repression observed under these conditions was prevented by R5135. Quantitation of autoradiographs from three such experiments revealed that both agonists produced a decline of 33% in the rate of α1 subunit expression (Fig.4), and the effects of both were statistically significant (p < 0.025). The S.E. in these 35S incorporation experiments was typically ±6%. These agonist treatments did not produce a detectable change in the rate of 35S incorporation into the general pool of membrane proteins (not shown). It is noteworthy that, as illustrated in Fig. 6, a 4-day exposure of the cells to GABA or isoguvacine failed to significantly repress de novo synthesis of the α1 polypeptide. Although the S.E. values in Fig. 6 were similar to those in Fig. 4, pvalues of 0.574 and 0.548 were obtained for the levels of35S-α1 polypeptides found in cells cultured for 4 days with GABA or isoguvacine, respectively, relative to the control (Fig.6). Likewise, when neurons were cultured for 4 or 7 days in the absence of agonist, the presence of GABA during a 2-h pulse did not alter the level of 35S incorporation into this subunit (not shown). This indicates the lack of an acute effect of GABA that could have faded during the chronic exposures. To determine the rate of GABAAR α1 subunit degradation, neurons from 4-day cultures were pulsed for 2 h with [35S]Met/Cys and then chased in conditioned media for 3–48 h. The level of the 35S-α1 polypeptide declined continuously during the first 24-h period and was barely detectable thereafter (Fig. 7). Densitometric analysis of three such experiments yielded a t½ = 7.7 ± 0.8 h for the α1 subunit. The general pool of neuronal membrane35S-proteins was much more stable, declining with an apparent t½ > 24 h. Since previous studies suggested a GABA-evoked degradation of GABAA receptor125I-polypeptides derived from the cell surface (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of adding GABA to the chase medium was examined. However, the presence of GABA during the chase period had no discernible effect on the rate of degradation of either the GABAAR35S-α1 subunit or the membrane protein pool. The α1 subunit is a major component of GABAARs in most brain regions and an important determinant for receptor pharmacology. It also forms part of the high affinity site for benzodiazepine binding (36Benke D. Cicin-Sain A. Mertens S. Mohler H. J. Receptor Res. 1991; 11: 407-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Pollard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21160-21165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there have been multiple reports of a decline in GABAAR α1 subunit mRNA levels that are evoked by exposure of neurons to GABA agonists (21Montpied P. Ginns E.I. Martins B.M. Roca D. Farb D.H. Paul S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6011-6014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baumgartner B.J. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Barnes E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Hirouchi M. Ohkuma S. Kuriyama K. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), there is little related information about the corresponding polypeptide. Although Calkin and Barnes (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that chronic exposure of chick cortical neurons to GABA agonists produced a decline in GABAAR 125I-polypeptides, the α1 subunit was only tentatively identified as part of this labile pool. In the present paper, we show that a 27–32% decline of GABAAR α1 subunit immunoreactivity was produced by 4-day agonist treatments. This reduction is somewhat less than that found for [3H]flunitrazepam binding (31–50%) under comparable conditions (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hablitz J.J. Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. Brain Res. 1989; 501: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, at saturation with the α1 subunit antibody, 58 ± 3% of the ]3H[flunitrazepam binding sites were precipitated, suggesting that only this fraction of the binding sites contains α1 subunits. The GABA-evoked decline in α1 subunits was prevented by R5135, a GABA antagonist shown to be effective against various subtypes of native GABAAreceptors (38Maksay G. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1865-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Alone, R5135 had little effect, showing that endogenous GABA makes little contribution in these experiments. Isoguvacine, a GABAA-specific agonist that is not subject to degradation or uptake by neurons, produced a decrease of α1 subunit immunoreactivity that was equivalent to that produced by GABA. Thus, the first conclusion to be drawn is that occupancy of GABAAreceptors produces a decline in the level of α1 subunits that is sufficient to account for receptor down-regulation. To examine the mechanism of the use-dependent decline in α1 subunits, we measured rates of [35S]Met/Cys incorporation by immunoprecipitation. Since these experiments were conducted with 35S pulses whose duration was within the linear range of incorporation (Fig. 5), the results may be taken to reflect the initial rates of α1 subunit synthesis de novo. To our knowledge, these are the first such measurements for any GABAAR subunit. Neither acute treatment of the cells with GABA during the 2-h 35S pulse nor prior chronic treatment for 4 days had a detectable effect on α1 subunit synthesis. However, after 7 days of exposure to GABA or isoguvacine, a significant decline (33%) in the rate of α1 subunit translation was observed. This use-dependent repression was also prevented by R5135. These findings are in good agreement with previous measurements of GABAAR α1 subunit mRNA levels under comparable conditions in this preparation (22Baumgartner B.J. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Barnes E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GABA administration to the neurons for 7 days produced a significant reduction (47 ± 8%) in the level of α1 subunit mRNA, while a 4-day treatment had no effect. That the α1 subunit mRNA represents a sensitive indicator for repression is indicated by an equivalent agonist-dependent decline in GABAAR α1, β2, β4, and γ2 subunit mRNAs (22Baumgartner B.J. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Barnes E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, our current findings support a delayed use-dependent repression of GABAA receptor subunit biosynthesis. It is apparent that this repression is evoked only after a long delay, long after the neuronal pool of GABAA receptor α1 subunits and assembled receptors has declined. This notion is also consistent with studies of GABAAR agonist administration in vivo, which show a loss of receptor binding sites before detectable changes in pools of GABAAR subunit mRNAs (39Kang I. Miller L.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1285-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40Calkin P.A. Baumgartner B.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although it is conceivable that small reductions in GABAAR α1 subunit biosynthesis occurring within the first 4 days of GABA exposure could have escaped detection (cf. Fig. 6), the decline in the synthetic rate was readily measured after longer treatments (Fig. 4). Collectively, this leads to a second conclusion, that the biosynthesis of GABAA receptor α1 subunits is subject to use-dependent repression, but this process was detectable only after, rather than before, receptor down-regulation. To examine the turnover of GABAAR α1 subunits, we utilized an 35S pulse-chase technique. In the chick cortical neuron cultures we found a monophasic decline in the35S-α1 polypeptide with a t½ = 7.7 h. Exposure of the neurons to GABA during the 24-h chase period had no discernible effect on the degradation of the35S-α1 subunit. Thus, the third conclusion from our experiments is that nascent GABAA receptor α1 polypeptides are degraded by an agonist-independent pathway. As discussed below, we believe that this differs from another, previously described pathway for the agonist-dependent degradation of mature GABAA receptors derived from the cell surface (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although GABAA receptor 35S-subunit turnover has not been previously measured, the degradation of receptor polypeptides photolabeled with [3H]flunitrazepam has been examined (41Borden L.A. Czajkowski C. Chan C.Y. Farb D.H. Science. 1984; 226: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Degradation of the photolabeled 48- and 51-kDa proteins in chick brain neurons was biphasic, showing t½ values of 3.8 and 32 h. Why do these values differ from the one obtained from our 35S measurements? We presume that thet½ values obtained by Borden et al.(41Borden L.A. Czajkowski C. Chan C.Y. Farb D.H. Science. 1984; 226: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reflect properties of assembled receptors because coexpression of GABAAR α and γ subunits is necessary for [3H]flunitrazepam binding (4Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GABAARs assembled from α1, β2, and γ2 subunits are transported to the cell surface, while unassembled α1 subunits are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (35Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It therefore appears likely that the pathways for degradation of unassembled and assembled α1 subunits differ as illustrated in Fig. 8. If the35S-α1 polypeptides from our labeling studies are mostly unassembled, then differences in degradation pathways could account for the discordance of our data with that of Borden et al.(41Borden L.A. Czajkowski C. Chan C.Y. Farb D.H. Science. 1984; 226: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Does the turnover of GABAAR α1 subunits in our pulse-chase measurements reflect unassembled or assembled subunits? Since our double immunoprecipitation procedure precludes a direct answer to this question, our argument that most of the nascent35S-α1 subunits are unassembled relies on indirect evidence. From the quantitative immunoblotting experiments, we estimate that cortical neurons, 4 days in culture, contain approximately 0.65 ± 0.11 pmol of α1 subunit/mg of membrane protein. Previous determinations of [3H]flunitrazepam binding density in these preparations gave a value of 0.22 ± 0.01 pmol/mg (14Hablitz J.J. Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. Brain Res. 1989; 501: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 42Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1986; 25: 91-98Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since 58% of these [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites contain α1 subunits (i.e. immunoprecipitable by RP4 antibody in the present study), the density of receptors containing coassemblies of α1 and γ subunits is estimated to be 0.13 pmol/mg. By this approach, the ratio of unassembled to assembled GABAA receptor α1 subunits is approximately 4:1. This is consistent with quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction data showing that the level of GABAAR α1 subunit mRNA greatly exceeds levels of the other subunits in these preparations (22Baumgartner B.J. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Barnes E.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, our data support the hypothesis that most of the α1 subunits in the cortical neuron cultures are unassembled, although further work is necessary to establish this conclusively. We believe that our chase experiments reflect the degradation of unassembled 35S-α1 polypeptides, which would presumably be diluted into a large pool of unlabeled α1 subunits retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. We have previously shown that an acute (4-h) exposure of cortical neurons to 100 μm GABA in culture produces an increase in the intracellular pool of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites (9Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This phenomenon could have been due to an increase in the synthesis of new receptors or a sequestration of existing receptors. Since the presence of GABA during the 35S pulse failed to influence GABAAR α1 subunit biosynthesis, our current findings lend support to a mechanism involving agonist-dependent sequestration of binding sites from the surface (9Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Further studies by Calkin and Barnes (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that surface GABAAR 125I-polypeptides, including a probable α1 subunit, were sequestered during 2–4 h of GABA exposure. In the absence of GABA, sequestration was not observed. Although small, the sequestered pool of 125I-subunits was quite labile, having an approximate t½ of 2 h. However, during longer agonist exposures, the number of intracellular receptors stabilized, presumably due to replenishment from the surface, and the surface pool declined. If this decline in surface subunits cannot be accounted for by reductions in de novo synthesis, as our current findings indicate, they must have been degraded (cf. Fig. 8). Thus, the biosynthetic data described here help support the previous hypothesis that GABAARs are regulated by use-dependent sequestration and degradation. If agonist-dependent degradation of surface GABAA receptors occurs, how could our 35S pulse/chase experiments fail to detect it? Our answer to this paradox is that assembly and transport of the nascent 35S-α1 subunits appears to be slow and inefficient. As discussed above, our data suggest that most of the α1 subunits in the neurons remain unassembled. Furthermore, of the newly synthesized/assembled sites photolabeled by [3H]flunitrazepam (Fig. 8, steps 1 and 2), only 4% reach the neuronal surface in 4 h (43Czajkowski C. Farb D.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar). On this basis, we believe it is unlikely that a substantial fraction of nascent 35S-α1 subunits would have acquired a surface localization during the 24-h “window” of our chase experiments. Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for the use-dependent decline in surface GABAA receptors: (i) agonist-dependent sequestration and degradation of surface receptors (10Calkin P.A. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) repression of GABAA receptor subunit biosynthesis (21Montpied P. Ginns E.I. Martins B.M. Roca D. Farb D.H. Paul S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6011-6014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the findings in the current report are consistent with the operation of both mechanisms, our data show that hypothesis II cannot account for the onset of down-regulation. Repression of GABAAR α1 subunit biosynthesis was observed only after the detection of down-regulation. Following the initial binding of externally applied agonists, a small pool of surface GABAA receptors appears to be rapidly sequestered and degraded, while repression of the synthesis of new receptor subunits is a much slower process. The nature of the intracellular signals that link gene expression to the surface binding of agonists is not understood. The temporal order of these events prompts speculation that such signals could be provided by molecules made available by the sequestration/degradation pathway. We thank Drs. David Sweatt and M. H.

To find affinity labels for the latter one, the effects of 2′-O-dansylated ATP analogs on Na+/K+-ATPase and its partial activities were analyzed. DANS-ATP (2′-O-(6-dimethylaminonaphthalenesulfonyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate) inhibited noncompetitively at low ATP concentrations and competitively at high ATP concentrations the Na+/K+-activated hydrolysis of ATP under turnover conditions. It interacted preferentially with the low affinity ATP site as shown by its protective effect against the inactivation of Na+/K+-ATPase by Co(NH3)4ATP and Cr(H2O)4ATP. DANS-N3-ATP, however, inactivated Na+/K+-ATPase. The initial velocity of inactivation shows a sigmoid concentration dependence that was converted to a hyperbola in the presence of ATP. DANS-N3-ATP inhibited competitively the K+-activated hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in a fluorescein isothiocyanate-blocked enzyme but did not effect Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme formation from [γ-32P]ATP in a Co(NH3)4PO4-blocked enzyme. These effects could be described by a Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model assuming two nucleotide binding sites in strong cooperation. Fitting all data to this model revealed that ATP was bound in a negative cooperative way with a K d = 0.3–1 μmto the first site and a K d = 100–120 μm to the second site of the enzyme containing already one ATP bound. The hydrolysis of ATP through a pathway with two ATP bound was 30 times faster than hydrolysis with one ATP bound. DANS-N3-ATP bound in a positive cooperative way with aK d = 500 ± 100 μm to the first site and a K d = 2.5 ± 0.5 μm to the second site containing already one DANS-N3-ATP bound. Therefore, DANS-N3-ATP may be an useful affinity marker of the low affinity, regulatory ATP site. Na+/K+-transport through mammalian cell membranes by Na+/K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37) needs the interaction of ATP sites with different binding affinities during catalysis: one with catalytic (high affinity site) and one with regulatory properties (low affinity site).

DANS-N3-ATP inhibited competitively the K+-activated hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in a fluorescein isothiocyanate-blocked enzyme but did not effect Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme formation from [γ-32P]ATP in a Co(NH3)4PO4-blocked enzyme. These effects could be described by a Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model assuming two nucleotide binding sites in strong cooperation. Fitting all data to this model revealed that ATP was bound in a negative cooperative way with a K d = 0.3–1 μmto the first site and a K d = 100–120 μm to the second site of the enzyme containing already one ATP bound.

Therefore, DANS-N3-ATP may be an useful affinity marker of the low affinity, regulatory ATP site. The sodium pump of animal cell membranes converts the energy of ATP hydrolysis into an electrochemical gradient of sodium and potassium ions. The process of ion transport is intimately connected to oscillations of the enzyme protein of Na+/K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37) between at least two different conformations called E 1 andE 2. Many of the events during cation transport can be described by the Albers-Post model (for an overview, see Ref.1Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd ed. Plenum Publishers, New York1985: 35-114Crossref Google Scholar): Na+/K+-ATPase binds ATP with high affinity to the sodium exporting E 1-form (E 1ATP binding site) and is consequently phosphorylated. After the release of sodium at the outer cell side and the following dephosphorylation, the enzyme needs a second binding of ATP. Therefore, ATP binds with low affinity to theE 2-form (E 2ATP binding site) of Na+/K+-ATPase and enhances the rate-limiting step of deocclusion of potassium during import (2Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast to expectations deriving from this single ATP site model with its subsequent formation of the ATP sites, use of substitution-inert MgATP complex analogs has led to the postulate of acoexistence (in time and at different places) of both ATP sites (4Schoner W. Thoenges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control, and Its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar). The Repke-Schön-Stein model (5Repke K.R.H. Schön R. Acta Biol. Med. Germ. 1973; 31: K19-K30PubMed Google Scholar) attempts to explain such a situation by shifting the energy excess of the sodium-transporting subunit to the potassium-transporting subunit. Each subunit follows a whole Albers-Post cycle but 180° out of phase. The bicyclic model of Plesner, on the other hand, gets its power from two ATP binding sites whose partial activities (Na+-ATPase, K+-phosphatase) are lower than the overall reaction (Na+/K+-ATPase). A single subunit does not have to pass all of the intermediates of the Albers-Post circle, but the sum fulfills all steps required for a whole turnover (6Plesner I.W. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, there is still a lot of discussion about the intermediates shared by the partial reactions and the overall reaction (7Campos M. Beaugé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18028-18036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufmann S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Bredenbröcker B. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Scheiner-Bobis G. Fahlbusch K. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The activities of theE 1ATP binding site (for example ATP/ADP exchange and “frontdoor phosphorylation”) are unaffected by the inactivation of the E 2ATP binding site by Co(NH3)4PO4 (11Buxbaum E. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, CrAMP-PCP, which inactivates the E 1ATP site but is unable to phosphorylate it, does not affect activities of theE 2ATP site, namely 86Rb+occlusion, K+-activated phosphatase activity, and “backdoor phosphorylation” (12Hamer E. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Linnertz H. Thoenges D. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although substitution-inert metal ATP complexes are on the one hand helpful tools to get information on basic properties of the coexisting ATP binding sites, on the other hand their suicidal properties and the low affinity to theE 2ATP site hamper a study of the interaction of these sites during catalysis. The interactions of the two ATP sites during Na+/K+ transport would be much easier to study if fluorescent ATP analogs exist which are able to discriminate between E 1ATP and E 2ATP sites. So far only the fluorescing TNP-ATP is known which binds with high affinity to the E 1ATP site but is not hydrolyzed there (14Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2346-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether DANS-ATP and DANS-N3-ATP are substrates of Na+/K+-ATPase and are able to distinguish between E 1 and E 2conformations. We became aware that both compounds are not hydrolyzed and bind with much higher affinity to the E 2ATP than to the E 1ATP binding site. This conclusion could be derived from studies of the protective effect of dansylated ATP analogs on the remaining Na+/K+-ATPase activity after selective poisoning of any ATP site by CrATP or CoATP as well as by kinetic analysis of the inactivation process of the enzyme by DANS-N3-ATP. This led to a kinetic model describing the overall Na+/K+-supported ATP hydrolysis as an interaction of two coexisting nucleoside triphosphate binding sites which vary in their cooperativity depending on the nature of the substrate molecule bound.DISCUSSIONThe function and location of the low affinity ATP binding site are still under discussion. There is much evidence that two ATP binding sites coexist in working Na+/K+-ATPase (4Schoner W. Thoenges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control, and Its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, if these sites are located on the same or on different catalytic subunits or if one subunit subsequently changes its behavior. Recently, Askari's group pointed out that coupling between the low and high affinity ATP sites is essential for the overall catalysis itself and not only for K+ deocclusion. This group proposed also that the two ATP sites are distinct physical entities and that both conformational states may coexist (26Zolotarjova N. Periyasamy S.M. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3989-3995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the existence of two separated ATP binding sites was also obtained in phosphorylation experiments by extraphosphorylation from p-nitrophenyl phosphate (27Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and by superphosphorylation from ATP (28Peluffo R.D. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6596-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explain their data, Peluffoet al. developed a model which allowed binding of up to three molecules of ATP to sites which exist in a “resting state” of the enzyme. This disappears as soon as the enzyme starts catalysis (29Peluffo R.D. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negative cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis in the overall Na+/K+-ATPase has been interpreted to indicate interaction of ATP sites within an oligomeric enzyme (5Repke K.R.H. Schön R. Acta Biol. Med. Germ. 1973; 31: K19-K30PubMed Google Scholar). However, negative cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis which does not require an oligomeric structure has been suggested from experiments on analytical ultracentrifugation of the solubilized Na+/K+-ATPase (30Ward G.W. Cavieres J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, an equilibrium of protomeric, diprotomeric, and oligomeric forms of the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase within cell membranes during pumping cannot be excluded (31Boldyrev A.A. Quinn P.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).The intention of the present work was to get information on the mechanism of the sodium pump and on the interaction of ATP binding sites in catalysis as well as to answer the question as to whether a fluorescent ATP analog may exist which binds with high affinity to the low affinity ATP binding site, the E 2ATP site. Therefore, 2′-O-dansylated ATP derivatives were investigated for their substrate function and their affinities for the ATP binding sites. It turned out that dansylated ATP analogs are not hydrolyzed but interact with the sodium pump with high affinity at a low affinity ATP site. A high affinity of DANS-ATP to the low affinityE 2ATP site could be verified by its protective action against the inactivation by CoATP (Fig. 3 A). CoATP is an inactivating metal-ATP analog that affects typical reactions of theE 2ATP site but does not alter partial activities of the E 1ATP site (4Schoner W. Thoenges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control, and Its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar). A protective effect against the inactivation of the E 1ATP site by CrATP was seen with low affinity of DANS-ATP (Fig. 3 B). CrATP is known to arrest the enzyme in an E 1Cr-P state (4Schoner W. Thoenges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control, and Its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar). The kinetic constants were evaluated by a modification of the Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model taking into account the specific behavior of the metal-ATP analogs and of the protecting ligands (Fig. 1, Equations 3 and 4). CoATP is known to bind at theE 1ATP binding site with high affinity but without inactivation (32Serpersu E.H. Bunk S. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Likewise, we assume binding of CrATP at theE 2ATP binding site without inactivation at this site. However, the strong negative cooperativity in complexes with CrATP (b = 300, c = 750) also allows an interpretation without binding of CrATP at theE 2ATP binding site. Obviously the kinetics of CrATP and CoATP are special cases of the general two-site model of Koshland-Némethy-Filmer. DANS-N3-ATP inactivated Na+/K+-ATPase by a biphasic time course (Fig.4 A), and the initial velocity of inactivation showed a sigmoidal concentration dependence (Fig. 4 B). One explanation for a biphasic time course is binding of DANS-N3-ATP at two different ATP sites. The modification at one of these sites may not fully inactivate the enzyme. DANS-N3-ATP also decreased the activity of the Na+-dependent protein-phosphokinase and the activity of K+-activatedp-nitrophenylphosphatase in the native enzyme (data not shown). Further experiments with E 1ATP- andE 2ATP-blocked enzyme preparations supported the idea of a higher affinity of DANS-N3-ATP with theE 2ATP site. The K+-activated phosphatase was lost in a CrAMP-PCP-enzyme (where theE 1ATP site is occupied) with high affinity (Fig.5 B), and the analysis of the competitive protective action of ATP against the DANS-N3-ATP-induced inactivation of K+-activated phosphatase could be determined to occur at a low affinity site for ATP (Fig. 5 C, inset). On the contrary, DANS-N3-ATP had no influence on Na+-dependent phosphorylation of the enzyme protein of the E 1ATP site in a Co(NH3)4PO4-inactivated Na+/K+-ATPase (where theE 2ATP site is blocked) (Fig. 5 A).The Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model used here explains our findings by a two-site competitive model with different affinities to the binding sites (Fig. 1). The model presented is similar to a reaction scheme used by the group of Beaugé to explain their findings with another P-type ATPase, the H+/K+-ATPase of plants (33Roberts G. Berberián G. Beaugé L Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast to the fixed coupling in the Repke-Schön-Stein model (5Repke K.R.H. Schön R. Acta Biol. Med. Germ. 1973; 31: K19-K30PubMed Google Scholar) the Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model (23Koshland Jr., D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar) includes variations of the coupling between the two ATP binding sites depending on the nature of the ATP analog bound. It is interesting to note that inactivation of native Na+/K+-ATPase by DANS-N3-ATP on one hand includes a simultaneous inactivation of all partial activities (Na+-dependent phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP as well as K+-activatedp-nitrophenylphosphatase). On the other hand inactivation of Na+/K+-ATPase with metal analogs (4Schoner W. Thoenges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control, and Its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar) allows a specific inactivation of the partial activities of theE 1ATP site (12Hamer E. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or theE 2ATP site (11Buxbaum E. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Such a “loose interaction” may also explain the double phosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase in the sequence of CoATP and CrATP but not in the reverse order (11Buxbaum E. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as well as backdoor phosphorylation in a CrAMP-PCP-treated enzyme but not in the case of CrATP treatment (13Linnertz H. Thoenges D. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model (Fig. 1) explains quantitatively the sigmoidal inactivation curve of inactivation with DANS-N3-ATP by a positive cooperative effect of two nucleotide binding sites and the decrease of the Hill coefficient in presence of ATP by the formation of hybrid complexes of inhibitor and substrate (Fig. 4 B, Equation 2). Therefore, in the hybrid complexes the intrinsic negative cooperativity of ATP (a= 377) and the intrinsic positive cooperativity of DANS-N3-ATP (c = 0.005) result in a macroscopic behavior of a Hill coefficient near 1 (n H = 0.9). Nevertheless, there is still an intrinsic cooperativity between the nucleotide binding sites in the hybrid complexes (b = 0.07) (Fig. 6). The model also explains the complex kinetics of inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by DANS-ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is explained by a negative cooperativity in the affinities of its binding sites. There is also a rate-accelerating effect on the product-forming step at higher ATP concentrations which results in a 30 times faster substrate hydrolysis when two ATP sites are occupied than when only one ATP is bound (Fig. 2, Equation 1). The values of the fitting process agree very well with the published data of other authors (6Plesner I.W. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufmann S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Peluffo R.D. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DANS-ATP inhibited competitively the hydrolysis of ATP at both binding sites with positive cooperativity (Figs. 2 and 6). This interpretation differs from that of Moczydlowski and Fortes (14Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2346-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who explained a similar observation of TNP-ATP inhibition on Na+/K+-supported ATP hydrolysis as a noncompetitive inhibition at low ATP concentrations and a competitive inhibition at high ATP concentrations. The Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model may also explain superphosphorylation (28Peluffo R.D. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6596-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as an event at the specific condition where two ATP molecules have already bound before ATP hydrolysis and phosphorylation starts at the E 1ATP site. The model used does not exclude the possibility that the two substrate binding sites reside on a single α subunit (30Ward G.W. Cavieres J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) rather than on neighboring subunits in a (αβ)2 dimer (4Schoner W. Thoenges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control, and Its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar, 27Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Boldyrev A.A. Quinn P.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is an open question so far why ATP analogs like DANS-N3-ATP and DANS-ATP are not substrates for Na+/K+-ATPase and why the affinities of the enzyme's two substrate binding sites for a specific ATP analog are just the opposite of that of ATP. One may speculate that the specific conformation of the ATP analog may be of importance in this respect and if so, whether some ATP analogs may be hydrolyzed by Na+/K+-ATPase in a positive cooperative way as well. Preliminary data seem to indicate this (34Thoenges D Hahnen J. Schoner W. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control, and Its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 421-424Crossref Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that Fig. 1 shows only the kinetic states necessary for the description of our data. Thus, each intermediate represents a pool that may be modulated by sodium and potassium ions and allows cooperativity between different conformations in one subunit. The competitive two-site model applies for CrATP, CoATP, and DANS-ATP derivatives. Whether this model explains the inhibitory effects of all ATP analogs and whether it may be useful for additional studies on the enzyme's catalysis of other substrate analogs must be proven by further experiments. In summary, the above findings strongly suggest a high affinity binding of DANS-N3-ATP at the low affinity ATP binding site (E 2ATP binding site) of Na+/K+-ATPase which leads to its irreversible inactivation. DANS-N3-ATP may also interact with low affinity at the high affinity ATP site (E 1ATP site) but in a dissociable way. This peculiar property of DANS-N3-ATP makes this fluorescent ATP analog a promising candidate to localize the E 2ATP site by affinity labeling and peptide sequencing (experiments are in progress). The interaction of DANS-N3-ATP and of the other ATP derivatives with Na+/K+-ATPase can be explained by a Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model of two interacting ATP sites. This explains positive and negative cooperative interactions of ATP sites with different ATP analogs. It also explains the 30-fold activation of Na+/K+-activated hydrolysis of ATP when both ATP sites are occupied compared with the situation where only one ATP site is catalytically active. The sodium pump of animal cell membranes converts the energy of ATP hydrolysis into an electrochemical gradient of sodium and potassium ions. The process of ion transport is intimately connected to oscillations of the enzyme protein of Na+/K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37) between at least two different conformations called E 1 andE 2. Many of the events during cation transport can be described by the Albers-Post model (for an overview, see Ref.1Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd ed. Plenum Publishers, New York1985: 35-114Crossref Google Scholar): Na+/K+-ATPase binds ATP with high affinity to the sodium exporting E 1-form (E 1ATP binding site) and is consequently phosphorylated. After the release of sodium at the outer cell side and the following dephosphorylation, the enzyme needs a second binding of ATP. Therefore, ATP binds with low affinity to theE 2-form (E 2ATP binding site) of Na+/K+-ATPase and enhances the rate-limiting step of deocclusion of potassium during import (2Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast to expectations deriving from this single ATP site model with its subsequent formation of the ATP sites, use of substitution-inert MgATP complex analogs has led to the postulate of acoexistence (in time and at different places) of both ATP sites (4Schoner W. Thoenges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control, and Its Role in Disease. Springer, New York1994: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar). The Repke-Schön-Stein model (5Repke K.R.H. Schön R. Acta Biol. Med. Germ. 1973; 31: K19-K30PubMed Google Scholar) attempts to explain such a situation by shifting the energy excess of the sodium-transporting subunit to the potassium-transporting subunit. Each subunit follows a whole Albers-Post cycle but 180° out of phase. The bicyclic model of Plesner, on the other hand, gets its power from two ATP binding sites whose partial activities (Na+-ATPase, K+-phosphatase) are lower than the overall reaction (Na+/K+-ATPase). A single subunit does not have to pass all of the intermediates of the Albers-Post circle, but the sum fulfills all steps required for a whole turnover (6Plesner I.W. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, there is still a lot of discussion about the intermediates shared by the partial reactions and the overall reaction (7Campos M. Beaugé L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2109965961,"We have identified a novel integrin β3 subunit, termed β3C, from a human osteoclast cDNA library. The COOH-terminal sequence and 3′-untranslated region of the β3C subunit differs from the previously reported β3A (platelet) and β3B (placenta) sequences, while the regions coding for the transmembrane and extracellular domains are identical. The β3C cytoplasmic domain contains 37 amino acids, the last 17 of which are encoded by a novel exon located about 6 kilobase pairs downstream of exon 14 of the β3A gene. HEK 293 cells were stably co-transfected with αV and either β3C (HEKβ3C) or β3A(HEKβ3A). The viability of HEKβ3C cells was lower than that of HEKβ3A cells, and HEKβ3Ccells in culture grew as clusters rather than as a monolayer. The novel cytoplasmic domain did not affect receptor binding affinity; both αVβ3A and αVβ3Cisoforms exhibited high affinity binding to 125I-echistatin and cyclic and linear RGD peptides. However, in contrast to HEKβ3A, HEKβ3C cells failed to adhere to osteopontin, an αVβ3 matrix protein. The data provide further support for the key role of the cytoplasmic domain of the β3 integrin in cell adhesion and suggest a potential role for the β3C integrin subunit in modulating cell-matrix interactions.

Integrins are a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). They are heterodimers composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits. Each subunit has a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain (2Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 3Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87 (,): 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). There are at least 9 β subunits and 15 α subunits that associate in various combinations to generate integrins of diverse ligand binding specificity. The extracellular domains of many of the integrins bind the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence present in several extracellular matrix proteins, while the cytoplasmic tail interacts with cytoskeletal proteins and generates signals important for cell adhesion, cell motility, apoptosis, and specific gene regulation (4Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). One member of the family, αVβ3, mediates cell adhesion to a wide spectrum of extracellular matrix proteins, including vitronectin, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, thrombospondin, fibronectin, and osteopontin (6Cheresh D.A. Spiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). αVβ3 is expressed on osteoclasts, platelets, melanoma, and endothelial and smooth muscle cells (7Horton M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1990; 71: 741-759PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoclasts are mobile, multinucleate cells within bone that are responsible for bone resorption (8Loutit J.F. Nisbet N.W. Immunology. 1982; 161: 193-203Google Scholar, 9Nijweide P.J. Burger E.H. Feyen J.H.M. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 855-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that αVβ3 present on the osteoclasts mediates attachment of osteoclasts to the bone matrix. This attachment is a prerequisite for osteoclast polarization, organization of the ruffled border, and the eventual resorption of bone. Monoclonal antibodies to αVβ3 have been shown to inhibit the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in vitro (10Horton M.A. Taylor M.L. Arnett T.R. Helfrich M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). An RGD containing snake venom protein, echistatin, binds αVβ3 with high affinity and inhibits bone resorption in an organ culture system (11Sato M. Sardana M.K. Grasser W.A. Garsky V.M. Murray J.M. Gould R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and in a thyro-parathyroidectomized rat model (12Fisher J.E. Caulfield M.P. Sato M. Quartuccio H.A. Gould R.J. Garsky V.M. Rodan G.A. Rosenblatt M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1411-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that αVβ3 plays an important role in modulating osteoclast function. Several lines of evidence suggest that there may be heterogeneity in αVβ3 obtained from different tissue sources. First, an alternative form of the β3 subunit with a variant cytoplasmic domain has been identified from a human placental library (13Toin H. van Kuppevelt S.M. Languino L.R. Gailit J.O. Suzuki S. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5415-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This variant form is generated by alternate mRNA splicing. 1For the sake of uniformity with other β3 variants, we refer to this novel β3subunit as β3C to distinguish it from the β3A (platelet/endothelial cell) and β3B(placenta) subunits. Second, a monoclonal antibody, 10C4.1.3, which recognizes a unique epitope on αVβ3, exhibits a very narrow tissue distribution with high level expression restricted to osteoclasts (14Chuntharapai A. Bodary S. Horton M. Kim K.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that epitopic variation may exist in αVβ3 expressed on the osteoclast compared with that expressed on other tissues. Third, a recent study reported that the potency for a series of αVβ3antagonists differed between their inhibition of bone resorption and endothelial cell adhesion on vitronectin (15Sato M. Garsky V. Majeska R.J. Einhorn T.A. Murray J. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Gould R.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that the αVβ3 on osteoclasts may have a distinct ligand specificity. To examine whether osteoclasts express a distinct form of αVβ3, we isolated and characterized αV and β3 cDNA clones from a human osteoclast-enriched osteoclastoma library. The αVcDNA clone was identical to the αV cDNAs obtained from endothelial and fibroblasts cells (16Fitzgerald L.A. Steiner B. Rall Jr., S.C. Lo S. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3936-3939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rosa J.-P. Bray P.F. Gayet O. Johnston G.I. Cook R.G. Jackson K.W. Shuman M.A. McEver R.P. Blood. 1988; 72: 593-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the β3 subunit existed in two forms: the previously characterized β3A form, which has a COOH-terminal sequence of 21 amino acids, and a novel β3C form with a unique 17-amino acid COOH-terminal sequence. In this report we describe the cloning and characterization of this novel β3Csubunit. Human osteoclasts were isolated from osteoclastoma tissue as described previously (18Drake F.H. Dodds Jr., R.A. James I.E. Connor J.R. Debouck C. Richardson S. Lee-Rykaczewski E. Coleman L. Rieman D. Barthlow R. Hastings G. Gowen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12511-12516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Briefly, osteoclasts were enriched from an osteoclastoma-derived cell suspension using a murine monoclonal antibody specific for the β3 chain of the vitronectin receptor (C22; Ref. 19James I.E. Walsh S. Dodds R.A. Gowen M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 37: 905-914Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and magnetic beads (Dynal Inc, Great Neck, NY) coated with an anti-murine antibody. After 3 days in culture, osteoclast mRNA was extracted using the Fast Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). A directional cDNA library was prepared from this mRNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the Uni-ZAP XR vector. The average insert size of the library was greater than 1 kb. To screen the library, αV and β3 cDNAs (3.2 and 2.4 kb in length, respectively) were generated from published sequences (20Suzuki S. Argraves W.S. Arai H. Languino L.R.

The identities of the cDNA sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer and dideoxy terminator chemistry. The sequencing primers were designed using the Oligo 4.0 program (National Bioscience, Plymouth, MN). The nucleotide sequence of the αV and β3 cDNAs obtained were identical to the fibroblast αV (20Suzuki S. Argraves W.S. Arai H. Languino L.R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14080-14085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HEL cell β3 (21Zimrin A.B. Eisman R. Vilaire G. Schwartz E. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1470-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) sequences, respectively. The cDNAs were32P-radiolabeled using the TAG-IT kit (Bios Corp., New Haven, CT) and used to screen the human osteoclastoma cDNA library by in situ plaque hybridization under low stringency conditions as described (22Bergsma D.J. Ellis C. Kumar C. Nuthulaganti P. Kersten H. Elshourbagy N. Griffin E. Stadel J.M. Aiyar N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Positive clones were plaque-purified, and cDNAs were excised to yield recombinant Bluescript plasmids in Escherichia coliXL1-Blue cells, according to methods recommended by Stratagene. Several partial positive clones were ligated together to generate full-length cDNAs; and three clones, pHOCαV-8, pHOCβ3A-49, and pHOCβ3C-16, encoding the αV, β3A, and novel β3C forms, respectively, were completely sequenced and used for further analysis. To determine the splicing mechanism by which the variant β3 (pHOCβ3C-16) is generated, PCR reactions were carried out using three sets of primers (see Fig.4), DNA isolated from the β3 genomic clone (P1 clone encompassing the entire β3 coding region and flanking regions; kind gift of Dr. M. Poncz, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) as a template, and eLONGase enzyme mix under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into PCR2000 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the nucleotide sequence of the 5′- and 3′-ends were determined. The analysis was performed using mRNA derived from human osteoclastoma tissue samples. Two-microgram aliquots of poly(A)+ RNA from an osteoclast-rich fraction and an osteoclast-depleted stromal cell fraction were fractionated on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (23Lehrach, H., Diamond, D., Wozney, J. M., and Boedtker, H. (1977)Biochemistry 4743–4751.Google Scholar). The Northern hybridization reaction was performed as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.52-9.57Google Scholar). Probes specific for the β3A and β3Csubunits (unique regions of the cytoplasmic domain and 3′-UTR regions; Fig. 3 A) were generated by PCR and32P-radiolabeled using the TAG-IT kit. Nested PCR reactions were carried out under standard conditions with β3A-specific (primer sets 1,3 and 2,4; see Fig. 3 A) or β3C-specific primers (5,7 and 6,8) and 5 ng of double-stranded cDNA prepared from heart, liver, lung, placenta, and prostate tissues or 1 μl of brain, osteoclastoma, osteoblast, stromal cells, or bone marrow cell cDNA libraries as templates (commercially prepared by Stratagene, La Jolla, CA in the Uni-ZAP XR vector). The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells) were obtained from ATCC (catalog number CRL 1573). Cells were grown in Earl's minimal essential medium containing Earl's salts, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. A 3.2-kbEcoRI-KpnI fragment of the αVsubunit, a 2.4-kb XbaI-XhoI fragment of the β3A subunit, and a 2.9-kb XbaI-XhoI fragment of the variant β3C subunit containing the entire coding region were inserted into the EcoRV site of the pcDNAI vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by blunt end ligation. The same constructs were also subcloned into theEcoRI-EcoRV cloning sites of the pCDN vector (25Aiyar N. Baker E. Wu H.L. Nambi P. Edwards R.M. Trill J.J. Ellis C. Bergsma D.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter and a G418-selectable marker. The pcDNAI constructs were used for transient expression, and the pCDN constructs were used for stable expression. Transient transfections of the αV, β3A, β3C, αV + β3A, and αV + β3C constructs into HEK 293 cells were carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Chen C.A. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). For stable expression, 80 × 106 HEK 293 cells were electrotransformed with αV + β3A or αV + β3C constructs (20 μg of DNA of each subunit) using a Gene Pulser (27Hensley P. McDevitt P.J. Brooks I. Trill J.J. Feild J.A. McNulty D.E. Connor J.R. Griswold D.E. Kumar V.N. Kopple K.D. Carr S.A. Dalton B.J. Johanson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23949-23958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and plated in 100-mm plates (5 × 105 cells/plate). After 48 h, the growth medium was supplemented with 450 μg/ml Geneticin (G418 sulfate; Life Technologies). The cells were maintained in selection medium until the colonies were large enough to be assayed. To determine whether the HEK 293 transfectants expressed the vitronectin receptor, the cells were reacted with 23C6 (28Davies J. Warwick J. Totty N. Philp R. Helfrich M. Horton M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1817-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), a monoclonal antibody specific for the αVβ3 complex, and the reactivity was analyzed by flow cytometry. The cells were harvested and washed in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 5% fetal calf serum, supplemented with 5% goat serum at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in medium alone (RPMI, 5% fetal calf serum) or medium containing either monoclonal antibody 23C6 or an IgG1 isotype control (Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc, Scarborough, ME; both antibodies were diluted 1:3). These were incubated on ice for 30 min and then washed twice in ice-cold wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 5% fetal calf serum). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody. To remove excess conjugate, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were finally resuspended in fresh ice-cold buffer. To identify dead cells, 10 μg/ml of propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to each tube prior to sorting. The cells were then analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (San Jose, CA). Cells transfected with either the αVβ3A or αVβ3Cconstructs were immobilized on glass microscope slides (approximately 5 × 104 cells/slide, 500 rpm for 1 min), using a Shandon Cytospin 3 cytocentrifuge (Pittsburgh, PA). The cells were air-dried and fixed in acetone for 2 min at room temperature. These preparations were wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at −20 °C until required for analysis. A Hacker cryostat (Fairfield, NJ) was used to cut 8-μm sections of human osteoclastoma tissue. These were placed on four-well multispot slides (Henley Ltd, Loughton, Essex, UK), air-dried and fixed in acetone for 2 min. The sections were wrapped in foil and stored at −20 °C until required. Antibodies specific for either the β3A or β3C subunits were prepared by injecting rabbits with synthetic peptides corresponding to the unique carboxyl-terminal sequences of each receptor. For the β3A subunit, the peptide sequence was CKEATSTFTNITYGRT; for the β3C subunit, the sequence was CHYAQSLRKWNQPVSIDG. Specific reactivity with the antibodies was demonstrated using a standard indirect immunofluorescence method (29Johnson G.D. Dorling J. Thompson R.A. Techniques in Clinical Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, London1981: 106-137Google Scholar), using phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum as the washing buffer and either a TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin as the second antibody (Sigma, Poole, UK). To determine the specificity of the primary antibodies for their antigens, controls were set up in which the antibodies were preincubated for 2 h with either 70 μg of each of the β3 antigens, 70 μg of an unrelated peptide, or vehicle alone. Echistatin (2000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. HEK 293 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in 75- or 150-cm2 flasks in Earl's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1 mg/ml G418. Prior to the binding assay, transfected 293 cells were rinsed with RPMI medium and trypsinized until the cells dislodged. Cells were washed once with RPMI medium and resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.1 mm MnCl2 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 1 × 106cells/ml. 125I-Echistatin binding assays were performed in a 96-well filtration plate assembly (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using 0.65-μm hydrophilic durapore membranes (catalog number MADV-N65). The 293 cell suspension (0.1 ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 125I-echistatin in the absence or presence of unlabeled αVβ3 antagonists. After the incubation, cell-bound 125I-echistatin was separated from free 125I-echistatin by filtration using a Millipore filtration manifold, followed by washing with ice-cold RPMI medium. The cell-associated radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by γ-counting (COBRA γ-counter; Packard Instrument Co.). Corning 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were precoated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 ml of human osteopontin (0.5 μg/ml in RPMI medium). The plates were then washed once with RPMI medium and blocked with 3.5% bovine serum albumin in RPMI medium for 1 h at room temperature. Transfected 293 cells were resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm MnCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at a density of 0.5 × 106cells/ml. A 0.1-ml aliquot of cell suspension was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, in the presence or absence of various αVβ3 antagonists. Following incubation, 0.025 ml of a 10% formaldehyde solution, pH 7.4, was added, and the cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min. The plates were washed three times with 0.2 ml of RPMI medium, and the adherent cells were stained with 0.1 ml of 0.5% toluidine blue for 20 min at room temperature. Excess stain was removed by extensive washing with deionized water. The toluidine blue incorporated into cells was eluted by the addition of 0.1 ml of 50% ethanol containing 50 mm HCl. Cell adhesion was quantified at an optical density of 600 nm on a microtiter plate reader (Titertek Multiskan MC, Sterling, VA). A 3.2-kb fragment encompassing the coding region of the αV subunit was used to probe 2 × 106 clones of the human osteoclastoma library, and several hybridizing clones that encompassed different regions of the αV subunit were characterized by nucleotide sequencing. The nucleotide sequences were 100% identical to the published fibroblast/placenta sequences (20Suzuki S. Argraves W.S. Arai H. Languino L.R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14080-14085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 2.4-kb fragment from the coding region of the β3A subunit was used to probe 2 × 106 clones of the osteoclastoma cDNA library. A number of hybridizing clones were obtained, and clones with large inserts (1–2 kb in length) were chosen for nucleotide sequencing. Of the clones sequenced, several partial clones were identical to the published β3A sequence. However, two clones (1.2 kb in length) that encompassed the transmembrane, cytoplasmic, and 3′-untranslated regions had identical sequences in the transmembrane and part of the cytoplasmic domain but differed in the rest of the sequence. The DNA sequence of the 3′-fragment and amino acid sequence derived from it are shown in Fig. 1. The variant sequence encodes a novel cytoplasmic domain of 17 amino acids (β3C form). In addition, the 3′-UTR is also different from the β3A and β3B forms. The 1.2-kb fragment encompassing the novel cytoplasmic and 3′-UTR sequence was used as a probe to rescreen the library under high stringency conditions. Twenty positive clones were characterized by nucleotide sequencing, and all were found to be identical to the sequence of the β3C subunit (Fig. 1). Comparison of the cytoplasmic tail sequences of the individual integrin β subunits reveals a striking degree of structural homology (Fig.2). Most contain the conserved motifs NPXY and NXX(Y/F), which produce tight β turns in the structure. One of these motifs, NPXY, has been shown to have an influence on the recruitment of transfected integrins into focal contacts (30Fildaro E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the β3C cytoplasmic domain lacks the NPXY motif, and, rather than NXX(Y/F), it contains the sequence NXXV. The cytoplasmic domain of the β3B integrin lacks both motifs. Northern analysis with β3A- and β3C-specific probes revealed that a 6.6-kb β3C transcript was expressed in both the osteoclast-enriched and stromal cell fractions of the osteoclastoma tissue (Fig. 3 B). RT-PCR reactions with various tissues and cell lines yielded a 530-bp β3A-specific band (Fig. 3 C) and a 470-bp β3C-specific band (Fig. 3 C) in many of the tissues tested including heart, liver, lung, kidney, osteoclastoma, placenta, and stromal and bone marrow cells. Interestingly, only the β3C subunit was expressed in the prostate and testis, while the osteoblast cells expressed only the β3A subunit (Fig. 3 C). Mature β3A protein is encoded by 14 exons, which range in length from 0.09 to 3.7 kb and are contained within approximately 46 kb of genomic DNA (31Zimrin A.B. Gidwitz S. Lord S. Schwartz E. Bennett J.S. White G.C., II Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8590-8595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variant β3B transcript from placenta arises due to nonsplicing of the final intron (31Zimrin A.B. Gidwitz S. Lord S. Schwartz E. Bennett J.S. White G.C., II Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8590-8595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the variant β3C cDNA (Fig. 1) predicts that it should be generated by alternate splicing to yield a novel exon 14, because it is identical to the β3A sequence up to exon 13. We designed several sets of sense oligonucleotide primers in the exon 14 region of the β3A gene using the published sequence (31Zimrin A.B. Gidwitz S. Lord S. Schwartz E. Bennett J.S. White G.C., II Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8590-8595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense oligonucleotide primers were designed in the novel β3C region. The sequence of three oligonucleotide primers that worked well are shown in Fig.4. Long range PCR using oligonucleotide primers 1 and 3 yielded a product that was about 9.5 kb in length, whereas PCR reactions carried out with oligonucleotide primers 2 and 3 yielded a product that was about 6 kb in length (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-ends of the 9.5- and 6-kb fragments revealed exact identity to the expected regions of the published β3A genomic sequence, whereas nucleotide sequence of the 3′-ends revealed 100% identity to novel β3C sequence. Based upon these data, we conclude that the novel exon 14 for the β3C transcript is located about 6 kb downstream of exon 14 that encodes the β3A transcript (Fig. 4). To allow characterization of this novel integrin subunit, HEK 293 cells were stably co-transfected with expression vectors for αV and β3C (HEKβ3C). For comparison, cells were also co-transfected with αV and β3A subunits (HEKβ3A). HEK 293 cells were selected because they do not endogenously express the β3integrin. Instead, these cells express multiple β1integrins, including α1β1, α3β1, α5β1, α6β1, and αVβ1(32Bossy B. Reichardt L.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10191-10198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To monitor expression of the transfected receptors, flow cytometry was performed using murine monoclonal antibody, 23C6. No reactivity was detected in either population of cells that were reacted with either the IgG1 isotype or medium controls. Approximately 97% of the αVβ3A-transfected cells showed receptor expression, and this was stable (>90% expression) for multiple (>20) passages. In contrast, flow cytometric analysis of HEKβ3Ccells indicated that many cells within the population did not express receptor. To obtain a pure population of cells expressing the αVβ3C receptor, HEKβ3C cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, using 23C6 to label the receptor. After several passages, however, only approximately 60% of the previously sorted αVβ3C cells demonstrated positive reactivity with 23C6. This suggested that either the cells were rapidly losing expression or that there was a growth or survival disadvantage for cells expressing αVβ3C. To address viability, 23C6-expressing cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide labeling. Initially, the proportion of nonviable HEKβ3C cells was 6.2% (Fig.5 A), compared with 2.2% in HEKβ3A transfectants (Fig. 5 B). When the labeled cells were analyzed 4 h later, the number of nonviable, 23C6-positive cells had risen to 11.3% in the HEKβ3Ctransfectants (Fig. 5 C), while the nonviable population of 23C6-positive HEKβ3A remained at 2.1% (Fig.5 D). These data indicate that under the conditions used cell death occurred at a higher rate in the β3C-transfected cells compared with the β3A-transfected cells. Characteristics of the two stably transfected cell populations in culture were also quite different. HEKβ3A cells grew as a monolayer (see Fig. 6, C and D), while HEKβ3C grew as large aggregates of cells (Fig. 6,E and F).Figure 6Immunocytochemistry. A, osteoclastoma tissue was reacted with the β3A antibody, demonstrating strong plasma membrane reactivity against osteoclasts (arrows). B, preincubation of the β3A antibody with β3A peptide immunogen completely inhibited the reactivity of the antibody. C, the HEK 293β3A cells also demonstrated strong reactivity with the β3A antibody (>95% of the cells). D, β3A immunoreactivity in HEK 293β3A cells could be competed with the β3A peptide immunogen.E, the β3C-reactive antibody demonstrated strong reactivity against a population of the HEKβ3Ctransfectants.

Note that the β3A transfected cells grew as a monolayer, while the β3C transfectants tended to grow as large aggregates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antibodies were prepared against synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequences of the β3A and β3C cytoplasmic domains. When tested against the β3A- or β3C-transfected HEK 293 cells, both antibodies reacted strongly against their respective transfectants (Fig. 6, C and E), and this reactivity could be competed with the relevant peptide antigens (Fig. 6, D and F). The β3A antibody also demonstrated some background reactivity with the β3Ctransfectants that could not be competed out with either the β3A or the β3C peptides. In contrast, no reactivity could be detected on the wild type β3Atransfectants that had been probed with the variant β3Cantibody. In osteoclastoma tissue, antibody to the β3A subunit demonstrated plasma membrane-associated reactivity on osteoclasts (Fig.6 A), similar to that of the 23C6 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). This reactivity was competed with the β3Apeptide antigen (Fig. 6 B) but was not affected by the β3C peptide. No reactivity was detected with the variant β3C antibody on the three osteoclastoma preparations tested (results not shown). Previous studies of the β3 cytoplasmic domain suggest that it modulates integrin ligand binding affinities and/or cell adhesion and t"

Using differential display, a novel putative vesicle transport-related factor (RA410) was cloned from reoxygenated astrocytes. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed RA410 to be composed of domains common to vesicle transport-related proteins of the Sec1/Unc18 family, including Sly1p and Sec1p (yeast), Rop (Drosophila), Unc18 (Caenorhabditis elegans), and Munc18 (mammalian), suggesting its possible role in vesicular transport. Northern analysis of normal rat tissues showed the highest expression of RA410 transcripts in testis. When astrocyte cultures were subjected to a period of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation, induction of RA410 mRNA was observed within 15 min of reoxygenation, reaching a maximum by 60 min. At the start of reoxygenation, the addition of diphenyl iodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, blocked in parallel astrocyte generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and expression of RA410 message. In contrast, cycloheximide did not affect RA410 mRNA levels, indicating that RA410 is an immediate-early gene in the setting of reoxygenation. Using polyclonal antibody raised against an RA410-derived synthetic peptide, Western blotting of lysates from reoxygenated astrocytes displayed an immunoreactive band of ≈70 kDa, the expression of which followed induction of the mRNA. Fractionation of astrocyte lysates on sucrose gradients showed RA410 antigen to be predominantly in the plasma membrane. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis demonstrated RA410 in large vesicles associated with the Golgi, but not in the Golgi apparatus itself, consistent with its participation in post-Golgi transport. Consistent with thesein vitro data, RA410 expression was observed in rat brain astrocytes following transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. These data provide insight into a new protein (RA410) that participates in the ischemia-related stress response in astrocytes.

Consistent with thesein vitro data, RA410 expression was observed in rat brain astrocytes following transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. These data provide insight into a new protein (RA410) that participates in the ischemia-related stress response in astrocytes. Changes in the cellular microenvironment, especially those that challenge cell viability, such as glucose deprivation, hypoxia, and accumulation of toxic metabolites, are major contributors to tissue damage consequent to cerebral ischemia (1Siesjoe B.K. Crit. Care Med. 1988; 16: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Adaptation to such circumstances leads to a change in the cellular phenotype due, at least in part, to redirection of biosynthetic properties with expression of stress proteins. The latter are central to the cellular stress response; global inhibition of their expression results in cell death in the altered environment (2Pelham R.B.H. Cell. 1986; 46: 959-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Because of their abundance and ability to sustain environmental perturbations, astrocytes have an important role in maintaining neuronal function under homeostatic and pathologic conditions (3Swanson A.R. Choi D.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For example, astrocytes subjected to hypoxia, a major component of the ischemic milieu, express stress proteins such as the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) (4Hori O. Matsumoto M. Maeda M. Kuwabara K. Ueda H. Ohtsuki T. Kinoshita T. Ogawa S. Stern D. Kamada T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the 150-kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150) (5Kuwabara K. Matsumoto M. Ikeda J. Hori O. Ogawa S. Maeda Y. Kitagawa K. Imuta N. Kinoshita T. Stern D.M. Yanagi H. Kamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5025-5032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Induction of these stress proteins in response to hypoxia is indicative of the capacity of astrocytes to maintain biosynthetic processes, albeit redirected toward different products, in the setting of oxygen deprivation. In contrast to oxygen deprivation, reoxygenation, an abrupt restoration of ambient oxygen tension in the cellular environment after a period of hypoxia, triggers a quite different cellular response. Since the period of reoxygenation is that most closely associated with damage to parenchymal cells (6McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar), we reasoned that astrocytes would rise to the challenge of ischemia/reperfusion by redirecting cellular activities in support of the more vulnerable population of neurons (7Maeda Y. Matsumoto M. Ohtsuki T. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Hori O. Shui D.Y. Kinoshita T. Kamada T. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of protein synthesis at the time of reoxygenation, even though it transiently increases the pool of high energy phosphate compounds, ultimately results in failure to adapt to the oxygen-rich environment and subsequent cell death (8Hori O. Matsumoto M. Maeda Y. Ueda H. Kinoshita T. Stern D. Ogawa S. Kamada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have previously described the cloning of a novel RNA-binding protein expressed by reoxygenated astrocytes, suggesting that changes in RNA processing/editing may be important in the cellular response to ischemia (9Matsuo N. Ogawa S. Imai Y. Takagi T. Tohyama M. Stern D. Wanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28216-28222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified another novel polypeptide (RA410), a vesicle transport-related protein, also induced in reoxygenated astrocytes. Our data demonstrate that RA410 is expressed intensely in astroglia in ischemic brain, and its subcellular localization suggests a role in post-Golgi protein processing. Rat primary astrocytes were obtained from neonatal rats by a modification of a previously described method (7Maeda Y. Matsumoto M. Ohtsuki T. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Hori O. Shui D.Y. Kinoshita T. Kamada T. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In brief, cerebral hemispheres were harvested from neonatal Harlan Sprague Dawley rats within 24 h of birth, and brain tissue was digested at 37 °C using Dispase II (3 mg/ml; Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). The mixture was plated in 175-cm2 culture flasks (two brains/flask), and cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% CellGrow, Life Technologies Inc.). After 10 days, culture flasks were incubated for 48 h with cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 mg/ml; Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) to prevent fibroblast overgrowth and agitated on a shaking platform (Bioshaker BR-30L, Taitek, Tokyo, Japan) to separate astrocytes from remaining microglia and oligodendroglia, and the adherent cell population was then identified by morphologic and immunohistochemical criteria (detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein). Cells were then replated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in the above medium. When cultures achieved confluence, they were exposed to hypoxia using an incubator attached to a hypoxia chamber that maintained a humidified atmosphere with low oxygen tension (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI), as described previously (10Ogawa S. Gerlach H. Esposito C. Macaulay A.P. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Where indicated, after exposure to hypoxia, cultures were returned to the ambient atmosphere (reoxygenation), at which time the conditioned medium was rapidly exchanged with fresh medium. Oxygen tension in the medium was monitored using a blood gas analyzer (ABL-2, Radiometer, Stockholm, Sweden). Cell viability was assessed by several methods, including morphologic criteria, trypan blue exclusion, and lactose dehydrogenase release. Total RNA was extracted and purified from astrocytes (≈5 × 108cells) exposed to hypoxia for 24 h or to hypoxia/reoxygenation (24 h of hypoxia followed by 1 h of reoxygenation) using the acid guanidinium/phenol/chloroform method (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For hypoxic samples, RNA extraction was performed inside the hypoxia chamber after all reagents were equilibrated in the hypoxic atmosphere. Then, purified RNA (≈3 μg) was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (300 units; Life Technologies, Inc.), oligo(dT) primer (2.5 μm T11GT), and dNTP mixture (20 μm each) for 60 min at 37 °C. cDNAs synthesized from RNAs were subjected to differential display (see below). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DPI, diphenyl iodonium; IL, interleukin. recovery, and reamplification of cDNAs obtained from astrocytes exposed to hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation were performed as described (12Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, reverse transcriptase products obtained from total RNA (≈25 ng in each reaction) were used as PCR templates in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing arbitrary primer (1 μm), dNTP (200 μm each), and Taqpolymerase (2 units of AmpliTaq; Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan). Thermocycling was performed for 39 cycles with the indicated parameters (95 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (5 min for last cycle)) using the same arbitrary 12-mer oligonucleotide as both the upstream and downstream primers. In one set of experiments, PCR products obtained from hypoxic and hypoxic/reoxygenated astrocytes were screened using 60 different primers. After separation by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PCR products were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. cDNA bands specifically amplified in hypoxic/reoxygenated astrocytes were excised and eluted from the gels. Then, the eluted material was reamplified by PCR using the same primers and conditions employed in differential display except for an increased concentration of dNTP mixture (40 μm). Reamplified cDNA fragments were cloned into the pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA sequencing of cloned fragments was carried out using the Taq Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing Core kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with either the M13 forward sequencing primer or reverse primer. The cDNA sequences were analyzed and compared for homology with those available in the EMBL and GenBank™ DNA data bases and the SWISSPROT protein data base. One of the cDNA fragments, tentatively named RA410, was subjected to further analysis. A rat cDNA library was screened allowing isolation of a cDNA (2 kilobase pairs) that encompassed the entire open reading frame of RA410. The latter was sequenced in both directions. To show homology to other vesicle transport-related proteins, phylogenic tree analysis was performed as described (13Hein J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 626-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To study induction of RA410transcripts during reoxygenation, Northern blot analysis was performed using a cDNA probe synthesized from an RA410 fragment as described previously (9Matsuo N. Ogawa S. Imai Y. Takagi T. Tohyama M. Stern D. Wanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28216-28222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA extracted from hypoxic or hypoxic/reoxygenated astrocytes (≈5 μg) by the acid guanidinium/phenol/chloroform method was subjected to formaldehyde-agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis and transferred overnight to Immobilon N membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). RNA was fixed to the membrane by exposure to UV irradiation prior to hybridization with cDNA probes. The membrane was prehybridized for 3 h at 65 °C in hybridization buffer (6 × SSC (0.9m NaCl and 90 mm sodium citrate, final pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.5% Ficoll, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA). The membrane was probed with 32P-labeled cDNA fragments of RA410 by the random hexamer procedure (14Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). After hybridization, filters were washed twice with 2 × SSC and 0.5% SDS and with 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C, exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.), and subjected to autoradiography. Induction ofRA410 mRNA was evaluated by comparison with β-actin mRNA. In some experiments, either cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) or diphenyl iodonium (DPI) (50 μm; both reagents from Sigma) was added to the culture 15 min prior to reoxygenation, and total RNA was extracted 30 min after reoxygenation. To access the distribution ofRA410 transcripts under normal conditions, RNA was prepared and purified from adult Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (200–300 g) by the method described previously (15Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar), and Northern blot analysis was performed as described above. To obtain antibody reactive with RA410 antigen, a peptide with the sequence CQEDEVKRLKSIMGLEGEDE (amino acids 346–365; see Fig. 1 B), which contains an extra cysteine residue at the N terminus to facilitate conjugation, was synthesized and conjugated to bovine serum albumin using a kit from Sigma. Rabbits were immunized by conventional methods, and antisera were obtained from two rabbits, each immunized with 1 mg of synthetic peptide. Antibody titers of these antisera were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the IgG fraction was purified by affinity chromatography using a column with immobilized RA410-derived synthetic peptide (ProtOn Kit1, Multiple Peptide Systems). Astrocytes (≈106 cells) exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation for the indicated times were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% 5 μg of protein/lane), and RA410 antigen was visualized by immunoblotting (16Towbin H. Strachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using anti-RA410 IgG. Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad microprotein assay kit. To localize RA410 antigen in reoxygenated astrocytes, cells (≈108) were exposed to hypoxia (24 h)/reoxygenation (3 h) and harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Fractionation of cell lysates was performed as described (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), and following measurement of protein concentration, each fraction (≈5 μg of protein) was immunoblotted with anti-RA410 IgG. Immunocytochemical studies were performed on either hypoxic or reoxygenated astrocytes as described (18Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R. Vijay S. Nitecki D. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25752-25781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). In brief, astrocytes plated on glass coverslips (ChamberSlide, Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) were exposed either to hypoxia (24 h)/reoxygenation (3 h) or to hypoxia only (24 h), fixed in Zamboni buffer for 2 h, washed twice with 0.2 mphosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with either anti-RA410 IgG or preimmune rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml in each case). Sites of primary antibody binding were visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). To further analyze the subcellular localization of RA410 antigen in hypoxic astrocytes, cells (≈5 × 108) were pelleted and fractionated as described (19Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In brief, astrocyte cell pellets frozen at −80 °C were thawed and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone), and the cells were cavitated at 400 p.s.i. N2 pressure for 30 min by nitrogen cavitation bomb (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ). Following homogenization, the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The clarified lysate was then centrifuged and fractionated by a series of sucrose steps: 38, 30, and 20% sucrose (all prepared in 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 100,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Layered fractions (fractions 1–4) were collected by puncturing the tube at the desired depth and gently withdrawing the fluid. The pellet at the bottom of the tube was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A (precipitate fraction 5). Following measurement of protein concentration, each fraction (≈5 μg of protein) was subjected to Western blotting using anti-RA410 IgG. Enrichment of cellular structures/organelles in subcellular fractions was identified by the presence of marker enzymes: alkaline phophodiesterase I (plasma membrane), α-mannosidase II (Golgi apparatus), and dolichol-P-mannose synthetase (endoplasmic reticulum) (19Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopic analysis to identify RA410 antigen within reoxygenated astrocytes was performed as described (20Kubota Y. Inagaki S. Shimada S. Kito S. Eckstein F. Tohyama M. Brain Res. 1987; 413: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In brief, cultured astrocytes exposed to hypoxia (24 h)/reoxygenation (3 h) were fixed in Zamboni buffer for 2 h, washed twice with 0.2m phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with either anti-RA410 IgG or preimmune rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml in each case). Sites of primary antibody binding were identified with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG following reaction with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Labs, Inc.) and staining with diaminobenzidine and uranyl acetate. Tissues were then flat-embedded in Epon 812, and ultrathin sections were stained with lead citrate, followed by observation at 75 kV on an H-600 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Cell-surface NADPH activity was measured as described (21Curnutte J.T. Kuver R. Scott P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5563-5569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating astrocytes (5 × 107 cells) for 3 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5 μg/ml cytochrome c. Where indicated, DPI (50 μm), an inhibitor of neutrophil-type NADPH oxidase, was added to the incubation mixture. Following the incubation period, cell suspensions were centrifuged (1000 × g for 5 min), and absorbance at 540 nm in the supernatant was measured using a Model UV-160 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Superoxide production was determined based on the difference in absorbance at 540 nm in the absence and presence of superoxide dismutase (1 μg/ml; Sigma). Expression of RA410 antigen was studied following transient unilateral (2 h) occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (250 g) (22Nagasawa H. Kogure K. Stroke. 1989; 20: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Blood gases, pH, and mean arterial blood pressure were monitored throughout the operation. Experiments were completed only if these physiological variables remained within normal limits. The normal limits for these parameters were set as follows: mean arterial blood pressure, 90–130 mm Hg; PCO2, 30–50 mm Hg;PO2, 100–130 mm Hg; and arterial blood pH, 7.25–7.45. Six hours after termination of arterial occlusion, rats were perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Serial coronal sections (20-μm thickness) were obtained using a vibratome and were appropriately prepared and stained with anti-RA410 IgG. The same sections was further stained with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (23Kitagawa K. Matsumoto M. Tagaya M. Hata R. Ueda H. Niinobe M. Handa N. Fukunaga R. Kimura K. Mikoshiba K. Kamada T. Brain Res. 1991; 561: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), followed by visualization of the primary antibody using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. Where indicated, anti-RA410 IgG was preincubated with excess antigen (10 μm RA410-derived peptide) for 12 h at 4 °C prior to its incubation with tissue sections. Oxygen tension in the medium fell to 8 torr within 3–5 h after cultures were transferred to the hypoxia chamber. Cell viability was maintained throughout hypoxia and following return of cultures to normoxia (reoxygenation). This conclusion is based on lack of lactose dehydrogenase release into culture supernatants, continued trypan blue exclusion, adherence to the culture substrate, and unchanged morphologic features (data not shown). Using the primer 5′-TGG TAC GGT ATA-3′ for differential display, a portion of a cDNA, termed RA410, was amplified from the cDNAs prepared from pooled RNA of hypoxia/reoxygenated astrocytes. A full-length cDNA was then isolated. Northern blotting using 32P-labeledRA410 cDNA probe confirmed the presence of the transcripts in RNA pools obtained from reoxygenated astrocytes (Fig.1 A). The apparent migration of the band corresponded to 2.0 kilobase pairs, suggesting that the cDNA (also 2 kilobase pairs) was likely to be full-length. The deduced amino acid sequence, derived from nucleotide sequencing of the RA410cDNA, included 637 amino acids (Fig. 1 B) and resulted in a predicted polypeptide molecular mass of ≈70 kDa. Comparison with data bases indicated the presence of a consensus sequence associated with vesicle transport-related factors (Fig. 1, C andD). Of known vesicle transport proteins, RA410 had greatest homology (38%) to Sly1p (24Dascher C. Ossing R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), a yeast vesicle transport-related factor (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, similarities were observed to Sec1p (yeast) (25Alato M.K.

Northern blot analysis of RNA from cultured astrocytes using 32P-labeled RA410 cDNA probe showed a striking increase in transcripts within 0.5 h of reoxygenation; levels of RA410 mRNA reached a plateau within 0.5–1 h and subsequently declined to the base line by 24 h (Fig. 2 A). Polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted RA410 protein sequence recognized a band in lysates of reoxygenated astrocytes of ≈70 kDa (Fig. 2 B). This is close to the expected molecular mass (≈70 kDa) based on the sequence deduced from full-lengthRA410 cDNA. The specificity of this immunoreactive band for RA410 was confirmed by its disappearance when antibody was preincubated with excess RA410-derived synthetic peptide (data not shown). Expression of RA410 antigen occurred within 2 h of reoxygenation, achieved a maximum by 4–8 h, and returned to base line within 24 h, consistent with the pattern of RA410message expression (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Expression of RA410 mRNA (A) and RA410 antigen (B) in cultured astrocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation. In A, total RNA was extracted from astrocytes at the end of hypoxia (0 h, the time at which reoxygenation was begun) and at the indicated time points after the start of reoxygenation (0.5–24 h). Then, ≈5 μg of total RNA was subjected to Northern analysis as described in the legend to Fig. 1 A. In B, astrocytes exposed to hypoxia (Hypo; 0–24 h) followed by reoxygenation (Reoxy; 2–24 h) were harvested, and protein extracts (≈5 μg) were subjected to reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) followed by immunoblotting with anti-RA410 polyclonal antibody (10 μg/ml). The migration of standard proteins is indicated on the left: carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), and myosin (200 kDa).

To localize RA410 antigen in reoxygenated astrocytes, fractionated cell lysates prepared from reoxygenated cultures were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-RA410 IgG. RA410 antigen was detected mainly in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4 A). Sucrose gradient separation of cytosolic fractions also showed RA410 antigen mainly in the plasma membrane and partially in the Golgi subfraction (Fig.4 B). These data were consistent with the results of immunocytochemical analysis of cultured astrocytes using anti-RA410 IgG (Fig. 5 A); hypoxic/reoxygenated astrocytes demonstrated RA410 antigen, whereas no significant staining was detected in astrocytes subjected to hypoxia alone (Fig. 5 B). Controls in which hypoxic/reoxygenated astrocytes were stained with preimmune IgG displayed no staining (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Immunocytochemical analysis of hypoxic astrocytes. Astrocytes plated on coverslips were exposed either to hypoxia (24 h)/reoxygenation (3 h) (A and C) or to hypoxia alone (24 h) (B), permeabilized, and incubated either with anti-RA410 IgG (A and B) or with preimmune IgG (C).

This is consistent with the results of Western blotting of subcellular fractions (Fig. 4, A and B) and suggests that RA410 may participate in post-Golgi vesicle transport. To assess mechanisms underlying expression of RA410 in astrocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation, elaboration of superoxide was measured using the cytochrome c assay; superoxide generation was measured as the component of cytochrome creduction suppressed on addition of superoxide dismutase. Superoxide was formed almost immediately after reoxygenation and was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by DPI (Fig.7 A). In contrast, astrocytes exposed to either hypoxia or normoxia alone demonstrated no superoxide generation (Fig. 7 A). Expression of RA410 mRNA in reoxygenated astrocytes was blocked by pretreatment of astrocytes with DPI (50 μm) in parallel with suppression of reactive oxygen intermediate formation (Fig. 7 B). The addition of antagonists of nitric-oxide syntheses, such as methyl-nitron-nitro l-arginine, or placing cultures in arginine-free medium had no affect on cytochrome c reduction or expression of RA410 mRNA, indicating that DPI exerted its effect most likely by inhibiting an NADPH oxidase-like activity, rather than by interfering with formation of nitric oxide (data not shown). The addition of cycloheximide to astrocytes, sufficient to diminish incorporation of [3H]leucine into a fraction precipitable in trichloroacetic acid by >90%, did not diminish the level of RA410 message, suggesting that RA410 expression might reflect an immediate early-type mechanism in reoxygenated astrocytes triggered by superoxide produced as a consequence of activation of an NADPH-like activity. To evaluate expression of RA410 in vivo, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on mouse brain following transientunilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. At lower power, staining of ipsilateral ischemic cortex was observed (Fig.8 A), whereas contralateral nonischemic cortex (control) was negative (Fig. 8 B). Higher power views of adjacent sections of ischemic cortex display colocalization of RA410 antigen (Fig. 8 D), with cells also staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. 8 E). In contrast, samples of ischemic cortex stained with anti-RA410 IgG in the presence of excess peptide used as immunogen showed no staining (Fig. 8 C), indicating that staining of RA410 (Fig. 8 D) was specific. Astrocytes have a central role in the maintenance of central nervous system homeostasis through modulation of the ionic milieu, removal of excitatory neurotransmitters, and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (33Henn F.A. Haljamae H. Hamberger A. Brain Res. 1972; 43: 435-442Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 34Schousobe A.L. Hertz L. Svenneby G. Neurochem. Res. 1977; 2: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 35Arthur F.E. Shivers R. Bowman P. Dev. Brain Res. 1987; 36: 155-161Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In addition to these housekeeping activities, neurotrophic properties of astrocytes support neuronal differentiation and survival through production of growth factors, such as nerve growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (36Frei K. Malipiero U. Leist T. Zinkernagel R. Schwab M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 37Pechan P.A. Chowdhury K. Seifert W. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Vaca K. Wendt E. Exp. Neurol. 1992; 118: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Another facet of astrocyte biology concerns their ability to adapt to environmental stress, such as that represented by ischemia/reperfusion, modeled in our studies by hypoxia/reoxygenation. In contrast to the vulnerability of neurons to changes in ambient conditions, external challenges allow astrocytes to undergo activation, resulting in a change in cellular phenotype, as in tissue remodeling in the central nervous system (39Janeczko K. Brain Res. 1991; 564: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, astrocytes have produced cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, interferons, and transforming growth factor-β, in response to changes in the cellular environment, allowing them to orchestrate a cytokine cascade in brain (40Benveniste E.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1-C16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that expression of IL-6, a potent neurotrophic cytokine in the central nervous system, occurs in cultured astrocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (7Maeda Y. Matsumoto M. Ohtsuki T. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Hori O. Shui D.Y. Kinoshita T. Kamada T. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although induction of IL-6 mRNA is initiated late during hypoxia, maximal transcription, translation, and elaboration of this cytokine does not begin until reoxygenation, leading us to hypothesize that reoxygenation sets in motion a series of events culminating in astrocyte expression of a neurotrophic phenotype. We have delineated several components of this potential pathway. RA301, a Drosophila Tra-2-like RNA-splicing factor, also first identified using differential display applied to hypoxic/reoxygenated astrocytes, is likely to contribute to maturation of nascent RNAs, as its expression was necessary for maximal IL-6 production by the reoxygenated astrocyte (9Matsuo N. Ogawa S. Imai Y. Takagi T. Tohyama M. Stern D. Wanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28216-28222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78/BiP), a major stress protein in astrocytes expressed in response to oxygen deprivation, functions as a molecular chaperone by retaining immature IL-6 in the endoplasmic reticulum until the cellular metabolic environment is restored (8Hori O. Matsumoto M. Maeda Y. Ueda H. Kinoshita T. Stern D. Ogawa S. Kamada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). RA410, likely to be a vesicle transport-related polypeptide, is also a potential contributor to protein trafficking in response to cellular stress. In this context, RA410 has the greatest homology to Sly1p, a yeast polypeptide that has a major role in vesicle transport and protein secretion (41Sogaard M. Tani K. Ye R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J. Sollner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Our pilot studies are consistent with this concept and demonstrate that suppression of RA410 expression causes intracellular (Golgi) retention of IL-6, suggesting that this polypeptide is required for optimal trafficking of IL-6 through hypoxic/reoxygenated astrocytes. Expression of RA410 mRNA is enhanced by inhibition of protein synthesis using cycloheximide, suggesting an immediate early-type mechanism. In this case, the stimulus for expression of this vesicle transport-related factor appears to reside in reoxygenation-mediated activation of an NADPH-like activity with subsequent generation of superoxide. Similarly, reoxygenation-associated induction of RA301 is also regulated by reactive oxygen intermediates; the addition of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyl iodonium resulted in a marked decline inRA301 message/RA301 antigen in cultured astrocytes (9Matsuo N. Ogawa S. Imai Y. Takagi T. Tohyama M. Stern D. Wanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28216-28222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our pilot studies demonstrate that the level of IL-6 transcripts is not suppressed by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, suggesting that diphenyl iodonium exerts its effect(s) at steps distal to transcription/mRNA stability. Such regulation appears to involve, at least in part, expression of RA301 and RA410. These data provide insight into the complex events activated in astrocytes by hypoxia/reoxygenation. In addition, a role for reactive oxygen intermediates as signal transducers of the stress signal is emphasized, analogous to their role in NF-κB activation (42Shreck R. Reiber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). In summary, we have cloned and characterized a novel vesicle transport-related factor, RA410, from hypoxic/reoxygenated astrocytes. Such expression of RA410 is regulated by the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates by an NADPH oxidase-like activity. Expression of RA410 in cultured astrocytes subject to environmental stress suggests that the markedly enhanced protein synthesis that occurs at this time represents a redirection of the biosynthetic apparatus to facilitate expression and release of new gene products.

We found that in PC12h cells, an increase of cell density enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of several intracellular proteins including p130 cas . Because it is a possible substrate for Src family kinases, we measured pp60 c-src activity and found that it was higher in high density cultures than in low density cultures. This phenomenon was also observed in PC12 (the parental cell line of the PC12h subclone), Balb/c 3T3, Swiss 3T3, and Hela cells. One of the possible mechanisms regulating the kinase activity of pp60 c-src is the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of its negative regulatory site located at its C terminus. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the regulatory site did not change depending on cell density. Subcellular fractionation showed that in high density culture, pp60 c-src was translocated from detergent-soluble to detergent-insoluble fractions. These results suggest that cell-cell interaction might induce the activation of pp60 c-src without changing its tyrosine phosphorylation levels.

The Src family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases expressed in a wide variety of cells including mature nondividing neurons. They have been implicated not only in proliferation but also in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and differentiation (1Cooper J.A. Howell B.

Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). The intramolecular interactions of these domains are thought to be important in regulation of these kinases. One of the possible functions of Src family kinases is to regulate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions by phosphorylating proteins of the adhesion plaques. Overexpression of pp60 v-src in fibroblasts elevates the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of proteins including paxillin, cortactin, and pp125 FAK (8Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). All these proteins are localized at focal contacts where they form complexes with integrins and other proteins to anchor the actin fibers to the site of cell contact (9Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 10Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

In v-src-transformed cells, pp60 v-src is localized at the adhesion plaques, and the amount of actin stress fibers is greatly reduced (11Rohrschneider L. Rosok M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that regulation of Src family kinases is essential to integrity of the actin cytoskeleton (1Cooper J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The distribution of p130 cas is not yet known, but its tyrosine phosphorylation is stimulated when cells are attached on fibronectin-coated dishes, suggesting that it is involved in the intracellular signaling pathway of integrins (10Vuori K.

Activities of Src family kinases are regulated by several different mechanisms. Under normal growth conditions, they are suppressed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the negative regulatory sites located at their C-terminal noncatalytic tails (1Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). These sites are phosphorylated by CSK, another tyrosine kinase (17Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nada S. Okada M. MacAnley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), and dephosphorylated by some tyrosine phosphatases. In cells lacking CSK, the activities of Src family kinases are elevated, and paxillin and cortactin are highly tyrosine-phosphorylated (19Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578PubMed Google Scholar). These cells are able to undergo normal proliferation but have disorders in focal contact formation and localization of some focal adhesion-associated proteins including paxillin, supporting the importance of Src family kinases in cell adhesion. Src family kinases are known to be activated in response to growth factors (20Walker F. deBlaquiere J. Burgess A.W. J. Biol.

During the course of the study on nerve growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12h cells (26Khan M.A. Okumura N. Okada M. Kobayashi S. Nakagawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we have noticed that tyrosine phosphorylation levels of some proteins were changed depending on cell density. This prompted us to study the effect of cell density on tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins and on activities of tyrosine kinases. In the present report, we show that activities of Src family kinases are elevated in high density culture and discuss the mechanism underlying it. PC12h cells were kindly provided by Dr. H.

Anti-p130 cas and anti-CSK antisera were prepared by immunizing rabbits with GST-Cas2 (15Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and GST-CSK, respectively. PC12 and PC12h cells were maintained in DMEM containing 5% horse serum and 5% calf serum as described previously (18Nada S. Okada M. MacAnley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). For experiments, the cells were plated on 100-mm culture dishes at different densities as indicated and cultured for 2 days. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μm sodium molybdate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and after protein determination the protein concentrations were adjusted. The lysates (500 μg of protein each) were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then with protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complex was washed three times with TNE buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of TNE buffer and 20 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then boiled for 3 min. Proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211821) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Balb/c 3T3, Swiss 3T3, and Hela cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and subcultured every 6–8 days. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 8% polyacrylamide gel by the method of Laemmli and were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The filter was then blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. After washing with T-TBS, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. Blots were developed with the Renaissance chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit (NEN Life Science Products). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (TNE buffer containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and pp60 c-src was immunoprecipitated with anti-v-Src antibody. The immune complexes were washed three times with TNE buffer and twice with kinase buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2). In vitro kinase reactions were carried out in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg of enolase and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 40 μl of 2 × sample buffer. The samples were boiled and separated on a 8% gel, and then the gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film for 1 h. Cells were metabolically labeled with 1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free DMEM for 16 h and lysed in RIPA buffer. pp60 c-src was immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoresis on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After drying the gel, pp60 c-src was detected by autoradiography, cut out from the dried gel, and digested with CNBr (0.5 m in 70% formic acid) for 1 h at room temperature. After digestion, the gel was washed with 10% methanol, dried up, and homogenized with elution buffer (10 mm NaHCO3, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS). The gel was then boiled for 3 min, shaken for 1 h, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was dried up. The samples were dissolved in SDS sample buffer without SDS, boiled for 3 min, and separated by Tris-Tricine-SDS-PAGE (28Schagger H. von J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10408) Google Scholar). The radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. In the course of the study on nerve growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12h cells, we have noticed that the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of some intracellular proteins had been changed depending on cell density. To examine the density-dependent change in tyrosine phosphorylation, we prepared PC12h cell cultures of different cell densities. PC12h cells were plated at 5 × 104 for low density culture and 2 × 105for high density culture. After 2 days, the cell densities came to be 1 × 105 cells/cm2 in the low density culture and 4 × 105 cells/cm2 in the high density culture. At this time, in the low density culture, cells were growing logarithmically, and most cells did not contact with another one (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, in the high density culture, cells were confluent, and each cell contacted with many other cells (Fig. 1 B). Using these cultures, we examined density-dependent changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins by Western blotting of crude cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. PC12h cells cultured at a high density showed elevated tyrosine phosphorylation levels of proteins of 120–130, 85, and 60 kDa (Fig.2 A). PC12h cells contain various kinds of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 120–130 kDa, including p130 cas and p125 FAK . To investigate whether the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of p130 cas were changed depending on cell density, p130 cas was immunoprecipitated from these lysates with anti-p130 cas antibody and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In low density culture, p130 cas exhibited a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas it was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in high density culture (Fig. 2 B). The amounts of p130 cas protein were essentially equal in all samples as shown by immunoblotting of the same samples with anti-p130 cas antibody. The changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-p130 cas antibody (Fig.2 C). On the other hand, when the immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody were probed with anti-p125 FAK antibody, we could not detect any change in tyrosine phosphorylation level of p125 FAK (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Changes in tyrosine phosphorylation levels of intracellular proteins depending on cell density. A, PC12h cells were cultured as described in the legend of Fig. 1. From the low density (L) and high density (H) cultures, cell lysates were prepared, and 500 μg of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 8% gel and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-p130 cas antibodies. B, the cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-p130 cas antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-p130 cas antibodies. C, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and then the lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p130 cas or pp125 FAK antibodies. PY, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because p130 cas is a possible substrate for pp60 c-src, these results raised the possibility that the kinase activity of pp60 c-src could be changed depending on cell density. To test the possibility, we immunoprecipitated pp60 c-src and measured its activity with enolase as the substrate (Fig.3 A). It was found that the pp60 c-src activity in high density culture was 2.5-fold higher than activity in a low density culture. The autophosphorylation activity was also increased to a similar extent, but the amount of pp60 c-src did not change in each condition as detected by Western blotting. We next examined whether the total tyrosine phosphorylation level of pp60 c-src was changed depending on cell density. In pp60 c-src, there are two tyrosine phosphorylation sites: the autophosphorylation site and the negative regulatory site (corresponding to the Tyr416 and Tyr527 of chicken c-Src, respectively). In PC12h cells, however, tyrosine phosphorylation occurs predominantly on the negative regulatory site as shown later (see Fig. 5). Thus the total tyrosine phosphorylation level would reflect that of the negative regulatory site. As shown in Fig.3 B, there was no difference in the total tyrosine phosphorylation levels of pp60 c-src between low and high density cultures, suggesting that the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the negative regulatory site did not change depending on cell density. The negative regulatory site is phosphorylated primarily by CSK, but the only known mechanism that controls CSK is regulation of its expression levels. Western blotting with anti-CSK antibody showed that its expression level did not change depending on cell density (Fig.3 C). It is consistent with the result that the total tyrosine phosphorylation levels of pp60 c-src did not change (Fig. 3 B). Next we investigated whether the density-dependent change in pp60 c-src activity is specific to PC12h cells or not. PC12h is a subclone derived from PC12 cells (29Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1981; 222: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This subclone has no detectable difference in morphology and nerve growth factor-induced neurite extension but expresses higher tyrosine hydroxylase activity than the parental cells on stimulation with nerve growth factor. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the parental cells also exhibited density-dependent increase in pp60 c-src activity as is the case with PC12h subclone. We further investigated using three fibroblastic cell lines, Swiss 3T3, Balb/c 3T3, and Hela. These cells are immortal but not transformed, and their growth is restricted by contact inhibition. In all these cells, pp60 c-src was also activated in high density cultures, whereas its expression levels were almost constant (Fig. 4 B). Thus the phenomenon found in PC12h cells could be observed in many other cell lines. The two tyrosine phosphorylation sites of pp60 c-src could be distinguished by phosphopeptide mapping after CNBr digestion (30Bolen J.B. Veillette A. Schwartz A.M. Deseau V. Rosen N. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 149-168PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.5 A shows the phosphopeptide mapping of pp60 c-src after in vitro labeling in the presence and the absence of GST-CSK. In the absence of GST-CSK, phosphorylation occurs exclusively on the 10-kDa fragment, which should contain the autophosphorylation site, whereas in the presence of GST-CSK, phosphorylation occurs on the 4-kDa fragment containing the negative regulatory site in addition to the 10-kDa fragment. This result confirms that phosphopeptide mapping can be used to distinguish the phosphorylation on Tyr416 and Tyr527. To identify the phosphorylation sites of pp60 c-src in vivo, PC12h cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and 32P-labeled pp60 c-src was immunoprecipitated with anti-v-Src antibody and subsequently digested with CNBr (Fig. 5 B). The major phosphorylation site of pp60 c-src was on the 31-kDa fragment containing the N-terminal serine phosphorylation sites. In contrast to the case with in vitro kinase reaction, the autophosphorylation site detected as a 10-kDa fragment was essentially not phosphorylated in the cells. The negative regulatory site on the 4-kDa fragment was phosphorylated both in high and low density cultures, but the extent of phosphorylation did not change depending on cell density. It has been shown by subcellular fractionation that pp60 c-src could be detected both in detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions (31Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4745-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The oncogenic counterpart of pp60 c-src and in some cases activated pp60 c-src were mostly detected in the detergent-insoluble fractions, indicating that the activated forms of pp60 c-src were translocated from the detergent-soluble to detergent-insoluble fractions (32Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Parsons S.J. Creutz C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine whether the subcellular distribution of pp60 c-src was changed depending on cell density, TNE-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions from PC12h cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-v-Src antibody (Fig.6 A) and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-v-Src antibody or in vitro kinase assay (Fig.6 B). In the low density culture, pp60 c-src was almost exclusively detected in the detergent-soluble fraction. On the other hand, in the high density culture, >10% of pp60 c-src protein and 30–40% of its activity were detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Then we tried to detect 4- and 10-kDa fragments in CNBr digestion of pp60 c-src from the detergent-insoluble fraction, but we could not determine their phosphorylation levels because they were under the detectable level (data not shown). In the present study, we first examined the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of cellular proteins in PC12h cells grown at different cell densities and found that the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of several proteins were elevated when the cell density became high. In low density cultures, each cell was separated from other cells, whereas in high density cultures, cells were confluent and made contact with each other. The changes in tyrosine phosphorylation thus might be due to the influence of the cell-cell interaction. In addition, similar changes were also observed in several other types of cells including PC12, Balb/c 3T3, Swiss 3T3, and Hela, indicating that this phenomenon is not unique to PC12h cells, rather commonly seen in a variety of transformed and nontransformed cells. One of the proteins that were highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in high density cultures was identified as p130 cas, a docking protein that can be associated with the SH2 domains of pp60 c-src (13Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and c-Crk (15Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). p130 cas was first found as a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated protein inv-src-transformed fibroblasts, and so it was thought to be one of the substrates of pp60 c-src (8Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 12Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.C. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by the finding that tyrosine phosphorylation level of p130 cas was very low in c-src-deficient cells (34Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the increase of the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of p130 cas indicated that pp60 c-src or related proteins were activated in high density cultures. PC12h cells have several Src family kinases including pp60 c-src, pp59 fyn, and pp62 c-yes . In the present study, we showed that pp60 c-src activity was activated in high density cultures. Src family kinases are known to be involved in a variety of cellular activities. Expressions of the activated forms of these kinases result in abnormal cell growth, disorder of the actin cytoskeleton, and incomplete cell adhesion. However, only a few reports showed changes in their activities under normal growth conditions (35Chen Y. Pouyssegur J. Courtneidge S.A. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the present results would be important in understanding their physiological function in normal cells. Although the activity of pp60 c-src was higher in high density cultures, its expression level was not different from that in low density cultures, indicating that some other mechanisms are involved in its regulation. One possible mechanism is tyrosine phosphorylation of its regulatory site located near the C terminus. In normal cells, CSK, another tyrosine kinase, specifically phosphorylates this site to keep the activity of pp60 c-src low (1Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 17Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its expression levels were not changed. In addition, total tyrosine phosphorylation levels of pp60 c-src were also constant. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of pp60 c-src was mostly on the negative regulatory sites both in low and high density cultures whereas the autophosphorylation site was not, the total tyrosine phosphorylation level must show the phosphorylation level of the negative regulatory site. Thus the results indicate that the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the negative regulatory sites did not change depending on cell density. It was further confirmed by phosphopeptide mapping of pp60 c-src prepared from 32P-labeled cells. It seems thus unlikely that the density-dependent change in pp60 c-src activity was due to tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory site. The strongest band was a 31-kDa band that contains the N-terminal serine phosphorylation site. It is also thought to be involved in regulation of pp60 c-src activity (1Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), but its phosphorylation levels were not different between low and high density cultures. Therefore, serine phosphorylation of its N terminus was also unlikely to be involved in the density-dependent activation. But we could not exclude the possibility that the serine phosphorylation site might be different in low and high density cultures because the 31-kDa fragment of CNBr digestion contains more than one serine and threonine residues. Further studies are needed to clarify the activation mechanisms. In normal cells, pp60 c-src is usually solubilized in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, whereas in v-src-transformed cells, pp60 v-src was found in Triton-insoluble fractions that contain various cytoskeletal components (32Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Parsons S.J. Creutz C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that the activated form of the kinase is tightly associated with the cytoskeleton. In low density cultures, pp60 c-src was mostly found in Triton-soluble fractions. On the other hand, in high density cultures, about 10% of it was Triton-insoluble. In high density cultures, pp60 c-src might thus be activated and translocated to some cytoskeletal structures. It is not known what is associated with pp60 c-src to make it Triton-insoluble. The present study suggested that Src family kinases were activated by cell-cell contacts. Consistent with this, a comparative study (37Ottilie S. Raulf F. Barnekow A. Hannig G. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1625-1630PubMed Google Scholar) showed that src family kinases could be found in sponge, the first multicellular organisms, but not in unicellular organisms, implying that these may be involved in cell-cell interaction, recognition, and aggregation. It remains to be determined which molecule triggers the activation of Src family kinases. Recently, it was found that stimulation of integrin caused tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125 FAK (20Walker F. deBlaquiere J. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19552-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pp130 cas (10Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 16Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15398-15402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are downstream of integrin signaling. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of pp125 FAK did not change depending on cell density in contrast to pp130 cas . Some other pathways might thus be responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas in high density cultures. It has been reported that some cell adhesion molecules such as L1 and N-CAM require Src family kinases for their function (38Beggs H.E. Soriano P. Maness P.F. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 39Ignelzi M.J. Miller D.R. Soriano P. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These molecules might be stimulated in high density cultures and affected downstream signal transduction molecules including Src family kinases."

To search for signaling proteins that might be involved in β-cell maturation, we analyzed protein kinase expression in two developmentally and functionally distinct pancreatic β-cell lines, RIN-5AH and RIN-A12, by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A number of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases were identified in both lines. One protein kinase, mixed lineage kinase-1 (MLK-1), was expressed at both the RNA and protein levels in RIN-5AH cells, which display an immature β-cell phenotype, but was not detected in the more mature RIN-A12 cells. Furthermore, levels of MLK-1 mRNA and protein were increased after brief stimulation of RIN-5AH cells with either the differentiation inducer, sodium butyrate, or with serum after serum starvation. These increases in expression were independent of phenotypic markers such as insulin secretion or surface expression of major histocompatibility class I- and A2B5-reactive ganglioside. In addition, increases in MLK-1 expression in the stimulated RIN-5AH cells were accompanied by phosphorylation of MLK-1 on serine but not tyrosine. Antisense oligonucleotides to two distinct regions of MLK-1 caused RIN-5AH cells, but not RIN-A12 cells, to adopt a highly undifferentiated morphology, with a reduction in DNA synthesis and MLK-1 protein levels and elevated glucagon mRNA levels, but with no effect on insulin mRNA. In an immunohistochemical survey of embryonic mouse tissues, we found that temporal expression of MLK-1 was regulated in a tissue-specific manner. In the embryonic pancreas, MLK-1 expression was evident in ductal cells from day 13 to 16 but was not detected in late stage gestation or neonatal pancreas. These data suggest that MLK-1 is regulated in immature pancreatic β-cells and their ductal precursors at the level of functional maturity and may therefore play a role in β-cell development.

The pancreas responds to changes in blood glucose concentration by secreting insulin from β-cells resident in the islets of Langerhans. In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, β-cells are selectively destroyed by an autoimmune process (1Harrison L.C. Campbell I.L. Colman P.G. Chosich N. Kay T.W.H. Tait B.D. Bartholomeusz R.K. DeAizpurua H.J. Joseph J.L. Chu S. Kielcynski W. Adv. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 1: 35-94Google Scholar). The disease is chronic because the destructive autoimmunity is ongoing and because there is limited proliferative capacity in β-cells of the adult pancreas. Several studies have demonstrated the low replicative potential of the β-cell and identified factors that may influence β-cell growth in animal models (2Swenne I.

Although the exact sequence of lineage events that results in mature islet cells is not known, it is believed that mature, insulin-secreting β-cells arise from pluripotent ductal precursors (5Alpert S.

Many aspects of individual protein kinase components of signal transduction pathways within cells and their relationships to each other and to associated molecules have been well documented (reviewed in Ref. 11van der Geer P.

Thus, protein kinases are likely to play important roles in the control of β-cell growth and differentiation.As a model of β-cell development, radiation-induced rat insulinomas (RINs) have been derived, and subclones have been characterized for their phenotypic profile (12Santerre R.F.

Endocrinol. 1989; 93: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Two subclones of a parental line (RINm) can be distinguished by differences in cell morphology, insulin mRNA expression, and several other surface markers, including A2B5-reactive ganglioside and MHC class 1 and have been used to analyze maturation events potentially relevant to β-cell development (15Bartholomeusz R.K. Campbell I.L. Harrison L.C. Cell. Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 16Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Chick W.J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Philippe J. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to compare the pattern of protein kinase expression in two rat β-cell lines displaying either the immature (RIN-5AH) or mature (RIN-A12) β-cell phenotype and to identify protein kinases associated with a particular stage of development. Here we demonstrate that while a number of protein kinases are expressed in both cell types, only mixed lineage kinase-1 (MLK-1; Ref. 18Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was differentially expressed in the two β-cell lines. Because MLK-1 was expressed only in the more immature β-cell type, the expression of MLK-1 in these cells was examined under both resting and stimulated conditions and during pancreas development in the embryonic mouse. Furthermore, MLK-1 antisense oligonucleotides were used to link MLK-1 expression to the phenotypic status of the immature β-cell.DISCUSSIONThe high proliferative capacity and potential for lineage-specific differentiation of RIN cells has allowed their use in a number of studies of β-cell growth and differentiation (12Santerre R.F. Cook R.A. Crisel R.M.D. Sharp J.D. Schmidt R.J. Williams D.C. Wilson C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4339-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 13Madson O.D. Larsson L-I.

Endocrinol. 1989; 93: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, RIN cells have been demonstrated to be pluripotent, with multiple hormone-producing cell lines generated from single cells (16Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Chick W.J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Philippe J. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). RIN-5AH cells represent a relatively undifferentiated cell type that secretes low levels of islet hormones and is unresponsive to the insulin secretogogue, glucose (19Gazdar A.F. Chick W.L. Oie H.K. Sims H.L. King D.L. Weir G.A. Lauries V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3519-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Exposure of RIN-5AH cells to prolonged culture (6 days) with the differentiation inducer NaB led to the generation of several sublines of which RIN-A12 displayed a phenotype more characteristic of normal adult islet cells (15Bartholomeusz R.K. Campbell I.L. Harrison L.C. Cell. Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the present studies, the “immature” RIN-5AH (undifferentiated morphology, low insulin, high MHC class 1) and “mature” RIN-A12 (differentiated, high insulin, low MHC class. In the present studies, the “immature” RIN-5AH (undifferentiated morphology, low insulin, high MHC class 1) and the “mature” RIN-A12 (differentiated morphology, high insulin, low MHC class 1) cell lines were employed as a model of β-cell lineage maturation to address the possible role of protein kinases in β-cell growth and differentiation. Messenger RNA from the two lines was subjected to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with primers based on nucleotide sequences encoding conserved motifs within subdomains VI and IX of the catalytic domains of PYKs (20Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Our findings show that both RIN-5AH and RIN-A12 cells express mRNAs for the cytoplasmic PYKs lyn,lck, fyn, and yes, which are members of the src subfamily of PYKs. The c-src family has nine known members (blk, c-fgr,fyn, hck, lck, lyn, c-src, c-yes, and yrk) that are believed to play critical roles in signal transduction via their threesrc homology domains. The expression patterns of c-src family PYKs (reviewed in Ref. 26Kefalas P. Brown T.R. Brickell P.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1995; 27: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggests that they function in a broad range of biological situations. For example, c-src PYKs can associate with activated receptor PYKs, including the receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (27Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (28Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), both of which have been shown to influence β-cell growth and differentiation (29Mares J. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Growth Factors. 1992; 6: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Expression of c-abl was similarly detected in both RIN cell lines. The mammalian c-Abl protein, although not linked to a receptor, has been shown to bind to specific DNA sequences in the cell nucleus as well as to actin filaments (30Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. The cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, Raf-1, which is thought to play a critical role in the control of proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 31Li P. Wood K. Mamon H. Haser W. Roberts T. Cell. 1991; 64: 479-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 32Heidecker G. Kolch W. Morrison D.K. Rapp U.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 58: 53-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), was also detected in both RIN-5AH and RIN-A12 cells. Raf-1 is thought to act as a key regulatory molecule that integrates upstream signals from protein kinase C and Ras-like proteins (33Li S. Janosch P. Tanji M. Rosenfeld G.C. Waymire J.C. Mischak H. Koch W. Sedivy J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and transmits them into the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways.MLK-1 expression was detected only in the RIN-5AH cells, although it is possible that very low levels of MLK-1 mRNA may exist in RIN-A12 cells. However, because polymerase chain reaction primers used to amplify protein kinase sequences may not necessarily recognize all possible templates in each cell with equal efficiency, the differential expression of MLK-1 in RIN-5AH and A12 cells required more direct confirmation. Using both Northern analysis and anti-MLK-1 immunoprecipitation from lysates of biosynthetically labeled cells, we were unable to demonstrate the presence of MLK-1 mRNA or protein in RIN-A12 cells. Both were detected in the RIN-5AH cells, however, in support of the findings by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, immunocytochemistry with MLK-1-specific antibodies revealed a positive signal for MLK-1 in the cytoplasm of RIN-5AH cells, but not in RIN-A12 cells.The MLKs represent a new family of protein kinases that share several distinctive structural features. All members described thus far have catalytic domains in which the primary sequence contains motifs conserved in both serine/threonine and tyrosine-specific protein kinases. In addition, immediately COOH-terminal to the kinase catalytic domain are two predicted leucine/isoleucine zipper domains, separated by a short spacer region (18Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Leucine zipper sequences are usually associated with the dimerization of transcription factors that is critical for activation of transcription (34Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 35O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). It is possible that the two leucine zippers within the MLK-1 protein may form helices that interact with one another as has been postulated for helix-loop-helix domain structures (36Visvader J. Begley C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 330-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Helix-loop-helix domains have been shown to be critical for the myogenic function of the cell type-determining protein, Myo-D, as well as the oncogenic activity of c-myc(37Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). In addition to the dual leucine zipper domain, MLK proteins all contain an extremely basic sequence C-terminal to the zipper region (18Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although this basic domain generally occurs N-terminal to the helix-loop-helix motif in most transcription factors (38Churchill M.E.A. Travers A.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the ability of MLK-1 to bind DNA elements has not been excluded. MLKs 1–3 also contain a src homology 3 domain and a large C-terminal domain rich in serine, threonine, and proline residues that includes consensus sequences for phosphorylation by a number of other protein kinases. The presence of these domains raises the possibility that the MLKs may play roles in as yet undetermined signal transduction pathways.Our observations suggest that the expression of MLK-1 may be regulated by the functional state of the cell. Because RIN-A12 cells were generated from RIN-5AH cells after prolonged (6-day) culture in 1 mm NaB, we examined the effects on RIN-5AH cells of short term (6-h) stimulation with NaB as well as cell cycle synchronization following serum starvation. Expression of MLK-1 mRNA and protein were both up-regulated after a short stimulation with NaB and to a lesser extent after cell synchronization at Go/G1 followed by serum replacement. These findings were confirmed by anti-MLK-1 immunocytochemistry on resting and stimulated cells. It is possible, therefore, that stimulated RIN-5AH cells, which also display increased insulin mRNA synthesis, represent activated cells that may be at the threshold of the differentiation process. Unlike prolonged exposure to NaB, however, which drives RIN-5AH differentiation into a biochemically and morphologically more mature phenotype, a short stimulation with NaB did not affect the morphology or levels of insulin secretion of these cells. The fact that MLK-1 expression is up-regulated concomitant with phosphorylation on serine but not tyrosine at this early activated stage, raises the possibility of its involvement in early signaling cascades that lead to β-cell differentiation.To further investigate a potential role for MLK-1 in the early inductive phase of β-cell activation we designed and synthesized two sense and antisense ODNs corresponding to regions within the kinase catalytic and N-terminal domains of MLK-1. The sequences of both these regions are unique to MLK-1 and in particular are not conserved in other members of the MLK family and were not found to match any sequences other than MLK-1 in data base searches. Antisense ODNs to both MLK-1 regions were capable of altering cell morphology and DNA synthesis of RIN-5AH cells but not RIN-A12 cells. In addition, treatment of RIN-5AH cells with AS-ODNs ablated the ability of 1 mm NaB to stimulate an increase in the levels of MLK-1 protein expression, resulting in an elevation of glucagon mRNA levels without affecting the levels of insulin mRNA expression. Sense ODN-treated cells consistently failed to display altered phenotypes. Taken together, these results suggest that the inability of RIN-5AH cells to regulate their levels of MLK-1 following AS-ODN treatment resulted in a quiescent, undifferentiated phenotype that displayed low levels of both glucagon and insulin gene expression, reminiscent of the parental RINm cell line (16Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Chick W.J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Philippe J. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, these data suggest that although insulin gene regulation is a marker of cellular activation and ultimately differentiation, MLK-1 is not directly linked to pathways that regulate insulin mRNA expression. The effects of MLK-1 AS-ODNs on cellular morphology, however, are suggestive of a possible role for MLK-1 in activation pathways that modulate components of the cellular cytoskeleton.Recently, it has been reported that all of the members of the MLK family contain a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif and that proteins containing this motif may engage Cdc42 and/or Rac in a GTP-dependent manner and participate in downstream signaling events (39Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Indeed, the Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain of MLK-3 has been directly demonstrated to bind to the GTP form of Cdc42, with weaker binding to Rac GTP (39Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). These observations are of interest because Rho GTPase subfamily members (Rac, Cdc42) are known to stimulate the formation of focal adhesions and the reorganization of cytoskeletal components such as stress fibers (40Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar), membrane ruffling (41Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar), and filopodia (42Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). These events are thought to be critical during the activation stage of cellular responses (43Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, inDrosophila melanogaster both Rac and Cdc42 are involved in extension of neuronal growth cones (44Luo L. Liao Y.J. Yan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway via a series of phosphorylation intermediates resulting in transcriptional activation of c-Jun (45Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar,46Minden A. Lin A. Claret F-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). These intermediates, such as the kinases that phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (47Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erickson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar,48Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, act as dual specificity kinases in phosphorylation of the tripeptide motif, Thr-Xaa-Tyr, that is critical for activation and downstream signaling (49Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar). MLK-3 has been recently shown to directly bind Rac1 and Cdc42 in vivo and subsequently activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase without affecting the phosphorylation activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase or p38 (50Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is now thought that MLK3 participates within this pathway by binding to Rac and/or Cdc42 and phosphorylating c-Jun N-terminal kinase intermediates such as mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase and SAP/ERK kinase-1 (50Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 51Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J . Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 52Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, a precise biological role for the MLK family is not yet known. Interestingly, a more distantly related MLK family member, the dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase, has been recently implicated as a potentially important mediator of synaptic vesicle trafficking in nerve terminals, possibly as a result of signal transduction events mediated by calcineurin. The function(s) of MLKs in other cellullar systems is not yet understood. The above observations led us to ask whether MLK-1 was expressed during pancreatic development. In light of the restricted expression of MLK-1 to the less mature β-cell line, RIN-5AH, we reasoned that MLK-1 may be more highly expressed at early stages of pancreatic development, when precommitted ductal cells are thought to be pluripotent. We observed that in the embryonic pancreas, MLK-1 was primarily expressed in duct-like structures between embryonic days 13 and 16 of mouse embryogenesis. It is these ductal cells that are considered to be the precursors of mature endocrine cells, including β-cells. Interestingly, MLK-1 expression in the pancreas was not detectable in late gestation and young adulthood, mirroring the absence of MLK-1 from the more mature β-cell line, RIN-A12. These observations, taken together with the results of cell stimulation and antisense treatments, are consistent with a role for MLK-1 in the early inductive phases of β-cell development. Determination of interactions between MLK-1 and other cellular effector proteins during β-cell proliferation and differentiation should provide new insights into the developmental events leading to β-cell maturation. The pancreas responds to changes in blood glucose concentration by secreting insulin from β-cells resident in the islets of Langerhans. In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, β-cells are selectively destroyed by an autoimmune process (1Harrison L.C. Campbell I.L. Colman P.G. Chosich N. Kay T.W.H. Tait B.D. Bartholomeusz R.K. DeAizpurua H.J. Joseph J.L. Chu S. Kielcynski W. Adv. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 1: 35-94Google Scholar). The disease is chronic because the destructive autoimmunity is ongoing and because there is limited proliferative capacity in β-cells of the adult pancreas. Several studies have demonstrated the low replicative potential of the β-cell and identified factors that may influence β-cell growth in animal models (2Swenne I. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 3Swenne I. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 803-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nielsen J.H. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although the exact sequence of lineage events that results in mature islet cells is not known, it is believed that mature, insulin-secreting β-cells arise from pluripotent ductal precursors (5Alpert S. Hanahan D. Tietelman G. Cell. 1988; 53: 295-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 6Le Douarin N.M.

Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) The factors that mediate the developmental process from ductal cell to hormone-secreting islet cells in the pancreas have not yet been identified. In studies of cell growth and differentiation, it has been demonstrated that binding of polypeptide growth factors to their cognate receptors leads to the sequential activation of a series of signaling proteins that link the cell surface with nuclear targets and ultimately results in altered gene expression (9Mayer B.
