https://openalex.org/W3213442916,"Emerging evidence suggests that host glycans influence severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, we reveal that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein on SARS-CoV-2 recognizes oligosaccharides containing sialic acid (Sia), with preference for monosialylated gangliosides. Gangliosides embedded within an artificial membrane also bind to the RBD. The monomeric affinities (Kd = 100-200 μM) of gangliosides for the RBD are similar to another negatively charged glycan ligand of the RBD proposed as a viral co-receptor, heparan sulfate (HS) dp2-dp6 oligosaccharides. RBD binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells is decreased following depletion of cell surface Sia levels using three approaches: sialyltransferase (ST) inhibition, genetic knockout of Sia biosynthesis, or neuraminidase treatment. These effects on RBD binding and both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 viral entry are recapitulated with pharmacological or genetic disruption of glycolipid biosynthesis. Together, these results suggest that sialylated glycans, specifically glycolipids, facilitate viral entry of SARS-CoV-2."

Here, we show that the brain's insular cortex (InsCtx) stores immune-related information. Using activity-dependent cell labeling in mice (FosTRAP), we captured neuronal ensembles in the InsCtx that were active under two different inflammatory conditions (dextran sulfate sodium [DSS]-induced colitis and zymosan-induced peritonitis). Chemogenetic reactivation of these neuronal ensembles was sufficient to broadly retrieve the inflammatory state under which these neurons were captured. Thus, we show that the brain can store and retrieve specific immune responses, extending the classical concept of immunological memory to neuronal representations of inflammatory information."

Research on terrestrial threats to coastal ecosystems has primarily focused on agricultural runoff, specifically showcasing how fertilizers and livestock waste create coastal eutrophication, harmful algae blooms, or hypoxic or anoxic zones. These impacts not only harm coastal species and ecosystems but also impact human health and economic activities. Few studies have assessed impacts of human wastewater on coastal ecosystems and community health. As such, we lack a comprehensive, fine-resolution, global assessment of human sewage inputs that captures both pathogens and nutrient flows to coastal waters and the potential impacts on coastal ecosystems. To address this gap, we use a new high-resolution geospatial model to measure and map nitrogen (N) and pathogen—fecal indicator organisms (FIO)—inputs from human sewage for ~135,000 watersheds globally. Because solutions depend on the source, we separate nitrogen and pathogen inputs from sewer, septic, and direct inputs. Our model indicates that wastewater adds 6.2Tg nitrogen into coastal waters, which is approximately 40% of total nitrogen from agriculture. Of total wastewater N, 63% (3.9Tg N) comes from sewered systems, 5% (0.3Tg N) from septic, and 32% (2.0Tg N) from direct input. We find that just 25 watersheds contribute nearly half of all wastewater N, but wastewater impacts most coastlines globally, with sewered, septic, and untreated wastewater inputs varying greatly across watersheds and by country. Importantly, model results find that 58% of coral and 88% of seagrass beds are exposed to wastewater N input. Across watersheds, N and FIO inputs are generally correlated. However, our model identifies important fine-grained spatial heterogeneity that highlight potential tradeoffs and synergies essential for management actions. Reducing impacts of nitrogen and pathogens on coastal ecosystems requires a greater focus on where wastewater inputs vary across the planet. Researchers and practitioners can also overlay these global, high resolution, wastewater input maps with maps describing the distribution of habitats and species, including humans, to determine the where the impacts of wastewater pressures are highest. This will help prioritize conservation efforts.Without such information, coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them will remain imperiled."
https://openalex.org/W3210697779,"The Nsp9 replicase is a conserved coronaviral protein that acts as an essential accessory component of the multi-subunit viral replication/transcription complex. Nsp9 is the predominant substrate for the essential nucleotidylation activity of Nsp12. Compounds specifically interfering with this viral activity would facilitate its study. Using a native mass-spectrometry-based approach to screen a natural product library for Nsp9 binders, we identified an ent-kaurane natural product, oridonin, capable of binding to purified SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 with micromolar affinities. By determining the crystal structure of the Nsp9-oridonin complex, we showed that oridonin binds through a conserved site near Nsp9's C-terminal GxxxG-helix. In enzymatic assays, oridonin's binding to Nsp9 reduces its potential to act as substrate for Nsp12's Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain. We also showed using in vitro cellular assays oridonin, while cytotoxic at higher doses has broad antiviral activity, reducing viral titer following infection with either SARS-CoV-2 or, to a lesser extent, MERS-CoV. Accordingly, these preliminary findings suggest that the oridonin molecular scaffold may have the potential to be developed into an antiviral compound to inhibit the function of Nsp9 during coronaviral replication."

It is a primary complaint in chronic pain conditions and remains difficult to treat. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying spontaneous pain remain poorly understood. Here we employed in vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and discovered a distinct form of abnormal spontaneous activity following peripheral nerve injury: clusters of adjacent DRG neurons firing synchronously and sporadically. The level of cluster firing correlated directly with nerve injury-induced spontaneous pain behaviors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cluster firing is triggered by activity of sympathetic nerves, which sprout into DRGs after injury, and identified norepinephrine as a key neurotransmitter mediating this unique firing. Chemogenetic and pharmacological manipulations of sympathetic activity and norepinephrine receptors suggest that they are necessary and sufficient for DRG cluster firing and spontaneous pain behavior. Therefore, blocking sympathetically mediated cluster firing may be a new paradigm for treating spontaneous pain. Spontaneous pain refers to pain occurring without external stimuli.

We find that (1) financial constraints suppress corporate innovation. (2) Government subsidies are targeted at bailing out firms facing financial constraints. (3) Government subsidies promote corporate innovation (4) Government subsidies partially offset the suppression of financial constraints on innovation. We contribute to the fields of public finance, corporate finance, and corporate innovation by: (1) justifying the government subsidies target strategy as a bailout of corporate financial constraints, (2) verifying the corporate-innovation promotion of government subsidies, thus justifying the efficiency of government subsidies, and (3) showing that different types of innovation benefit differently from subsidies, thus justifying subsidies as a structural innovation engine."
https://openalex.org/W3207926133,"Fatigue syndromes have been widely observed following post-viral infection and are being recognised because of Covid19. Interventions used to treat and manage fatigue have been widely researched and this study aims to synthesise the literature associated with fatigue interventions to investigate the outcomes that may be applicable to 'long Covid'.The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214209) in October 2020 and five electronic databases were searched. Papers were screened, critically appraised and data extracted from studies that reported outcomes of fatigue interventions for post-viral syndromes. The narrative synthesis includes statistical analysis associated with effectiveness and then identifies the characteristics of the interventions, including identification of transferable learning for the treatment of fatigue in long Covid. An expert panel supported critical appraisal and data synthesis.Over 7,000 research papers revealed a diverse range of interventions and fatigue outcome measures. Forty papers were selected for data extraction after final screening. The effectiveness of all interventions was assessed according to mean differences (MD) in measured fatigue severity between each experimental group and a control following the intervention, as well as standardised mean differences as an overall measure of effect size. Analyses identified a range of effects-from most effective MD -39.0 [95% CI -51.8 to -26.2] to least effective MD 42.28 [95% CI 33.23 to 51.34]-across a range of interventions implemented with people suffering varying levels of fatigue severity. Interventions were multimodal with a range of supportive therapeutic methods and varied in intensity and requirements of the participants. Those in western medical systems tended to be based on self- management and education principles (i.e., group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).Findings suggest that the research is highly focussed on a narrow participant demographic and relatively few methods are effective in managing fatigue symptoms. Selected literature reported complex interventions using self-rating fatigue scales that report effect. Synthesis suggests that long Covid fatigue management may be beneficial when a) physical and psychological support, is delivered in groups where people can plan their functional response to fatigue; and b) where strengthening rather than endurance is used to prevent deconditioning; and c) where fatigue is regarded in the context of an individual's lifestyle and home-based activities are used."
https://openalex.org/W3211185924,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are structurally connected with each other at specific sites termed mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). These physical links are composed of several tethering proteins and are important during varied cellular processes, such as calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism and transport, membrane biogenesis, and organelle remodeling. However, the attributes of specific tethering proteins in these cellular functions remain debatable. Here, we present data to show that one such tether protein, glucose regulated protein 75 (GRP75), is essential in increasing ER-mitochondria contact during palmitate-induced apoptosis in pancreatic insulinoma cells. We demonstrate that palmitate increased GRP75 levels in mouse and rat pancreatic insulinoma cells as well as in mouse primary islet cells. This was associated with increased mitochondrial Ca2+ transfer, impaired mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS production, and enhanced physical coupling between the ER and mitochondria. Interestingly, GRP75 inhibition prevented these palmitate-induced cellular aberrations. Additionally, GRP75 overexpression alone was sufficient to impair mitochondrial membrane potential, increase mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and ROS generation, augment ER-mitochondria contact, and induce apoptosis in these cells. In vivo injection of palmitate induced hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, as well as impaired glucose and insulin tolerance in mice. These animals also exhibited elevated GRP75 levels accompanied by enhanced apoptosis within the pancreatic islets. Our findings suggest that GRP75 is critical in mediating palmitate-induced ER-mitochondrial interaction leading to apoptosis in pancreatic islet cells."
https://openalex.org/W3213545440,"Generalized language models that are pre-trained with a large corpus have achieved great performance on natural language tasks. While many pre-trained transformers for English are published, few models are available for Japanese text, especially in clinical medicine. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a clinical specific BERT model with a huge amount of Japanese clinical text and evaluate it on the NTCIR-13 MedWeb that has fake Twitter messages regarding medical concerns with eight labels. Approximately 120 million clinical texts stored at the University of Tokyo Hospital were used as our dataset. The BERT-base was pre-trained using the entire dataset and a vocabulary including 25,000 tokens. The pre-training was almost saturated at about 4 epochs, and the accuracies of Masked-LM and Next Sentence Prediction were 0.773 and 0.975, respectively. The developed BERT did not show significantly higher performance on the MedWeb task than the other BERT models that were pre-trained with Japanese Wikipedia text. The advantage of pre-training on clinical text may become apparent in more complex tasks on actual clinical text, and such an evaluation set needs to be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3209548543,"Chronic exposure to high levels of manganese (Mn) leads to manganism, a neurological disorder with similar symptoms to those inherent to Parkinson's disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this pathological condition have yet to be established. Since the human excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) (glutamate transporter 1 in rodents) is predominantly expressed in astrocytes and its dysregulation is involved in Mn-induced excitotoxic neuronal injury, characterization of the mechanisms that mediate the Mn-induced impairment in EAAT2 function is crucial for the development of novel therapeutics against Mn neurotoxicity. Repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) exerts protective effects in many neurodegenerative diseases. But the effects of REST on EAAT2 expression and ensuing neuroprotection are unknown. Given that the EAAT2 promoter contains REST binding sites, the present study investigated the role of REST in EAAT2 expression at the transcriptional level in astrocytes and Mn-induced neurotoxicity in an astrocyte-neuron coculture system. The results reveal that astrocytic REST positively regulates EAAT2 expression with the recruitment of an epigenetic modifier, cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300, to its consensus binding sites in the EAAT2 promoter. Moreover, astrocytic overexpression of REST attenuates Mn-induced reduction in EAAT2 expression, leading to attenuation of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in the astrocyte-neuron coculture system. Our findings demonstrate that astrocytic REST plays a critical role in protection against Mn-induced neurotoxicity by attenuating Mn-induced EAAT2 repression and the ensuing excitotoxic dopaminergic neuronal injury. This indicates that astrocytic REST could be a potential molecular target for the treatment of Mn toxicity and other neurological disorders associated with EAAT2 dysregulation."
https://openalex.org/W3214006525,"To quantify nonfatal injurious police shootings of people and examine the factors associated with victim mortality.We gathered victim-level data on fatal and nonfatal injurious police shootings from four states that have such information publicly available: Florida (2009-14), Colorado (2010-19), Texas (2015-19), and California (2016-19). For each state, we examined bivariate associations between mortality and race/ethnicity, gender, age, weapon, and access to trauma care. We also estimated logistic regression models predicting victim mortality in each state.Forty-five percent of these police shooting victims (N = 1,322) did not die. Black-white disparities were more pronounced in nonfatal injurious police shootings than in fatal police shootings. Overall, Black victims were less likely than white victims to die from their wound(s). Younger victims were less likely to die from their wound(s), as well as those who were unarmed.Racial and age disparities in police shootings are likely more pronounced than previous estimates suggest.Other states should strongly consider compiling data like that which is currently being gathered in California. Absent data on nonfatal injurious police shootings-which account for a large share of deadly force incidents-researchers and analysts must be cautious about comparing and/or ranking jurisdictions in terms of their police-involved fatality rates."
https://openalex.org/W3213785775,"Urban traffic demand distribution is dynamic in both space and time. A thorough analysis of individuals' travel patterns can effectively reflect the dynamics of a city. This study aims to develop an analytical framework to explore the spatiotemporal traffic demand and the characteristics of the community structure shaped by travel, which is analyzed empirically in New York City. It uses spatial statistics and graph-based approaches to quantify travel behaviors and generate previously unobtainable insights. Specifically, people primarily travel for commuting on weekdays and entertainment on weekends. On weekdays, people tend to arrive in the financial and commercial areas in the morning, and the functions of zones arrived in the evening are more diversified. While on weekends, people are more likely to arrive at parks and department stores during the daytime and theaters at night. These hotspots show positive spatial autocorrelation at a significance level of p = 0.001. In addition, the travel flow at different peak times form relatively stable community structures, we find interesting phenomena through the complex network theory: 1) Every community has a very small number of taxi zones (TZs) with a large number of passengers, and the weighted degree of TZs in the community follows power-law distribution; 2) As the importance of TZs increases, their interaction intensity within the community gradually increases, or increases and then decreases. In other words, the formation of a community is determined by the key TZs with numerous traffic demands, but these TZs may have limited connection with the community in which they are located. The proposed analytical framework and results provide practical insights for urban and transportation planning."

We collected a large series of primary macula-on rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) cases and analysed the effect of socio-economic deprivation and ethnicity on both six-month retinal re-detachment rate and visual outcomes.Retrospective consecutive case series of 568 patients attending Birmingham and Midlands Eye Centre from January 2017-2020. Multiple Indices of Deprivation (IMD) deciles were used for deprivation status and split to two groups: IMD-A (Decile 1-5) and IMD-B (Decile 6-10). The two largest subgroups of ethnicities were compared, White and South Asians (SA).We report an overall retinal re-detachment rate of 8.5%. IMD-A re-detached significantly more than IMD-B (11.2% vs 6.0% respectively, p = 0.034). No statistical significance was found between White and SA re-detachment rate (9.1% and 5.6% respectively, p = 0.604). SA median age significantly lower at 49 years (IQR: 37-61) compared to White patients at 57 years (IQR: 50-65) (p = <0.001). IMD-A median age of 55 years (IQR: 46-64) was significantly lower to IMD-B median age of 58 years (IQR: 51-65) (p = 0.011). No differences in final visual outcomes were detected across all groups.We demonstrated an increased retinal re-detachment rate in our more deprived patients according to IMD and a younger cohort of SA compared to White ethnicity. Further prospective studies are required to demonstrate the link between socio-economic deprivation and surgical success."

Many efforts are made to develop efficient CRISPR/Cas RNP delivery methods that will not affect viability of target cell dramatically. Popular current methods and protocols of CRISPR/Cas RNP delivery include lipofection and electroporation, transduction by osmocytosis and reversible permeabilization and erythrocyte-based methods.In this study we will assess the efficiency and optimize current CRISPR/Cas RNP delivery protocols to target cells. We will conduct our work using molecular cloning, protein expression and purification, cell culture, flow cytometry (immunocytochemistry) and cellular imaging techniques.This will be the first extensive comparative study of popular current methods and protocols of CRISPR/Cas RNP delivery to human cell lines and primary cells. All protocols will be optimized and characterized using the following criteria i) protein delivery and genome editing efficacy; ii) viability of target cells after delivery (post-transduction recovery); iii) scalability of delivery process; iv) cost-effectiveness of the delivery process and v) intellectual property rights. Some methods will be considered 'research-use only', others will be recommended for scaling and application in the development of cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3211079320,"It has been shown that phages have evolved anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to inhibit host CRISPR-Cas systems. Most acr genes are located upstream of anti-CRISPR-associated (aca) genes, which is instrumental for identifying these acr genes. Thus far, eight Aca families (Aca1-Aca8) have been identified, all proteins of which share low sequence homology and bind to different target DNA sequences. Recently, Aca1 and Aca2 proteins were discovered to function as repressors by binding to acr-aca promoters, thus implying a potential anti-anti-CRISPR mechanism. However, the structural basis for the repression roles of Aca proteins is still unknown. Here, we elucidated apo-structures of Aca1 and Aca2 proteins and their complex structures with their cognate operator DNA in two model systems, the Pseudomonas phage JBD30 and the Pectobacterium carotovorum template phage ZF40. In combination with biochemical and cellular assays, our study unveils dimerization and DNA-recognition mechanisms of Aca1 and Aca2 family proteins, thus revealing the molecular basis for Aca1-and Aca2-mediated anti-CRISPR repression. Our results also shed light on understanding the repression roles of other Aca family proteins and autoregulation roles of acr-aca operons."

This construct has emerged as an important paradigm in the higher education field for many decades. However, evaluating and predicting the student’s engagement level in an online environment remains a challenge. The purpose of this study is to suggest an intelligent predictive system that predicts the student’s engagement level and then provides the students with feedback to enhance their motivation and dedication. Three categories of students are defined depending on their engagement level (Not Engaged, Passively Engaged, and Actively Engaged). We applied three different machine-learning algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network, to students’ activities recorded in Learning Management System reports. The results demonstrate that machine learning algorithms could predict the student’s engagement level. In addition, according to the performance metrics of the different algorithms, the Artificial Neural Network has a greater accuracy rate (85%) compared to the Support Vector Machine (80%) and Decision Tree (75%) classification techniques. Based on these results, the intelligent predictive system sends feedback to the students and alerts the instructor once a student’s engagement level decreases. The instructor can identify the students’ difficulties during the course and motivate them through e-mail reminders, course messages, or scheduling an online meeting."
https://openalex.org/W3213666568,"BCG vaccination is known to induce innate immune memory, which confers protection against heterologous infections. However, the effect of BCG vaccination on the conventional adaptive immune cells subsets is not well characterized. We investigated the impact of BCG vaccination on the frequencies of T cell subsets and common gamma c (γc) cytokines in a group of healthy elderly individuals (age 60-80 years) at one month post vaccination as part of our clinical study to examine the effect of BCG on COVID-19. Our results demonstrate that BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central (p<0.0001) and effector memory (p<0.0001) CD4+ T cells and diminished frequencies of naïve (p<0.0001), transitional memory (p<0.0001), stem cell memory (p = 0.0001) CD4+ T cells and regulatory T cells. In addition, BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central (p = 0.0008), effector (p<0.0001) and terminal effector memory (p<0.0001) CD8+ T cells and diminished frequencies of naïve (p<0.0001), transitional memory (p<0.0001) and stem cell memory (p = 0.0034) CD8+T cells. BCG vaccination also induced enhanced plasma levels of IL-7 (p<0.0001) and IL-15 (p = 0.0020) but diminished levels of IL-2 (p = 0.0033) and IL-21 (p = 0.0020). Thus, BCG vaccination was associated with enhanced memory T cell subsets as well as memory enhancing γc cytokines in elderly individuals, suggesting its ability to induce non-specific adaptive immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W3213700879,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a high risk of transmission in close-contact indoor settings, which may include households. Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy. Methods We compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior SARS-CoV-2 test reporting from members of 9,224 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population. Results We estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.41% (95% CI 0.32%– 0.51%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 36% (27%– 48%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 16% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.41 (0.33–0.52) to avoid continued growth of the pandemic in Utah. Conclusions Our findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals. Mitigation efforts targeting large households and other locations where many people congregate indoors might curb continued spread of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3209932177,"Membrane protein variants with diminished conformational stability often exhibit enhanced cellular expression at reduced growth temperatures. The expression of “temperature-sensitive” variants is also typically sensitive to corrector molecules that bind and stabilize the native conformation. There are many examples of temperature-sensitive rhodopsin variants, the misfolding of which is associated with the molecular basis of retinitis pigmentosa. In this work, we employ deep mutational scanning to compare the effects of reduced growth temperature and 9-cis-retinal, an investigational corrector, on the plasma membrane expression of 700 rhodopsin variants in HEK293T cells. We find that the change in expression at reduced growth temperatures correlates with the response to 9-cis-retinal among variants bearing mutations within a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TM2). The most sensitive variants appear to disrupt a native helical kink within this transmembrane domain. By comparison, mutants that alter the structure of a polar transmembrane domain (TM7) exhibit weaker responses to temperature and retinal that are poorly correlated. Statistical analyses suggest that this observed insensitivity cannot be attributed to a single variable, but likely arises from the composite effects of mutations on the energetics of membrane integration, the stability of the native conformation, and the integrity of the retinal-binding pocket. Finally, we show that the characteristics of purified temperature- and retinal-sensitive variants suggest that the proteostatic effects of retinal may be manifested during translation and cotranslational folding.

Eukaryotic membrane proteins are prone to misfolding, and mutations that enhance their propensity to misfold are associated with a myriad of diseases of aberrant protein homeostasis (1Marinko J.T.

The expression of many tempterature-sensitive variants can also be restored by small-molecule correctors that preferentially bind and stabilize the native conformation (10Bernier V. Lagace M.

However, response to these compounds varies considerably among class II variants for reasons that remain unclear as a result of the heterogeneity of their molecular defects (14Veit G. Avramescu R.G.

Energetics of membrane protein folding.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2014; 43: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the basis of these variations, we recently surveyed mutagenic trends in the class A G-protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin, the misfolding of which causes retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (16Athanasiou D.

Our investigations have collectively revealed that the plasma membrane expression (PME) of rhodopsin is particularly sensitive to mutations within its seventh transmembrane domain (TM7) (20Penn W.D.

Schlebach J.P. Contribution of cotranslational folding defects to membrane protein homeostasis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019; 141: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, variants bearing mutations within TM7 appear to be less sensitive to the proteostatic effects of retinal relative to mutations within its second transmembrane domain (TM2), which is considerably more hydrophobic (20Penn W.D. McKee A.G. Kuntz C.P. Woods H. Nash V. Gruenhagen T.C. Roushar F.J. Chandak M. Hemmerich C. Rusch D.B. Meiler J. Schlebach J.P. Probing biophysical sequence constraints within the transmembrane domains of rhodopsin by deep mutational scanning.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaay7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that mutations within different regions of the molecule may have divergent pharmacological profiles as a result of their distinct conformational effects. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to delineate the effects of mutations on cotranslational folding, posttranslational folding, and the intrinsic binding energetics. In this work, we utilize DMS to survey the temperature sensitivity of 700 combined TM2 and TM7 variants in relation to their response to 9-cis-retinal. Using a panel of computational and structural tools, we identify various classes of temperature- and/or retinal-sensitive mutations. Consistent with expectations, we find a robust statistical correlation between the degree of temperature- and retinal-sensitivity among TM2 variants. Moreover, we identify a cluster of mutations within this helix that render rhodopsin both temperature- and retinal sensitive by disrupting a native helical kink. An analysis of the crystal structures of G90D and T94I rhodopsin (22Singhal A. Ostermaier M.K. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Panneels V. Homan K.T. Tesmer J.J. Veprintsev D. Deupi X. Gurevich V.V.

Structural role of the T94I rhodopsin mutation in congenital stationary night blindness.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which cause congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), along with a series of molecular dynamics simulations suggests many mutations within this region perturb native backbone hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, such perturbations do not appear to be a unique feature of temperature-sensitive variants. By comparison, we find fewer temperature-sensitive mutations within TM7 and show that temperature sensitivity does not coincide with retinal sensitivity within this region. Statistical trends within these data suggest that this disconnect arises from the differential effects of these mutations on the stability of the native conformation, the fidelity of cotranslational folding, and/or the integrity of the retinal binding pocket. Together, these results provide insights into how the molecular defects caused by different classes of mutations ultimately influence their sensitivity to temperature and to correctors. Moreover, this unbiased survey of missense variants provides a molecular context to interpret the proteostatic effects and pharmacological profiles of the mutations that are known to cause RP and CSNB. To identify and characterize temperature-sensitive rhodopsin variants, we measured changes in the PME of several hundred variants at reduced growth temperature by DMS. We first utilized a genetically modified HEK293T cell line bearing a single genomic recombination site (24Matreyek K.A. Stephany J.J. Fowler D.M. A platform for functional assessment of large variant libraries in mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45e102Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to produce a pool of stable cells that collectively express a mixed library of TM2 variants, a mixed library of TM7 variants, or WT rhodopsin only. The surface immunostaining of stable cells expressing WT opsin increased by an average of 31% when the growth temperature was reduced to 27 °C for 24 h (Fig. 1A). Reducing the growth temperature also increased the average surface immunostaining intensity of recombinant cells expressing either the collection of TM2 variants (+13%, Fig. 1B) or TM7 variants (+8%, Fig. 1C) contained within each genetic library. Cells expressing these rhodopsin variants exhibit a relatively modest change in average intensity at 27 °C as a result of a minor subpopulation that expresses insensitive variants that exhibit minimal surface immunostaining under either condition (Fig. 1, B and C). Nevertheless, the relative proportion of these cells decreases at reduced temperature (Fig. 1, B and C), which suggests that many of these (likely class II) variants regain expression at 27 °C. These observations suggest that, like WT, many variants bearing mutations within these TM domains exhibit enhanced PME when the growth temperature is reduced to 27 °C. To identify specific variants that exhibit enhanced expression at 27 °C, we first utilized fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to fractionate the cellular libraries grown at each temperature according to the distribution of surface immunostaining intensities. We then used deep sequencing to track the expressed variants within each fraction and to estimate each of their surface immunostaining intensities as was previously described (20Penn W.D. McKee A.G. Kuntz C.P. Woods H. Nash V. Gruenhagen T.C. Roushar F.J. Chandak M. Hemmerich C. Rusch D.B. Meiler J. Schlebach J.P. Probing biophysical sequence constraints within the transmembrane domains of rhodopsin by deep mutational scanning.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaay7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To facilitate the comparison of these intensity values across replicates and conditions, we previously opted to normalize the value for each variant by that of WT (20Penn W.D. McKee A.G. Kuntz C.P. Woods H. Nash V. Gruenhagen T.C. Roushar F.J. Chandak M. Hemmerich C. Rusch D.B. Meiler J. Schlebach J.P. Probing biophysical sequence constraints within the transmembrane domains of rhodopsin by deep mutational scanning.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaay7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the temperature-sensitive expression of WT opsin undermines its utility as an internal control (Fig. 1A). As an alternative, we used the average intensity values for the collection of truncated nonsense variants within each library to normalize the intensity values of each missense variant. Heatmaps depicting normalized intensity values at 27 °C relative to those at 37 °C reveal which variants exhibit the largest increase in PME at reduced growth temperature (Fig. 2, A and B). These data reveal few generalizable trends about the sensitivity of TM2 or TM7 variants, which suggests that temperature sensitivity depends on the structural context of their mutations. Temperature sensitivity is typically associated with unstable variants that are poorly expressed, and it is generally assumed that their enhanced expression arises from an increase in thermodynamic stability and a corresponding increase in the fraction of folded protein at reduced growth temperatures. In this case, variants bearing destabilizing mutations that decrease PME should exhibit the largest increase in expression at 27 °C. Indeed, a plot of intensity ratios against the relative PME of each variant at 37 °C reveals that temperature sensitivity trends upward as expression levels decrease (Fig. 3A). However, this uptick in expression is only statistically significant among TM2 variants with diminished expression, and there appear to be relatively few temperature-sensitive TM7 variants overall (Fig. 3B). Together, these results reveal trends in the temperature sensitivity of 700 opsin variants and hint at underlying differences in the molecular effects of mutations in TM2 and TM7. To evaluate the coincidence between sensitivity to temperature and to correctors, we utilized our previous measurements (20Penn W.D. McKee A.G. Kuntz C.P. Woods H. Nash V. Gruenhagen T.C. Roushar F.J. Chandak M. Hemmerich C. Rusch D.B. Meiler J. Schlebach J.P. Probing biophysical sequence constraints within the transmembrane domains of rhodopsin by deep mutational scanning.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaay7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to calculate the change in the surface immunostaining of these variants in the presence of 5 μM 9-cis-retinal. Heatmaps depicting the change in the immunostaining intensity for each variant reveal few generalizable trends about retinal-sensitive mutations (Fig. 2, C and D), which suggests that this property also depends on structural context. Based on these measurements, we have assigned the molecular phenotypes of the 700 variants according to their response to both temperature and retinal (Table S1). Mutations that introduce polar side chains within the C-terminal residues of TM2 generally render rhodopsin sensitive to both temperature and retinal (Fig. 2, A and C). These residues are directly adjacent to a rigid region within the rhodopsin structure that makes key contributions to its stability (25Rader A.J. Anderson G. Isin B. Khorana H.G. Bahar I. Klein-Seetharaman J. Identification of core amino acids stabilizing rhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7246-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, a simulated thermal denaturation (26Pfleger C. Rathi P.C. Klein D.L. Radestock S. Gohlke H. Constraint network analysis (CNA): A Python software package for efficiently linking biomacromolecular structure, flexibility, (thermo-)stability, and function.J. Chem. Inf.

Global and local indices for characterizing biomolecular flexibility and rigidity.J. Comput. Chem. 2013; 34: 220-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) of the native rhodopsin ensemble suggests that the C-terminal residues are actually more dynamic than the N-terminal residues of TM2 (Fig. S1). Interestingly, these dynamic residues surround a native kink that is mediated by two consecutive glycine residues (G89 and G90, Figs. 2, A and C, and 4, A and B). This kink is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds established between G89 (backbone C=O), G90 (backbone C=O), S93 (backbone NH, sidechain OH), and T94 (backbone NH & sidechain OH, Fig. 4C). Notably, there are several pathogenic mutations that either introduce a polar side chain or remove a native polar side chain near this kink. Three of these mutations cause RP (V87D, G89R, and T89I) and result in a loss of PME (20Penn W.D. McKee A.G. Kuntz C.P. Woods H. Nash V. Gruenhagen T.C. Roushar F.J. Chandak M. Hemmerich C. Rusch D.B. Meiler J. Schlebach J.P. Probing biophysical sequence constraints within the transmembrane domains of rhodopsin by deep mutational scanning.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaay7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Two others that cause CSNB (G90D and T94I) feature nonnative tertiary contacts that increase expression yet disrupt retinal binding and/or the native photocycle. Nevertheless, crystal structures of these two variants show that, while the helical kink is maintained by surrounding tertiary contacts, the hydrogen bonding network that locally stabilizes it is disrupted (Fig. 4, D and E) (22Singhal A. Ostermaier M.K. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Panneels V. Homan K.T. Tesmer J.J. Veprintsev D. Deupi X. Gurevich V.V. Schertler G.F. Standfuss J. Insights into congenital stationary night blindness based on the structure of G90D rhodopsin.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Singhal A. Guo Y. Matkovic M. Schertler G. Deupi X. Yan E.C. Standfuss J. Structural role of the T94I rhodopsin mutation in congenital stationary night blindness.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To assess whether the perturbation of this hydrogen bonding network is a common feature of temperature-sensitive mutants, we carried out a series of molecular dynamics simulations to compare the impact of three temperature-sensitive (G89E, G90R, and T94R) and three temperature-insensitive (G89S, G90V, and T94L) mutations on the conformational dynamics of the kink. Our results suggest that all six of these mutations disrupt the native backbone hydrogen bonding dynamics of the kink (Fig. S2). Consistent with crystallographic structures (Fig. 4), these results confirm that this hydrogen bonding network is sensitive to mutations within this region. Nevertheless, such perturbations do not appear to be a unique feature of temperature-sensitive variants. Across all TM2 variants, the change in expression in the presence of 9-cis-retinal is statistically correlated with the change in expression at 27 °C (Fig. 3C, Pearson’s R = 0.54, m = 0.98 ± 0.08). In contrast, the response of TM7 variants to retinal appears to diverge from their response to a reduction in growth temperature (Fig. 2, B and D). Moreover, the correlation between the intensity ratios of TM7 variants is considerably weaker, and increases in surface immunostaining at 27 °C generally coincide with a smaller change in the presence of retinal (Fig. 3C, Pearson’s R = 0.36, m = 0.23 ± 0.03). We note that, if changes in PME reflect the impacts of mutations on the free energy of folding and the corresponding fraction of folded protein, then ideal trends should be nonlinear. We therefore calculated Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, which do not assume linearity, in order to evaluate the statistical significance of the coincidence between temperature- and retinal sensitivity among these variants. Rank correlation coefficients suggest that the coincidence between temperature- and retinal sensitivity is highly significant among TM2 variants (ρ = 0.37. p = 3.6 × 10−13) but not among TM7 variants (ρ = 0.01, p = 0.79). Together, these observations reveal that temperature sensitivity only coincides with retinal sensitivity among mutations within certain regions of the protein. We suspect the decoupling of temperature sensitivity from retinal sensitivity among TM7 variants arises from a distinction in the underlying conformational effects of these mutations. In the following section, we analyze deviations in the expression profiles of certain subsets of variants in order to test a series of hypotheses related to the origins of temperature- and retinal-sensitivity. We first hypothesized that certain mutations in TM7 render rhodopsin expression insensitive to changes in temperature and/or retinal by enhancing the stability of the native conformation and increasing the fraction of folded apoprotein. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed mutant sensitivity profiles in relation to their predicted impacts on conformational stability. Both technical challenges (15Fleming K.G. Energetics of membrane protein folding.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2014; 43: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the sheer volume of data preclude experimental approaches to measure the stability of the 700 rhodopsin mutants characterized herein. As an alternative, we calculated Rosetta ΔΔG values (28Kellogg E.H. Leaver-Fay A. Baker D. Role of conformational sampling in computing mutation-induced changes in protein structure and stability.Proteins. 2011; 79: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) to estimate the effects of each of these mutations on the free energy of the native conformation (20Penn W.D. McKee A.G. Kuntz C.P. Woods H. Nash V. Gruenhagen T.C. Roushar F.J. Chandak M. Hemmerich C. Rusch D.B. Meiler J. Schlebach J.P. Probing biophysical sequence constraints within the transmembrane domains of rhodopsin by deep mutational scanning.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaay7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Despite quantitative limitations (29Kroncke B.M. Duran A.M. Mendenhall J.L. Meiler J. Blume J.D. Sanders C.R. Documentation of an imperative to improve methods for predicting membrane protein stability.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 5002-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), ensembles of stability predictions remain useful for the identification of energetic trends within large data sets (20Penn W.D. McKee A.G. Kuntz C.P. Woods H. Nash V. Gruenhagen T.C. Roushar F.J. Chandak M. Hemmerich C. Rusch D.B. Meiler J. Schlebach J.P.

Biol. 2007; 369: 1318-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Using these ΔΔG values, we applied a series of increasingly stringent cutoffs to filter out neutral or stabilizing mutations and define subsets of TM7 variants that are enriched with destabilizing mutations. For both TM2 and TM7 variants, the rank correlation between temperature- and retinal sensitivity improves as the stringency of the cutoff value increases (Table 1). Moreover, this correlation is statistically significant among the subset of TM7 variants predicted to increase the free energy of folding by more than 3.0 Rosetta energy units (REU, Table 1). Consistent with expectations, median intensity ratios associated with the response to both temperature and retinal are higher among destabilized variants (ΔΔG >5.0 REU) in both TMs 2 and 7 (Fig. 5). Together, these findings suggest that the insensitivity of TM7 variants arises, in part, from the fact that this domain appears to have a relatively small proportion of destabilizing mutations (Table 1).Table 1Coincidence between temperature and retinal response among variant subclassesParsingTM2 variantsTM7 variantsNumber of variantsSpearman’s ρp- valueNumber o"

The native sequences from fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be collected. Data from different sources will be integrated and analyzed using ML and DL, and forecasting algorithms will be developed for each outcome.

https://openalex.org/W3213350478,"Accurate and reliable relative gene expression analysis via the Reverse Transcription-quantitative Real Time PCR (RT-qPCR) method strongly depends on employing several stable reference genes as normalizers. Utilization of the reference genes without analyzing their expression stability under each experimental condition causes RT-qPCR analysis error as well as false output. Similar to cancerous tissues, cancer cell lines also exhibit various gene expression profiles. It is crucial to recognize stable reference genes for well-known cancer cell lines to minimize RT-qPCR analysis error. In this study, we showed the expression level and investigated the expression stability of eight common reference genes that are ACTB, YWHAZ, HPRT1, RNA18S, TBP, GAPDH, UBC, and B2M, in two sets of cancerous cell lines. One set contains MCF7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB231 as breast cancer cell lines. Another set includes three hepatic cancer cell lines, including Huh7, HepG2, and PLC-PRF5. Three excel-based softwares comprising geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder, and an online tool, namely RefFinder were used for stability analysis. Although all four algorithms did not show the same stability ranking of nominee genes, the overall results showed B2M and ACTB as the least stable reference genes for the studied breast cancer cell lines. While TBP had the lowest expression stability in the three hepatic cancer cell lines. Moreover, YWHAZ, UBC, and GAPDH showed the highest stability in breast cancer cell lines. Besides that, a panel of five nominees, including ACTB, HPRT1, UBC, YWHAZ, and B2M showed higher stability than others in hepatic cancer cell lines. We believe that our results would help researchers to find and to select the best combination of the reference genes for their own experiments involving the studied breast and hepatic cancer cell lines. To further analyze the reference genes stability for each experimental condition, we suggest researchers to consider the provided stability ranking emphasizing the unstable reference genes."

The rapid development and deployment of extremely effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have seemingly brought within reach the end of the pandemic. However, the virus has acquired mutations. and emerging variants of concern are more infectious and reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines. Although promising efforts to combat these variants are underway, the evolutionary pressures leading to these variants are poorly understood. To that end, here we have studied the effects on the structure and function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain of three amino-acid substitutions found in several variants of concern, including alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), and gamma (P.1). We found that these substitutions alter the receptor-binding domain structure, stability, and ability to bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2, in such a way as to possibly have opposing and compensatory effects. These findings provide new insights into how these variants of concern may have been selected for infectivity while maintaining the structure and stability of the receptor binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W3211245133,"Fungal plant pathogens secrete virulence-related proteins, called effectors, to establish host infection; however, the details are not fully understood yet. Functional screening of effector candidates using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assay in Nicotiana benthamiana identified two virulence-related effectors, named SIB1 and SIB2 (Suppression of Immunity in N. benthamiana), of an anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum orbiculare, which infects both cucurbits and N. benthamiana. The Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of SIB1 or SIB2 increased the susceptibility of N. benthamiana to C. orbiculare, which suggested these effectors can suppress immune responses in N. benthamiana. The presence of SIB1 and SIB2 homologs was found to be limited to the genus Colletotrichum. SIB1 suppressed both (i) the generation of reactive oxygen species triggered by two different pathogen-associated molecular patterns, chitin and flg22, and (ii) the cell death response triggered by the Phytophthora infestans INF1 elicitin in N. benthamiana. We determined the NMR-based structure of SIB1 to obtain its structural insights. The three-dimensional structure of SIB1 comprises five β-strands, each containing three disulfide bonds. The overall conformation was found to be a cylindrical shape, such as the well-known antiparallel β-barrel structure. However, the β-strands were found to display a unique topology, one pair of these β-strands formed a parallel β-sheet. These results suggest that the effector SIB1 present in Colletotrichum fungi has unique structural features and can suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in N. benthamiana."

Even though platelet parameters are among the proposed biomarkers for the prediction of preeclampsia, the use of its indices in the diagnosis of preeclampsia is not increasing in Ethiopia. There is little information on platelet patterns in preeclampsia and normal pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the pattern of platelet indices in women with preeclampsia in our study setting.A case-control study was conducted among 180 pregnant women who attended anti-natal follow-ups from January 1 to April 3, 2019. An Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic Acid anti-coagulated venous blood was collected and analyzed using a hematology analyzer (MINDRAY®-BC-300Plus, Shenzhen China).

A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 180 pregnant women were included in the study. Platelet count and platelet crit levels tend to decrease as pre-eclampsia becomes more severe. In contrast, the mean platelet volume and platelet distribution widths were significantly increased with the severity of preeclampsia (P<0.001). Platelet distribution width (rho = 0.731, p<0.001) and mean platelet volume (rho = 0.674, p<0.001) had statistically significant positive relationships with mean arterial pressure. The best metric for predicting preeclampsia was platelet distribution width (AUC = 0.986; 95%CI; 0.970, 1).Platelet indices, including platelet count, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, and Platelet crit, have been identified as promising candidate markers for predicting preeclampsia in pregnant women. In the future, a serial examination of these indicators during several trimesters of pregnancy should be conducted."
https://openalex.org/W3142659628,"Dating Violence (DV) is a public health problem that is on the rise. In this paper, we aim to analyse different factors associated with DV victimization among female and male adolescents in Spain, considering socioeconomic circumstances, sexual orientation and the presence of different attitudes and experiences related to violence.Cross-sectional data from a convenience sample of 640 ever-partnered adolescents aged 13 to 17 at schools in the cities of Alicante (n = 359, 50.1% girls) and Terrassa (n = 281, 51.9%) in the context of an educational intervention to promote healthy relationships. We calculated the prevalence of different forms of DV (physical, sexual and control and fear) and carried out multivariate regression models by sex.5.5% of girls and 8.7% of boys declared having suffered lifetime physical and/or sexual violence, while 22% of girls and 20.5% of boys reported control and/or fear victimization. The likelihood of DV was higher among migrants and those with foreign-born parents (aPR girls = 2.1 CI95%: 1.1-3.9; aPR boys = 1.9: CI95%: 1.0-3.6); prior experiences of abuse (aPR girls = 1.6; CI95%: 1.0-2.6; aPR boys = 1.7; CI95%: 1.1-2.6); and those who showed higher levels of machismo (aPR girls = 1.0; CI95%: 1.0-1.1; aPR boys = 1.0; CI95%: 1.0-1.1). In girls, DV increased among those who reported lesbian/bisexual orientation and poor relationship with teachers.DV is socially patterned and increases among LGB adolescents (especially in the case of girls), migrants, and those with foreign-born parents, and adolescents who reported prior experiences of violence in childhood. Future DV prevention programs should consider social inequalities in the likelihood of DV and by reinforcing adolescents' abilities to recognize social support sources and reject machismo and violence."
https://openalex.org/W3210346182,"The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) is part of a presynaptic multiprotein network involving interactions with scaffold proteins via its C-terminal PDZ domain-binding sequence. Using a mouse model expressing DAT with mutated PDZ-binding sequence (DAT-AAA), we previously demonstrated the importance of this binding sequence for striatal expression of DAT. Here, we show by application of direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy not only that the striatal level of transporter is reduced in DAT-AAA mice but also that the nanoscale distribution of this transporter is altered with a higher propensity of DAT-AAA to localize to irregular nanodomains in dopaminergic terminals. In parallel, we observe mesostriatal DA adaptations and changes in DA-related behaviors distinct from those seen in other genetic DAT mouse models. DA levels in the striatum are reduced to ∼45% of that of WT, accompanied by elevated DA turnover. Nonetheless, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings on striatal slices reveal a larger amplitude and prolonged clearance rate of evoked DA release in DAT-AAA mice compared with WT mice. Autoradiography and radioligand binding show reduced DA D2 receptor levels, whereas immunohistochemistry and autoradiography show unchanged DA D1 receptor levels. In behavioral experiments, we observe enhanced self-administration of liquid food under both a fixed ratio of one and progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement but a reduction compared with WT when using cocaine as reinforcer. In summary, our data demonstrate how disruption of PDZ domain interactions causes changes in DAT expression and its nanoscopic distribution that in turn alter DA clearance dynamics and related behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3212069271,"Objectives We investigated the predictive value of subset scales and full versions of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) for therapeutic outcomes in ECT. Methods This secondary analysis of patients with major depression (N = 136; 63% female; age = 56.7 [SD = 14.8]) from the EFFECT-Dep trial (NCT01907217) examined the predictive value of Evans-6, Toronto-7, Gibbons-8 and Maier-Philip 6 HAMD subset scales and three ‘full’ versions (HAMD-17, HAMD-21 and HAMD-24) on therapeutic outcomes. We also examined early improvement on subset scales and full versions as predictors of response and remission and explored predictive abilities of individual HAMD-24 items. Results The subset scales and full scales lacked sufficient predictive ability for response and remission. Receiver operating characteristic curves identified a lack of discriminative capacity of HAMD subset scales and full versions at baseline to predict response and remission. Only the Maier-Philip-6 was significantly associated with percentage reduction in HAMD-24 scores from baseline to end of ECT course. Early improvement on most of the subset scales and full versions was a sensitive and specific predictor of response and remission. Four of the HAMD-24 items were significantly associated with response and one with remission. Conclusions Limited utility of the HAMD subset scales and full versions in this context highlight a need for more tailored depression rating scales for ECT."

This study aimed to evaluate the management and outcomes of patients with postoperative pancreatic fistula and verify the significance of computed tomography values for predicting peripancreatic fluid infections after distal pancreatectomy. We retrospectively investigated 259 consecutive patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy. Grade B postoperative pancreatic fistula patients were divided into two subgroups (B-antibiotics group and B-intervention group) and outcomes were compared. Predictive factor analysis of peripancreatic fluid infection was performed. Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistulas developed in 88 (34.0%) patients. The duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in the B-intervention (n = 54) group than in the B-antibiotics group (n = 31; 41 vs. 17 days, p &lt; 0.001). Computed tomography values of the infected peripancreatic fluid collections were significantly higher than those of the non-infected peripancreatic fluid collections (26.3 vs. 16.1 Hounsfield units, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The outcomes of the patients with grade B postoperative pancreatic fistulas who received therapeutic antibiotics only were considerably better than those who underwent interventions. Computed tomography values may be useful in predicting peripancreatic fluid collection infection after distal pancreatectomy."

https://openalex.org/W3213798611,"Clinical and surveillance testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus relies overwhelmingly on RT-qPCR-based diagnostics, yet several popular assays require 2-3 separate reactions or rely on detection of a single viral target, which adds significant time, cost, and risk of false-negative results. Furthermore, multiplexed RT-qPCR tests that detect at least two SARS-CoV-2 genes in a single reaction are typically not affordable for large scale clinical surveillance or adaptable to multiple PCR machines and plate layouts. We developed a RT-qPCR assay using the Luna Probe Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix with publicly available primers and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2 N gene, E gene, and human RNase P (LuNER) to address these shortcomings and meet the testing demands of a university campus and the local community. This cost-effective test is compatible with BioRad or Applied Biosystems qPCR machines, in 96 and 384-well formats, with or without sample pooling, and has a detection sensitivity suitable for both clinical reporting and wastewater surveillance efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3213961178,"Describe what costs and benefits parents across the socioeconomic spectrum weight most heavily when making decisions about sport participation for their children.Cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative online panel of parents of children between the ages of 5 and 18 (n = 1025, 52% response rate). Parents rated the importance of a series of potential costs and benefits of youth sport and these responses were compared across tertiles of per capita family income. We first examined the association between family income tertiles and cost and benefit variables. Model-based cluster analysis was then used to identity homogeneous groups of responses to costs and benefits.In all income tertiles, the top two benefits of sport were the same: having fun and being physically active. Sport as a means of keeping children out of trouble was very important for 64% of low-income parents as compared to 40% of high-income parents. Obtaining a college athletic scholarship was very important for 26% of low-income parents, as compared to 8% of high-income parents. Relative rankings of potential costs were similar by income tertile, with risk of concussion and other injury and the impact of sport on schoolwork prioritized across tertiles.Parents prioritized fun and fitness in sport, and were concerned about injury and the impact of sport on academics. Lower income parents were the most likely to view keeping their child out of trouble, and the potential for a college athletics scholarship, as benefits of sport. Efforts to support parental decision making should be grounded in an understanding that family preferences are contextually constrained. While all parents should be appropriately informed about the potential costs and benefits they are weighting in their sports-related decision making, such family-focused efforts should be balanced with the recognition that structural change is needed to address income-related concerns about sport participation."

https://openalex.org/W3209922466,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) convert external stimuli into cellular signals through heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) and β-arrestins (βarrs). In a βarr-dependent signaling pathway, βarrs link GPCRs to various downstream signaling partners, such as the Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade. Agonist-stimulated GPCR-βarr complexes have been shown to interact with C-Raf and are thought to initiate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway through simple tethering of these signaling partners. However, recent evidence shows that in addition to canonical scaffolding functions, βarrs can allosterically activate downstream targets, such as the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src. Here, we demonstrate the direct allosteric activation of C-Raf by GPCR-βarr1 complexes in vitro. Furthermore, we show that βarr1 in complex with a synthetic phosphopeptide mimicking the human V2 vasopressin receptor tail that binds and functionally activates βarrs also allosterically activates C-Raf. We reveal that the interaction between the phosphorylated GPCR C terminus and βarr1 is necessary and sufficient for C-Raf activation. Interestingly, the interaction between βarr1 and C-Raf was considerably reduced in the presence of excess activated H-Ras, a small GTPase known to activate C-Raf, suggesting that H-Ras and βarr1 bind to the same region on C-Raf. Furthermore, we found that βarr1 interacts with the Ras-binding domain of C-Raf. Taken together, these data suggest that in addition to canonical scaffolding functions, GPCR-βarr complexes directly allosterically activate C-Raf by binding to its amino terminus. This work provides novel insights into how βarrs regulate effector molecules to activate downstream signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3210192594,"Preserving optimal mitochondrial function is critical in the heart, which is the most ATP-avid organ in the body. Recently, we showed that global deficiency of the nuclear receptor RORα in the ""staggerer"" mouse exacerbates angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and compromises cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function. However, the mechanisms underlying these observations have not been defined previously. Here, we used pharmacological and genetic gain- and loss-of-function tools to demonstrate that RORα regulates cardiomyocyte mitophagy to preserve mitochondrial abundance and function. We found that cardiomyocyte mitochondria in staggerer mice with lack of functional RORα were less numerous and exhibited fewer mitophagy events than those in WT controls. The hearts of our novel cardiomyocyte-specific RORα KO mouse line demonstrated impaired contractile function, enhanced oxidative stress, increased apoptosis, and reduced autophagic flux relative to Cre(-) littermates. We found that cardiomyocyte mitochondria in ""staggerer"" mice with lack of functional RORα were upregulated by hypoxia, a classical inducer of mitophagy. The loss of RORα blunted mitophagy and broadly compromised mitochondrial function in normoxic and hypoxic conditions in vivo and in vitro. We also show that RORα is a direct transcriptional regulator of the mitophagy mediator caveolin-3 in cardiomyocytes and that enhanced expression of RORα increases caveolin-3 abundance and enhances mitophagy. Finally, knockdown of RORα impairs cardiomyocyte mitophagy, compromises mitochondrial function, and induces apoptosis, but these defects could be rescued by caveolin-3 overexpression. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel role for RORα in regulating mitophagy through caveolin-3 and expand our currently limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying RORα-mediated cardioprotection."

This cross-sectional study explores the association between socioeconomic factors and PPD literacy with PPD incidence in 350 participants (mean age: 30.58±4.72 years) at one to six months postpartum, who attended the Kuala Lumpur Health Clinic from May to October 2020. PPD incidence and literacy were assessed using the validated Malay versions of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Postpartum Depression Literacy Scale (PoDLiS), respectively. The participants' socioeconomic characteristics were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Chi-square tests were performed to determine the association between these factors and PPD incidence. Binary logistic regression models were used to determine the odds ratios (OR). The incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 14.29%. Those with low household income were twice likely to have PPD symptoms (OR:2.58, 95% CI:1.23-5.19; p = 0.01) than those with higher incomes. Unemployment (i.e., participants who were housewives/homemakers) was associated with higher PPD incidence (Χ2(2, 350) = 6.97, p = 0.03), but it was not a significant PPD predictor. In conclusion, PPD incidence in the sample of Kuala Lumpur postpartum mothers is significantly associated with low household income. Other socioeconomic characteristics, including PPD literacy, were not significant predictors of PPD incidence."

https://openalex.org/W3214718971,"The Covid-19 pandemic has led millions of students worldwide to intensify their use of digital education. This massive change is not reflected by the scant scientific research on the effectiveness of methods relying on digital learning compared to other innovative and more popular methods involving face-to-face interactions. Here, we tested the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in Science and Technology compared to inquiry-based learning (IBL), another modern method which, however, requires students to interact with each other in the classroom. Our research also considered socio-cognitive factors-working memory (WM), socioeconomic status (SES), and academic self-concept (ASC)-known to predict academic performance but usually ignored in research on IBL and CAI. Five hundred and nine middle-school students, a fairly high sample size compared with relevant studies, received either IBL or CAI for a period varying from four to ten weeks prior to the Covid-19 events. After controlling for students' prior knowledge and socio-cognitive factors, multilevel modelling showed that CAI was more effective than IBL. Although CAI-related benefits were stable across students' SES and ASC, they were particularly pronounced for those with higher WM capacity. While indicating the need to adapt CAI for students with poorer WM, these findings further justify the use of CAI both in normal times (without excluding other methods) and during pandemic episodes."
https://openalex.org/W3209020935,"Human ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (ATR) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes an adenosyl transfer to cob(I)alamin, synthesizing 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or coenzyme B12. ATR is also a chaperone that escorts AdoCbl, transferring it to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is important in propionate metabolism. Mutations in ATR lead to methylmalonic aciduria type B, an inborn error of B12 metabolism. Our previous studies have furnished insights into how ATR protein dynamics influence redox-linked cobalt coordination chemistry, controlling its catalytic versus chaperone functions. In this study, we have characterized three patient mutations at two conserved active site residues in human ATR, R190C/H, and E193K and obtained crystal structures of R190C and E193K variants, which display only subtle structural changes. All three mutations were found to weaken affinities for the cob(II)alamin substrate and the AdoCbl product and increase KM(ATP). 31P NMR studies show that binding of the triphosphate product, formed during the adenosylation reaction, is also weakened. However, although the kcat of this reaction is significantly diminished for the R190C/H mutants, it is comparable with the WT enzyme for the E193K variant, revealing the catalytic importance of Arg-190. Furthermore, although the E193K mutation selectively impairs the chaperone function by promoting product release into solution, its catalytic function might be unaffected at physiological ATP concentrations. In contrast, the R190C/H mutations affect both the catalytic and chaperoning activities of ATR. Because the E193K mutation spares the catalytic activity of ATR, our data suggest that the patients carrying this mutation are more likely to be responsive to cobalamin therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3211754203,"While past empirical studies have explored associations between types of primary and secondary schools and student academic achievement, outcomes beyond academic performance remain less well-understood. Using longitudinal data from a cohort of children (N = 12,288, mean age = 14.56 years) of nurses, this study examined associations between the types of schools participants attended in adolescence and a wide range of subsequent psychological well-being, social engagement, character strengths, mental health, health behavior and physical health outcomes. Results in this sample suggested little difference between attending private independent schools and public schools across outcomes in young adulthood. There were, however, notable differences in subsequent outcomes comparing homeschooling and public schools, and possibly some evidence comparing religious schools and public schools. Specifically, there was some evidence that attending religious schools versus public schools was associated with a higher likelihood of frequent religious service attendance and becoming registered voters, a lower risk of overweight/obese, fewer lifetime sexual partners, and a higher risk of subsequently being binge drinkers; however, these associations were not robust to correction for multiple testing. Homeschooling compared with public schooling was associated with subsequently more frequent volunteering (ß = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.52), greater forgiveness (ß = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.16, 0.46), and more frequent religious service attendance (Risk Ratio [RR] = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.80), and possibly also with greater purpose in life, less marijuana use, and fewer lifetime sexual partners, but negatively associated with college degree attainment (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.88) and possibly with greater risk of posttraumatic stress disorder.

https://openalex.org/W3212242794,"Induction of labor (IOL) is an essential intervention to reduce adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. It is also improved pregnancy outcomes, especially in resource-limited countries, where maternal and perinatal mortality is unacceptably high. However, there is a scarcity of evidence regarding the outcome of induction of labor and its predictors in low-income countries like Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing the outcome of induction of labor and associated factors among mothers who underwent labor induction in public Hospitals of Harari Regional State, Estern Ethiopia.A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 to 30 March, 2019 in Harari Regional State, Eastern Ethiopia. A total of 717 mothers who underwent induction of labor in public Hospitals of Harari Regional State, Eastern Ethiopia from January 2017 to December 2018 were enrolled in the study. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 24 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 2016) for further analysis. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the effects of each predictor variable on the outcome of induction of labor after controlling for potential confounders. Statistical significance was declared at p-value <0.05.Overall, the prevalence of success of induction of labor was 65% [95% CI (61.5, 68.5)]. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was found to be the most common indication for induction of labor (46.70%) followed by pre-labor rupture of fetal membrane (33.5%). In the final model of multivariable analysis, predictors such as: maternal age < 24 years old [AOR = 1.93, 95%CI(1.14, 3.26)], nulliparity[AOR = 0.34, 95%CI(0.19, 0.59)], unfavorable Bishop score [AOR = 0.06, 95%CI(0.03, 0.12)], intermediate Bishop score [AOR = 0.08, 95%CI(0.04, 0.14)], misoprostol only method [AOR = 2.29, 95%CI(1.01, 5.19)], nonreassuring fetal heart beat pattern [AOR = 0.14, 95%CI (0.07, 0.25)] and Birth weight 3500 grams and above[AOR = 0.32, 95% CI (0.17, 0.59)] were statistically associated with the successful outcome of induction of labor.The prevalence of successful of induction of labor was relatively low in this study area because only two-thirds of the mothers who underwent induction of labor had a successful of induction. Therefore, this result calls for all stakeholders to give more emphasis on locally available induction protocols and guidelines. In addition, pre-induction conditions must be taken into consideration to avoid unwanted effect of failed induction of labour."

However, few data or predictive models are available for the identification of patients with a high risk for massive IBL. This study aimed to build a model for massive IBL prediction using a decision tree algorithm, which is one machine learning method. One hundred and seventy-five patients undergoing curative surgery for resectable PDAC at our facility between January 2007 and October 2020 were allocated to training (n = 128) and testing (n = 47) sets. Using the preoperatively available data of the patients (34 variables), we built a decision tree classification algorithm. Of the 175 patients, massive IBL occurred in 88 patients (50.3%). Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that alanine aminotransferase and distal pancreatectomy were significant predictors of massive IBL occurrence with an overall correct prediction rate of 70.3%. Decision tree analysis automatically selected 14 predictive variables. The best predictor was the surgical procedure. Though massive IBL was not common, the outcome of patients with distal pancreatectomy was secondarily split by glutamyl transpeptidase. Among patients who underwent PD (n = 83), diabetes mellitus (DM) was selected as the variable in the second split. Of the 21 patients with DM, massive IBL occurred in 85.7%. Decision tree sensitivity was 98.5% in the training data set and 100% in the testing data set. Our findings suggested that a decision tree can provide a new potential approach to predict massive IBL in surgery for resectable PDAC."

https://openalex.org/W3211885207,"Due to COVID-19 precautions, the Vanderbilt University summer biomedical undergraduate research program, the Vanderbilt Summer Science Academy (VSSA), rapidly transitioned from offering an in-person training program to a virtual seminar format. Our program typically supports undergraduate development through research and/or clinical experience, meeting with individuals pursuing postgraduate training, and providing career development advice. Evidence supports the idea that summer programs transform undergraduates by clarifying their interest in research and encouraging those who haven't previously considered graduate studies. We were interested in exploring whether a virtual, synchronous program would increase participants' scientific identity and clarify postgraduate career planning. Rather than create a virtual research exposure, our 5-week ""Virtual VSSA"" program aimed to simulate the casual connections that would naturally be made with post-undergraduate trainees during a traditional summer program. In seminars, presenters discussed 1) their academic journey, explaining their motivations, goals, and reasons for pursuing a career in science as well as 2) a professional story that illustrated their training. Seminars included Vanderbilt University and Medical School faculty, M.D., MD/Ph.D., as well as Ph.D. students from diverse scientific and personal backgrounds. In addition, weekly informational sessions provided an overview of the nature of each degree program along with admissions advice. Through pre-and post-program surveys, we found that students who registered for this experience already strongly identified with the STEMM community (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine). However, participation in the Virtual VSSA increased their sense of belonging. We also uncovered a gap in participants' understanding of postgraduate pathways prior to participation and found that our program significantly increased their self-reported understanding of postgraduate programs. It also increased their understanding of why someone would pursue a Ph.D. or Ph.D./MD versus M.D. These changes did not uniformly impact participants' planned career paths. Overall, by providing personal, tangible stories of M.D., MD/Ph.D., and Ph.D. training, the Virtual VSSA program offered seminars that positively impacted students' sense of belonging with and connection to the STEMM disciplines."

https://openalex.org/W3214281770,"Numerous studies have demonstrated a negative relationship between community violence and youth academic achievement, but they have varied in their geographic definition of ""community,"" especially as it relates to proximity to students' residences. We extend this by considering the independent relationships between academic achievement and violent events (from 911 dispatches; e.g., gun shots) at the neighborhood (i.e., census tract) and street-block levels. We use data from standardized Math and English Language Arts (ELA) tests from Boston, MA for 2011-2013. Exposure to community violence was partially independent between streets and tracts, with some students living on low-crime streets in high-crime neighborhoods or high-crime streets in low-crime neighborhoods. Initial regression models found that differences in a neighborhood's violent crime predicted up to a 3% difference in test scores on both Math and ELA tests. Students living on high-crime streets scored an additional 1% lower than neighbors on safer streets. Subsequent models with student-level fixed effects, however, eliminated these relationships, except for the effect of neighborhood-level violence on Math scores. These findings suggest that future work should consider community violence at both geographic scales, but that in this case the impacts were only consistent at the neighborhood level and associations at the street level were seemingly due to spatial segregation of households."
