https://openalex.org/W3013893137,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infection of the respiratory tract that emerged in late 20191,2. Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% of cases with severe courses, and 6.1% of cases with critical courses3. This severe presentation may result from the virus using a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4; the same receptor tropism is thought to have determined the pathogenicity—but also aided in the control—of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of cases of COVID-19 in which the patient shows mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which suggests the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6–8. There is an urgent need for information on virus replication, immunity and infectivity in specific sites of the body. Here we report a detailed virological analysis of nine cases of COVID-19 that provides proof of active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, with a peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab on day 4. Infectious virus was readily isolated from samples derived from the throat or lung, but not from stool samples—in spite of high concentrations of virus RNA. Blood and urine samples never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by the presence of viral replicative RNA intermediates in the throat samples. We consistently detected sequence-distinct virus populations in throat and lung samples from one patient, proving independent replication. The shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (and by day 14 in all patients), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild illness of the upper respiratory tract. The confirmation of active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract has implications for the containment of COVID-19. Detailed virological analysis of nine cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provides proof of active replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in tissues of the upper respiratory tract."

https://openalex.org/W3014176310,"Background Low Back Pain (LBP) is associated with an increase in disability-adjusted life years, and increased risk of disability retirement and greater absenteeism in Brazil. Hence, evidence on healthcare and lost productivity costs due to LBP is of utmost importance to inform decision-makers. Methods Cost-of-illness study with top-down approach, and societal perspective. We extracted data from National databases, considering the period 2012–2016. Outpatient expenses included clinical, surgical, diagnosis, orthosis/prosthetics, and complementary actions. Inpatient care expenses included hospital and professional services, intensive care unit, and companion stay. For productivity losses, duration of work absence and associated information (work-related and non-work-related; value of the sickness absence benefit; age; gender; and economic activity) were analyzed. Lost productivity costs were calculated multiplying the absence from work (days) by the daily-benefit. Results The societal costs amounted to US$ 2.2 billion, and productivity losses represented 79% of the costs. Total healthcare expenses were estimated to US$ 460 million. We found more than 880,000 diagnostic images. Individuals with LBP were in total 59 million days absent from work between 2012–2016. The mean lost days absent from work per person, for each year investigated was, respectively, 88; 84; 83; 87; and 100. Men were more days absent from work than women. In addition, rural workers presented greater absence from work compared to other professional activities. Conclusion Healthcare expenses and lost productivity costs due to LBP were substantial, hence, there is a need for improvement of health services and policies to deal with this increasing burden of illness. We found an extensive use of diagnostic imaging, which is rather discouraged by clinical guidelines. We assume that men were experiencing high levels of back pain disability compared with women, as they presented greater absenteeism and higher lost productivity costs."

The vaccine was safe and generated robust immune responses, but delayed time to viral rebound compared to that in placebo recipients by only several days and did not lead to viremic control after treatment interruption (clinical trial NCT02919306)."
https://openalex.org/W3014241277,"The translocation of chemical insecticides in corn plants could enhance the control of Spodoptera frugiperda, based on their application form. Chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole were applied via seed treatment and foliar spray in corn (VE and V3) to characterize the systemic action of both molecules in leaves that appeared after application. Bioassays with S. frugiperda and chemical quantification in LC-MS/MS confirmed the absorption and upward translocation of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole by xylem to new leaves. Both insecticides caused the mortality of larvae up to stage V6 (57.5±9.5% for chlorantraniliprole and 40±8.1% for cyantraniliprole), indicating the translocation of insecticides into leaves of corn plants when applied via seed treatment. However, the translocation of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole from sprayed leaves to new leaves was not observed, regardless of the stage of application plus the next first, second and third stages. An increased dosage of cyantraniliprole did not influence on its translocation in plant tissues, however, it influenced on the present amount of active ingredient. The application of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole in seed treatment is an important alternative for integrated pest management. The absorption and redistribution capacity of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole throughout the plant confer a prolonged residual action with satisfactory control of S. frugiperda."
https://openalex.org/W3015181514,"Different evidence has indicated metabolic rewiring as a necessity for pancreatic cancer (PC) growth, invasion, and chemotherapy resistance. A relevant role has been assigned to glucose metabolism. In particular, an enhanced flux through the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) has been tightly linked to PC development. Here, we show that enhancement of the HBP, through the upregulation of the enzyme Phosphoacetylglucosamine Mutase 3 (PGM3), is associated with the onset of gemcitabine (GEM) resistance in PC. Indeed, mRNA profiles of GEM sensitive and resistant patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) indicate that PGM3 expression is specifically increased in GEM-resistant PDXs. Of note, PGM3 results also overexpressed in human PC tissues as compared to paired adjacent normal tissues and its higher expression in PC patients is associated with worse median overall survival (OS). Strikingly, genetic or pharmacological PGM3 inhibition reduces PC cell growth, migration, invasion, in vivo tumor growth and enhances GEM sensitivity. Thus, combined treatment between a specific inhibitor of PGM3, named FR054, and GEM results in a potent reduction of xenograft tumor growth without any obvious side effects in normal tissues. Mechanistically, PGM3 inhibition, reducing protein glycosylation, causes a sustained Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a significant attenuation of the pro-tumorigenic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-Akt axis, and finally cell death. In conclusion this study identifies the HBP as a metabolic pathway involved in GEM resistance and provides a strong rationale for a PC therapy addressing the combined treatment with the PGM3 inhibitor and GEM."
https://openalex.org/W3014245112,"Frailty is common in older patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since gut microbiota (gMB) may contribute to frailty, we explored possible associations between gMB and frailty in CKD.We studied 64 CKD patients (stage 3b-4), categorized as frail (F, 38) and not frail (NF, 26) according to Fried criteria, and 15 controls (C), all older than 65 years. In CKD we assessed serum C-reactive protein, blood neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, Malnutrition-inflammation Score (MIS); gMB was studied by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), high-throughput sequencing (16S r-RNA gene), and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR).No differences in alpha diversity between CKD and C and between F and NF patients emerged, but high-throughput sequencing showed significantly higher abundance of potentially noxious bacteria (Citrobacter, Coprobacillus, etc) and lower abundance of saccharolytic and butyrate-producing bacteria (Prevotella spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia spp.), in CKD respect to C. Mogibacteriaceae family and Oscillospira genus abundance was positively related to inflammatory indices in the whole CKD cohort, while that of Akkermansia, Ruminococcus and Eubacterium genera was negatively related. Compared with NF, in F there was a higher abundance of some bacteria (Mogibacteriacee, Coriobacteriacee, Eggerthella, etc), many of which have been described as more abundant in other diseases.These results suggest that inflammation and frailty could be associated to gMB modifications in CKD."
https://openalex.org/W3014342264,"Small-scale coastal fisheries contribute directly and indirectly to the food and nutrition security of marine-dependent households. Fishers can apportion part of their catch for household consumption or use the income earned to purchase staples and other desired foods. Fish are an important animal-source food rich in micronutrients essential for cognitive development of children and for adult health, and a valuable addition to rice-based diets. Furthermore, the engagement of women in fisheries value chains and increased control over income may facilitate decision-making which improves nutrition outcomes for women and their children. Despite these contributions, food insecurity remains prevalent in many low and middle income fish-producing countries. This paper reports findings from an exploration of the interplaying factors leading to food and nutrition insecurity in three marine-dependent coastal communities in eastern Indonesia, focusing on the consumption pathway, that is, the contribution of fish to the diets and nutrition of women and children. The research was undertaken as a mixed-methods case study. The study found that over 50% of mother-child pairs failed to meet the minimum recommended dietary diversity, and, while fish was the main animal-source food in diets, the introduction of fish to infant and young child diets was delayed due to fears of allergies and illnesses. Moreover, access to nutrient-dense foods was affected by variable and insufficient income from fisheries-based livelihoods, isolation from markets, and the broader food environment. Given the shift towards 'nutrition-sensitive interventions' to improve the livelihoods and well-being of fisher households, these results highlight the need for analysis of the intra-household sharing of fish within fisher households, culturally-appropriate strategies to improve the quality of family and especially complementary foods, and efforts to increase physical access to nutrient-dense foods."
https://openalex.org/W3014414552,"The Monopodal Squat, Forward Lunge and Lateral Step-Up exercises are commonly performed with one's own body weight for rehabilitation purposes. However, muscle activity evaluated using surface electromyography has never been analyzed among these three exercises. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the amplitude of the EMG activity of the gluteus medius, gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and rectus femoris muscles in participants performing the Lateral Step-Up, Forward Lunge and Monopodal Squat exercises. A total of 20 physically active participants (10 men and 10 women) performed 5 repetitions at 60% (5 repetition maximum) in each of the evaluated exercises. The EMG amplitude was calculated in percentage of the maximum voluntary contraction. The Monopodal Squat exercise showed a higher EMG activity (p ≤ 0.001) in relation to the Lateral Step-Up and Forward Lunge exercises in all of the evaluated muscles (d > 0.6) except for the rectus femoris. The three exercises showed significantly higher EMG activity in all of the muscles that were evaluated in the concentric phase in relation to the eccentric one. In the three evaluated exercises, vastus lateralis and vastus medialis showed the highest EMG activity, followed by gluteus medius and gluteus maximus. The Monopodal Squat, Forward Lunge and Lateral Step-Up exercises not only are recommended for their rehabilitation purposes but also should be recommended for performance objectives and strength improvement in the lower limbs."
https://openalex.org/W3014717156,"Background Overnutrition increases the risk of diabetes. Evidence on the causal impact of overnutrition on diabetes is scarce for India. Considering a representative sample from India, this study examines the causal effect of a rise in the Body Mass Index (BMI) of an individual on the likelihood of being diabetic while addressing the issue of unobserved endogeneity between overnutrition and diabetes. Methods The study considers individual level data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of India, namely, National Family Health Survey (NFHS) for the year 2015–16. The NFHS is a large-scale, multi-round survey conducted in a representative sample of households throughout India. The survey covers females having age 15–49 years and males having age 15–54 years. The instrument variable approach is used to address the potential endogeneity in the relationship between BMI and diabetes. We instrument BMI of an individual by BMI of a non-biologically related household member. Ordered Probit, Probit and IV-Probit models are estimated using two alternative definitions for measuring diabetes–self-reported diabetes status and blood glucose levels (ordinal measure). Results The coefficients obtained from the Ordered Probit and Probit models are much smaller than those estimated by an IV-Probit model. The latter estimates the causal impact of a rise in BMI on diabetes by taking into account the effect of the unobserved genetic and other related factors. The likelihood of being diabetic is twice or more among the overweight and obese individuals as compared to non-overweight individuals in all the specifications. With a unit increase in BMI the probability of being diabetic increases by about 1.5% among overweight and obese individuals and by 0.5% among the non-overweight individuals in the IV-Probit model. Similar results from the Ordered Probit model show that on average, the overweight and obese individuals experience about 0.2% increase in the probability of being diabetic and about 0.4% increase in the probability of being prediabetic. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that the likelihood of being both prediabetic and diabetic is higher among the overweight and obese individuals as compared to the non-overweight individuals. We also find that the level of risk of being prediabetic or diabetic differs across gender, wealth quintiles and regions and the effects are more severe among population in the urban areas, belonging to the richest wealth quintile and men. Our findings have significant implications for the policy formulation as diabetes has a substantial health and economic burden associated with it. Future studies may investigate the effect of abdominal obesity on diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3014153801,"Acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhoea are the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia. Understanding the associations between infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and ARI and diarrhoea can inform IYCF policy interventions and advocacy in Ethiopia. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between IYCF practices and ARI and diarrhoea in Ethiopian children.This study used the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data for the years 2000 (n = 3680), 2005 (n = 3528), 2011 (n = 4037), and 2016 (n = 3861). The association between IYCF practices and (i) ARI and (ii) diarrhoea were investigated using propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression models. The IYCF practices include early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), predominant breastfeeding, introduction of complementary foods, continued breastfeeding at two years and bottle feeding.Infants and young children who were breastfed within 1-hour of birth and those who were exclusively breastfed had a lower prevalence of ARI. Infants who were exclusively and predominantly breastfed had a lower prevalence of diarrhoea. Early initiation of breastfeeding (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72, 0.92) and EBF (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.83) were associated with lower risk of ARI. Bottle-fed children had higher odds of ARI (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.68). Early initiation of breastfeeding and EBF were associated with lower odds of diarrhoea (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.94 for Early initiation of breastfeeding and OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.65 for EBF). Infants who were predominantly breastfed were less likely to experience diarrhoea (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.89).The recommended best practices for preventing ARI and diarrhoeal diseases in infants and young children namely: the early initiation of breastfeeding, EBF and avoidance of bottle feeding should be institutionalized and scale-up in Ethiopia as part of implementation science approach to cover the know-do-gaps."
https://openalex.org/W3014478049,"Background High ultrasound renal resistive index (RI) predicts poor cardiorenal outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has recently emerged as a marker of nephroprotective drugs response. Thus, having a risk profile of CKD patients with abnormal RI may be relevant for the clinicians. Methods Consecutive patients referred to our non-dialysis CKD clinic from 01/01/2016 to 01/12/2016, were evaluated by clinical and ultrasound analysis. Inclusion criteria were age >18 years and presence of CKD defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 mL/min/1.73m2 and/or proteinuria>0.150g/24h. Renal artery stenosis, solitary kidney, acute kidney injury were the main exclusion criteria. RI value was the mean of three measures in segmental arteries in each kidney. Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate associations between continuous RI and clinical variables. Multivariate linear regression analysis, based on stepwise method with an elimination criterion of p<0.10, was used to assess the independent correlates of RI as continuous variable. Results We studied 73 patients (69.9% men). Mean RI was 0.67±0.09. Frequencies of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) were 19.2% and 20.6% and median eGFR 54.1 [30.0–84.6] mL/min/1.73m2. From low (<0.65) to intermediate (0.65–0.70) to high (>0.70) RI categories, eGFR and haemoglobin levels were decreased while diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), phosphate and smokers were higher. At univariate analysis, RI was significantly associated with age, presence of diabetes, CVD, serum phosphorus, eGFR, Urea and haemoglobin. Multi-adjusted stepwise regression analysis showed that lower eGFR levels (p<0.001), diabetes (p = 0.042), CVD (p = 0.009), smoking habit (p = 0.021) and higher serum phosphorus levels (p = 0.001) were associated with higher continuous RI. Serum phosphorus showed Area Under the Curves (AUC) values of 0.714 and 0.664 for discriminating RI cut-offs of 0.70 and 0.65. Conclusions This analysis suggests that RI is higher in CKD patients with CVD, diabetes, smoking habit and higher serum phosphorus, regardless of eGFR. Further studies are needed to verify whether higher RI indicates more complex pathway of intrarenal damage, besides and beyond kidney function."
https://openalex.org/W3014219112,"Introduction BRAC, an international development organisation based in Bangladesh, uses female volunteer community health workers called Shasthya Shebika (SS), who receive small incentives to implement its home-fortification interventions at the community level. This paper examines the individual, community and BRAC work environment factors that exert an influence on the performance of SS. Methods This qualitative study was conducted between the period of June 2014 to December 2016 as part of a larger evaluation of BRAC’s home-fortification programme. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews and analysed thematically. The participants were SS and their supervisors working for BRAC, caregivers of children aged 6–59 months, husbands of SS, village doctors, and Upazila Health and Family Planning Officers. Results Younger, better educated and more experienced SS with positive self-efficacy were perceived to have performed better than their peers. Social and community factors, such as community recognition of the SS’s services, social and religious norms, family support, and household distance, also affected the performance of the SS. There were several challenges at the programme and organisational level that needed to be addressed, including appropriate recruitment, timely basic training and income-generation guidance for the SS. Conclusion BRAC’s volunteer SS model faces challenges at individual, community, programme and organisational level. Importantly, BRAC’s SS require a living wage to earn essential income for their family. Considering the current socio-cultural and economic context of Bangladesh, BRAC may need to revise the existing volunteer SS model to ensure that SS receive an adequate income so that they can devote themselves to implementing its home-fortification intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3014866564,"Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most prevalent causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, and it is largely associated with consumption of contaminated poultry. Current Campylobacter control measures at the poultry production level remain insufficient, and hence there is the need for alternative control strategies. We evaluated the potential of the monoterpene (-)-α-pinene for control of C. jejuni in poultry. The antibacterial and resistance-modulatory activities of (-)-α-pinene were also determined against 57 C. jejuni strains. In addition, the anti-quorum-sensing activity of (-)-α-pinene against C. jejuni NCTC 11168 was determined for three subinhibitory concentrations (125, 62.5, 31.25 mg/L) over three incubation times using an autoinducer-2 bioassay based on Vibrio harveyi BB170 bioluminescence measurements. The effects of a subinhibitory concentration of (-)-α-pinene (250 mg/L) on survival of C. jejuni, and in combination with enrofloxacin on fluoroquinolone resistance development in C. jejuni, were determined in a broiler chicken model, by addition of (-)-α-pinene to the broiler water supply. The reduction of C. jejuni numbers by (-)-α-pinene was further determined in broiler chickens that were colonized with either fluoroquinolone-susceptible or -resistant strains, by direct gavage treatment. We observed weak in vitro antimicrobial activity for (-)-α-pinene alone (MIC >500 mg/L), but strong potentiating effects on antibiotics erythromycin and ciprofloxacin against different Campylobacter strains (>512 fold change). After 24 h of treatment of C. jejuni with (-)-α-pinene, its quorum-sensing signaling was reduced by >80% compared to the untreated control. When given in the drinking water, (-)-α-pinene did not show any significant inhibitory effects on the level of C. jejuni in the colonized chickens, and did not reduce fluoroquinolone resistance development in combination with enrofloxacin. Conversely, when (-)-α-pinene was administered by direct gavage, it significantly reduced the number of fluoroquinolone susceptible C. jejuni in the colonized broiler chickens. These results demonstrate that (-)-α-pinene modulates quorum-sensing in Campylobacter, potentiates antibiotics against different Campylobacter strains, and reduces Campylobacter colonization in broiler chickens."
https://openalex.org/W3015020376,"Abstract The genetically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) continues to be an intractable disease, due to lack of effective targeted therapies. Gene amplification is a major event in tumorigenesis. Genes with amplification-dependent expression are being explored as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In this study, we have applied Analytical Multi-scale Identification of Recurring Events analysis and transcript quantification in the TNBC genome across 222 TNBC tumors and identified 138 candidate genes with positive correlation in copy number gain (CNG) and gene expression. siRNA-based loss-of-function screen of the candidate genes has validated EGFR, MYC, ASAP1, IRF2BP2, and CCT5 genes as drivers promoting proliferation in different TNBC cells. MYC, ASAP1, IRF2BP2, and CCT5 display frequent CNG and concurrent expression over 2173 breast cancer tumors (cBioPortal dataset). More frequently are MYC and ASAP1 amplified in TNBC tumors (&gt;30%, n = 320). In particular, high expression of ASAP1, the ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein, is significantly related to poor metastatic relapse-free survival of TNBC patients ( n = 257, bc-GenExMiner). Furthermore, we have revealed that silencing of ASAP1 modulates numerous cytokine and apoptosis signaling components, such as IL1B, TRAF1, AIFM2, and MAP3K11 that are clinically relevant to survival outcomes of TNBC patients. ASAP1 has been reported to promote invasion and metastasis in various cancer cells. Our findings that ASAP1 is an amplification-dependent TNBC driver gene promoting TNBC cell proliferation, functioning upstream apoptosis components, and correlating to clinical outcomes of TNBC patients, support ASAP1 as a potential actionable target for TNBC treatment."

https://openalex.org/W3015185769,"Objective To achieve the goal of “healthy China 2030”, reasonable health policies must be developed based on the changes of death spectrum. We aim to investigate the temporal patterns of life expectancy (LE) and age/cause-specific contributions from 1990 to 2016. Methods Joinpoint regression model was used with Arriaga’s decomposition method. Results LE in China has reached to 76.3 years in 2016 with an increase of 9.44 years from 1990. From 1990 to 2002, a remarkable reduction in infant mortality accounted for an increase of 1.27 years (35.39%) to LE which mainly resulted from diarrhea, lower respiratory, and other common infectious diseases (1.00 years, 27.79%). After 2002, those aged 65+ years contributed most to increased LE and the most prominent causes included cardiovascular diseases (0.67 years, 23.36%), chronic respiratory diseases (0.54 years, 18.76%) and neoplasms (0.39 years, 13.44%). Moreover, the effects of transport injuries changed from negative to positive. After 2007, contributions of transport and unintentional injuries increased especially for males. And for females contributions of cardiovascular diseases sharply increased LE by 1.17 years (32.26%). Conclusion More attention should be paid to cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and neoplasms which were mainly attributed to the increase of LE, especially for males and elderly population."

This study assessed the effectiveness of 3-month-duration interventions with peer counseling, social engagement, and combination vs. control in improving depressive symptoms of community-dwelling Filipino senior citizens.We conducted an open (non-blinded), non-randomized trial of senior citizens at risk for depression. Three different 3-month interventions included peer counseling (n = 65), social engagement (n = 66), and combination (n = 65) were compared with the control group (n = 68). We assessed geriatric depression, psychological resilience, perceived social support, loneliness, and working alliance scores at baseline and three months after the intervention. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03989284.Geriatric depression score over three months significantly improved in all intervention groups (control as reference). Significant improvements were also seen in psychological resilience and social support. Not all interventions, however, significantly improved the loneliness score. The combination group showed the largest effect of improving depressive symptoms (d = -1.33) whereas the social engagement group showed the largest effect of improving psychological resilience (d = 1.40), perceived social support (d = 1.07), and loneliness (d = -0.36) among senior citizens.At the community level, peer counseling, social engagement, and combination interventions were effective in improving depressive symptoms, psychological resilience, and social support among Filipino senior citizens. This study shows that it is feasible to identify senior citizens at risk for depression in the community and intervene effectively to improve their mental health. Further studies are required to target loneliness and investigate the long-term benefits of the interventions.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03989284."
https://openalex.org/W3014559202,"The 32-item Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) is a widely-used measure of multidimensional interoception. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of a Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) translation of the MAIA.An online sample of 815 Malaysian Malays (women n = 403) completed a novel translation of the MAIA. Validated measures of trait mindfulness and self-esteem were also completed to facilitate a preliminary assessment of convergent validity.Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the MAIA items reduced to a 19-item, 3-factor model. The 3-factor model was further tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) alongside the parent 8-factor model. Both models had good fit on some indices, but less-than-ideal fit on other indices. The 3-factor model evidenced comparatively better fit, with fit indices being adequate following modification. Multi-group CFA indicated both the 3-factor model and the 8-factor model had full strict invariance across sex. However, evidence for construct and convergent validity was mixed.Overall the 3-dimensional Malay MAIA was demonstrated to be both internally consistent and invariant across sex, but further evidence of construct and convergent validity is required. Issues that affect the dimensionality of MAIA scores in the present and extant work are discussed in conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W3014174215,"Objective The aim of the study was to develop a multifactorial tool for assessment of sedation in dogs. Methods Following a modified Delphi method, thirty-eight veterinary anaesthetists were contacted to describe the following levels of awareness: no-sedation, light, moderate, profound sedation and excitation. The answers were summarized in descriptors for each level. A questionnaire was created with all the variables obtained from the descriptors. The questionnaire was returned to the panel of anaesthetists to be used before and after real sedations in conjunction with the previous 5-point categorical scale. Data obtained were analysed using the classification-tree and random-forest methods. Results Twenty-three anaesthetists (60%) replied with descriptions. The descriptors and study variables were grouped in categories: state-of-mind, posture, movements, stimuli-response, behaviour, response-to-restraint, muscle tone, physiological data, facial-expression, eye position, eyelids, pupils, vocalization and feasibility-to-perform-intended-procedure. The anaesthetists returned 205 completed questionnaires. The levels of awareness reported by the anaesthetists were: no sedation in 92, mild (26), moderate (37) and profound in 50 cases. The classification-tree detected 6 main classifying variables: change in posture, response-to-restraint, head-elevation, response-to-toe-pinching, response-to-name, and movements. The random-forest found that the following variables: change in posture, response-to-restraint, head-elevation, response-to-name, movements, posture, response-to-toe-pinching, demeanour, righting-reflex and response-to-handclap, were classified correctly in 100% awake, 62% mild, 70% moderate and 86% of profound sedation cases. Discussion and conclusion The questionnaire and methods developed here classified correctly the level of sedation in most cases. Further studies are needed to evaluate the validity of this tool in the clinical and research setting."

In response, the Colombian government initiated the scaling-up of a community-based intervention under inter and multi-sector partnerships in two out of four sectors in Girardot, one of the most hyper-endemic dengue cities in the country. Using a quasi-experimental research design a scaled-up community-led Aedes control intervention was assessed for its capacity to reduce dengue from January 2010 to August 2017 in Girardot, Colombia. Reported dengue cases, and associated factors were analysed from available data sets from the Colombian disease surveillance systems. We estimated the reduction in dengue cases before and after the intervention using, Propensity Score Matching and an Autoregressive Moving Average model for robustness. In addition, the differences in dengue incidence among scaling-up phases (pre-implementation vs sustainability) and between treatment groups (intervention and control areas) were modelled. Evidence was found in favour of the intervention, although to maximise impact the scaling-up of the intervention should continue until it covers the remaining sectors. It is expected that a greater impact of the intervention can be documented in the next outbreak of dengue in Girardot."
https://openalex.org/W3014666412,"Subtle gender dynamics in the publishing process involving collaboration, peer-review, readership, citation, and media coverage disadvantage women in academia. In this study we consider whether commenting on published work is also gendered. Using all the comments published over a 16-year period in PNAS (N = 869) and Science (N = 481), we find that there is a gender gap in the authorship of comment letters: women are less likely than men to comment on published academic research. This disparity is greater than gender differences in the publication of research articles. There is also a gendered pattern in commenting: women comment writers are relatively less likely to engage with men's research. If left unaddressed, these patterns in academic commenting could impede scholarly exchange between men and women and further marginalize women within the scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W3014845741,"The last few years have seen increasing research on self-report measures of compassion. The Compassionate Engagement and Action Scale (CEAS) is rooted in an evolutionary approach to compassion, which focuses on the competencies of compassion those are engagement with distress or suffering, and taking action to alleviate and prevent it. This study sought to validate the CEAS in a Japanese population using a cross-sectional design. A total of 279 students (82 males, 191 females, 6 unknown) answered self-report questionnaires, including the Japanese version of CEAS. We found single-factor structures for compassion for others scales, compassion from others scales, and compassion for self scales. All scales were found to have acceptable internal consistency, test-retest reliability, content validity, and construct validity. Even though some limitations, these results indicate that the Japanese version of CEAS is an adequately constructed and useful measure to assess compassionate engagement and action toward others, from others, and for the self with Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W3014672450,"Emulating the highly resource-efficient processing of visual motion information in the brain of flying insects, a bio-inspired controller for collision avoidance and navigation was implemented on a novel, integrated System-on-Chip-based hardware module. The hardware module is used to control visually-guided navigation behavior of the stick insect-like hexapod robot HECTOR. By leveraging highly parallelized bio-inspired algorithms to extract nearness information from visual motion in dynamically reconfigurable logic, HECTOR is able to navigate to predefined goal positions without colliding with obstacles. The system drastically outperforms CPU- and graphics card-based implementations in terms of speed and resource efficiency, making it suitable to be also placed on fast moving robots, such as flying drones."
https://openalex.org/W3014684701,"This study examined the effects of a 6-week Nordic Walking (NW) training, at the intensity corresponding to the dominance of lipid metabolism, on the levels of selected physiological indices, the haemodynamic indices of the cardiovascular system and physical fitness in sedentary women older than 55 years of age. In addition, the physiological response of the female body to the walking effort on treadmill with poles (NW) and without poles (W) was compared and the influence of training on this response was determined. A single group study with a pre-test/post-test study design was conducted. Eighteen women performed NW controlled intensity training 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Body composition, resting blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) as well as circulatory and respiratory indices in two graded walking efforts on mechanical treadmill NW and W were measured before and after training period. The intensity of workouts, which considered the dominance of lipid metabolism, was determined individually, based on the dynamics of changes in the level of physiological indices during the graded intensity NW. After the course of training, body mass, fat mass, resting BP and HR decreased significantly (p < 0.05). HR and respiratory exchange ratio recorded during NW and W at 1.75 m.s-1 walking speed decreased, while the oxygen pulse increased (p < 0.05). VO2max increased significantly (p < 0.05). Before and after the training period HR, oxygen uptake per minute, and energy expenditure during NW were significantly higher than in W (p < 0.05). The study showed that 6-week NW training at the intensity corresponding to the dominance of lipid metabolism can provide improvement in body composition, cardiovascular function and physical performance in previously sedentary women. NW compared to the regular walk with the same speed revealed higher energy expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W3014987435,"Stormwater runoff is recognized as a cause of water quality degradation because it may carry nitrogen (N) and other pollutants to aquatic ecosystems. Stormwater ponds are a stormwater control measure often used to manage stormwater runoff by holding a permanent pool of water, which reduces the peak flow, magnitude of runoff volume, and concentrations of nutrients and pollutants. We instrumented the outlet of a stormwater pond in an urban residential neighbourhood in Florida, United States to (1) investigate the concentration and composition of N forms during the summer rainy season (May to September 2016), and (2) determine the bioavailability of organic N in the stormwater pond with a bioassay experiment. A total of 144 outflow water samples over 13 storm events were collected at the outlet of the stormwater pond that collects runoff from the residential catchment. Samples were analysed for various inorganic N [ammonium (NH4–N), nitrate (NO3–N)], and organic N forms [dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and particulate organic nitrogen (PON)]. Flow-weighted mean concentration of total N (TN) in pond outflow for all collected storm events was 1.3±1.42 mg L-1, with DON as the dominant form (78%), followed by PON and NO3–N (each at 8%), and NH4–N (6%). In the bioassay experiment, organic N (DON+PON) was significantly decreased by 25–28% after 5 days of incubation, suggesting that a portion of the DON carried from the pond outflow to receiving water bodies may be bioavailable. These results suggest that efforts to mitigate stormwater N outflows from urban ponds should incorporate both inorganic and organic N in management plans."
https://openalex.org/W3015158841,"Melanopsin is a visual pigment expressed in a small subset of ganglion cells in the mammalian retina known as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and is implicated in regulating non-image forming functions such as circadian photoentrainment and pupil constriction and contrast sensitivity in image formation. Mouse melanopsin's Carboxy-terminus (C-terminus) possesses 38 serine and threonine residues, which can potentially serve as phosphorylation sites for a G-protein Receptor Kinase (GRK) and be involved in the deactivation of signal transduction. Previous studies suggest that S388, T389, S391, S392, S394, S395 on the proximal region of the C-terminus of mouse melanopsin are necessary for melanopsin deactivation. We expressed a series of mouse melanopsin C-terminal mutants in HEK293 cells and using calcium imaging, and we found that the necessary cluster of six serine and threonine residues, while being critical, are insufficient for proper melanopsin deactivation. Interestingly, the additional six serine and threonine residues adjacent to the required six sites, in either proximal or distal direction, are capable of restoring wild-type deactivation of melanopsin. These findings suggest an element of plasticity in the molecular basis of melanopsin phosphorylation and deactivation. In addition, C-terminal chimeric mutants and molecular modeling studies support the idea that the initial steps of deactivation and β-arrestin binding are centered around these critical phosphorylation sites (S388-S395). The degree of functional versatility described in this study, along with ipRGC biophysical heterogeneity and the possible use of multiple signal transduction cascades, might contribute to the diverse ipRGC light responses for use in non-image and image forming behaviors, even though all six sub types of ipRGCs express the same melanopsin gene OPN4."
https://openalex.org/W3014228068,"Recent studies suggest that birth mode (Cesarean section [C-section] or vaginal delivery) is an important event in the initial colonization of the human microbiome and may be associated with long-term health outcomes. We sought to determine the association between a woman’s birth mode and her vaginal microbiota in adulthood. We re-contacted 144 adult women from two U.S. studies and administered a brief survey. Vaginal microbiota was characterized on a single sample by amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene and clustered into community state types (CSTs). We evaluated the association between birth mode and a CST with low relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. (“molecular bacterial vaginosis” [Molecular-BV]) compared to Lactobacillus-dominated CSTs in logistic regression modeling which adjusted for body mass index, a confounder in this analysis. Twenty-seven women (19%) reported C-section. Overall, C-section showed a non-significant trend towards increased odds of Molecular-BV (aOR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.45, 3.32), and Prevotella bivia was the strongest single taxa associated with C-section. However, because the two archived studies had different inclusion criteria (interaction p = 0.048), we stratified the analysis by study site. In the study with a larger sample size (n = 88), women born by C-section had 3-fold higher odds of Molecular-BV compared to vaginally-delivered women (aOR = 3.55, p = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.97–13.02). No association was found in the smaller study (n = 56, aOR = 0.19, p = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02–1.71). This pilot cross-sectional study suggests a possible association between C-section and Molecular-BV in adulthood. However, the analysis is limited by small sample size and lack of comparability in participant age and other characteristics between the study sites. Future longitudinal studies could recruit larger samples of women, address the temporal dynamics of vaginal microbiota, and explore other confounders, including maternal factors, breastfeeding history, and socioeconomic status, which may affect the relationship between birth mode and vaginal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3014428703,"Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and water are four crucial factors that have significant effects on strawberry yield and fruit quality. We used a 11 that involved 36 treatments with five levels of each of the four variables (N, P, and K fertilizers and water) to optimize fertilization and water combination for high yield and quality. Moreover, we used the SSC/TA ratio (the ratio of soluble solid content to titratable acid) as index of quality. Results showed that N fertilizer was the most important factor, followed by water and P fertilizer, and the N fertilizer had significant effect on yield and SSC/TA ratio. By contrast, the K fertilizer had significant effect only on yield. N×K fertilizer interacted significantly on yield, whereas the other interactions among the four factors had no significant effects on yield or SSC/TA ratio. The effects of the four factors on yield and SSC/TA ratio were ranked as N fertilizer > water > K fertilizer > P fertilizer and N fertilizer > P fertilizer > water > K fertilizer, respectively. The yield and SSC/TA ratio increased when NPK fertilizer and water increased, but then decreased when excessive NPK fertilizer and water were applied. The optimal fertilizer and water combination were 22.28-24.61 g plant-1 Ca (NO3)2·4H2O, 1.75-2.03 g plant-1 NaH2PO4, 12.41-13.91 g plant-1 K2SO4, and 12.00-13.05 L water plant-1 for yields of more than 110 g plant-1 and optimal SSC/TA ratio of 8.5-14."
https://openalex.org/W3014243341,"Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN) is the causative agent of endemic syphilis (bejel). Until now, only a single TEN strain, Bosnia A, has been completely sequenced. The only other laboratory TEN strain available, Iraq B, was isolated in Iraq in 1951 by researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this study, the complete genome of the Iraq B strain was amplified as overlapping PCR products and sequenced using the pooled segment genome sequencing method and Illumina sequencing. Total average genome sequencing coverage reached 3469×, with a total genome size of 1,137,653 bp. Compared to the genome sequence of Bosnia A, a set of 37 single nucleotide differences, 4 indels, 2 differences in the number of tandem repetitions, and 18 differences in the length of homopolymeric regions were found in the Iraq B genome. Moreover, the tprF and tprG genes that were previously found deleted in the genome of the TEN Bosnia A strain (spanning 2.3 kb in length) were present in a subpopulation of TEN Iraq B and Bosnia A microbes, and their sequence was highly similar to those found in T. p. subsp. pertenue strains, which cause the disease yaws. The genome sequence of TEN Iraq B revealed close genetic relatedness between both available bejel-causing laboratory strains (i.e., Iraq B and Bosnia A) and also genetic variability within the bejel treponemes comparable to that found within yaws- or syphilis-causing strains. In addition, genetic relatedness to TPE strains was demonstrated by the sequence of the tprF and tprG genes found in subpopulations of both TEN Iraq B and Bosnia A. The loss of the tprF and tprG genes in most TEN microbes suggest that TEN genomes have been evolving via the loss of genomic regions, a phenomenon previously found among the treponemes causing both syphilis and rabbit syphilis."

TBX5 variants in the region encoding the T-box domain have been shown to cause cardiac defects, such as atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect, while TBX5 variants have also been identified in a few cardiomyopathy patients and considered causative. We identified a TBX5 variant (c.791G>A, p.Arg264Lys), that is over-represented in cardiomyopathy patients. This variant is located outside of the T-box domain, and its pathogenicity has not been confirmed by functional analyses.To investigate whether the TBX5 R264K is deleterious and could contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy.We developed mice expressing Tbx5 R264K. Mice homozygous for this variant displayed compensated dilated cardiomyopathy; mild decreased fractional shortening, dilatation of the left ventricle, left ventricular wall thinning and increased heart weight without major heart structural disorders. There was no difference in activation of the ANF promotor, a transcriptional target of Tbx5, compared to wild-type. However, analysis of RNA isolated from left ventricular samples showed significant increases in the expression of Acta1 in left ventricle with concomitant increases in the protein level of ACTA1.Mice homozygous for Tbx5 R264K showed compensated dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, TBX5 R264K may have a significant pathogenic role in some cardiomyopathy patients independently of T-box domain pathway."

Using a recently-established 3D in-vitro neural hydrogel model for mTBI we investigated the efficacy of TH after compressive impact injury and established critical treatment parameters including target cooling temperature, and time windows for application and maintenance of TH. Across four temperatures evaluated (31.5, 33, 35, and 37°C), 33°C was found to be most neuroprotective after 24 and 48 hours post-injury. Assessment of TH administration onset time and duration showed that TH should be administered within 4 hours post-injury and be maintained for at least 6 hours for achieving maximum viability. Cellular imaging showed TH reduced the percentage of cells positive for caspases 3/7 and increased the expression of calpastatin, an endogenous neuroprotectant. These findings provide significant new insight into the biological parameter space that renders TH effective in mitigating the deleterious effects of cellular mTBI and provides a quantitative foundation for the future development of animal and preclinical treatment protocols."

The prevention of new, establishing species is less costly, both economically and ecologically, and is more manageable than eradicating nonnative invasive species once they are widespread and negatively impactful. We ask if international trade hubs and points-of-entry with high-volume trade, constant disturbance, and propagule rain have a higher number of nonnative species compared to surrounding areas and if they may serve as initial establishment sites and refugia of nonnative, invasive populations. Therefore, we partnered with various federal, state, and private interests to evaluate the floristic composition at the Garden City Terminal of the Port of Savannah, Georgia, USA. We conducted the following study to demonstrate the collaborative relationship-building between researchers and industry and to develop a framework for biodiversity conservation. In our study, we collected all reproductive vascular plants in the secured areas of the Garden City Terminal during four major seasonal time points over two years. The percent of nonnative species and number of nonnative plant species per hectare at this industrial location exceeded all other comparison floras. The mean coefficient of conservatism was lowest among the comparison floras, indicating a highly disturbed habitat with nonnative, weedy native, and other native species tolerant of disturbance. Our study represents one of the first inventories of an Industrialized Flora and indicates that such areas are hot-spots of nonnative plant diversity and possible sources of emergent plant invasions. We posit that industrial sites and international points-of-entry should be considered laboratories for research on species transport and introduction, adaptability, and taxonomic delineation to better understand the mechanisms and consequences of biotic homogenization due to the volume and frequency of anthropogenic activities."
https://openalex.org/W3014349818,"Background Evidence from multiple studies suggests metabolic abnormalities play an important role in lung cancer. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of lung cancer. The present study aimed to explore differences in the global metabolic response between male and female patients in LUAD and to identify the metabolic genes associated with lung cancer susceptibility. Methods Transcriptome and clinical LUAD data were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Information on metabolic genes and metabolic subsystems were collected from the Recon3D human metabolic model. Two validation datasets (GSE68465 and GSE72094) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks were used to identified key metabolic pathways and genes. Functional experiments were used to verify the effects of genes on proliferation, migration, and invasion in lung cancer cells in vitro. Results Samples of tumors and adjacent non-tumor tissue from both male and female patients exhibited distinct global patterns of gene expression. In addition, we found large differences in methionine and cysteine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism, and nuclear transport between male and female LUAD patients. We identified 34 metabolic genes associated with lung cancer susceptibility in males and 15 in females. Most of the metabolic cancer-susceptibility genes had high prediction accuracy for lung cancer (AUC > 0.9). Furthermore, both bioinformatics analysis and experimental results showed that TAOK2 was down-regulated and ASAH1 was up-regulated in male tumor tissue and female tumor tissue in LUAD. Functional experiments showed that inhibiting ASAH1 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells. Conclusions Metabolic cancer-susceptibility genes may be used alone or in combination as diagnostic markers for LUAD. Further studies are required to elucidate the functions of these genes in LUAD."

A pilot study with Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) to control Aedes aegypti (L.) and Ae. albopictus (Skuse) was evaluated in Z-7L, a densely populated site of 12 ha. Bti treatments were conducted weekly from epidemiology week (EW) 24/2015 for 4 weeks, followed by fortnight treatments for 2 months, in addition to the routine control activities. Bti was directly introduced into potable containers and the outdoor artificial and natural containers were treated via a wide area spray application method using a backpack mister. Aedes indices significantly reduced during the treatment and post treatment phases, compared to the control site, Z-5 (p<0.05). A 51 fold reduction in the incidence rate per 100,000 population (IR) was observed, with one case in 25 weeks (EW 29-52). In Z-5 and Z-14, control sites, a 6 fold reduction in the IR was observed from EW 29-52. However, almost every week there were dengue cases in Z-14 and until EW 44 in Z-5. In 2016, dengue cases resurfaced in Z-7L from EW 4. Intensive routine control activities were conducted, but the IR continued to escalate. The wide area Bti spray misting of the outdoor containers was then included from EW 27 on fortnight intervals. A 6 fold reduction in IR was observed in the Bti treatment phase (EW 32-52) with no successive weekly cases after EW 37. However, in the control sites, there were dengue cases throughout the year from EW 1-52, particularly in Z-14. We feel that the wide area Bti spray application method is an integral component in the control program, in conjunction with other control measures carried out, to suppress the vector population in outdoor cryptic containers and to interrupt the disease transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3014962173,"LEFTY2 (endometrial bleeding associated factor; EBAF or LEFTYA), a cytokine released shortly before menstrual bleeding, is a negative regulator of cell proliferation and tumour growth. LEFTY2 down-regulates Na+/H+ exchanger activity with subsequent inhibition of glycolytic flux and lactate production in endometrial cancer cells. Glucose can be utilized not only for glycolysis but also for glycogen formation. Both glycolysis and glycogen formation require cellular glucose uptake which could be accomplished by the Na+ coupled glucose transporter-1 (SGLT1; SLC5A1). The present study therefore explored whether LEFTY2 modifies endometrial SGLT1 expression and activity as well as glycogen formation. Ishikawa and HEC1a cells were exposed to LEFTY2, SGLT1 and glycogen synthase (GYS1) transcript levels determined by qRT-PCR. SGLT1, GYS1 and phospho-GYS1 protein abundance was quantified by western blotting, cellular glucose uptake from 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) uptake, and cellular glycogen content utilizing an enzymatic assay and subsequent colorimetry. As a result, a 48-hour treatment with LEFTY2 significantly increased SGLT1 and GYS1 transcript levels as well as SGLT1 and GYS1 protein abundance in both Ishikawa and HEC1a cells. 2-NBDG uptake and cellular glycogen content were upregulated significantly in Ishikawa (type 1) but not in type 2 endometrial HEC1a cells, although there was a tendency of increased 2-NBDG uptake. Further, none of the effects were seen in human benign endometrial cells (HESCs). Interestingly, in both Ishikawa and HEC1a cells, a co-treatment with TGF-β reduced SGLT1, GYS and phospho-GYS protein levels, and thus reduced glycogen levels and again HEC1a cells had no significant change. In conclusion, LEFTY2 up-regulates expression and activity of the Na+ coupled glucose transporter SGLT1 and glycogen synthase GYS1 in a cell line specific manner. We further show the treatment with LEFTY2 fosters cellular glucose uptake and glycogen formation and TGF-β can negate this effect in endometrial cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3014241299,"Introduction The way strength recovers after reduction of pediatric fractures of the upper extremity has not previously been the specific scope of research. This is remarkable, since strength measurements are often used as an outcome measure in studies on trauma of the upper extremity. The aim of this study was to evaluate how strength recovers after sustainment of fractures of the forearm, wrist or hand treated by closed or open reduction in children and adolescents in the first 6 months after trauma. How much strength is lost at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after trauma, and is this loss significant? Are there differences in the pattern of recovery between children who underwent a different treatment? And finally, which of the following factors are associated with an increase in the ratio between affected grip strength and expected strength: type of fracture, cast immobilization, occurrence of complications, and degree of pain? Design Prospective observational study. Participants Children and adolescents aged 4–18 years with a reduced fracture of the forearm, wrist or hand. Methods Grip strength, key grip and three-jaw chuck grip were measured twice in each hand 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after trauma. Details on fracture type and location, treatment received, cast immobilization and complications were obtained. Hand-dominance and pain were verbally confirmed. Results Loss of strength was more prominent and prolonged the more invasive the treatment, hence most extensive in the group receiving open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF), intermediate in the group receiving closed reduction with percutaneous pinning (CRIF), and least extensive in the group undergoing closed reduction without internal fixation (CR). Besides time passed, gender and age were of significant influence on strength, although there was no difference in pattern of recovery over time between children who received a different treatment. In the period of 6 weeks to 3 months after trauma, female gender, type of fracture sustained and occurrence of an unwanted event were associated with an increased ratio between affected and expected grip strength. For the later phase of recovery, between 3 and 6 months, this was only true for the occurrence of an unwanted event."

This article aims to assess whether global consumption chains are currently on the decoupling path or not, from a social point of view. Specifically, we address the working conditions which developed societies’ lifestyle sparked at a distance in global factory countries, focusing on the most harmful consequences of an indecent work. Additionally, we determine the kind of decoupling observed through the new concept of social footprints’ elasticities with respect to final demand for each region. We employ a Multi-Regional Input-Output model and an own elaboration database of social impacts concerning undignified working conditions. Results indicate that most countries achieved the goal of decoupling occupational injuries -both fatal and non-fatal- from production, while results for forced labour show a slower and sometimes uncertain process of decoupling. European Union and United States’ footprints have been reduced overtime for the three impacts. However, more than half of these footprints are still generated by imports, mainly from developing regions."

We evaluated the type of PN formulation, PN administration period, administration route, calories supplied, amount of protein supplied, and laboratory results. Among the 11,580 inpatient admissions on that day, 1,439 patients received PN (12.4%). The majority of enrolled patients (96.5%) used the commercial PN, of which 86.2% were multi-chamber. 71.2% of them received PN peripherally. The average in hospital PN duration was 17.8 ± 52.6 days. Patients received only 65.4 ± 25.4% calories of their target calories. The in-hospital mortality of enrolled patients was 22%. In South Korea, commercial PN was usually administered to hospitalized adult patients and in-hospital mortality in adult patients using PN was higher in South Korea compared to other countries.

https://openalex.org/W3014944052,"Wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo; hereafter turkeys) are an important game animal whose popularity among hunters has increased in recent decades. Yet, the number of hunters pursuing turkeys appears to be in flux, patterns of hunter abundance have primarily been described at broad spatial scales, and the ability of management to impact hunter numbers in the post-restoration era of management through opportunity for quality hunting is unclear. We used county-scale estimates of turkey hunter numbers collected over a 14-year period (2001–2014) and time-series analyses to evaluate the spatial scales at which spring and fall turkey hunter populations fluctuate, and also used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate whether attributes related to quality turkey hunting explain recent patterns in hunter abundance. We found heterogeneity in turkey hunter population growth at finer spatial scales than has been previously described (i.e., counties and management units), and provide evidence for spatial structuring of hunter population dynamics among counties that did not always correspond with existing management units. Specifically, the directionality of hunter population change displays spatial structure along an east-west gradient in southern Michigan. We also found little evidence that factors providing opportunity for quality turkey hunting had meaningful impacts on recent spatial-temporal patterns of hunter numbers. Our results imply that providing quality turkey hunting opportunities alone may be insufficient for sustaining populations of turkey hunters in the future, and that modern determinants of hunter participation extend beyond the availability of abundant turkey populations. Moreover, our results demonstrate that interpretation of harvest data as indices of abundance for turkey populations is difficult in the absence of hunter effort data, as changes to turkey harvest are a function of potentially fine-scaled changes in populations of hunters, not simply changes to turkey populations."

The need principle is considered one of the three major principles of distributive justice. In contrast to equality or equity, however, evidence on the adherence to the needs principle rests mainly on stated instead of revealed preferences. In this paper we present an experimental design that exogenously assigns objective, heterogeneous need thresholds to individuals in small laboratory societies structured by a three-line network. The data reveal that a large proportion of individuals respond to others’ need thresholds, but at a declining rate as thresholds increase. The equal distribution marks a discrete drop in the need satisfaction rate: Need thresholds above the equal distribution are less frequently satisfied. We conclude that others’ needs are weighed against self-interest and equality. Our results provide evidence that distributions may be socially justified on grounds of the need principle."

A persistent problem due to the large-scale evacuations during hurricanes in the southeastern United States is the fuel shortages during the evacuation. Computational models can aid in emergency preparedness and help mitigate the impacts of hurricanes. In this paper, we model the hurricane fuel shortages using the SIR epidemic model. We utilize the crowd-sourced data corresponding to Hurricane Irma and Florence to parametrize the model. An estimation technique based on Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is employed to evaluate the SIR dynamic parameters. Finally, an optimal control approach for refueling based on a vaccination analogue is presented to effectively reduce the fuel shortages under a resource constraint. We find the basic reproduction number corresponding to fuel shortages in Miami during Hurricane Irma to be 3.98. Using the control model we estimated the level of intervention needed to mitigate the fuel-shortage epidemic. For example, our results indicate that for Naples- Fort Myers affected by Hurricane Irma, a per capita refueling rate of 0.1 for 2.2 days would have reduced the peak fuel shortage from 55% to 48% and a refueling rate of 0.75 for half a day before landfall would have reduced to 37%."

One sector where one would expect to see gender parity is the movie industry, yet the representation of females in most functions within the U.S. movie industry remain surprisingly low. Here, we study the historical patterns of female representation among actors, directors, and producers in an attempt to gain insights into the possible causes of the lack of gender parity in the industry. Our analyses reveals a remarkable temporal coincidence between the collapse in female representation across all functions and the advent of the Studio System, a period when the major Hollywood studios controlled all aspects of the industry. Female representation among actors, directors, producers and writers dropped to extraordinarily low values during the emergence and consolidation of the Studio System that in some cases have not yet recovered to pre-Studio System levels. In order to explore some possible mechanisms behind these patterns, we investigate the association between the gender balance of actors, writers, directors, and producers and a number of economic indicators, movie industry indicators, and movie characteristics. We find robust, strong, and significant associations which are consistent with an important role for the gender of decision makers on the gender balance of other industry functions. While in no way demonstrating causality, our findings add new perspectives to the discussions of the reasons for female under-representation in fields such as computer science and medicine, that have also experienced dramatic changes in female representation."
https://openalex.org/W3014642693,"Dengue diagnostics have come a long way. Attempts at breaking away from lab-oriented dengue detection, such as NS1 antigen, IgM or IgG antibodies detection have extensively received numerous coverage. As a result, rapid detection tests (RDTs) have started to gain inroads in medical practice. Rapid detection tests notwithstanding, analysis of blood serum is still a relatively complicated task. This includes the necessity of phlebotomy, centrifugation for blood serum, and other reagent-based tests. Therefore, a non-invasive method of dengue detection was considered. In this study, we present the utility of diffuse reflectance skin spectroscopy (bandwidth of 200-2500nm) on the forearm during the triaging period for dengue screening potential. This is performed with multivariate analysis of 240 triaged febrile/suspected dengue patients. The data is then scrutinized for its clinical validity to be included as either confirmed or probable dengue, or a control group. Based on discriminant analysis of several data normalization models, we can predict the patients' clinical dengue-positivity at ranges of accuracy between ~93-98% depending on mode of the data, with a probably optimal sensitivity and specificity to the clinical diagnosis of ~89% and ~100% respectively. From the outcomes of this study, we recommend further trials with cautious optimism. With these findings, it is hoped that the elusive non-invasive detection of tropical diseases may gain platform in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W3014448982,"The person-centred approach (PCA) is a promising avenue for care improvement. However, health professionals in Burkina Faso (hereafter referred to as caregivers) seem unprepared for taking into consideration patients' preferences and values in the context of healthcare provision.To understand the meaning attributed to PCA in the Burkina Faso context of care and to identify the challenges related to its adoption from the perspective of caregivers and women service users (hereafter referred to as patients).An ethnographic qualitative research design was used in this study. We conducted 31 semi-directed interviews with caregivers and patients from Koudougou (Burkina Faso) healthcare facilities. We also carried out direct observation of consultations. Data thematic analyses are based on the person-centred approach analysis framework.According to the caregivers and patients interviewed, the PCA in maternal and child healthcare in Burkina Faso includes the following five components used in our analytical framework: i) pregnancy follow-up consultations extend beyond examining physical health issues (biopsychosocial component), ii) healthcare professionals' mood affects the caregiver-patient relationship as well as care delivery (the healthcare professional as a person), iii) patients expect to be well received, listened to, and respected (the patient as a person), iv) healthcare professionals first acknowledge that both themselves and patients have power, rights but also responsibilities (sharing power, rights and responsibilities of professionals and patients), and v) healthcare professionals who are open to involving patients in decision-making about their care and patients asking to have a say in the organization of services (therapeutic alliance). Implementing each of these themes comes with challenges, such as i) talking about health problems in the presence of other women, especially those related to sexuality, even though they are common to parturient women (biopsychosocial component); ii) offering psychotherapy to healthcare professionals (healthcare professional as a person); iii) taking into consideration patients' cultural and linguistic differences (the patient as a person); iv) raising awareness among patients about their right to ask questions and healthcare professionals' duty to answer them (sharing power, and rights and responsibilities of professionals and patients); v) accepting the presence of birth attendants while avoiding traditional practices that are contrary to scientific recommendations (therapeutic alliance).Despite some context-specific particularities, the PCA is not new in the context of health care in Burkina Faso. However, its implementation can pose a number of challenges. There is a need to train healthcare professionals with a view to being sensitive to these particularities. This may also require organizational adjustments so as to create the physical and sociocultural environments that are conducive to taking into account the patient's perspective."
https://openalex.org/W3014091473,"The present study aims to develop the Race-related Attitudes and Multiculturalism Scale (RRAMS), as well as to perform an initial psychometric assessment of this instrument in a national sample of Australian adults.The sample comprised 2,714 Australian adults who took part in the 2013 National Dental Telephone Interview Survey (NDTIS), which includes a telephone-based interview and a follow-up postal questionnaire. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to evaluate the RRAMS' factorial structure (n = 271) and then proceeded with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to confirm the proposed structure in an independent sample (n = 2,443). Measurement invariance was evaluated according to sex, age and educational attainment. Construct validity was assessed through known-groups comparisons. Internal consistency was assessed with McDonald's ΩH and ordinal α. Multiple imputation by chained equations was adopted to handle missing data.EFA indicated that, after excluding 4 out of the 12 items, a two-factor structure provided a good fit to the data. This configural structure was then confirmed in an independent sample by means of CFA (χ2(19) = 341.070, p<0.001, CFI = 0.974, RMSEA = 0.083; 90% CI [0.076, 0.091]). Measurement invariance analyses suggested that the RRAMS items can be used to compare men/women, respondents with/without tertiary education and young/older participants. The ""Anglo-centric/Assimilationist attitudes"" (ΩH = 0.83, αORDINAL = 0.85) and ""Inclusive/Pluralistic attitudes"" subscales (ΩH = 0.77, αORDINAL = 0.79) showed adequate reliability. Men and participants with low education had higher Anglo-centric/assimilationist attitudes and lower inclusive/pluralistic attitudes, suggesting construct validity.The RRAMS appears to be a valid and reliable measure to evaluate multiculturalist attitudes in the Australian context. The instrument may be useful in the assessment and monitoring of interventions aiming to promote multiculturalist inclusive attitudes and to increase social cohesion in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W3014373809,"Studies demonstrate that post-meal walking decreases postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients but it has never been tested with the active treatment comparator. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of post-meal walking on glycemic control compared with one prandial insulin in type 2 diabetic patients who failed basal insulin. A randomized controlled cross-over study of post-meal walking or one prandial insulin was done in type 2 diabetic patients who were being treated with basal insulin between May 2017 and March 2018. In post-meal walking group, patients walked after meal for 15-20 minutes one meal a day every day for 6 weeks. In prandial insulin (basal plus) group, one prandial insulin was injected before breakfast or main meal with rapid-acting insulin. The primary outcome was a difference in HbA1c reduction in post-meal walking compared with basal plus groups. Fourteen patients completed the study. By intention-to-treat analysis, HbA1c was reduced by -0.05(range:-1.08 to 0.74) and -0.19(range:-0.8 to 0.56) % in post-meal walking and basal plus groups respectively. By per-protocol analysis, post-meal walking and basal plus groups decreased HbA1c by 0.13(range:-0.74 to 1.08) and 0.2(range:-0.56 to 0.8) %, respectively. There was were no significant differences in HbA1c reduction from baseline in each group and between groups in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. Fructosamine levels were decreased by 17.5(-59 to 43) and 10(-15 to 40) μmol/L, respectively at 3 and 6 weeks in post-meal walking group whereas the respective changes in basal plus group were 12.5(-17 to 64) and 17.5(-28 to 38) μmol/L and there were no significant differences in fructosamine reduction from baseline in each group and between groups. In conclusion, although post-meal walking might be as effective as one prandial insulin to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients who failed basal insulin but the magnitude of reduction was small. A longer-term study with a larger sample size or with a different walking protocol is required."
https://openalex.org/W3014945063,"Successive health system reforms have steadily eroded physician autonomy. Escalating accountability demands placed on physicians concurrent with diminishing autonomy plus widespread ""cost cutting"" endanger clinical work-life quality and, in turn, threaten patient-care quality, safety, and continuity. This has engendered a renewed emphasis on bettering physician work-life to safeguard patient care. Research indicates that autonomy support could be an effective intervention point in this dynamic, and that improving healthcare practitioners' experience of autonomy can promote better patient outcomes. New measures of autonomy support towards physicians during systemic/organizational transformation are thus needed.We investigated the validity and reliability of two versions of a brief measure of physicians' perceptions of autonomy support.Psychometric evaluation of practitioners' responses to a theory-based, pilot-tested, multi-center, cross-sectional survey-questionnaire.Physicians serving in California, Massachusetts, or upstate New York clinical practices implementing pay-for-performance incentives were eligible. We obtained responses from 1,534 (35.14%) of 4,365 physicians surveyed.We randomly partitioned the study sample equitably into derivation and validation subsamples. We conducted parallel analysis, inter-item/point-biserial correlations, and item-response-theory-based graded response modeling on six autonomy support items. Three items with the highest (a) point-biserial correlations, (b) item-level discrimination and (c) information capture were used to construct a short-form (3-item) version of the full (6-item) autonomy scale. We utilized exploratory structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis to establish the factor structure and construct validity of the full-length and short-form scales before comparing their factor invariance, reliability and interrater agreement across physician subgroups.All six autonomy support items loaded highly onto one factor accounting for the majority of variance and demonstrating good data fit. The three most discriminating and informative items loaded equally well onto a single factor with similar goodness-of-fit to the data. The three-item scale correlated highly with its six-item parent, showing equally high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating high autonomy support. Variability in scores nested predominantly at within- rather than between-subgroup levels.Our data supported the factor structure, construct validity, internal consistency, and reliability of six- and three-item autonomy support scales. These brief tools are easily incorporated into multi-dimensional questionnaires at relatively low cost."
