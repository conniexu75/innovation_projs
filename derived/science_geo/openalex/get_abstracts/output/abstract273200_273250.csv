https://openalex.org/W2065022073,"Seasonal records of tropical sea-surface temperature (SST) over the past 10(5) years can be recovered from high-precision measurements of coral strontium/calcium ratios with the use of thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The temperature dependence of these ratios was calibrated with corals collected at SST recording stations and by (18)O/(16)O thermometry. The results suggest that mean monthly SST may be determined with an apparent accuracy of better than 0.5 degrees C. Measurements on a fossil coral indicate that 10,200 years ago mean annual SSTs near Vanuatu in the southwestern Pacific Ocean were about 5 degrees C colder than today and that seasonal variations in SST were larger. These data suggest that tropical climate zones were compressed toward the equator during deglaciation."

This SiO(2) polymorph, unlike other silicas and silicates, exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio; alpha-cristobalite contracts laterally when compressed and expands laterally when stretched. Tensorial analysis of the elastic coefficients shows that Poisson's ratio reaches a maximum value of -0.5 in some directions, whereas averaged values for the single-phased aggregate yield a Poisson's ratio of -0.16."

The nanostructured titanium oxide mask was itself derived from a protein crystal template. Pattern transfer from the biological crystal to the metal oxide film and finally to the graphite substrate was accomplished entirely by parallel processing.

Computer simulations of the circulation of the Venus middle atmosphere between 40 and 85 kilometers, as driven by solar radiation absorbed in the clouds, reproduce (i) the observed cloud-level rotation rate, (ii) strong vertical shears above and below the cloud tops, and (iii) midlatitude jets and strong poleward flow on the day side. Simulated circulations converge to yield nearly the same zonal winds when initialized with both stronger or weaker rotation rates. These results support the hypothesis that the observed cloud-top rotation rate is maintained by statistical balance between fluxes of momentum by thermal tides and momentum advection by mean meridional circulation."

https://openalex.org/W2038827778,This method appears to be suitable for the oral administration of penicillin. Basic aluminum aminoacetate seems admirably suited for this purpose. It is neutral and buffers gastric acidity to pH 4 to 4.5. While this work was in progress McDermott et al.(6) successfully employed magnesium trisilicate in this manner. Clinical work is now in progress using the combination in infections known to be susceptible to parenteral penicillin therapy.

https://openalex.org/W1973623627,"Montmorillonite goes readily into solution in slightly acid water. In strong acids only bases, in pure water only free silica is removed. In the range from 0.02 to 0.5 per cent. acid, both bases and silica go into solution and recombine as an aluminosilicate sol and as highly soluble salts. The sol recovered by evaporation, washing and drying is an amorphous colloid near pyrophyllite in composition, Al(2)O(3).mSiO(2).nH(2)O, with m averaging 4.1 (3.9 to 4.5) and n about 1.5. The slight variation in m is unrelated to either sol, acid or clay concentration. A general characteristic relation between the amount of sol formed and the amounts of clay, acid and water used has been found for montmorillonite clays. This relation differs in two essential properties from that previously deduced for halloysite-allophane solutions. The variation with temperature of the constants of these equations remains to be investigated."
