https://openalex.org/W3034888566,"Although a great deal of attention has been paid to how conspiracy theories circulate on social media and their factual counterpart conspiracies, there has been little computational work done on describing their narrative structures. We present an automated pipeline for the discovery and description of the generative narrative frameworks of conspiracy theories on social media, and actual conspiracies reported in the news media. We base this work on two separate repositories of posts and news articles describing the well-known conspiracy theory Pizzagate from 2016, and the New Jersey conspiracy Bridgegate from 2013. We formulate a graphical generative machine learning model where nodes represent actors/actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific relationships. Posts and news items are viewed as samples of subgraphs of the hidden narrative network. The problem of reconstructing the underlying structure is posed as a latent model estimation problem. We automatically extract and aggregate the actants and their relationships from the posts and articles. We capture context specific actants and interactant relationships by developing a system of supernodes and subnodes. We use these to construct a network, which constitutes the underlying narrative framework. We show how the Pizzagate framework relies on the conspiracy theorists' interpretation of ""hidden knowledge"" to link otherwise unlinked domains of human interaction, and hypothesize that this multi-domain focus is an important feature of conspiracy theories. While Pizzagate relies on the alignment of multiple domains, Bridgegate remains firmly rooted in the single domain of New Jersey politics. We hypothesize that the narrative framework of a conspiracy theory might stabilize quickly in contrast to the narrative framework of an actual one, which may develop more slowly as revelations come to light."
https://openalex.org/W3034444120,"In order to improve treatment selection for high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix (NECC), we performed a comparative genomic analysis between this rare tumor type and other cervical cancer types, as well as extra-cervical neuroendocrine small cell carcinomas of the lung and bladder. We performed whole exome sequencing on fresh-frozen tissue from 15 NECCs and matched normal tissue. We then identified mutations and copy number variants using standard analysis pipelines. Published mutation tables from cervical cancers and extra-cervical small cell carcinomas were used for comparative analysis. Descriptive statistical methods were used and a two-sided threshold of P < .05 was used for significance. In the NECC cohort, we detected a median of 1.7 somatic mutations per megabase (range 1.0–20.9). PIK3CA p.E545K mutations were the most frequency observed oncogenic mutation (4/15 tumors, 27%). Activating MAPK pathway mutations in KRAS (p.G12D) and GNAS (p.R201C) co-occurred in two tumors (13%). In total we identified PI3-kinase or MAPK pathway activating mutations in 67% of NECC. When compared to NECC, lung and bladder small cell carcinomas exhibited a statistically significant higher rate of coding mutations (P < .001 for lung; P = .001 for bladder). Mutation of TP53 was uncommon in NECC (13%) and was more frequent in both lung (103 of 110 tumors [94%], P < .001) and bladder (18 of 19 tumors [95%], P < .001) small cell carcinoma. These comparative genomics data suggest that NECC may be genetically more similar to common cervical cancer subtypes than to extra-cervical small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung and bladder. These results may have implications for the selection of cytotoxic and targeted therapy regimens for this rare disease."
https://openalex.org/W3034888056,"Rapid resuscitation of an opioid overdose with naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is critical. We developed an opioid receptor quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model for evaluation of naloxone dosing. In this model we examined three opioid exposure levels that have been reported in the literature (25 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, and 75 ng/ml of fentanyl). The model predicted naloxone-fentanyl interaction at the mu opioid receptor over a range of three naloxone doses. For a 2 mg intramuscular (IM) dose of naloxone at lower fentanyl exposure levels (25 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml), the time to decreasing mu receptor occupancy by fentanyl to 50% was 3 and 10 minutes, respectively. However, at a higher fentanyl exposure level (75 ng/ml), a dose of 2 mg IM of the naloxone failed to reduce mu receptor occupancy by fentanyl to 50%. In contrast, naloxone doses of 5 mg and 10 mg IM reduced mu receptor occupancy by fentanyl to 50% in 5.5 and 4 minutes respectively. These results suggest that the current doses of naloxone (2 mg IM or 4 mg intranasal (IN)) may be inadequate for rapid reversal of toxicity due to fentanyl exposure and that increasing the dose of naloxone is likely to improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3035497047,"The importance of improving STEM education is of perennial interest, and to this end, the education community needs ways to characterize transformation efforts. Three-dimensional learning (3DL) is one such approach to transformation, in which core ideas of the discipline, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts are combined to support student development of disciplinary expertise. We have previously reported on an approach to the characterization of assessments, the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), that can be used to identify whether assessments have the potential to engage students in 3DL. Here we present the development of a companion, the Three-Dimensional Learning Observation Protocol (3D-LOP), an observation protocol that can reliably distinguish between instruction that has potential for engagement with 3DL and instruction that does not. The 3D-LOP goes beyond other observation protocols, because it is intended not only to characterize the pedagogical approaches being used in the instructional environment, but also to identify whether students are being asked to engage with scientific practices, core ideas, and crosscutting concepts. We demonstrate herein that the 3D-LOP can be used reliably to code for the presence of 3DL; further, we present data that show the utility of the 3D-LOP in differentiating between instruction that has the potential to promote 3DL from instruction that does not. Our team plans to continue using this protocol to evaluate outcomes of instructional transformation projects. We also propose that the 3D-LOP can be used to support practitioners in developing curricular materials and selecting instructional strategies to promote engagement in three-dimensional instruction."
https://openalex.org/W3035253480,"Poly(A) tails at the 3’ end of eukaryotic messenger RNAs control mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Facilitated by various NGS methods, alternative polyadenylation sites determining the 3ʹ-UTR length of gene transcripts have been extensively studied. However, poly(A) lengths demonstrating dynamic and developmental regulation remain largely unexplored. The recently developed NGS-based methods for genome-wide poly(A) profiling have promoted the study of genom-wide poly(A) dynamics. Here we present a straight forward NGS-method for poly(A) profiling, which applies a direct 3’-end adaptor ligation and the template switching for 5’-end adaptor ligation for cDNA library construction. Poly(A) lengths are directly calculated from base call data using a self-developed pipeline pA-finder. The libraries were directly sequenced from the 3ʹ-UTR regions into the followed poly(A) tails, firstly on NextSeq 500 to produce single-end 300-nt reads, demonstrating the method feasibility and that optimization of the fragmented RNA size for cDNA library construction could detecting longer poly (A) tails. We next applied Poly(A)-seq cDNA libraries containing 40-nt and 120-nt poly(A) tail spike-in RNAs on HiSeq X-ten and NovaSeq 6000 to obtain 150-nt and 250-nt pair-end reads. The sequencing profiles of the spike-in RNAs demonstrated both high accuracy and high quality score in reading poly(A) tails. The poly(A) signal bleeding into the 3’ adaptor sequence and a sharp decreased quality score at the junction were observed, allowing the modification of pA-finder to remove homopolymeric signal bleeding. We hope that wide applications of Poly(A)-seq help facilitate the study of the development- and disease-related poly(A) dynamics and regulation, and of the recent emerging mixed tailing regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3035216923,"Background Voluntary medical male circumcision (MC) is safe and effective. Nevertheless, MC programs require multiple post-operative visits. In Zimbabwe, a randomized control trial (RCT) found that post-operative two-way texting (2wT) between clients and MC providers instead of in-person reviews reduced provider workload and safeguarded patient safety. A critical component of the RCT assessed usability and acceptability of 2wT among providers and clients. These findings inform scale-up of the 2wT approach to post-operative follow-up. Methods The RCT assigned 362 adult MC clients with cell phones into 2wT; these men responded to 13 automated daily texts supported by interactive texting or in-person follow-up, when needed. A subset of 100 texting clients filled a self-administered usability survey on day 14. 2wT acceptability was ascertained via 2wT response rates. Among 2wT providers, eight key informant interviews focused on 2wT acceptability and usability. Influences of wage and age on response rates and client-reported potential AEs were explored using linear and logistic regression models, respectively. Results Clients felt confident, comfortable, satisfied, and well-supported with 2wT-based follow-up; few noted texting challenges or concerns about healing. Clients felt 2wT saved them time and money. Response rates (92%) suggested 2wT acceptability. Both clients and providers felt 2wT was highly usable. Providers noted 2wT saved them time, empowered clients to engage in their healing, and closed gaps in MC service quality. For scale, providers reinforced good post-operative counseling on AEs and texting instructions. Wage and age did not influence text response rates or potential AE texts. Conclusion Results strongly suggest that 2wT is highly usable and acceptable for providers and patients. Men with concerns solicited provider guidance and reassurance offered via text. Providers noted that men engaged proactively in their healing. 2wT between providers and patients should be expanded for MC and considered for other short-term care contexts. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, trial NCT03119337, and was activated on April 18, 2017. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03119337"
https://openalex.org/W3034356437,"Asymmetry, color variegation and diameter are considered strong indicators of malignant melanoma. The subjectivity inherent in the first two features and the fact that 10% of melanomas tend to be missed in the early diagnosis due to having a diameter less than 6mm, deem it necessary to develop an objective computer vision system to evaluate these criteria and aid in the early detection of melanoma which could eventually lead to a higher 5-year survival rate. This paper proposes an approach for evaluating the three criteria objectively, whereby we develop a measure to find asymmetry with the aid of a decision tree which we train on the extracted asymmetry measures and then use to predict the asymmetry of new skin lesion images. A range of colors that demonstrate the suspicious colors for the color variegation feature have been derived, and Feret's diameter has been utilized to find the diameter of the skin lesion. The decision tree is 80% accurate in determining the asymmetry of skin lesions, and the number of suspicious colors and diameter values are objectively identified."
https://openalex.org/W3034303034,"Chronic unresolved inflammation is the primary determinant of cardiovascular disease. Precise mechanisms that define the genesis of unresolved inflammation in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are of interest due to the obesity epidemic. To examine the obesity phenotype and its direct/indirect consequences, multiple approaches were employed using the lipoxin receptor (abbreviated as ALX) dysfunction mouse model. Indirect calorimetry analyses revealed that the deletion of ALX dysregulated energy metabolism driving toward age-related obesity. Heart function data suggest that obesity-prone ALX deficient mice had impaired myocardium strain. Comprehensive measurement of chemokines, extracellular matrix, and arrhythmogenic arrays confirmed the dysregulation of multiple ion channels gene expression with amplified inflammatory chemokines and cytokines response at the age of 4 months compared with WT counterparts. Quantitative analyses of leukocytes demonstrated an increase of proinflammatory Ly6ChiCCR2+ macrophages in the spleen and heart at a steady-state resulting in an inflamed splenocardiac axis. Signs of subtle inflammation were marked with cardiorenal, endothelial defects with decreased CD31 and eNOS and an increased iNOS and COX2 expression. Thus, ALX receptor deficiency serves as an experimental model that defines multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms in HFpEF that could be a target for the development of HFpEF therapy in cardiovascular medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3035693890,"In this paper, a novel self-learning digital twin strategy is developed for fluid sloshing phenomena. This class of problems is of utmost importance for robotic manipulation of fluids, for instance, or, in general, in simulation-assisted decision making. The proposed method infers the (linear or non-linear) constitutive behavior of the fluid from video sequences of the sloshing phenomena. Real-time prediction of the fluid response is obtained from a reduced order model (ROM) constructed by means of thermodynamics-informed data-driven learning. From these data, we aim to predict the future response of a twin fluid reacting to the movement of the real container. The constructed system is able to perform accurate forecasts of its future reactions to the movements of the containers. The system is completed with augmented reality techniques, so as to enable comparisons among the predicted result with the actual response of the same liquid and to provide the user with insightful information about the physics taking place."
https://openalex.org/W3034549055,"Tuber mustard, which is the raw material of Fuling pickle, is a crop with great economic value. However, during growth and development, tuber mustard is frequently attacked by the pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae and frequently experiences salinity stress. Jasmonic acid (JA) is a hormone related to plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Jasmonate ZIM domain proteins (JAZs) are crucial components of the JA signaling pathway and play important roles in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. To date, no information is available about the characteristics of the JAZ family genes in tuber mustard. Here, 38 BjJAZ genes were identified in the whole genome of tuber mustard. The BjJAZ genes are located on 17 of 18 chromosomes in the tuber mustard genome. The gene structures and protein motifs of the BjJAZ genes are conserved between tuber mustard and Arabidopsis. The results of qRT-PCR analysis showed that BjuA030800 was specifically expressed in root, and BjuA007483 was specifically expressed in leaf. In addition, 13 BjJAZ genes were transiently induced by P. brassicae at 12 h, and 7 BjJAZ genes were induced by salt stress from 12 to 24 h. These results provide valuable information for further studies on the role of BjJAZ genes in the regulation of plant growth and development and in the response to biotic and abiotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W3034885502,"Peroxidasin (PXDN) has been reported to crosslink the C-terminal non-collagenous domains of collagen IV (Col IV) by forming covalent sulfilimine bond. Here, we explored the physiological role of PXDN and its mechanism of action in endothelial cell survival and growth. Silencing of PXDN using siRNAs decreased cell proliferation without increase of the number of detached cells and decreased cell viability under serum-starved condition with increased fragmented nuclei and caspase 3/7 activity. Conditioned medium (CM) containing wild-type PXDN restored the proliferation of PXDN-depleted cells, but CM containing mutant PXDN with deletion of either N-terminal extracellular matrix (ECM) motifs or peroxidase domain failed to restore PXDN function. Accordingly, anti-PXDN antibody [raised against IgC2 (3-4) subdomain within ECM motifs] and peroxidase inhibitor phloroglucinol prevented the rescue of the PXDN-depleted cells by PXDN-containing CM. PXDN depletion resulted in loss of sulfilimine crosslinks, and decreased dense fibrillar network assembly of not only Col IV, but also fibronectin and laminin like in Col IV knockdown. Exogenous PXDN-containing CM restored ECM assembly as well as proliferation of PXDN-depleted cells. Accordingly, purified recombinant PXDN protein restored the proliferation and ECM assembly, and prevented cell death of the PXDN-depleted cells. PXDN depletion also showed reduced growth factors-induced phosphorylation of FAK and ERK1/2. In addition, siPXDN-transfected cell-derived matrix failed to provide full ECM-mediated activation of FAK and ERK1/2. These results indicate that both the ECM motifs and peroxidase activity are essential for the cellular function of PXDN and that PXDN is crucial for ECM assembly for survival and growth signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3035336215,"Xanthoxylin was the main compound (content 44.92% of total volatiles) in the leaves of Luodian B. balsamifera, which might be the key cause of failure in collecting essential oil (EO) of the leaves using general hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus. A modified hydrodistillation equipped with Clevenger apparatus was designed for isolating EO from the leaves. Six EOs of Luodian B. balsamifera harvested once a month from September to next February were collected successfully. The main components of EOs were δ-elemene, α-cubenene, caryophyllene, caryophyllene epoxide, γ-eudesmol, xanthoxylin, and α-eudesmol. The EOs of Luodian B. balsamifera collected from October to December had higher antioxidant activities (ACs). Combining the principal component analysis of chemical components with the results of ACs and the yields of six EOs, the leaves of Luodian B. balsamifera were suitable to be harvested in November and December to obtain EO with high quality."
https://openalex.org/W3035753915,"Myocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium that can progress to a more severe phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Three main harmful factors determine this progression: inflammation, cell death, and oxidative stress. Lipoxins and their derivatives are endogenous proresolving mediators that induce the resolution of the inflammatory process. This study aims to determine whether these mediators play a protective role in a murine model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) by treating with the lipoxin A4 analog BML-111. We observed that EAM mice presented extensive infiltration areas that correlated with higher levels of inflammatory and cardiac damage markers. Both parameters were significantly reduced in BML-treated EAM mice. Consistently, cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and emerging fibrosis detected in EAM mice was prevented by BML-111 treatment. At the molecular level, we demonstrated that treatment with BML-111 hampered apoptosis and oxidative stress induction by EAM. Moreover, both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that these beneficial effects were mediated by activation of Nrf2 pathway through CaMKK2-AMPKα kinase pathway. Altogether, our data indicate that treatment with the lipoxin derivative BML-111 effectively alleviates EAM outcome and prevents cardiac dysfunction, thus, underscoring the therapeutic potential of lipoxins and their derivatives to treat myocarditis and other inflammatory cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3034191040,"Objective Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is common, curable, and associated with significant reproductive morbidity and risk for HIV infection. This analysis updates estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic TV infection, and its associated risk factors, in the non-institutionalized U.S. population. Methods We analyzed data from 4057 individuals who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014 data collection cycle. Participant interviews ascertained demographic characteristics, self-reported tobacco use, and sexual history. Self-collected urine specimens from participants aged 18 to 59 years were tested for TV infection using the Gen-Probe Aptima TV assay. Cotinine was assayed from serum to provide a biomarker of recent tobacco exposure. Weighted percentages are provided to account for unequal selection probabilities among participants and adjustments for non-response. Results Our sample included 1942 men (49.2%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 48.0–50.5) and 2115 women (50.8%, 95%CI 49.5–52.0). The infection prevalence among men was 0.5% (n = 16; 95%CI 0.2–1.0) and 1.8% (n = 55; 95%CI 1.1–3.1) in women. After controlling for participant characteristics associated with TV infection, females had a 5.2-fold increased odds of being infected compared to men (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.2, 95% CI 2.4–11.4). Non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be infected compared to non-Hispanic whites (aOR 11.2, 95% CI 4.6–27.2). Individuals below the federal poverty level were more likely to be infected compared to those earning >3 times the federal poverty level (aOR 6.7, 95% CI 1.7–26.6), and active smokers were more likely to be infected compared to participants with no nicotine exposure (aOR 8.7, 95% CI 4.1–18.2). Conclusion Trichomonas vaginalis infection continues to be relatively common, especially in women, smokers, non-Hispanic blacks, and in groups of lower socioeconomic status. Identifying the demographic characteristics of populations in the United States disproportionately affected by TV could impact screening and treatment of this infection in clinical practice. Further research on whether screening and treating for asymptomatic TV infection in high-risk populations improves risk for reproductive morbidity and HIV infection is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3034475272,"Mentorship plays an essential role in enhancing the success of junior faculty. Previous evaluation tools focused on specific types of mentors or mentees. The main objective was to develop and provide validity evidence for a Mentor Evaluation Tool (MET) to assess the effectiveness of one-on-one mentoring for faculty in the academic health sciences.Evidence was collected for the validity domains of content, internal structure and relationship to other variables. The 13 item MET was tested for internal structure evidence with 185 junior faculty from Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy. Finally, the MET was studied for additional validity evidence by prospectively enrolling mentees of three different groups of faculty (faculty nominated for, or winners of, a lifetime achievement in mentoring award; faculty graduates of a mentor training program; and faculty mentors not in either of the other two groups) at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and asking them to rate their mentors using the MET. Mentors and mentees were clinicians, educators and/or researchers.The 13 MET items mapped well to the five mentoring domains and six competencies described in the literature. The standardized Cronbach's coefficient alpha was 0.96. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a single factor (CFI = 0.89, SRMR = 0.05). The three mentor groups did not differ in the single overall assessment item (P = 0.054) or mean MET score (P = 0.288), before or after adjusting for years of mentoring. The mentorship score means were relatively high for all three groups.The Mentor Evaluation Tool demonstrates evidence of validity for research, clinical, educational or career mentors in academic health science careers. However, MET did not distinguish individuals nominated as outstanding mentors from other mentors. MET validity evidence can be studied further with mentor-mentee pairs and to follow prospectively the rating of mentors before and after a mentorship training program."
https://openalex.org/W3034951810,"Dichotic-listening paradigms are widely accepted as non-invasive tests of hemispheric dominance for language processing and represent a standard diagnostic tool for the assessment of developmental auditory and language disorders. Despite its popularity in research and clinical settings, dichotic paradigms show comparatively low reliability, significantly threatening the validity of conclusions drawn from the results. Thus, the aim of the present work was to design and evaluate a novel, highly reliable dichotic-listening paradigm for the assessment of hemispheric differences. Based on an extensive literature review, the paradigm was optimized to account for the main experimental variables which are known to systematically bias task performance or affect random error variance. The main design principle was to minimize the relevance of higher cognitive functions on task performance in order to obtain stimulus-driven laterality estimates. To this end, the key design features of the paradigm were the use of stop-consonant vowel (CV) syllables as stimulus material, a single stimulus pair per trial presentation mode, and a free recall (single) response instruction. Evaluating a verbal and manual response-format version of the paradigm in a sample of N = 50 healthy participants, we yielded test-retest intra-class correlations of rICC = .91 and .93 for the two response format versions. These excellent reliability estimates suggest that the optimal paradigm may offer an effective and efficient alternative to currently used paradigms both in research and diagnostic."
https://openalex.org/W3035075758,"Understanding progression of breast cancers to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) can significantly improve breast cancer treatments. However, it is still difficult to identify genetic signatures and the role of tumor microenvironment to distinguish pathological stages of pre-invasive lesion and IDC. Presence of multiple subtypes of breast cancers makes the assessment more challenging. In this study, an in-vitro microfluidic assay was developed to quantitatively assess the subtype-specific invasion potential of breast cancers. The developed assay is a microfluidic platform in which a ductal structure of epithelial cancer cells is surrounded with a three-dimensional (3D) collagen matrix. In the developed platform, two triple negative cancer subtypes (MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159PT) invaded into the surrounding matrix but the luminal A subtype, MCF-7, did not. Among invasive subtypes, SUM-159PT cells showed significantly higher invasion and degradation of the surrounding matrix than MDA-MB-231. Interestingly, the cells cultured on the platform expressed higher levels of CD24 than in their conventional 2D cultures. This microfluidic platform may be a useful tool to characterize and predict invasive potential of breast cancer subtypes or patient-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W3034273239,"Introduction The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommended retrieval of at least 12 lymph nodes and firstly classified N category by the number of positive lymph nodes (PLNs) for Distal Cholangiocarcinoma (DCC). Objective The end of this cohort study was to explore the optimal cut-off values of the number of examined lymph nodes (ELNs) and PLNs to better stratify patients by utilizing a population-based database. Methods A number of 758 patients with DCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were enrolled in the study and comparing by the survival analysis. Results Survival analysis found that patients with ELNs < 5 had a lower 3-year disease-specific survival rate than ELNs ≥ 5 in N0M0 cohort (35.3% vs. 53.0%, P = 0.001) and in M0 cohort (42.7% vs. 32.8%, P = 0.006); survival curves between patients with ELNs < 12 and ELNs ≥ 12 were overlapped in N0M0 cohort (P = 0.256) and in M0 cohort (P = 0.233). Among patients with ELNs ≥ 5, using the optimal cut-off value of the number of PLNs (0, 2) could accurately stratify patients, but the recommendation of the number of PLNs (0, 3) by the AJCC could not. Conclusions This study recommended examining at least 5 lymph nodes and defining PLNs = 1–2 as the N1 category and PLNs ≥ 3 as the N2 category, which may better stratify distal cholangiocarcinoma patients and improve the accuracy of the eighth edition AJCC staging."
https://openalex.org/W3034552053,"Background and aims Adipose tissue plays a pivotal role in storing excess fat and its composition reflects the history of person’s lifestyle and metabolic health. Broad profiling of lipids with mass spectrometry has potential for uncovering new knowledge on the pathology of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other related conditions. Here, we developed a lipidomic method for analyzing human subcutaneous adipose biopsies. We applied the method to four body areas to understand the differences in lipid composition between these areas. Materials and methods Adipose tissue biopsies from 10 participants were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The sample preparation optimization included the optimization of the lipid extraction, the sample amount and the sample dilution factor to detect lipids in an appropriate concentration range. Lipidomic analyses were performed for adipose tissue collected from the abdomen, breast, thigh and lower back. Differences in lipid levels between tissues were visualized with heatmaps. Results Lipidomic analysis on human adipose biopsies lead to the identification of 186lipids in 2 mg of sample. Technical variation of the lipid-class specific internal standards were below 5%, thus indicating acceptable repeatability. Triacylglycerols were highly represented in the adipose tissue samples, and lipids from 13 lipid classes were identified. Long polyunsaturated triacylglycerols in higher levels in thigh (q<0.05), when compared with the abdomen, breast and lower back, indicating that the lipidome was area-specific. Conclusion The method presented here is suitable for the analysis of lipid profiles in 2 mg of adipose tissue. The amount of fat across the body is important for health but we argue that also the distribution and the particular profile of the lipidome may be relevant for metabolic outcomes. We suggest that the method presented in this paper could be useful for detecting such aberrations."
https://openalex.org/W3035220441,"Folates are important for neurodevelopment and cognitive function. Folate transport across biological membranes is mediated by three major pathways: folate receptor alpha (FRα), proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), and reduced folate carrier (RFC). Brain folate transport primarily occurs at the choroid plexus through FRα and PCFT; inactivation of these transport systems results in suboptimal folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) causing childhood neurological disorders. Our group has reported that upregulation of RFC at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through interactions with specific transcription factors, that is, vitamin D receptor (VDR) could increase brain folate delivery. This study investigates the role of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) in the regulation of RFC at the BBB. Activation of NRF-1/PGC-1α signaling through treatment with its specific ligand, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), significantly induced RFC expression and transport activity in hCMEC/D3 cells. In contrast, transfection with NRF-1 or PGC-1α targeting siRNA downregulated RFC functional expression in the same cell system. Applying chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we further demonstrated that PQQ treatment increased NRF-1 binding to putative NRF-1 binding sites within the SLC19A1 promoter, which encodes for RFC. Additionally, in vivo treatment of wild type mice with PQQ-induced RFC expression in isolated mouse brain capillaries. Together, these findings demonstrate that NRF-1/PGC-1α activation by PQQ upregulates RFC functional expression at the BBB and could potentially enhance brain folate uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3034927656,"The major symptoms of Tourette syndrome are motor and vocal tics, but Tourette syndrome is occasionally associated with cognitive alterations as well. Although Tourette syndrome does not affect the majority of cognitive functions, some of them improve. There is scarce evidence on the impairment of learning functions in patients with Tourette syndrome. The core symptoms of Tourette syndrome are related to dysfunction of the basal ganglia and the frontostriatal loops. Acquired equivalence learning is a kind of associative learning that is related to the basal ganglia and the hippocampi. The modified Rutgers Acquired Equivalence Test was used in the present study to observe the associative learning function of patients with Tourette syndrome. The cognitive learning task can be divided into two main phases: the acquisition and test phases. The latter is further divided into two parts: retrieval and generalization. The acquisition phase of the associative learning test, which mainly depends on the function of the basal ganglia, was affected in the entire patient group, which included patients with Tourette syndrome with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, or no comorbidities. Patients with Tourette syndrome performed worse in building associations. However, the retrieval and generalization parts of the test phase, which primarily depend on the function of the hippocampus, were not worsened by Tourette syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3035391010,"Predicting and mitigating impacts of climate change and development within the boreal biome requires a sound understanding of factors influencing the abundance, distribution, and population dynamics of species inhabiting this vast biome. Unfortunately, the limited accessibility of the boreal biome has resulted in sparse and spatially biased sampling, and thus our understanding of boreal bird population dynamics is limited. To implement effective conservation of boreal birds, a cost-effective approach to sampling the boreal biome will be needed. Our objective was to devise a sampling scheme for monitoring boreal birds that would improve our ability to model species-habitat relationships and monitor changes in population size and distribution. A statistically rigorous design to achieve these objectives would have to be spatially balanced and hierarchically structured with respect to ecozones, ecoregions and political jurisdictions. Therefore, we developed a multi-stage hierarchically structured sampling design known as the Boreal Optimal Sampling Strategy (BOSS) that included cost constraints, habitat stratification, and optimization to provide a cost-effective alternative to other common monitoring designs. Our design provided similar habitat and spatial representation to habitat stratification and equal-probability spatially balanced designs, respectively. Not only was our design able to achieve the desired habitat representation and spatial balance necessary to meet our objectives, it was also significantly less expensive (1.3-2.6 times less) than the alternative designs we considered. To further balance trade-offs between cost and representativeness prior to field implementation, we ran multiple iterations of the BOSS design and selected the one which minimized predicted costs while maximizing a multi-criteria evaluation of representativeness. Field implementation of the design in three vastly different regions over three field seasons showed that the approach can be implemented in a wide variety of logistical scenarios and ecological conditions. We provide worked examples and scripts to allow our approach to be implemented or adapted elsewhere. We also provide recommendations for possible future refinements to our approach, but recommend that our design now be implemented to provide unbiased information to assess the status of boreal birds and inform conservation and management actions."
https://openalex.org/W3034329198,"Background Imipenem, an intravenous antibiotic is recommended for use in drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) when an effective regimen with combination of other second line drugs is not possible. Though the treatment success rates with carbapenems are promising, the twice daily injection of Imipenem usually requires patients to be hospitalized. The Médecins Sans Frontières independent clinic in Mumbai, India implemented ambulatory and home based management of patients receiving Imipenem through the use of port-a-cath. Objective We aimed to describe the adverse events and treatment outcomes of ambulatory pre- and XDR-TB patients initiated on imipenem through port-a-cath between January 2015 and June 2018 and to explore the challenges with this regimen as perceived by healthcare providers and patients. Methods A convergent mixed methods study with quantitative (longitudinal descriptive study using the routine data) and qualitative (descriptive study) part conducted concurrently. For the quantitative component, all XDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB initiated on imipenem containing regimen during January 2015-June 2018 were included. For qualitative component, interviews were carried out including patients who initiated on imipenem (n = 5) and healthcare providers (n = 7) involved in providing treatment. Treatment outcomes, culture conversion and adverse events during treatment were described. Thematic analysis was carried out for qualitative component. Results Of the 70 patients included, the mean age was 28.1 (standard deviation: 11.2) years and 36 (51.4%) were females. Fifty one (72.9%) had XDR-TB. All patients were resistant to fluoroquinilone, levofloxacin. Vomiting was reported by 55 (78.6%) patients and at least one episode of QTC prolongation (more than 500 msec by Fredrecia method) was detected in 25 (35.7%). Port-a-cath block and infection was seen in 11 (15.7%) and 20 (28.6%) patients respectively. Favourable outcomes were seen in 43 (61.4%) patients. Mortality was seen in 22 (31.4%) patients, 2 (2.9%) were lost-to-follow-up and 3 (4.3%) were declared as treatment failure. The overarching theme of the qualitative analysis was: Challenges in delivering Imipenem via port-a-cath device in ambulatory care. Major challenges identified were difficulties in adhering to drug dose timelines, vomiting, restricted mobility due to port-a-cath, paucity of infection control and space constraints at patients’ home for optimal care. Conclusion Administration of imipenem was feasible through port-a-cath. Though outcomes with ambulatory based imipenem containing regimens were promising, there were several challenges in providing care. The feasibility of infusion at day care facilities needs to explored to overcome challenges in infusion at patients home."
https://openalex.org/W3034633997,"Objectives To compare objective and subjective image quality of bronchial structures between a 512-pixel and a 1024-pixel image matrix for chest CT in phantoms and in patients. Materials and methods First, a two-size chest phantom was imaged at two radiation doses on a 192-slice CT scanner. Datasets were reconstructed with 512-, 768-, and 1024-pixel image matrices and a sharp reconstruction kernel (Bl64). Image sharpness and normalized noise power spectrum (nNPS) were quantified. Second, chest CT images of 100 patients were reconstructed with 512- and 1024-pixel matrices and two blinded readers independently assessed objective and subjective image quality. In each patient dataset, the highest number of visible bronchi was counted for each lobe of the right lung. A linear mixed effects model was applied in the phantom study and a Welch’s t-test in the patient study. Results Objective image sharpness and image noise increased with increasing matrix size and were highest for the 1024-matrix in phantoms and patients (all, P<0.001). nNPS was comparable among the three matrices. Objective image noise was on average 16% higher for the 1024-matrix compared to the 512-matrix in patients (P<0.0001). Subjective evaluation in patients yielded improved sharpness but increased image noise for the 1024- compared to the 512-matrix (both, P<0.001). There was no significant difference between highest-order visible bronchi (P>0.07) and the overall bronchial image quality between the two matrices (P>0.22). Conclusion Our study demonstrated superior image sharpness and higher image noise for a 1024- compared to a 512-pixel matrix, while there was no significant difference in the depiction and subjective image quality of bronchial structures for chest CT."
https://openalex.org/W3035077801,"The Minangkabau people of West Sumatra in Indonesia are renowned for their matrilineal culture with property and land passing down from mother to daughter. Despite there being a fairly balanced social status for women in the community, the impact of health inequalities is uneven. This study was therefore carried out to explore the relationship between the social, cultural and economic contexts in such a distinctive community with maternal nutrition and pregnancy-related health outcomes, from the perspectives of the mothers, fathers and care providers. Qualitative methods were used to undertake this study in collaboration with partners from the University of Andalas in a suburban area of Padang district. The data collection method was qualitative, semi-structured interviews (n = 19) with women, men, midwives and community health workers. The data were recorded with informed consent, transcribed in the local language and then translated into English prior to being thematically analysed. The major themes which emerged from the data included 'Minangkabau matrilineality and role of women'; 'culture and supportive attitude towards pregnant women'; 'dietary patterns, attitude and access to food'; and 'limited access to information about food and nutrition'. The findings showed healthy dietary patterns such as regular consumption of vegetables and fruit among the participants. However, the issues of poverty, access to food, dietary taboos and inadequate nutritional information remained major challenges for the mothers and the families who participated in the study. The evidence from this study suggests that the matrilineal culture of the Minangkabau promotes the empowerment of women and offers an encouraging environment for enhancing reproductive health. This lends itself to co-developing locally sensitive and sustainable complex interventions incorporating professional support and building on family and community back-up, enhancing knowledge and demystifying dietary misinformation to improve maternal health and nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3034650586,"A study was conducted to determine the impact of applying different sources of Mg, namely kieserite, ground magnesium limestone (GML) and Mg-rich synthetic gypsum (MRSG) on an acid tropical soil, oil palm growth and production. Besides high amount of Mg and Ca, MRSG contains S. Exchangeable Ca in the untreated soil of the plantation was 0.64 cmolc kg-1, but its critical level to sustain oil palm growth was 0.9 cmolc kg-1. MRSG was applied in the plantation as Mg-fertilizer; however, since Ca is also a limiting nutrient, oil palm growth was correlated (r = 0.69) with Ca supplied by the MRSG. Mg needed to sustain oil palm production is normally supplied by kieserite. Its requirement can be met at a lower cost compared to that of the kieserite by using MRSG. Due to MRSG treatment, exchangeable Ca in the soil increased steadily to satisfy the requirement of oil palm for fruit bunches production. From the glasshouse and field study, it was observed that MRSG applied at 1.5 times the recommended rate gave results comparable to that of the kieserite. MRSG treatment resulted in the increase of soil pH to >5 that precipitated Al3+ as inert Al-hydroxides, which eventually enhanced oil palm seedlings growth. Thus, MRSG can also replace GML to increase soil pH and satisfy the Ca and Mg requirement of oil palm. It can be concluded that MRSG has the potential to be used as a source of Mg as well as Ca for oil palm grown on acidic soil."
https://openalex.org/W3034849135,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent a promising platform for studying embryonic development, and different states of pluripotency reflect the different stages of embryo development. Here, we successfully converted three in-house-derived primed hPSC lines (H10, H24, and iPS) to a naive state and an expanded pluripotent stem cell (EPS) state. Primed, naive and EPS cells displayed state-specific morphologies and expressed pluripotent markers. The expression of SSEA4 and TRA-1-60 was downregulated in the conversion process. The H3K27me3 expression level also decreased, indicating that global methylation was reduced and that the X chromosome started to reactivate. RNA-sequencing analysis results revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in both naive hPSCs and EPS cells when compared to the primed state. However, imprinted gene expression barely changed before and after state reversion. Gene ontology (GO) analyses showed that the upregulated DEGs were mostly enriched in RNA processing, DNA replication and repair, and regulation of cell cycle process, while downregulated DEGs were related to extracellular adhesion and various tissue developmental processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that EPS cells were enriched in the PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. Analysis of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network between primed, naive hPSCs and EPS cells revealed that hsa-miR-424-5p, has-miR-16-5p, has-miR-27b-3p, has-miR-29c-3p, and KCNQ1OT1 were crucial nodes with high degrees of connectivity. Our work may represent new insight into the intrinsic molecular features of different hPSC states."
https://openalex.org/W3035077681,"This study was undertaken to investigate the potential association between sleep duration and periodontitis. The study population consisted of 10,291 individuals who participated in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the 2009-2014 cycles. Sleep duration was categorized into sleep deficient (< 7 hours), sleep adequate (7-8 hours), and sleep excessive (> 8 hours). We used the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) periodontitis case definition. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used for data analyses. The prevalence of periodontitis was 36% higher in individuals who reported sleep deficiency when compared to the sleep adequate group (odds Ratio (OR) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.50). Those who reported excessive sleep had 41% higher odds of periodontitis (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.16-1.71). After adjusting for confounding factors, sleep deficient individuals were 19% more likely to have periodontitis when compared to sleep adequate individuals (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.06-1.38). Among sleep excessive individuals, the association was non-significant (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.94-1.43). Sleep deficiency was associated with a higher prevalence of periodontitis in this study population. The association however needs to be confirmed in longitudinal studies."
https://openalex.org/W3035193790,"Airborne fungi are associated with upper and lower airway inflammatory diseases. Alternaria is commonly found in nasal secretions and induces the production of chemical mediators from sinonasal mucosa. This study aimed to establish an Alternaria-induced chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) mouse model and determine the influence of host allergic background on the immunopathological characteristics of CRS. BALB/c mice were used for establishing the CRS model. Alternaria was intranasally instilled for 8 or 16 weeks with or without ovalbumin (OVA) presensitization. Total serum IgE and Alternaria-specific IgE levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) and splenocytes were measured by ELISA and their mRNAs and levels of associated transcription factors in sinonasal mucosa were determined with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Hematoxylin-eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining were performed to evaluate histological changes. Total serum IgE was increased in both allergic and non-allergic CRS. IL-4 was strongly expressed in NLF in both allergic and non-allergic CRS at 16 weeks and not only eosinophils but also neutrophils were increased in NLF of non-allergic CRS mice. The levels of Th1, Th2, and Treg cytokines and transcription factor mRNAs were significantly increased in sinonasal mucosa of non-allergic CRS mice. Both inflammatory cell infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia were increased in CRS mice. Repeated intranasal instillation of Alternaria results in sinonasal inflammation with inflammatory cell infiltration. The sinonasal mucosal immune responses against Alternaria were shown to differ depending on the host allergic background."
https://openalex.org/W3035295502,"Gestations at the extremes of reproductive age are characterized as high-risk pregnancies, conditions that might influence colostrum composition. This first milk secretion contains nutrients necessary for the development and immunity of the newborn; therefore, this study aims to compare adolescent and advanced maternal age mothers regarding sociodemographic, gestational, and perinatal characteristics and the colostrum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in these groups of study. This cross-sectional study has compared sociodemographic, gestational and perinatal data from adolescent mothers (between 10 and 24 years old) (n = 117), advanced maternal age mothers (over 35 years of age) (n = 39) and mothers considered a control group (25 to 34 years old) (n = 58). Additionally, colostrum samples were obtained from the studied and control group subjects by manual milking, between 48 and 72 hours postpartum, and the samples were analyzed for cytokine concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The majority of the studied mothers reported living a stable union, and 81.2% of the adolescent mothers did not carry out any paid activity. Mothers with advanced maternal age mainly delivered by cesarean section and presented a higher body mass index (BMI). Neonatal weight and Apgar score were not different between the groups. The concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 were higher in the colostrum of mothers with advanced age compared to adolescent mothers, but did not differ from the control group. The concentrations of IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha did not differ between the three groups. Therefore, our data demonstrated that maternal age influenced the sociodemographic and gestational characteristics as well as the composition of colostrum cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W3034274136,"High quality care—at a minimum—is a combination of the availability of tangible resources as well as a capable and motivated health workforce. Researchers have suggested that supportive supervision can increase both the performance and motivation of health workers and the quality of care. This study is aimed at assessing the required number of visits and time between visits to bring about improvements in health service delivery. The study employed a primary health care performance improvement conceptual framework which depicts building blocks for improved health service delivery using longitudinal program outcome monitoring data collected from July 2017 to December 2019. The analysis presented in this study is based on 3,080 visits made to 1,479 health centers in the USAID Transform: Primary Health Care project’s intervention districts. To assess the effects of the visits on the repeated measure of the outcome variable (Service-Delivery), multilevel linear mixed model (LMM) with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation was employed. The results showed that there was a significant dose-response relationship that consistent and significant improvement on Service-Delivery indicator was observed from first (β = -26.07, t = -7.43, p < 0.001) to second (β = -21.17, t = -6.00, p < 0.01), third (β = -15.20, t = -4.49, p < 0.02), fourth (β = -12.35, t = -3.58, p < 0.04) and fifth (β = -11.18, t = -2.86, p < 0.03) visits. The incremental effect of the visits was not significant from fifth visit to the sixth suggesting five visits are the optimal number of visits to improve service delivery at the health center level. The time interval between visits also suggested visits made between 6 to 9 months (β = -2.86, t = -2.56, p < 0.01) showed more significant contributions. Therefore, we can conclude that five visits each separated by 6 to 9 months elicits a significant service delivery improvement at health centers."
https://openalex.org/W3035587339,"Recent studies on water demand management show that providing visual information on water usage along with social comparisons with neighbouring households resulted in more efficient water usage. However, social comparisons can be discomforting for participants, especially in the case of downward or negative evaluations. To avoid this, some studies promote the use of social identity, a social norm approach that avoids comparisons. Past studies using social comparison used infographics, whereas other study types have used only textual (non-graphic) information. Therefore, in this study, we created a visualisation of water usage to highlight the importance of water as a shared resource, that is, as a public good, and feedback over six months according to the participants' water usage. A difference-in-difference analysis indicated that the feedback was marginally significant in decreasing water consumption immediately and continuously, especially for the middle and low use households, during the summer months, which is a period of perceived water shortage. From the questionnaire survey, we found that households felt that they determined their water usage based on their preference and were satisfied with the outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3034609755,"Carbon emissions are the primary reason that contributes to global warming. The gradient has a significant impact on the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced by trucks. The aim of the current paper is to propose a carbon emission quantification model for diesel trucks on longitudinal slope sections and investigate the influence of gradient on the carbon emissions of trucks for use in the low-carbon highway design. The law of conservation of mechanical energy, the first law of thermodynamics, and the vehicle longitudinal dynamics theory were adopted for deriving the carbon emission model of the trucks on the flat, uphill, downhill and round-trip longitudinal slope segments. Three kinds of common trucks were chosen to conduct the field test. Following the test data, the model demonstrates a high accuracy. The minimum gradient which is expected to impact carbon emissions of trucks on the round-trip longitudinal slope sections was the balance gradient as revealed. The gradient of the longitudinal slope is required to be avoided to be greater in comparison with the balance gradient for the achievement of the two-way traffic low carbon operation on a highway. The results of this study are valuable to researchers interested in low carbon road design and low carbon transportation control."
https://openalex.org/W3035671642,"Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) show the postural constraints while standing, and gait disorders, resulting from both primary and secondary impairments of brain injury. In our previous studies, several characteristic postural and gait patterns in children with unilateral as well as with bilateral CP were defined, and the relationship between these patterns was demonstrated. The purpose of present study was to identify which features of body posture deviation during standing were strongly related to gait deviations in independently ambulatory children with CP. For this aim we explored the cross—relationship between features of body posture while standing examined by surface topography and the selected gait parameters from three-dimensional instrumented gait analysis in one hundred twenty children with cerebral palsy, aged between 7 and 13 years, who were able to walk independently. First, our study documented that that sagittal misalignment of the spine curvature was significantly related to kinematic deviations such as deviations of pelvic tilt, inadequate swing phase and knee flexion, and peak dorsiflexion in stance. Second, the study shows that the static asymmetry of pelvis and trunk was significantly associated with kinematic deviations during gait cycle such as pelvic rotation, hip abduction in swing, ROM of knee flexion, peak dorsiflexion in stance. Based on obtained results and referring to our previous findings it can be assumed that the first model of the relationship between postural deviation and gait disturbances, called ‘postural and gait complex of disorders in sagittal plane’, is related to children with bilateral CP, whereas the second model ‘postural and gait complex of disorders in coronal plane’ to children with unilateral CP. The clinical applications of this study relate to the early recognition of particular features of postural deviation using surface topography, instead of more difficult and demanding expensive tools 3-D gait analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3034192655,"Bilingualism was implemented in the Community of Madrid (Spain) more than ten years ago, through the incorporation of the English language in the teaching methods of certain schools. Since that time, various research projects have been carried out, with the objective of comparing the academic performance of students in bilingual schools with those in non-bilingual schools. The present paper makes use of primary education data from the Department of Education and Research for the Community of Madrid in an effort to analyze whether or not bilingualism results in the relative improvement of educational outcomes achieved in primary schools in the Region of Madrid, in Spain. More specifically, the data used is from sixth grade classrooms, given that, generally speaking, in this grade all schools give a standardized test which measures academic performance in Math, Science and Technology, Spanish Language Arts and English Language Arts. Our assessment makes use of a multinomial logit model, and includes the most common variables found in the research on the determination of educational outcomes (variables related to whether or not schools are bilingual, which is the main focus of this paper), as well as other less common variables considered to be relevant. These include absenteeism, satisfaction levels among families and students, and the percentage of students in second chance programs. The results show that bilingualism does not lower children performance in the subjects taught in English or in the subjects taught in Spanish. Academic performance in Mathematics, Science and Technology, and Spanish Language Arts is similar with respect to those schools which are not bilingual. However, results in English are significantly higher in bilingual schools when compared to non-bilingual schools."
https://openalex.org/W3034745263,"Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the major pathogenic microorganism causing enzootic pneumonia in pigs. With increasing resistance of M. hyopneumoniae to conventional antibiotics, treatment is becoming complicated. Herein, we investigated the mutant selection window (MSW) of doxycycline, tylosin, danofloxacin, tiamulin, and valnemulin for treating the M. hyopneumoniae type strain (ATCC 25934) to determine the likelihood of promoting resistance with continued use of these antibiotics. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against M. hyopneumoniae were determined for each antimicrobial agent based on microdilution broth and agar dilution methods (bacterial numbers ranged from 105 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL to 109 CFU/mL). The minimal concentration inhibiting colony formation by 99% (MIC99) and the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) were determined by the agar dilution method with three inoculum sizes. Antimicrobial killing was determined based on MIC99 and MPC values for all five agents. MIC values ranged from 0.001 to 0.25 μg/mL based on the microdilution broth method, and from 0.008 to 1.0 μg/mL based on the agar dilution method. MPC values ranged from 0.0016 to 10.24 μg/mL. MPC/MIC99 values were ordered tylosin > doxycycline > danofloxacin > tiamulin > valnemulin. MPC achieved better bactericidal action than MIC99. Based on pharmacodynamic analyses, danofloxacin, tylosin, and doxycycline are more likely to select resistant mutants than tiamulin and valnemulin."

A previous study implementing a hand hygiene campaign and antibiotic stewardship program significantly reduced these infections. Sustaining such interventions can be challenging.To evaluate whether there was a sustained effect of a multifaceted infection control and antibiotic stewardship program on HAI and antibiotic use 5 years after it began.A prospective evaluation study was conducted over 26 months (from February 2016 to April 2018) in a teaching hospital in Indonesia, 5 years after the implementation of an antibiotic stewardship and infection control program, which was successful when initially evaluated. All children admitted to the pediatric ICU and pediatric wards were observed daily. Assessment of HAI was made based on the criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Assessment of rational antibiotic use was based on the WHO Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to quantify the relationship between the HAI and the multifaceted intervention.We observed an increase in HAIs, from 8.6% (123/1419 patients) in the initial post-intervention period in 2011-2013 to 16.9% (314/1855) in the evaluation study (relative risk (RR) (95% CI) 1.95 (1.60 to 2.37)). After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that an increase in HAI in the evaluation period with adjusted OR 1.94 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.45). Inappropriate antibiotic use also increased, from 20.6% (182 of 882 patients who were prescribed antibiotics) to 48.6% (545/1855) (RR 2.35 (2.04 to 2.71)). Hand hygiene compliance also declined from 62.9% (1125/1789) observed moments requiring hand hygiene to 51% (1526/2993) (RR 3.33 (2.99 to 3.70)).Healthcare-associated infections and irrational use of antibiotics remain significant even after the implementation of a multifaceted infection control intervention and antibiotic stewardship program.

https://openalex.org/W3034190548,"Purpose To compare quantitative changes in macular parameters in diabetic patients detected by two optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) instruments. Methods 80 phakic eyes were classified as no diabetes, diabetes without diabetic retinopathy (DR), mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and severe NPDR or proliferative DR (PDR). OCTA was performed using devices from two manufacturers (Zeiss and Heidelberg). Superficial and deeper vascular skeleton density (SVSD, DVSD), superficial and deeper vessel area density (SVAD, DVAD), choriocapillaris flow voids (CCFV), and choroidal flow voids (CFV) were calculated. Inter-device comparisons were performed using the size comparison index (SCI) and the discrepancy index (DI). Results The two devices were inconsistent in SVSD, DVSD, DVAD, CCFV and CFV parameters (all P < 0.05). In addition, the SCI was positive for DVAD (all P < 0.001) and negative for SVSD, DVSD, CCFV and CFV in all groups (all P <0.001), except for DVSD in severe NPDR or PDR. The discrepancy index was not significantly different among groups for SVD, SPD, DVD, DPD and CFV (all P> 0.05). The mean DI of CCFV was statistically different between the four groups (P < 0.001). Conclusions The two instruments were largely inconsistent in the measurement of macular parameters relevant to DR. The choice of imaging device can impact OCTA analytics and should be taken into account when drawing conclusions about DR-related changes."

Our present study was designed to assess the potential role of irisin, adiponectin, leptin and gene polymorphism of PNPLA3, leptin and adiponectin as predictive markers of diabetes associated with obesity. One hundred eighty subjects were distributed to three groups including; healthy non-diabetic non obese volunteers as a control group, diabetic non obese group, and diabetic obese group (n = 60 for each group). Fasting blood samples of all groups were collected to determine fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triacylglycerol, irisin, adiponectin, leptin; as well as, polymorphism of PNPLA3, adiponectin and leptin. The results showed that glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, irisin, leptin, LDL-C, triacylglycerol concentrations were significantly increased, however, insulin, HDL-C, adiponectin were significantly decreased in diabetic obese patients in relation to diabetic non-obese patients as well as in healthy volunteers. The polymorphism of PNPLA3 rs738409 was linearly related to irisin and leptin but was not related with circulating concentrations of adiponectin. We concluded that increased irisin and leptin levels can predict the insulin resistance in obese patients. Moreover, patients who have mutant genotype of PNPLA3 I148 gene (rs738409) C>G, ADIPOQ gene (rs266729) G>C and LEP gene (rs2167270) G>A showed a significant higher susceptibility rate for DM in obese people than those with wild type.

https://openalex.org/W3034421477,"The genetic bases of growth and body weight are of economic and scientific interest, and teleost fish models have proven useful in such investigations. The Oryzias latipes species complex (medaka) is an abundant freshwater fish in Japan and suitable for genetic studies. We compared two wild medaka stocks originating from different latitudes. The Maizuru population from higher latitudes weighed more than the Ginoza population. We investigated the genetic basis of body weight, using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the F2 offspring of these populations. We detected one statistically significant QTL for body weight on medaka chromosome 4 and identified 12 candidate genes that might be associated with body weight or growth. Nine of these 12 genes had at least one single nucleotide polymorphism that caused amino acid substitutions in protein-coding regions, and we estimated the effects of these substitutions. The present findings might contribute to the marker-assisted selection of economically important aquaculture species."
https://openalex.org/W3034535472,"The dynamics of infectious diseases propagating in populations depends both on human interaction patterns, the contagion process and the pathogenesis within hosts. The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and, consequently, the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow 24-hour cycles, which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized Chinese cities. By this setup, we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune systems. In most of the scenarios we test, we observe circadian rhythms would constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures (strength, outward transmission risk and introduction risk) are highly correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City, outward transmission risk and introduction risk are correlated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.83, and the risks correlate to strength with coefficients of $-0.85$ and $-0.75$, respectively (all have $p<0.05$), in simulations with no circadian effect and $R_0=1.5$. The relation between the circadian rhythms of the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and extent of infectious disease spreading. Shifting commuting times could mitigate the emergence of outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3034876589,"Erlotinib has potential therapeutic effect on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients, but the mechanism is not clear. Effective tumor biomarkers for erlotinib in the treatment of AML remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that erlotinib in vitro significantly inhibits the growth of the FLT3-ITD mutant AML cell MV4-11 and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cell via targeting FLT3, a certified valid target for the effective treatment of AML. In vivo, oral administration of erlotinib at 100 mg/kg/day induced rapid MV4-11 tumor regression and significantly prolonged the survival time of bone marrow engraftment AML mice via inhibiting the FLT3 signal. Thus, the therapeutic benefits of erlotinib on AML are due to its ability to target FLT3. FLT3-ITD mutation is an effective biomarker for erlotinib during AML treatment. In addition, we also demonstrate that erlotinib inhibits the activity of AML cell KG-1 (no FLT3 expression) by targeting Lyn. Recently, single cell analysis demonstrated that intratumoral heterogeneity are one of the contributors in the relapse and FLT3 inhibitor resistance. Erlotinib could effectively inhibit the MV4-11 cells via targeting FLT3, and inhibit KG-1 cells via targeting Lyn. Therefore, Erlotinib also has the potential to overcome intratumoral heterogeneity via targeting FLT3 and Lyn."

Specifically, this study sought to: (a) identify the factors that influence an IMG’s decision to remain working in RRR areas, and (b) develop a theory, grounded in the data, to explain how these factors are prioritised, evaluated and used to inform a decision to remain working in RRR areas. This study adopted a qualitative approach and employed grounded theory methods. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently, using constant, comparative analysis, guided by theoretical sampling and data saturation. Data sources were transcripts from semi-structured interviews with IMG registrars (n = 20) and supervisors (n = 5), interviewers’ notes and analytic memos. Interviewees were all currently working in RRR areas of Queensland, Australia. The analysis involved a three-phase coding process, progressing from specific, inductive coding to abstract, abductive coding. The analysis revealed that the IMG decision-making process involves a complex, dynamic, and iterative process of balancing life goals based on life stage. Many factors are considered when assessing the balance of three main life goals: satisfaction with work, family, and lifestyle. The prioritisation and balance of these life goals can vary as the IMG moves through varying work-, family-, and age-related life stages. It is hoped that having this understanding of the complexity of the IMG decision-making process, will better equip medical educators, policy makers and support service providers to tailor services to encourage IMGs to continue practising in these regions."

After a critical period, a state of chronic denervation develops as repair Schwann cells lose their pro-regenerative properties and inhibitory factors such as CSPGs accumulate in the denervated nerve. In rats with ventral root avulsion injuries, we combined timed GDNF gene therapy delivered to the proximal nerve roots with the digestion of inhibitory CSPGs in the distal denervated nerve using sustained lentiviral-mediated chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) enzyme expression. Following reimplantation of lumbar ventral roots, timed GDNF-gene therapy enhanced motoneuron survival up to 45 weeks and improved axonal outgrowth, electrophysiological recovery, and muscle reinnervation. Despite a timed GDNF expression period, a subset of animals displayed axonal coils. Lentiviral delivery of ChABC enabled digestion of inhibitory CSPGs for up to 45 weeks in the chronically denervated nerve. ChABC gene therapy alone did not enhance motoneuron survival, but led to improved muscle reinnervation and modest electrophysiological recovery during later stages of the regeneration process. Combining GDNF treatment with digestion of inhibitory CSPGs did not have a significant synergistic effect. This study suggests a delicate balance exists between treatment duration and concentration in order to achieve therapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3034658123,"Introduction In Catalonia caesarean rates have always been analysed as a single percentage. The objective is to estimate caesarean section rates using the Robson classification in publicly funded hospitals in Catalonia between 2013 and 2017, considering sociodemographic, institutional and obstetric characteristics. Materials and methods Cross-sectional population-based study in Catalonia including all women delivering within publicly funded hospitals between 2013–2017 (n = 210 020). The modified Robson classification distribution was estimated, the caesarean rate and the overall contribution, analysed for each year, and by confounders, through logistic regression models. Results CS rates decreased steadily between 2013 and 2017 in Catalonia within publicly funded hospitals from 24.3% to 22.8% (cOR 0.92, 95% CI; 0.89 to 0.95). Once adjusted for changes in sociodemographic, institutional and obstetric characteristics the observed decline was even more pronounced (aOR 0.87, 95% CI; 0.84 to 0.90). Within the different groups of Robson once adjusted for confounders, groups 1+2 (aOR 0.88, 95% CI; 0.83 to 0.93), 3+4 (aOR 0.83, 95% CI; 0.78 to 0.89) and 10 (aOR 0.78, 95% CI; 0.68 to 0.90) presented a reduction in caesarean section rates, whereas group 5 showed no significant decrease (aOR 0.95, 95% CI; 0.87 to 1.03%). Conclusions The decrease in caesarean section rates in Catalonia is more pronounced when adjusted for known confounders, suggesting retrospective overutilization of caesarean section and percentages of (in)adequacy in the past. In any case, it remains above the recommended by experts. Further efforts should be made to achieve optimum rates, including improvement on obstetric data collection"

This study aimed to real-time dynamic radiation dose measurement to estimate lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence and mortality in operators. Coronary angiography (CA) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CA, and others (radiofrequency ablation, pacemaker and defibrillator implantation) procedures with different beam directions, were undertaken on x-ray angiography system. A real-time electronic personal dosimeter (EPD) system was used to measure the radiation dose of staff during all procedures. We followed the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VII report to estimate the LAR of all cancer incidence and mortality. Primary operators received radiation dose in CA with PCI, CA, and others procedures were 59.33 ± 95.03 μSv, 39.81 ± 103.85 μSv, and 21.92 ± 37.04 μSv, respectively. As to the assistant operators were 30.03 ± 55.67 μSv, 14.67 ± 14.88 μSv, and 4 μSv, respectively. LAR of all cancer incidences for staffs aged from 18 to 65 are varied from 0.40% for males to 1.50% for females. LAR of all cancer mortality for staffs aged from 18 to 65 are varied from 0.22% for males to 0.83% for females. Our study provided an easy, real-time and dynamic radiation dose measurement to estimate LAR of cancer for staff during the cardiac catheterization procedures. The LAR for all cancer incidence is about twice that for cancer mortality. Although the radiation doses of staff are lower during each procedure, the increased years of service leads to greater radiation risk to the staff."
https://openalex.org/W3034827054,"Changes in parasite communities might result in new host-parasite dynamics and may threaten local fish populations. This phenomenon has been suggested for acanthocephalan parasites in the river Rhine and Danube where the species Pomphorhynchus tereticollis is becoming replaced by the Ponto-Caspian P. laevis. Developing knowledge on morphologic, genetic and behavioural differences between such species is important to follow such changes. However, disagreements on the current phylogeny of these two acanthocephalan species are producing conflicts that is affecting their correct identification. This study is offering a clearer morphological and genetic distinction between these two species. As P. tereticollis is found in rhithral tributaries of the Rhine, it was questioned whether the local salmonid populations were hosts for this species and whether P. laevis was expanding into the Rhine watershed as well. In order to test for this, brown trout, Salmo trutta, and grayling, Thymallus thymallus from South-Western Germany watersheds have been samples and screened for the occurrence of acanthocephalan parasites. For the first time, both species were confirmed to be hosts for P. tereticollis in continental Europe. P. tereticollis was found to be common, whereas P. leavis was found only at a single location in the Danube. This pattern suggest either that the expansion of P. laevis through salmonid hosts into rhithral rivers has not yet occurred, or that not yet ascertained biotic or abiotic features of rhithral rivers hinder P. laevis to spread into these areas."

On the other hand, for the deep sequencing method, cases with double substitutions in the tandem sequence were detected in 8/14 non-responders and 1/42 responders (p<0.0001). For the conventional method, substitutions were detected at any position in 6/14 non-responders and 2/42 responders (p = 0.0019), with a clear difference between the two groups. The difference was also clear with the deep sequencing method, with 11/14 non-responders and 8/42 responders. Interestingly, for the deep sequencing method, the single substitution of L31 was found in 6/14 non-responders and 7/42 responders, whereas single substitutions of Y93 or double substitutions were found in 7/14 vs. 1/42 and 8/14 vs. 1/42 patients, respectively.NS5A L31 and Y93 substitutions were detected in tandem by the deep sequencing methods in several genotype 1 patients, who may be more resistant to DAA treatment containing an NS5A inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W3035465922,"Recent studies suggest that a large proportion of new HIV-1 infections in mature epidemics occurs within discordant couples, making discordancy a major contributor to the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa. This paper aims at assessing changes over a five-year period (2009–2015) on the (risk) factors associated with HIV serodiscordance among couples in Mozambique, using cross-sectional data from the INSIDA and IMASIDA surveys. The pooled data of both surveys were analyzed using a joint model for three parameters characterizing in a particular way disagreement and sero(con/dis)corance between the HIV statuses of couples, as introduced by Aerts et al.: the probability that the female partner is HIV positive, given that both partners differ in their HIV status, the probability that only one partner is HIV positive, given that at least one of the two partners is positive (“positive” serodiscordance), and the probability that both partners are negative given that at most one of the two partners is positive (“negative” seroconcordance). The results reveal similar significant factors and estimates as in Aerts et al. (HIV prevalence, union number for woman, STI for man, condom use by woman and wealth index), but the additional significant factors “condom use by man” (no use had a negative effect on the positive serodiscordance) and “union number for man” (for couples where the man has been married or co-habiting with a woman before had a decreased negative seroconcordance) were identified. The only factor that had a different effect over time (IMASIDA as compared to INSIDA) was the effect of “HIV prevalence of province” on the negative seroconcordance. The negative effect of a higher HIV prevalence was less pronounced in 2015 for negative seroconcordance."

We find that the electronic band gap varies within 0.3 eV, and that this magnitude, the binding energy, and the geometry are not significantly correlated. A clearly favoured structure is found with a binding energy of 1.75±0.07 eV, with all but three other arrangements displaying values of less than one third of this highest binding one, which involves the aliphatic chain of 4TIC."
