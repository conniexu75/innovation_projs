https://openalex.org/W1598202087,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an inflammatory mediator that stimulates neutrophil migration and functional activation. Analogs of human IL-8 were chemically synthesized, purified, and compared with the full-length 72-residue synthetic IL-8 for their ability to stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis and exocytosis as measured by assaying for release of elastase, as well as their binding to specific receptors in competition assays. Analogs corresponding to the less abundant natural forms, 3-72, 4-72, and 77-residue IL-8, were evaluated and the 3-72 and 4-72 had 2-5-fold higher potencies, whereas the 77-residue IL-8 was 2-fold less potent. A major finding was that NH2-terminal residues 4, 5, and 6 were absolutely essential for IL-8 activity and receptor binding. Quantitative dissociation of elastase release and chemotaxis activity was detected with 5-72, which compared with 1-72, was 80-fold less potent in the elastase assay, but was only slightly less potent in stimulating chemotaxis. IL-8 6-72 lacked all the biological activities tested but had detectable receptor binding activity. The NH2-terminal peptide, AVLPRSAKEL, lacked activity and receptor binding, suggesting that the NH2-terminal region alone is not sufficient for function. Comparison of analogs shortened at the COOH terminus showed that potency was progressively reduced as the COOH-terminal residues were excluded. However activity was retained in an analog (1-51) with the entire COOH-terminal alpha helix and beta turn missing. A peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 22 residues, although inactive alone, synergized with the 1-51 analog in stimulating elastase release. The results suggest that the NH2-terminal residues 4, 5, and 6, which are disordered in the IL-8 solution structure, are directly involved in receptor binding, but the COOH-terminal alpha helix is probably important for stabilizing the three-dimensional structure. Other regions within residues 7-51 are also functionally important."
https://openalex.org/W1501588760,"A heparan sulfate proteoglycan is a component of all basement membranes. This molecule consists of three heparan sulfate side chains linked to a large core protein of approximately 400 kDa. We have isolated seven overlapping murine cDNA clones that encode the entire mRNA sequence of 12.685 kilobases of this molecule. This sequence has a single open reading frame of 3,707 amino acids that encodes for a protein of 396 kDa. Identical or near identical matchups with nine peptide sequences derived from the core protein of the molecule isolated from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor were found with the deduced sequence. Sequence analysis and data base comparison of the deduced sequence show the protein to consist of five different domains, most of which contain internal repeats. Domain I contains a start methionine followed by a typical signal transfer sequence and a unique segment of 172 amino acids that contains the three probable sites of heparan sulfate attachment, SGD. Domain II contains four cysteine- and acidic amino acid-rich repeats that are very similar to those found in the LDL receptor and proteins such as GP330. Domain III consists of cysteine-rich and globular regions, both of which show similarity to those in the short arm of the laminin A chain. Domain IV contains 14 repeats of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are most highly similar to the immunoglobulin-like repeats in the neural cell adhesion molecule. Domain V contains three repeats with similarity to the laminin A chain G domain that are separated by epidermal growth factor-like regions not found in the laminin A chain. As the primary structural data agree with the appearance of the molecule in the electron microscope as a series of globules separated by rods, or beads on a string, we have adopted the name perlecan for this molecule. The variety of domains in perlecan suggest multiple interactions with other molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1489573122,"Regulation of the human type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) promoter by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) was studied. An 800-base pair fragment from the PAI-1 promoter and 5'-flanking region was fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene and transfected into Hep3B human hepatoma cells. Treatment of the cells with TGF beta induced luciferase activity by more than 50-fold. Transfection studies using constructs with 5' or 3' deletions through this region revealed that two sequences were important in the TGF beta response. The first sequence was located in the proximal promoter (-49 to -87) and mediated an 11-fold induction with TGF beta, while the second more distal region (-636 to -740) contained two sequences which together mediated a 50-fold or greater response. Sequence comparison indicated that both of the responsive regions contained sequences with high homology to the AP-1 consensus binding site. Moreover, gel retardation analysis experiments demonstrated that both sequences bound a common nuclear protein, and that an oligonucleotide containing a consensus AP-1 sequence was able to compete for the binding of this common protein. Thus, the response of the PAI-1 gene to TGF beta is mediated by at least two separate regions, and both of these regions contain DNA sequences homologous to the AP-1 binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2120381920,"Abstract The present study characterized the regulation of the genetic expression of the vasoactive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) by insulin in bovine aortic endothelial cells. By RNA blot analysis, insulin (1.67 x 10(-8) M) increased ET-1 mRNA levels by 2.3-fold over the basal within 10 min and attained a maximum (5.3-fold increase) in 2 h. Dose-response studies showed that a maximum effect of insulin was reached at 1.67 x 10(-8) M although a significant increase can be observed at 1.66 x 10(-9) M. Radioligand receptor studies indicated that the affinity constant for insulin receptors on endothelial cells correlated closely with the dose response observed for ET-1 mRNA. The ET-1 mRNA half-life was estimated with actinomycin D studies to be 20 min in control cells and was not affected by insulin treatment. Moreover, the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and insulin were additive in the induction of ET-1 gene expression. When protein kinase C in the bovine aortic endothelial cells was down-regulated by preincubation with 8 x 10(-7) M PMA for 24 or 48 h, insulin was still able to increase ET-1 mRNA levels whereas PMA was ineffective. Using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion plasmid containing the CAT gene and the 5'-flanking region of the ET-1 gene (Lee, M. E., Bloch, K. D., Clifford, J. A., and Quertermous, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10446-10450), we observed that 1.67 x 10(-8) M insulin increased CAT enzyme activity and mRNA levels. The insulin dose-response curve observed for CAT activity correlated with that observed for ET-1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that insulin stimulates expression of the ET-1 gene at the transcriptional level via its own receptors. This effect is mediated mostly through a protein kinase C-independent pathway, suggesting the existence of an insulin-responsive element in the ET-1 gene 5'-flanking sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1604651284,"Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone that stimulates the maturation of late erythroid progenitor cells. It has three N-linked and one O-linked carbohydrates which play an important role in the biosynthesis and biological activities of the protein. To determine the role the carbohydrate might have in maintaining the conformational stability of the protein, the protein expressed in mammalian cells (fully glycosylated), the asialo mammalian-expressed protein, and the protein expressed in Escherichia coli (no carbohydrate) were compared for their stability to guanidine HCl, pH, and temperature. Circular dichroism was used to follow protein unfolding. Both the intact and asialo mammalian-expressed proteins unfolded with a cooperative transition in guanidine HCl, with a midpoint at 1.75 M guanidine HCl. The E. coli-expressed material unfolded with a midpoint of 1.2 M guanidine HCl, and a delta G of unfolding which was 1.4 kcal/mol less than that of the two glycosylated molecules. The E. coli-derived protein was also significantly less stable to pH-induced conformational changes, showing a cooperative transition in 35% glycerol with a midpoint at pH 4.4, while both the intact and asialo mammalian-expressed molecules had a transition midpoint of pH 3.75 in the absence of glycerol, and approximately pH 3 in the presence of 35% glycerol. The E. coli-expressed molecule unfolded and precipitated upon heating to 44 degrees C, while the asialo and intact mammalian-expressed proteins remained soluble, with a Tm of 56 degrees C. From these experiments, the carbohydrate appears to play a critical role in stabilizing the erythropoietin molecule to denaturing conditions, and this increased stability does not depend on the presence of sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1540724623,"The genes encoding mouse and human acetylcholinesterases have been cloned from genomic and cosmid libraries. Restriction analysis and a comparison of sequence with the cDNAs have defined the exon-intron boundaries. In mammals, three invariant exons encode the signal peptide and the amino-terminal 535 amino acids common to all forms of the enzyme whereas alternative exon usage of the next exon accounts for the structural divergence in the carboxyl termini of the catalytic subunits. mRNA protection studies show that the cDNA encoding the hydrophilic catalytic subunits represents the dominant mRNA species in mammalian brain and muscle whereas divergent mRNA species are evident in cells of hematopoietic origin (bone marrow cells and a erythroleukemia cell line). Analyses of mRNA species in these cells and the genomic sequence have enabled us to define two alternative exons in addition to the one found in the cDNAs; they encode unique carboxyl-terminal sequences. One mRNA consists of a direct extension through the intervening sequence between the common exon and the 3' exon deduced from the cDNA. This sequence encodes a subunit lacking the cysteine critical to oligomer formation. Another mRNA results from a splice that encodes a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids immediately upstream of a stop codon. This exon, when spliced to the upstream invariant exons, should encode glycophospholipid-linked species of the enzyme. Homologous sequence, identity of exon-intron junctions, and identity of position of the stop codon are seen for this region in mouse and human. Polymerase chain reactions carried out across the expected intron region and mRNA protection studies show that this splice occurs in mouse bone marrow and erythroleukemia cells yielding the appropriate cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1540876124,"Cyclophilin (CyP), a major cytosolic protein possessing peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, has been implicated as the specific receptor of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). To identify other potential CsA receptors related to CyP, two human cDNA libraries were screened under low stringency conditions using human CyP cDNA (encoding hCyP1) as a probe. Two cDNAs were identified which encode distinct proteins related to human hCyP1. These two novel proteins, designated hCyP2 and hCyP3, share 65 and 76% amino acid sequence homology with hCyP1, respectively. Both hCyP2 and hCyP3 contain NH2-terminal hydrophobic extensions of 32 and 42 amino acids, respectively. Protein-specific antibodies revealed the predominant association of hCyP2 and hCyP3 with membranes and subcellular organelles, which suggests that the amino-terminal leader sequences of the two CyP isoforms may act as signal peptides. In contrast to the results with hCyP1, Southern blot analysis indicated that both hCyP2 and hCyP3 gene sequences are represented infrequently in the human genome. Northern and Western blot analysis showed that the distribution of mRNA and proteins of the three hCyPs in differing tissues and cell types was similar. Each hCyP protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and shown to be an active peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Substrate specificity was examined with 11 synthetic peptides (Suc-Xaa-Yaa-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide), and inhibition of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activities associated with hCyP1, hCyP2, and hCyP3 was studied with CsA, MeAla6-CsA and MeBm2t1-CsA. From both equilibrium considerations and the results of kinetic characterizations it is proposed that of these three CyP proteins, hCyP1 is the most likely intracellular target for CsA."
https://openalex.org/W1505318371,"The transcription factors GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 were found to be expressed in several mouse and rat mast cell lines that contain mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) and other proteases in their cytoplasmic granules. GATA-1 mRNA was not detected in P815 cells, an immature mouse mastocytoma-derived cell line that lacks electron-dense granules and has low levels of secretory granule proteases. Because the 5'-flanking regions of the mouse and human MC-CPA genes contained a conserved GATA-binding motif 51 base pairs upstream of their translation initiation sites, the ability of GATA-binding proteins to regulate the promoter activity of the MC-CPA gene was examined in rat basophilic leukemia cells, mouse P815 cells, and transfected mouse P815 cells that expressed GATA-1. In all three mast cell lines, the promoter activity of the MC-CPA gene depended on the GATA binding site. GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 are thus the first DNA-binding proteins identified in mast cells which regulate the promoter activity of a gene that encodes a secretory granule protease."
https://openalex.org/W1495117474,"The structures and hemolytic and bactericidal activities of three bombinin-like peptides, or BLP-1-3, from the skin of Bombina orientalis are described. The peptides were isolated from the skin of B. orientalis and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and are amphipathic, cationic peptides of 25-27 amino acids in length. The sequence of the most abundant member (BLP-1) is: Gly-Ile-Gly-Ala-Ser-Ile-Leu-Ser-Ala-Gly-Lys-Ser-Ala-Leu-Lys-Gly-Leu- Ala-Lys-Gly-Leu-Ala-Glu-His-Phe-Ala-Asn-NH2. All three peptides were found to share considerable, but not complete, homology with bombinin, an antimicrobial, hemolytic peptide first isolated by Michl and Csordas (Csordas, A., and Michl, A. (1970) Monatsh. Chem. 101, 182-189) from the skin of Bombina variegata. The BLPs have been assayed for antibiotic and hemolytic activity and found to be more potent than magainin 2 (a related antimicrobial peptide from Xenopus laevis) in their ability to kill bacteria. However, no significant hemolytic activity was found for these peptides which suggests a selectivity for prokaryotic over eukaryotic membranes. The molecular basis for antibacterial activity is presumed to be due to their predicted amphipathic alpha-helical structures which is supported by circular dichroism measurements that found significant helical content (63-69% alpha-helix) in 40% trifluoroethanol. Last, a cDNA library was constructed from the skin of B. orientalis and screened with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the COOH terminus of BLP-1. Several clones were isolated and sequenced that encode BLP-1 and BLP-3, as well as an additional peptide (BLP-4) that differs by two amino acid substitutions from BLP-3."
https://openalex.org/W1560734798,"Saccharomyces SUC2 invertase, secreted by the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity from the growth medium by DE-52 chromatography, appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a diffuse ladder of species at 85-90 kDa, while the secreted Saccharomyces form migrated as a broad band from 100 to 150 kDa. Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H released the Pichia invertase carbohydrate generating a 60-kDa protein with residual Asn-linked GlcNAcs and oligosaccharides separated on Bio-Gel P-4 into Man8-11GlcNAc. Nearly 75% of the oligosaccharides were equally distributed between Man8,9GlcNAc, while 17% were Man10GlcNAc and 8% were Man11GlcNAc. Oligosaccharide pools were analyzed for homogeneity by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography, and structures were assigned using 500 MHz one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. Pichia Man8GlcNAc was the same isomer as found in Saccharomyces, which arises by removing the alpha 1,2-linked terminal mannose from the middle arm of the lipid-oligosaccharide Man9GlcNAc (Byrd, J. C., Tarentino, A. L., Maley, F., Atkinson, P. H., and Trimble, R. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14657-14666). The Man9GlcNAc pool was 5% lipid-oligosaccharide precursor and 95% Man8GlcNAc isomer with a terminal alpha 1,6-linked mannose on the lower-arm alpha 1,3-core-linked residue (Hernandez, L. M., Ballou, L., Alvarado, E., Gillece-Castro, B. L., Burlingame, A. L., and Ballou, C. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11849-11856). An alpha 1,2-linked mannose on the new alpha 1,6-linked branch in Man9GlcNAc provided 80% of the Man10GlcNAc, which is the structure on Saccharomyces invertase (Trimble, R. B., and Atkinson, P. H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9815-9824). A minor Man10GlcNAc (12%) and the principal Man11GlcNAc (82%) were the major Man9,10GlcNAc with novel alpha 1,2-linked mannoses on the preexisting alpha 1,2-linked termini. Although Pichia glycans did not have terminal alpha 1,3-linked mannoses as found on Saccharomyces core oligosaccharides, over 60% of the structures were isometric configurations unique to lower eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1581684397,"The condensing peptide forming multienzyme of gramicidin S synthetase (gramicidin S synthetase 2) was specifically labeled at its putative thiotemplate sites for L-valine and L-leucine by covalent incorporation of the 14C-labeled substrate amino acids. The thioester complexes of the multienzyme were digested with CNBr, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and pepsin. Reaction center peptides containing the [14C]valine and [14C]leucine labels were isolated in pure form. They show a high degree of sequence similarity and contain the same consensus sequence LGGH/DXL. The labels were eliminated in the first Edman degradation step. A dehydroalanine was identified which can originate from either a cysteine or a serine. The comparison of the chemical results with the deduced amino acid sequence of the grsB gene encoding the gramicidin S synthetase 2 revealed that 4 such motifs are located within the gene structure, each of them being localized in the 3'-terminal region of one of 4 gene segments grsB1-B4. They have a size of approximately 2 kilobases and presumably code for the 4 amino acid activating domains of the synthetase. Surprisingly a serine was found at each putative substrate amino acid-binding position instead of a cysteine as postulated by the thiotemplate mechanism. Therefore the data suggest that active serine residues are involved in nonribosomal peptide syntheses of microbial peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1484023808,"The effects of phorbol ester (TPA) and other known stimulators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1, and lipopolysaccharide on induction of mRNA for manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) were investigated in various cell lines. TPA enhanced Mn-SOD mRNA expression in TNF-resistant cell lines including HeLa cells, in which the other reagents also induced expression of the gene, but did not affect TNF-sensitive cells, in which the other stimulators did not alter expression of the gene. HeLa cells which had been desensitized to TPA by pretreatment with TPA for 24 h expressed Mn-SOD mRNA at a slightly higher level than the cells without TPA treatment. TPA-pretreated cells stimulated with TNF, however, expressed Mn-SOD mRNA at about twice the level of TNF-stimulated, TPA-untreated cells. When protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide during TPA pretreatment, TNF no more enhanced the Mn-SOD mRNA accumulation. These data suggest that at least two separate signal-transducing pathways are involved in expression of this gene. One is triggered by protein kinase C activation itself in the absence of new protein synthesis. The other can be activated by stimulation with TNF, interleukin-1, or lipopolysaccharide and in which a protein factor that can be induced by TPA treatment is involved."
https://openalex.org/W1582699060,"The isolated perfused rat pancreas was used to test the hypothesis that total cellular ATP or the ratio of ATP/free ADP plays the primary role in coupling intermediary metabolism to the biophysical events that are the basis of glucose-stimulated insulin release. The pancreas was preperfused for 20 min with 4.0 mM of a physiological mixture of 20 amino acids plus 4.2 mM glucose, and insulin release was then stimulated for 150 s by suddenly increasing the glucose to 8.3 mM. The pancreas was sampled at 24, 48, 72, and 150 s after the switch. The content of total ATP, ADP, AMP, Pi, phosphocreatine, and creatine were measured in beta-cell enriched cores of pancreatic islets microdissected from freeze-dried pancreas cryostat sections. Metabolites were measured by quantitative histochemical enzymatic cycling techniques. Modeling studies were carried out to assess the impact of biochemical analytical results on the membrane potential of the beta-cells. The level of free ADP was calculated using the creatine kinase equilibrium reaction and an intracellular pH of 7.2. First phase insulin release was stimulated at least 10-fold with the maximum reached 45 s after adding high glucose. The biochemical analytical data demonstrate that the total cellular level of the putative coupling factor ATP and of the ratios ATP/free ADP and ATP/free ADP x Pi are not significantly influenced by a glucose level change that causes a more than 10-fold surge of insulin release. The strength and limitations of the present experimental strategy and the implications of the results for our understanding of metabolic coupling in glucose-stimulated insulin release are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1949348922,"The macrophage scavenger receptor, a 220-kDa trimeric membrane glycoprotein, mediates the internalization of modified forms of low density lipoprotein (LDL) such as acetyl-LDL and oxidized-LDL and thus is likely to play a key role in atheroma macrophage foam cell formation. In addition, recent evidence suggests that the scavenger receptor may be an important macrophage binding site for lipopolysaccharide involved in lipopolysaccharide scavenging by macrophages. However, little is known about the regulation of this important receptor. We now report that the induction of scavenger receptor activity (as measured by acetyl-LDL stimulation of intracellular cholesterol esterification) seen in phorbol ester-differentiated THP-1 human macrophages was completely suppressed to the level seen in undifferentiated THP-1 monocytes by picomolar concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). 125I-Acetyl-LDL degradation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by TGF-beta 1, with maximal inhibition (approximately 70%) occurring at 24 pM TGF-beta 1. Scatchard analysis revealed that TGF-beta 1 treatment resulted in a approximately 2-fold decrease in receptor number, and Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from differentiated THP-1 macrophages demonstrated approximately 2-fold less scavenger receptor mRNA in TGF-beta 1-treated cells compared with that in macrophages not treated with TGF-beta 1. Since TGF-beta 1 is thought to be present in both atherosclerotic and inflammatory lesions, the above findings may have physiological relevance regarding the regulation of atheroma foam cell formation and/or the regulation of lipopolysaccharide clearance by macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1594700564,"Two independent approaches were employed to explore the potential role of endogenous glucosylceramide or a closely related glucosphingolipid in mediating the cellular proliferation of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. First, cultured cells were depleted of glucosphingolipids by exposure to a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol. This agent markedly inhibited cell growth and DNA synthesis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Second, cells were grown in the presence of conduritol B epoxide, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide beta-D-glucosidase. Exposure of cells to this inhibitor resulted in the time-dependent accumulation of glucosylceramide with a corresponding increase in cellular proliferation. Alterations in protein kinase C activity were evaluated as a potential mechanism for these effects on growth. Both membrane- and cytosol-associated protein kinase C (PKC) activity declined under conditions of glucosylceramide synthase inhibition and increased under conditions of beta-glucosidase inhibition. The changes in PKC activity were evident after DEAE-cellulose purification. Diacylglycerol levels increased in response to both glucosylceramide synthase and beta-glucosidase inhibition. Ceramide and sphingosine levels changed only in the presence of D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, increasing due to lack of conversion to glucosylceramide. However, the elevation in endogenous sphingosine was probably insufficient to account for the decrease in PKC, considering the high level of diacylglycerol in the cells. These data demonstrate an association between glucosylceramide levels, PKC activity, and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1530680837,"We have recently shown that the immediately submembranous domain of the human insulin receptor (hIR) is required for rapid ligand-dependent internalization (Thies, R. S., Webster, N. J., and McClain, D. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10132-10137). This region contains one copy of an NPXY sequence that is required for endocytosis of the low density lipoprotein receptor. In order to dissect and analyze the specific sequences involved in endocytosis of the insulin receptor, we have mutated the NPXY sequence from NPEY (residues 957-960) to APEA (NPEY/APEA). In addition, we have mutated a similar sequence in the same region, changing GPLY (residues 950-953) to APLA (GPLY/APLA). The cDNAs encoding the normal hIR and these mutant receptors were transfected into Rat 1 fibroblasts. The expressed receptors bound insulin with high affinity and retained insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. Despite the ability of these mutant receptors to bind insulin and undergo autophosphorylation, the GPLY/APLA receptor internalized insulin at only 32% of the rate of normal hIR at low receptor occupancy. On the other hand, the NPEY/APEA receptor internalized insulin at 87% of the normal rate. These results were confirmed by measuring internalization of photoaffinity-labeled insulin receptors. Another receptor with both the NPEY/APEA and GPLY/APLA mutations internalized to a lesser degree than the GPLY/APLA receptor and at a rate equivalent to that seen for a receptor with the entire submembranous domain deleted. A receptor with the complete normal submembranous domain but with the tyrosine kinase and C-terminal region of the hIR deleted exhibited only a basal internalization rate. We conclude that the information contained in the GPLY and, to a lesser extent, the NPEY sequences are necessary but not sufficient for signaling internalization of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1659602917,"The gene encoding Candida tropicalis peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme, hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase (HDE), was expressed in both Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular location of HDE was determined by subcellular fractionation followed by Western blot analysis of peroxisomal and cytosolic fractions using antiserum specific for HDE. HDE was found to be exclusively targeted to and imported into peroxisomes in both heterologous expression systems. Deletion and mutational analyses were used to determine the regions within HDE which are essential for its targeting to peroxisomes. Deletion of a carboxyl-terminal tripeptide Ala-Lys-Ile completely abolished targeting of HDE to peroxisomes, whereas large internal deletions of HDE (amino acids 38-353 or 395-731) had no effect on HDE targeting to peroxisomes in either yeast. This tripeptide is similar to, but distinct from, other tripeptide peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTSs) as identified in peroxisomal firefly luciferase and four mammalian peroxisomal proteins. Substitutions within the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide (Ala----Gly and Lys----Gln) supported targeting of HDE to peroxisomes of C. albicans but not of S. cerevisiae. This is the first detailed analysis of the peroxisomal targeting signal in a yeast peroxisomal protein."
https://openalex.org/W1659827168,"Gene 4 of bacteriophage T7 encodes two proteins, a 63-kDa protein and a colinear 56-kDa protein, that are essential for synthesis of leading and lagging strands during DNA replication. The gene 4 proteins together catalyze the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides, pppACC(C/A) or pppACAC, at the single-stranded DNA sequences 3'-CTGG(G/T)-5' or 3'-CTGTG-5', respectively. Purified 56-kDa protein has helicase activity, but no primase activity. In order to study 63-kDa gene 4 protein free of 56-kDa gene 4 protein, mutations were introduced into the internal ribosome-binding site responsible for the translation of the 56-kDa protein. The 63-kDa gene 4 protein was purified 16,000-fold from Escherichia coli cells harboring an expression vector containing the mutated gene 4. Purified 63-kDa gene 4 protein has primase, helicase, and single-stranded DNA-dependent dTTPase activities. The constraints of primase recognition sequences, nucleotide substrate requirements, and the effects of additional proteins on oligoribonucleotide synthesis by the 63-kDa gene 4 protein have been examined using templates of defined sequence. A three-base sequence, 3'-CTG-5', is necessary and sufficient to support the synthesis of pppAC dimers. dTTP hydrolysis is essential for oligoribonucleotide synthesis. Addition of a 7-fold molar excess of 56-kDa gene 4 protein to 63-kDa protein increases the number of oligoribonucleotides synthesized by 63-kDa protein 100-fold. The increase in oligonucleotides results predominantly from an increase in the synthesis of tetramers, with relatively little change in the synthesis of dimers and trimers. The presence of 56-kDa protein also causes 63-kDa protein to synthesize pseudo-templated pppACCCC pentamers at the recognition sequence 3'-CTGGG-5'. T7 gene 2.5 protein, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, increases the total number of oligoribonucleotides synthesized by 63-kDa gene 4 protein on single-stranded M13 DNA, but has no effect on the ratio of dimers to trimers and tetramers."
https://openalex.org/W1586837785,"Quantitative changes in the total mass and the molecular species of 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) formed upon muscarinic receptor activation were studied in cultured human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. DAG was isolated from the total lipid extracts of carbachol (CCh)-stimulated and unstimulated cells and after benzoylation, was subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to separate the component species. The molecular species of DAG were identified by analyzing the fatty acid composition of each separated fraction by gas chromatography, and their total and individual masses were quantified from the known amount of an internal standard, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol, added during the extraction of the lipid. Relatively high basal levels of DAG (1.5 nmol/mg protein) are present in these cells, and addition of CCh elicited a 50-60% increase in the total amounts of DAG within 5 min. The increase was biphasic: an initial major peak at 5 min was followed by a sustained increase that persisted for at least 30 min. An increase in DAG was elicited by both full and partial muscarinic agonists and was blocked by atropine. The presence of extracellular Ca2+ was necessary for muscarinic receptor-activated formation of DAG. To determine the source of the DAG, the molecular species of the major phospholipids present in SK-N-SH cells were also analyzed. The phospholipids were first enzymatically hydrolyzed to DAGs which were then analyzed as described above. A number of unusual fatty acids, the major one being 20:3 (n-9), were present in these lipids especially in the phosphoinositides and also in the DAG formed after CCh stimulation. Within 5 s of CCh stimulation there were transient increases in the DAG species representative of phosphoinositides. By 5 min the newly formed molecular species of DAG resembled a mixture of phosphoinositides and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Quantitative comparison of the molecular species compositions of phosphoinositides, PC, and newly formed DAGs indicated that at time periods up to 10 min, approximately 30% of the DAG originated from the phosphoinositides and the rest from PC. At longer intervals (greater than 20 min), most (85%) of DAGs originated from PC. Activation of muscarinic receptors in SK-N-SH cells also elicited an increase in PA (200% in 5 min). A quantitative molecular species analysis, using 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol-3-P as internal standard, was performed by enzymatic (alkaline phosphatase) hydrolysis of PA to DAG and subsequent analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1530687490,"Abstract Bacterial denitrification reverses nitrogen fixation in the global N-cycle by transforming nitrate or nitrite to dinitrogen. Both nitrite and nitric oxide (NO) are considered as the chemical species within the denitrification pathway, that precede nitrous oxide (N2O), the first recognized intermediate with N,N-bonds antecedent to N2. Molecular cloning of the structural genes for NO reductase from Pseudomonas stutzeri has allowed us to generate the first mutants defective in NO utilization (Nor- phenotype) by marker exchange of the norCB genes with a gene cassette for gentamicin resistance. Nitric oxide reductase was found to be an indispensable component for denitrification; its loss constituted a conditionally lethal mutation. NO as the sole product accumulated from nitrite by mutant cells induced for nitrite respiration (denitrification). The Nor- mutant lost the capability to reduce NO and did not grow anymore anaerobically on nitrate. A Nir-Nor- double mutation, that inactivated also the respiratory nitrite reductase cytochrome cd1 rendered the bacterium again viable under anaerobiosis. Our observations provide evidence for a denitrification pathway in vivo of NO2(-)----NO----N2O, and N,N-bond formation catalyzed by NO reductase and not by cytochrome cd1."
https://openalex.org/W1595269757,"The structure of the copper sites in oxidized and reduced dopamine beta-hydroxylase has been studied by extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy using a restrained refinement approach to data analysis. An histidine-rich active site has been found to be present with an average histidine coordination of between two and three histidine ligands per copper. In the oxidized protein, the data support four-coordination, involving two to three imidazole groups at 1.99 A with additional ligands derived from water or exogenous O-donor groups at an average distance of 1.94 A. Studies on the reduced enzyme have focused on resolving the controversy in the literature (Scott, R. A., Sullivan, R. J., De Wolfe, W. E., Dolle, R. E., and Kruse, L. I. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 5411-5417; Blumberg, W. E., Desai, P. R., Powers, L., Freedman, J. H., and Villafranca, J. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6029-6032) as to whether a S/Cl scatterer is a ligand to Cu(I). Five independent samples of reduced enzyme prepared under conditions designed to probe the Cu(I) ligand environment have been measured and analyzed. All five samples gave identical spectra and could be simulated by two to three imidazoles (1.93 A) and 0.5 S/Cl (2.25 A) per Cu(I). The spectra were insensitive to the presence of added bromide or to exclusion of chloride during preparation. The results establish that the heavy atom scatterer is derived from a sulfur donor. Some evidence was found for an additional O/N scatterer at 2.6 A in the reduced enzyme. A hypothesis for the structure of the copper sites has been proposed involving inequivalent CuA(His)3(H2O)...CuB-(His)2X(H2O) coordination in the oxidized enzyme, which upon reduction loses coordinated water and coordinates a sulfur probably from a methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1518104214,"We have used radio-high pressure liquid chromatography to study the acyl-CoA ester intermediates and the acylcarnitines formed during mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. During oxidation of [U-14C]hexadecanoate by normal human fibroblast mitochondria, only the saturated acyl-CoA and acylcarnitine esters can be detected, supporting the concept that the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase step is rate-limiting in mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Incubations of fibroblast mitochondria from patients with defects of beta-oxidation show an entirely different profile of intermediates. Mitochondria from patients with defects in electron transfer flavoprotein and electron transfer flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxido-reductase are associated with slow flux through beta-oxidation and accumulation of long chain acyl-CoA and acylcarnitine esters. Increased amounts of saturated medium chain acyl-CoA and acylcarnitine esters are detected in the incubations of mitochondria with medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, whereas long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is associated with accumulation of long chain 3-hydroxyacyl- and 2-enoyl-CoA and carnitine esters. These studies show that the control strength at the site of the defective enzyme has increased. Radio-high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of intermediates of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is an important new technique to study the control, organization and defects of the enzymes of beta-oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1635144243,"Regulation of free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the rod outer segments (ROS) isolated from bovine retinas was examined with the fluorescent Ca(2+)-indicating dye fluo-3. In situ calibration of cytosolic fluo-3 was done in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and yielded a dissociation constant of 500 nM for the Ca(2+)-fluo-3 complex. Ca2+ influx in Ca(2+)-depleted ROS was completely abolished when internal Na+ was removed suggesting that Ca2+ influx exclusively occurred via Na-Ca-K exchange. The most striking observation was that Na-Ca-K exchange could mediate a rapid increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ over the most of the usable indicating range of fluo-3 (from 10 nM to 2 microM), even when exposed to free external Ca2+ concentrations as low as 10 nM. From a comparison between changes in free Ca2+ and changes in total Ca2+, we conclude that physiologically occurring changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ are mediated by exchange fluxes less than 1% of the maximal Na-Ca-K exchange flux. The Na-Ca-K exchanger could mediate both K(+)-dependent and K(+)-independent Ca2+ influx; Li+ caused a complete inhibition of K(+)-independent Ca2+ influx, but had no effect on K(+)-dependent Ca2+ influx. We examined the complex interactions of alkali cations with Ca2+ influx and discuss the results in terms of a three-site model for the Na-Ca-K exchanger (Schnetkamp, P. P. M. and Szerencsei, R. T. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 189-197). Ca2+ competed with one Mg2+ ion or two Na+ ions for binding to a common site. High K+ concentration greatly diminished the ability of Na+ and Mg2+ to compete with Ca2+ for this common site on the exchanger protein. As a result, high internal K+ induced a conformation of the exchange protein that kinetically favoured Ca2+ extrusion."

(1990) Nature 343, 771-774) is used to explain the possible structural effects of the amino acid mutations identified to date in the human lipoprotein and hepatic lipase genes. A sequence homology profile was used to evaluate the alignment of the amino acid sequences of all three lipolytic enzymes (Kirchgessner, T. G., Chuat, J.-C., Heinzmann, C., Etienne, J., Guilhot, S., Svenson, K., Ameis, D., Pilon, C., D'Auriol, L., Andalibi, A., Schotz, M. C., Galibert, F., and Lusis, A. J. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 9647-9651) with respect to the secondary structure elements identified in the pancreatic lipase. As expected, maximum homology is observed in internal regions namely the hydrophobic strands of the central beta-pleated sheet. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that all three molecules exhibit a very similar three-dimensional structure, particularly in the N-terminal catalytic domain. There is considerable variation in some of the surface loops connecting the individual strands, whereas others are conserved. It is hypothesized that the most conserved loops located around the active site are responsible for the catalytic function (similar for all three enzymes), whereas those that markedly differ are involved in the regulation at the molecular level, namely the binding of colipase (pancreatic enzyme) and apolipoprotein CII (lipoprotein lipase). The currently available library of hepatic and lipoprotein gene mutations seems to indicate that the majority of mutants disrupt the folding of the polypeptide chain, rather than affect specific constellations in and around the catalytic site or regulatory loops."

We found that MMEP is present in human endometrium, localized primarily in stromal cells of this tissue, and that the specific activity of MMEP (and immunoreactive MMEP protein) in endometrial tissue is correlated in a highly significant positive manner with the concentration of progesterone in plasma. In estrogen-treated, human endometrial stromal cells in monolayer culture, the specific activity of MMEP increases in response to treatment with progestin; and, this increase is accompanied by increases in immunoreactive MMEP protein, newly synthesized MMEP, and MMEP mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1551406743,"The poly-N-acetyllactosamines on neutrophils and monocytes have been shown to serve as ligands for various selectins present on endothelial cells and platelets. We have previously shown that only a limited number of glycoproteins contain poly-N-acetyllactosamine and found that lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (lamps) are the major glycoproteins carrying poly-N-acetyllactosamine. In order to understand the reason why only certain glycoproteins can be modified by poly-N-acetyllactosamine, we have utilized 21 degrees C incubation conditions, which were previously shown to cause the accumulation of glycoproteins at the trans-Golgi. HL-60 cells were labeled with [3H]galactose at 21 or 37 degrees C for 6 or 24 h, and lamp-1 and lamp-2 were immunoprecipitated. Upon examination by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, each lamp from HL-60 cells incubated at 21 degrees C exhibited a much broader, slower migrating band than that isolated from the cells incubated at 37 degrees C. The number of N-glycans containing poly-N-acetyllactosamine, estimated by their binding to tomato lectin column, increased approximately 30-50% after incubation at 21 degrees C than incubation at 37 degrees C. The analysis of oligosaccharides released by endo-beta-galactosidase digestion demonstrates that the amount of side chains containing three or more N-acetyllactosamine repeats increased about 100% after incubation at 21 degrees C, and methylation analysis confirmed these results. The same analysis and the results obtained by ion-exchange chromatography also provided evidence that the N-glycans of lamps are sialylated at 21 degrees C as much as at 37 degrees C. Pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine labeling indicated that the time necessary for processing of lamps is much longer at 21 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. These results therefore indicate that incubation at 21 degrees C causes the lamps to reside longer within the Golgi complex, and such longer residence allows lamps to acquire more polylactosaminoglycan. These results also suggest that the time necessary for moving through the Golgi complex is a critical factor for poly-N-acetyllactosamine formation."
https://openalex.org/W1648071955,"Oxygen evolution by photosystem II membranes was inhibited by Cu(II) when 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone or ferricyanide, but not silicomolybdate, was used as electron acceptor. This indicated that Cu(II) affected the reducing side of the photosystem II. The inhibition curves of Cu(II), o-phenanthroline and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), were compared; the inhibitory patterns of Cu(II) and o-phenanthroline were very similar and different in turn from that of DCMU. Cu(II) did not eliminate or modify the electron paramagnetic resonance signal at g = 8.1 ascribed to the non-heme iron of the photosystem II reaction center, indicating that the inhibition by Cu(II) was not the result of the replacement of the iron by Cu(II). Controlled trypsin digestion of thylakoid membranes inhibited oxygen evolution using 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone, but had no effect when using ferricyanide or silicomolybdate. Using ferricyanide, oxygen evolution of trypsin-treated thylakoids was insensitive to DCMU but became even more sensitive to Cu(II) and o-phenanthroline than nontreated thylakoids; however, trypsinized thylakoids were insensitive to inhibitors in the presence of silicomolybdate. We conclude that Cu(II) impaired the photosystem II electron transfer before the QB niche, most probably at the pheophytin-QA-Fe domain."
https://openalex.org/W1487548491,"In this study, we have investigated the Ca2+ requirements for the activation of phospholipase D by the tripeptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) in human neutrophils. EGTA inhibited the activation of phospholipase D (PLD) by 55% (n = 4). When the initial transient rise in [Ca2+]i was prevented by loading the cells with limited amounts of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM), PLD activation was inhibited by 92% (n = 4). In the presence of both chelators, PLD activation was only 4% of control. In electropermeabilized neutrophils, too, the activation of PLD after the addition of fMLP strongly depends on the Ca2+ concentration, being almost absent with 100 nM free Ca2+ present and reaching maximum activation with a free [Ca2+] of 500 nM. We subsequently investigated the relationship between PLD activation and the activation of the respiratory burst. In neutrophils loaded with BAPTA/AM (10 microM), in which PLD activation was almost absent, a respiratory burst could be induced by fMLP, albeit with a much longer lag time. A respiratory burst could also be elicited by fMLP in electropermeabilized neutrophils incubated with 100 nM free Ca2+. This response, however, was strongly enhanced in the presence of 1 microM Ca2+. Our results indicate that changes in [Ca2+]i are essential for the activation of PLD by fMLP, but probably do not constitute the sole activation signal. In addition, our data provide evidence that PLD activation is important, but not necessary, for activation of the neutrophil respiratory burst."
https://openalex.org/W1519979644,"Proteinase B (PrB) is a subtilisin-like serine protease found in the vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is first made as a large precursor that consists of a putative signal sequence, a 260-amino acid pro region, the serine protease domain, and two small COOH-terminal post regions (Moehle, C. M., Dixon, C. K., and Jones, E. W. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 108, 309-324). This precursor is glycosylated and proteolytically processed at least three times before mature enzyme is formed. To determine whether an intact PrB catalytic site is required for proteolytic processing of the precursor, point mutations were generated at the codons for the active site serine or aspartate residues by site-directed mutagenesis. The effect of these mutations on PrB processing suggests that the large pro region may be cleaved by an intramolecular, autocatalytic mechanism. The properties of a prb1 mutant that accumulates a 37-kDa precursor in addition to mature sized mutant PrB antigen suggests that the final proteolytic cleavage step is also autocatalytic. A prb1 deletion that lacks codons for the large pro region was made to test whether this part of the precursor is required for formation of mature PrB. Analysis of this mutant revealed two functions for this region: it prevents N-linked glycosylation of the serine protease domain and it allows the PrB precursor to be processed by proteinase A. The pro region can fulfill this latter function if added as a separate molecule, so long as glycosylation of the catalytic domain is prevented by other means."
https://openalex.org/W2158921944,"In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a full length cDNA clone for rat prolactin-like protein C (PLP-C) and describe the expression of PLP-C mRNA in the developing rat placenta. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PLP-C cDNA clone predicted a mature protein of 238 amino acids, including a 30-amino acid signal sequence. The predicted PLP-C amino acid sequence contains seven cysteine residues, three tryptophan residues, and two putative N-linked glycosylation sites. Six of the cysteine residues in PLP-C are located in positions homologous to the cysteines of pituitary prolactin (PRL). Additional sequence similarities with pituitary PRL and other members of the rat placental PRL family are evident. The PLP-C gene was localized to rat chromosome 17. Northern blot analysis showed that the PLP-C cDNA clone specifically hybridized to a 1.0-kilobase mRNA. PLP-C mRNA was first detectable between days 13 and 14 of gestation, peaked by day 18 of gestation, and remained elevated until term. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that PLP-C mRNA was specifically expressed by spongiotrophoblast cells and some trophoblast giant cells in the junctional zone region of rat chorioallantoic placenta."
https://openalex.org/W1555441023,"The mitogenic membrane glycoprotein (gp55) encoded by Friend erythroleukemia virus is inefficiently processed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and only 3-5% reaches plasma membranes. Because this processed component (gp55P) contains larger and more complex oligosaccharides, it can be separated from RER gp55. In nonreducing conditions, gp55P is a unique disulfide-bonded dimer, whereas RER gp55 consists of monomers and dimers with diverse intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds. This suggests that gp55 folds heterogeneously and that only one homodimer is competent for export from the RER. Pulse-chase analyses of gp55 components labeled with radioactive amino acids indicated that formation of diverse disulfide-bonded components occurred within minutes of polypeptide synthesis and that malfolded components did not later isomerize to generate dimers competent for export from the RER. Chemical studies suggested that all 12 cysteines of gp55 were oxidized within 5 min after synthesis of the protein. In contrast, the envelope glycoprotein precursor (gPr90) encoded by a replication-competent murine leukemia virus folds more homogeneously, and it is then processed and cleaved to form an extracellular glycoprotein gp70 plus a transmembrane protein p15E. The fully processed glycoprotein contains an unoxidized cysteine sulfhydryl that isomerizes reversibly with a disulfide bond that links gp70 to p15E. Consequently, only a proportion of gp70 and p15E is disulfide-bonded, and dissociation occurs when the environment becomes even slightly reducing. The gp55 glycoprotein appears to be an extreme example of protein malfolding associated with imprecise and irreversible disulfide bonding. We discuss evidence that folding inefficiencies are common for retroviral proteins that have newly evolving pathogenic functions."
https://openalex.org/W1599571436,"ras-Transformed NIH3T3 (R3T3) cells were transfected with expression vectors for the RII alpha and RII beta regulatory subunits of the type II isozyme of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the effects on gene activation by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) were analyzed. In RII alpha and RII beta-overexpressing cells, type II isozyme levels were increased, and type I isozyme levels were eliminated, demonstrating that both RII regulatory subunits compete efficiently with RI for catalytic subunit. The type II isozyme separated into three peaks on high performance liquid chromatography, referred to as A, B, and C. Western blot analysis strongly suggests that peak A and peak C correspond to holoenzymes containing RII beta and RII alpha, respectively. Overexpression of RII alpha resulted in the loss of peak A and a dramatic reduction in RII beta protein with no change in RII beta mRNA, indicating that the level of RII beta protein is controlled posttranscriptionally and that RII beta protein may become unstable when displaced from C. The role of type I and II kinases in transcriptional activation was investigated by comparing the response of control and RII expressing clones to site-selective cAMP analogs and the hormones, CRF and PGE1. The site-selective analogs demonstrated that either type I or type II kinase could activate the cAMP-responsive alpha-subunit promoter. The response to various concentrations of CRF or PGE1 was identical in control cells and transfected clones containing very little type I kinase. These experiments suggest that in the CRF and PGE1 response pathways leading to gene induction, the magnitude and sensitivity of the response are not influenced by the presence or absence of type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1501551269,"Human plasma apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor ligand. It targets cholesterol-rich lipoproteins to LDL receptors on both hepatic and peripheral cells. The region of apoE responsible for its binding to the LDL receptor has been localized to amino acids 140-160. An apoE 141-155 monomeric peptide and a dimeric 141-155 tandem peptide were synthesized and tested for their inhibition of 125I-LDL degradation by human fibroblasts and human monocytic-like cells, THP-1. The monomer had no activity at 250 microM, but the dimer inhibited 125I-LDL degradation by 50% at 5 microM. The inhibition was specific for the LDL receptor because the dimer did not inhibit the degradation of 125I-acetylated LDL by scavenger receptors expressed by phorbol ester-stimulated THP-1 cells. As reported for native apoE, amino acid substitutions of Lys-143----Ala, Leu-144----Pro, and Arg-150----Ala decreased the inhibitory effectiveness of the dimer. Furthermore, a trimer of the 141-155 sequence had a 20-fold greater inhibitory activity than the dimer. Studies with a radioiodinated dimer indicated that some of the inhibitory activity could be a result of the interaction of the dimer with LDL. However, direct binding of the 125I-dimeric peptide to THP-1 cells was observed as well. This binding was time-dependent, linear with increasing cell number, Ca(2+)- but not Mg(2+)-dependent, saturable, inhibited by lipoproteins, and increased by preculture of the cells in lipoprotein-depleted medium. Therefore, a synthetically prepared dimeric repeat of amino acid residues 141-155 of apoE binds the LDL receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1592892826,"Recent studies ascribed some biological actions of cell adhesion and cell outgrowth to the carboxyl-most 1200 amino acids of vertebrate laminin A chains. Here we report a 6.1-kilobase pair nucleotide cDNA sequence encoding 1951 amino acids and the carboxyl end of a Drosophila laminin A chain. It corresponds to the mouse laminin A domains G, I, II, and III, but may represent a different type of laminin A chain. The arrangement of the cysteine-rich repeats of domain III resembles that of B2 chains. However, it has more amino acid identity with a portion of the mouse laminin A chain domain IIIb than with other laminin repeats. Domains I and II are consistent with an interrupted coiled-coil alpha-helical model of the long arm of laminin but are poorly conserved. The G domain contains five subdomains which are individually related to subdomains of vertebrate laminin A chains. The results indicate that laminin G subdomains should be considered individually, rather than merely as parts of a G-globule. A sequence of hydroxyamino acids contributes to a spacer between two of the subdomains. Stretches of hydroxyamino acids may be indicative of junctions between domains of extracellular Drosophila proteins."

(1985) FEBS Lett. 191, 181-185) have made the intriguing proposal that AlF4- acts by mimicking the gamma-phosphate of GTP. The endogenous G protein (probably G alpha i-2 or G alpha i-3 (Yatani, A., Mattera, R., Codina, J., Graf, R., Okabe, K., Padrell, E., Iyengar, R., Brown, A. M., and Birnbaumer, L. (1988) Nature 336, 680-682) that stimulates the muscarinic atrial K+ (K+[ACh]) channel is also thought to be activated by AlF4- (Kurachi, Y., Nakajima, T., and Ito, H. (1987) Circulation 76, 105P). To investigate the AlF4- mechanism, we applied potassium fluoride (KF) to the cytoplasmic face of inside-out membrane patches excised from guinea pig atria. We found that KF activated single K+[ACh] channel currents in both a concentration- and a Mg(2+)-dependent manner. Activation persisted following removal of KF, but unlike activation by guanosine 5‘-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), was fully reversed by removal of Mg2+. Evidence for Al3+ involvement was that the Al3+ chelator deferoxamine (500 microM) inhibited KF activation and that at low concentrations of KF (less than 1 mM), micromolar AlCl3 concentrations potentiated KF stimulation. The rate of activation produced by KF was far slower than the rate produced by GTP or GTP gamma S, and unlike these guanine nucleotides, the rate was unchanged in the presence of agonist. To test the gamma-phosphate-mimicking hypothesis, we evaluated the requirement for GDP; and to accomplish this, it was necessary to establish a condition that ensured exchange of guanine nucleotides. This condition was satisfied by using the muscarinic agonist carbachol because both the rate and the extent of activation of the K+[ACh] channels produced by GTP were much faster in carbachol, and both were greatly slowed when GDP was added along with GTP. By contrast, the effects of KF were unchanged by carbachol in the presence or absence of GDP. Further evidence that GDP is not essential for activation by AlF4- was provided by the observation that during carbachol activation and following extensive washing with GMP, guanosine 5‘-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) at blocking concentrations had no effect on activation produced by KF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W97593416,"Regulation of cytosolic free Ca2+ in the physiologically relevant submicromolar range was measured in isolated intact bovine rod outer segments (ROS) with the intracellular Ca(2+)-indicating dye fluo-3. Changes in free Ca2+ were compared with changes in total Ca2+ measured with 45Ca fluxes and a good qualitative correlation was observed. Ca2+ homeostasis in isolated bovine ROS was exclusively mediated via the Na-Ca-K exchanger. Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was lowered by an increase in the inward Na+ gradient, was raised by an increase in external K+, and was raised by depolarization of the plasma membrane. The simplest stoichiometry consistent with these qualitative observations is 4Na:(1Ca + 1K). The individual K:Ca, Na:Ca, and K:Na coupling ratios were deduced from quantitative changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ upon changes in the transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients. The observed changes in free Ca2+ did not agree with changes in free Ca2+ calculated on the basis of the above fixed stoichiometry which may reflect the flexibility in the Ca:K coupling ratio observed before in flux experiments (Schnetkamp, P. P. M., Szerencsei, R. T., and Basu, D. K. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 198-206). The most dramatic discrepancy was observed for the Na:Ca coupling ratio: the expected very large changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ upon changes in the transmembrane Na+ gradient were not observed. Rapid Na(+)-induced Ca2+ extrusion was unable to lower cytosolic free Ca2+ below 100 nM, even under nonequilibrium conditions and despite the observation that Ca2+ influx via reverse Na-Ca-K exchange readily occurred at a free external Ca2+ concentration of 20 nM. We conclude that the Na(+)-dependent extrusion mode of the Na-Ca-K exchanger occurs in a brief (20-s) burst of high maximal velocity transport followed by a nearly complete inactivation of transport. The importance of our findings for Ca2+ homeostasis in functioning rod photoreceptors is discussed."

We report biosynthesis of the allene oxide (8R)-8,9-epoxyeicosa-(5Z,9,11Z,14Z)-tetraenoic acid via the (8R)-lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid in starfish oocytes. Formation of the allene oxide was deduced from high pressure liquid chromatography, UV, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 1H-NMR analyses of the precise structure and mechanism of biosynthesis of its major hydrolysis product, the alpha-ketol 8-hydroxy-9-ketoeicosa-(5Z,11Z,14Z)-trienoic acid. A second enzymic activity detected in the oocytes (hydroperoxide lyase) cleaves specifically the (8R)-hydroperoxy substrate into C7 and C13 fragments, identified as the hydroxyacid, (5Z)-7-hydroxyheptenoic acid, and two aldehydes, (2E,4Z,7Z)-tridecenal and its 4E isomer. Discovery of the allene oxide synthase and hydroperoxide lyase marks the first definitive localization of these enzymic activities to an animal cell. It was established previously that the (8R)-lipoxygenase metabolite (8R)-HETE will activate the maturation (re-initiation of meiosis) of starfish oocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2124378315,"Methionine synthase catalyzes the conversion of N5-methyltetrahydrofolate and homocysteine to tetrahydrofolate and methionine. Methylcobalamin (Me-Cbl) is tightly bound to methionine synthase and is required for enzymatic activity. When added to crude tissue homogenates, Me-Cbl stimulates methionine synthase but similar stimulation is observed with hydroxocobalamin, cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl), and adenosyl-Cbl, although the mechanisms involved are unknown. We prepared human apomethionine synthase and studied its activation in the presence of [14C]CN-Cbl and [14CH3]Me-Cbl with concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol ranging from 0.15 to 100 mM. We observed that the removal of the labeled upper axial ligands from CN-Cbl and Me-Cbl both paralleled the activation of human apomethionine synthase. Spectral studies employing CN-Cbl and Me-Cbl showed that both forms of Cbl must be converted to Cob(II)alamin before they can bind to human apomethionine synthase and convert it to its activated holoenzyme form. Studies with 14 different Cbl analogues with alterations in various portions of the corrin ring and the nucleotide showed that all of the analogues were able to fully activate human methionine synthase when they were reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol. Full activation occurred at lower concentrations of many of the Cbl analogues than occurred with Cbl itself. We conclude that Me-Cbl and other forms of Cob(III)alamin do not bind to human apomethionine synthase and that all must first be reduced to Cob(II)alamin before such binding can occur. The fact that human methionine synthase shows little absolute specificity for alterations in various portions of the Cbl molecule suggests that the potent inhibition of mammalian methionine synthase activity observed in vivo with various Cbl analogues is due to inhibition of intracellular Cbl transport or to inhibition of the enzymatic formation of Cob(II)alamin rather than to direct inhibition of mammalian methionine synthase itself."

Five different human ARFs have been identified by cDNA cloning. Northern analysis using ARF 3-specific oligonucleotides identified two mRNAs of 3.7 and 1.2 kilobases (kb). We report here the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3.7-kb ARF 3 mRNA derived from three overlapping cDNAs isolated from human hippocampus and fetal brain cDNA libraries, as well as the structure of human ARF 3 gene. Sequences of two overlapping genomic clones indicated that the ARF 3 gene spans approximately 18.3 kb and contains five exons and four introns. The conserved amino acid sequences involved in guanine nucleotide binding by ARF 3 are distributed among separate exons, as found in other GTP-binding protein genes. Translation initiates in exon 2 which includes the sequence GXXXXGK that probably participates in phosphate binding and GTP hydrolysis. The sequence DVGG in exon 3 coordinates binding of Mg2+ and the beta-phosphate of GDP. In the ARF 3 gene in contrast to those of other GTP-binding proteins, the sequence NKXD (which is thought to contribute to the specificity of interaction with the guanine ring) is divided between exons 4 and 5. The latter encodes the COOH-terminal 53 amino acids of ARF 3 and contains greater than 2500 base pairs of untranslated DNA. The sequence AATTAA is 19 bases 5' to the polyadenylation addition site of the 3.7-kb mRNA. Multiple transcription start sites were identified by primer extension and S1 and mung bean nuclease analyses. The 5'-flanking region of exon 1 contains neither a TATA nor a CAAT box, but is high in GC content (greater than 70%) and includes three potential Sp1-binding sites (GC box), consistent with the promoters described for several housekeeping genes. The 1.2-kb ARF 3 mRNA is shown to arise by use of an alternative polyadenylation signal (AACAAA) at nucleotide 1091 within the ARF 3 cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2170133741,"Adenylylcyclase activity in the flagella of gametes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was inhibited by prior incubation at or below 30 degrees C in the presence of ATP. This decrease did not occur in the absence of ATP, in the presence of the ATP analog 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (App(NH)p), or in the presence of ATP plus the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (2 microM). If ATP treatment was performed in the absence of an ATP-regenerating system, activity initially declined and subsequently recovered. Incubation of flagella at 45 degrees C in the absence of ATP or incubation at lower temperatures in the presence of either App(NH)p or staurosporine both increased adenylylcyclase activity (over 10-fold) and blocked subsequent ATP-dependent loss of activity at 30 degrees C. This heat-induced activation was prevented by the presence of ATP plus an ATP-regenerating system. Incubation of flagella with [gamma-32P]ATP followed by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated the presence of endogenous protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities. These data suggest that the flagellar adenylylcyclase in Chlamydomonas gametes is inhibited by phosphorylation and stimulated by dephosphorylation. This mechanism for regulating adenylylcyclase may underlie the rapid increase in cyclic AMP that is induced by flagellar adhesion during fertilization in Chlamydomonas."
https://openalex.org/W1580806023,"Using 125I-calmodulin as a probe, we have recently identified specific Ca2+/calmodulin-binding proteins in cell extracts from the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum: a major 22-kDa activity, a soluble 78/80-kDa protein, and several membrane-associated high Mr proteins (Winckler, T., Dammann, H., and Mutzel, R. (1991) Res. Microbiol. 142, 509-519). cDNA clones for at least two of these proteins have been isolated by ligand screening of a lambda gt11 prophage expression library. Antibodies directed against the lacZ-cDNA-encoded fusion protein from one of the clones recognized a single 22-kDa component in D. discoideum extracts which comigrated with the endogenous 22-kDa calmodulin-binding protein. The cDNA-derived nucleotide sequence predicts a protein of Mr 21,659 with 56% sequence identity (69% homology) with rat ribosomal protein L19. The endogenous 22-kDa calmodulin-binding activity was associated with ribosomes. It was found to be an integral constituent of the large ribosomal subunit, since it cosedimented with 60 S ribosomal subunits in sucrose density gradients in the presence of 0.5 M NH4Cl. Our observations point to a physiological role for calmodulin in the Ca2+ regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis. Support for this comes from recent studies showing inhibition of protein synthesis by calmodulin antagonists in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (Kumar, R. V., Panniers, R., Wolfman, A., and Henshaw, E.C. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 195, 313-319)."
https://openalex.org/W2129127560,"We have examined the functional importance of the two disulfide bonds formed by the four conserved cysteines of human interleukin (IL-6). Using a bacterial expression system, we have synthesized a series of recombinant IL-6 mutants in which the constituent cysteines of the first (Cys45-Cys51), second (Cys74-Cys84), or both disulfide bonds of recombinant human interleukin-6 were replaced by other amino acids. Each mutant was partially purified and tested in four representative bioassays. While mutants lacking Cys45 and Cys51 retained activity similar to nonmutated recombinant IL-6, the activity of mutants lacking Cys74 and Cys84 was significantly reduced, especially in assays involving human cell lines. These results indicate that the first disulfide bond of human interleukin-6 is not required for maintenance of normal biologic activity. However, the fact that mutants lacking Cys45 and Cys51 were more active than corresponding cysteine-free mutants indicates that the disulfide bond formed by these residues contributes to biologic activity in the absence of the second disulfide bond. Competition binding studies with representative mutants indicate that their affinity for the human IL-6 receptor parallels their biologic activities on human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606555933,"A new active site-directed photoaffinity analogue, [beta-32P]5-azido-UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), was enzymatically synthesized from [beta-32P]5-N3UDP-Glc using UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. The product was characterized by its mobility on ion exchange and two thin-layer chromatographic systems, by its UV absorbance at 288 nm, and the loss of this absorbance after UV irradiation of the compound. Photoincorporation of [beta-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA into bovine liver UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.22) was saturable with an apparent Kd of 12.5 microM, and was inhibited by the known active-site effectors UDP-GlcA, UDP-Glc, and UDP-xylose. When human liver microsomes with known UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17) activities were photolabeled with [beta-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA, major photolabeled bands of 35-37 and 50-54 kDa were detected. When rat liver microsomes from phenobarbital-injected rats were photolabeled with [beta-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA, there was a marked increase in photoincorporation of a 51-kDa protein as compared with control animals. Evidence is presented which suggests that the photolabeled 51-54-kDa proteins in the liver microsomes from both tissues are UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and that [beta-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA represents a new alternative approach in the study of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and other UDP-GlcA-utilizing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1513908748,"Based on primary sequence homology between the lactose repressor protein and periplasmic sugar-binding proteins (Muller-Hill, B. (1983) Nature 302, 163-164), a hypothetical sugar-binding site for the lac repressor was proposed using the solved x-ray crystallographic structure of the arabinose-binding protein (ABP) (Sams, C. F., Vyas, N. K., Quiocho, F. A., and Matthews, K. S. (1984) Nature 310, 429-430). By analogy to Arg151 in the ABP sugar site, Arg197 is predicted to play an important role in lac repressor binding to inducer sugars. Hydrogen bonding occurs between Arg151 and the ring oxygen and 4-hydroxyl of the sugar ligand, two backbone carbonyls, and a side chain in ABP, and similar interactions in the lac repressor would be anticipated. To test this hypothesis, Arg197 in the lac repressor protein was altered by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to substitute Gly, Leu, or Lys. Introduction of these substitutions at position 197 had no effect on operator binding parameters of the isolated mutant proteins, whereas the affinity for inducer was dramatically decreased, consistent with in vivo phenotypic behavior obtained by suppression of nonsense mutations at this site (Kleina, L. G., and Miller, J. H. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 212, 295-318). Inducer binding affinity was reduced approximately 3 orders of magnitude for Leu, Gly, or Lys substitutions, corresponding to a loss of 50% of the free energy of binding. The pH shift characteristic of wild-type repressor is conserved in these mutants. Circular dichroic spectra demonstrated no significant alterations in secondary structure for these mutants. Thus, the primary effect of substitution for Arg197 is a very significant decrease in the affinity for inducer sugars. Arginine is uniquely able to make the multiple contacts found in the ABP sugar site, and we conclude that this residue plays a similar role in sugar binding for lactose repressor protein. These results provide experimental validation for the proposed homology between ABP and the lac repressor and suggest that homology with ABP may be employed to generate additional insight into the structure and function of this regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1553300512,"In the absence of ribosomes, Bacillus stearothermophilus translation initiation factor IF2 (Mr = 82 kDa) and its GTP-binding domain (i.e. the G-domain, Mr = 41 kDa) promote barely detectable hydrolysis of GTP. Upon addition of some aliphatic alcohols, however, the rate of nucleotide cleavage is substantially increased with both IF2 and G-domain, the highest stimulation being observed with 20% (v/v) ethanol. Under these conditions, the rates of ribosome-independent GTP hydrolysis with both IF2 and G-domain are approximately 30-fold lower than the corresponding rates obtained in the presence of ribosomes, while the Km for GTP is approximately the same in all cases. These results indicate that, as with the other two prokaryotic G proteins involved in translation (i.e. elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G), also in the case of IF2, the GTPase catalytic center resides in the factor and, more specifically, in its G-domain."
https://openalex.org/W1581439266,"Abstract The rapid response of rat hepatic mRNA-S14 to hormonal or dietary manipulation makes it an excellent model to study the control of lipogenic enzyme mRNA. The mechanism of regulation of this mRNA by triiodothyronine (T3) or sucrose remains controversial. Although initial studies suggested that T3 stabilized the nuclear precursor, subsequent studies suggest that T3 acts by increasing the transcriptional rate of this gene. More recently, the induction of mRNA-S14 by sucrose administration was shown to be associated with an increase in transcriptional run-on activity. Because T3 and carbohydrate feeding synergistically regulate this mRNA, we studied the response to short and long term high carbohydrate feeding in hypothyroid and euthyroid rats. We found the response to the lipogenic diet was rapid in hypothyroid rats, with maximal levels of mRNA-S14 attained by 4 h (2.2 +/- 0.6 chow fed versus 13.5 +/- 2.5 pg/micrograms RNA on lipogenic diet). The rapid induction by the lipogenic diet contrasts with the diminished response to sucrose by gastric gavage (4.6 +/- 1.2 pg/micrograms RNA) over the same time interval. Despite the large increase in the mature mRNA induced by the lipogenic diet, the rise in the nuclear precursor was small and not different from that observed after sucrose gavage (0.14 +/- 0.01 chow, 0.26 +/- 0.03 sucrose gavage, 0.25 +/- 0.04 pg/micrograms RNA lipogenic diet). The molar ratio of the mature to precursor mRNA-S14 showed progressive increases with the smallest level in the fasting rat, an intermediate level in the chow-fed and sucrose gavaged rats, and the highest level in the animals fed a lipogenic diet (2.1, 16.5, 16.3, 62.7, respectively). Based on the previously reported half-life for the mature mRNA-S14, these data show that feeding sucrose by gavage or by a lipogenic diet leads to enhanced fractional conversion of precursor to mature mRNA-S14 with a simultaneous stabilization of the precursor mRNA-S14."
https://openalex.org/W1494065787,"Hemoglobin (Hb) Chico (Lys beta 66----Thr at E10) has a diminished oxygen affinity (Shih, D. T.-b., Jones, R. T., Shih, M. F.-C., Jones, M. B., Koler, R. D., and Howard, J. (1987) Hemoglobin 11, 453-464). Our studies show that its P50 is about twice that of Hb A and that its cooperativity, anion, and Bohr effects between pH 7 and 8 are normal. The Bohr effect above pH 8 is somewhat reduced, indicating a small but previously undocumented involvement of the ionic bond formed by Lys beta 66 in the alkaline Bohr effect. Since the oxygen affinity of the alpha-hemes is likely to be normal, that of the beta-hemes in the tetramer is likely to be reduced by the equivalent of 1.2 kcal/mol beta-heme in binding energy. Remarkably, both initial and final stages of oxygen binding to Hb Chico are of lowered affinity relative to Hb A under all conditions examined. The isolated beta chains also show diminished oxygen affinity. In T-state Hb A, Lys(E10 beta) forms a salt bridge with one of the heme propionates, but comparison with other hemoglobin variants shows that rupture of this bridge cannot be the cause of the low oxygen affinity. X-ray analysis of the deoxy structure has now shown that Thr beta 66 either donates a hydrogen bond to or accepts one from His beta 63 via a bridging water molecule. This introduces additional steric hindrance to ligand binding to the T-state that results in slower rates of ligand binding. We measured the O2/CO partition coefficient and the kinetics of oxygen dissociation and carbon monoxide binding and found that lowered O2 and CO affinity is also exhibited by the R-state tetramers and the isolated beta chains of Hb Chico."
https://openalex.org/W1565438241,"Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells and the B-cell line, BJA-B, generated two protein-DNA complexes which bound specifically to sequences in the TATA box of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) promoter. Complex A also bound the core promoter of a retroviral long terminal repeat but did not bind to five other promoters including the adenovirus major late promoter. Of these seven promoters, complex B bound only to the IgH promoter. Footprinting analysis revealed that both complexes A and B bound sequences which include the TATA element, and complex A additionally contacted sequences downstream to +28. Mutation of the IgH TATA element from ATTAATATA to GCTA-TAAAA, the optimal TATA sequence as found in the major late promoter, resulted in a 10-fold decrease in binding to complex A and a 25-fold decrease in binding complex B. Surprisingly, both transfection experiments in HeLa cells and in vitro transcription experiments with whole nuclear extract demonstrated that mutation of the TATA box in the core IgH promoter to this consensus sequence resulted in a 2-fold decrease in the level of transcription. These data suggest that the specific sequence of the TATA region is important, and factors which recognize these sequences, such as complex A and B, may modulate the level of transcription from the IgH promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1523755955,"Abstract An attempt has been made to understand the conformational determinants that govern the hydroxylation of selected lysyl residues in the nascent collagen molecule by lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4). A series of peptide substrates of the enzyme, ranging in length from 3 to 12 residues, were synthesized. These included: tert-butyloxylcarbonyl (t-Boc)-Ile-Lys-Gly; Boc-Ala-Lys-Gly; N-acetyl-Ala-Lys-Gly-Ser; Hyp-Gly-Pro-Lys-Gly-Glu; Leu-Hyp-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gly-Glu; Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Leu-Hyp-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gly-Glu; (Hyp-Gly-Pro-Lys-Gly-Glu)2; and Ala-Arg-Gly-Ile-Lys-Gly-Ile-Arg-Gly-Phe-Ser-Gly. The conformational features of these peptides were studied by spectroscopic methods so as to relate this information with the kinetic parameters for the interaction of these peptides with purified lysyl hydroxylase. Spectroscopic data, supported by conformational energy calculations, indicated that the tripeptides t-Boc-Ile-Lys-Gly and t-Boc-Ala-Lys-Gly adopt a gamma-turn structure in water and trifluoroethanol with Lys in the second position of the turn. In the tetra- and larger peptides two structures, the beta-turn and a polyproline-II (PP-II) type conformation, were identified. The proportions of these two structures in a given peptide depended on the polarity of the solvent. All of the peptides were hydroxylated by lysyl hydroxylase isolated from chicken embryos. In contrast, a control peptide, t-Boc-Ala-Gly-Lys which adopted a beta-turn with Lys at the end of the turn, was not hydroxylated. Competitive inhibition of the hydroxylation of protocollagen by some of the peptides showed a common binding site for these substrates in the enzyme's active site. Kinetic data on the peptides indicated improved hydroxylation rate (higher Vmax) in peptides having relatively higher beta-turn content and improved binding (lower Km) in peptides with higher content of the PP-II structure. The efficacy of the substrate was also governed by its chain length. These data suggest that the conformational criterion for lysine hydroxylation in collagen-related peptides is the presence of a bent structure, such as the gamma- or beta-turn at the catalytic site of lysyl hydroxylase and an extended PP-II type structure at the binding site(s) of the enzyme's active site. This suggestion also provides a conformational rationale for earlier observations on the substrate specificity of lysyl hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1514970743,"A protease delivery system was developed for the exclusive and controlled digestion of proteins exposed at the morphological inside (periplasmic surface) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides chromatophores. In this procedure, proteinase K is encapsulated within large unilamellar liposomes which are fused to the chromatophores in the presence of Ca2+ ions. The liposomes were prepared by a detergent dialysis procedure from native phosphatidylglycerol and found to undergo rapid bilayer fusion with purified chromatophore preparations above a threshold concentration of 12.5 mM CaCl2. The fusion process was complete within 10 min at 35 mM Ca2+ with about 80% of the pigment located in the fusion products. Electron micrographs of freeze-fracture replicas confirmed the intermixing of the lipid bilayers and the unilamellar structure of the fused membrane vesicles. The procedure did not affect the labile B800 chromophore of the B800-850 antenna complex, but reduced slightly the absorption due to the B875 core antenna. Emission from both light-harvesting complexes was increased in the fused membranes, suggesting a partial dissociation of photosynthetic units in the expanded bilayer. The results, together with those presented in the following paper (Theiler, R., and Niederman, R. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23163-23168), demonstrate that this new method fulfills the stringent requirements for a successful delivery of macromolecules to the chromatophore interior."
